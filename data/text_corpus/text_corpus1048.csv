5240,rainfall and runoff are considered the main components in the hydrological cycle developing an accurate model to capture the dynamic connection between rainfall and runoff remains a problematic task for engineers several studies have been carried out to develop models to accurately predict the changes in runoff from rainfall however these models have limitations in terms of accuracy and complexity when large numbers of parameters are needed therefore recently with the advancement of data driven techniques a vast number of hydrologists have adopted models to predict changes in runoff however data driven models still encounter several limitations related to hyperparameter optimization and overfitting hence there is a need to improve these models to overcome these limitations in this study data driven techniques such as a multi layer perceptron mlp neural network and least squares support vector machine lssvm are integrated with an advanced nature inspired optimizer namely harris hawks optimization hho to model the rainfall runoff relationship five different scenarios will be examined based on the autocorrelation function acf cross correlation function ccf and partial autocorrelation function pacf finally for comprehensive analysis the performance of the proposed model will then be compared with integrated data driven techniques with particle swarm optimization pso the results revealed that all the augmented models with hho outperformed other integrated models with pso in predicting the changes in runoff in addition a high level of accuracy in predicting runoff values was achieved when hho was integrated with lssvm keywords runoff model nature inspired optimizers malaysia 1 introduction water is an essential natural resource that is considered the key element in social and economic development in general water resources are under heavy stress or are experiencing mismatch between water supply and demand in several areas worldwide this is due to the increase in demand and limitations in the available water quantity or mismanagement of the available water resources in fact appropriate water planning and management is the only alternative to minimize such water stress or to address the gap between water supply and demand borga and vizzaccaro 1997 abrahart and see 2000 banadkooki et al 2019 rezaie balf et al 2019 turgut et al 2019 1 1 background rainfall is considered the main component in the hydrological cycle and it is the primary source for river runoff that could be directly used and controlled to meet the water demand abrahart and see 2000 asokan and dutta 2008 several research attempts all over the world have been carried out to not only predict rainfall but also determine the interrelationship between rainfall and runoff to be able to adapt certain management strategies of the water to make it available whenever needed borga and vizzaccaro 1997 andr√©assian et al 2001 asokan and dutta 2008 these studies mainly focused on empirical numerical deterministic and statistical methods however all these models are still in the research stage and more focus on advanced model techniques is required to achieve accurate estimation of runoff from rainfall in addition these efforts have been developed at different spatial basin catchment and subcatchment levels and temporal scales daily weekly monthly and seasonal time increments abudu et al 2010 2011 in fact runoff is important for water resource planning management development and modelling of available water and flood protection and forecasting brath et al 2002 anctil and lauzon 2004 akhtar et al 2009 afan et al 2017 the conversion of rainfall that transforms and reflects runoff is considered an extremely nonlinear complex and dynamic process and includes several temporal and spatial variabilities as well there are several parameters and usually they are physical factors that affect the interrelationship between rainfall and runoff in addition even with successful identification for a particular watershed an accurate relationship for rainfall runoff is not necessarily accurate for another watershed actually developing an accurate rainfall runoff model is still considered a complex problem for engineers hydrologists and agriculturists fahimi et al 2017 tikhamarine et al 2020 several approaches have been developed since the middle of the previous century to tackle this issue such as the soil conservation curve number scs cn method soulis et al 2009 stewart et al 2012 this approach was developed to convert rainfall to surface runoff using a particular model scs uh that has been abstracted from the characteristics of the watershed hence many modifications are needed for use in another watershed furthermore different empirical and statistical methods have been applied to overcome the difficulty of collecting a large amount of data from the watershed for successful application of the scs cn method soulis and valiantzas 2012 singh et al 2013 these methods showed acceptable estimation of runoff from rainfall but only for average rainfall patterns while for extreme rainfall events the model showed poor estimation of runoff tikhamarine et al 2020 1 2 problem statement and innovation more recently with the existence of the new generation of data driven models hydrologists switched to artificial intelligence ai models to tackle the non linearity and the stochasticity problem within the rainfall and runoff including several types of the artificial neural networks anns modelling such as multi layer perceptron mlps radial basis functions rbfs recurrent neural networks rnns input delays ids adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfiss and support vector machines svms el shafie et al 2007 el shafie et al 2009 afan et al 2017 ho et al 2019 adnan et al 2019a 2019b tikhamarine et al 2019a 2019b during the past two decades several research efforts have been carried out to develop rainfall runoff models using different ai models however these models still have several drawbacks brath et al 2002 asokan and dutta 2008 these drawbacks are usually related to overfitting difficulty in initializing the internal parameters related to these models and proposing the proper input output architecture of the model ahmed et al 2019 in this context in the current study a focus on how to overcome the problem of identifying the internal parameters of the ai models and appropriate selection for the input output architecture of the model will be investigated therefore the input output architecture will be developed as a pre processing analysis for the used data by employing autocorrelation and cross correlation analysis to identify the best model architecture in addition to select the most suitable initialization for the internal parameters an advanced nature inspired optimization algorithm has been functionalized and integrated with the prediction model namely harris hawks optimization hho heidari et al 2019 in fact there are several internal parameters within all the ai models the optimization algorithm selected should be able to consider the scalability and the dimension of the optimization problem because hho as an optimizer showed outstanding performance for searching for optimal solutions for higher and multidimensional problems hho could be the best choice to be applied heidari et al 2019 moayedi et al 2019a b 1 3 objectives the chief objective of this study is to develop a rainfall runoff model that could achieve accurate estimation for runoff in addition this study proposed a process to pre process the data used by introducing autocorrelation and cross correlation analysis to identify the optimal input output architecture of the model furthermore to select the best initial values for the hyperparameters of the proposed models a new nature inspired optimizer has been integrated with the prediction model finally different ai methods and different particle swarm optimization pso methods have been developed to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the achieved results from the proposed model the proposed models have been applied to real rainfall and runoff data collected from the perak river system in malaysia 2 case study and data description 2 1 study area the perak river is among the largest rivers in malaysia with a length equal to 427 km it covers a catchment area of 15 180 km2 which occupies approximately 71 of perak state its flow starts from north of perak state through the mountainous area towards the southern part the elevation of these mountains is more than 2000 m msl a series of four dams have been built on the upper part of the perak river catchment these dams include temengor bersia kenering and chenderoh which are used for hydropower generation the elevation of the perak basin ranges from 206 m to 2156 m msl the temengor dam covers an area of 3 434 km2 which is considered the first and largest dam on the perak river fig 1 shows the location map of the perak river catchment sammen et al 2018 2 2 data acquisition rainfall measurements are considered a basis for any hydrological modelling thus rainfall data for the period from 01 january 2008 to 24 june 2014 at seven stations distributed in the temengor catchment area were collected and used to model the rainfall runoff relationship the places and details of these stations are presented in fig 2 and table 1 respectively in order to develop the model the first step is to split the data into different classes to train validate and test the model performance the main importance of such step is to assure that the model would perform with consistent level of accuracy in case that the model experienced unseen data rather than those in the training however in order to cross validate the model s performance before switching to the testing stage the training data could be split also into two parts one for training and the other for validation by this step the model could overcome the drawback of experienced over fitting problem and also assure better performance when the model moved to the testing stage in this context the collected data for this study has been split into two major parts one for training 70 of the data records in order to calibrate the model and identify the values of the internal parameters and 30 for testing to examine the model performance in the meantime the training data has been split into two parts as well one for training and the other for validation with percentage 70 for training and 30 for validation additionally a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 1 m was used all of these data were acquired from the owner of the power plant and the department of irrigation and drainage did malaysia the dem is considered necessary to identify the catchment border and size the dem for the study area was acquired from the national energy agency in malaysia the thiessen polygons approach was adopted in this study to estimate the average rainfall value from the seven stations as shown in fig 3 the mean area weights or proportion of each rainfall station that contributes to the catchment were estimated as shown in table 2 while table 3 summarizes the statistical parameters of the dataset used in this research fig 4 present the time series plot of the observed rainfall and runoff values 3 methodology 3 1 models 3 1 1 least squares support vector machine the least squares support vector machine lssvm was proposed for the first time by suykens and vandewalle 1999 the lssvm could be considered one of the models under machine learning categories that presented an enhanced form of the basic original support vector machine svm that has been established from structural risk minimization smr in structural theory lssvm has been successfully applied in regression and classification problems and has provided a robust performance chamkalani et al 2014 kalteh 2016 gholampour et al 2018 keshtegar et al 2019 the nonlinear regression function of lssvm can be given as 1 f x w t x b where œï x denotes the mapping function nonlinear function that represents the input patterns of the model through higher dimensional space the other parameters w and b can be identified using the following optimizer formula 2 min j w e 1 2 w t w Œ≥ 2 i 1 n e i 2 subjected to the following equality 3 z i w t x i b e i where Œ≥ denotes the parameter of regularization and ei is defined as a random initialized error to resolve the given optimization sequence the lagrange equation procedure is employed as follows 4 l w b e Œ± j w e i 1 n Œ± i w t x i b e i z i i 1 2 3 n where Œ±i is the multiplicator of a lagrange function the optimization requirements are listed as follows 5 l w 0 w i 1 n Œ± i x i l b 0 i 1 n Œ± i 0 l e i 0 Œ± i Œ≥ e i i 1 2 3 n l e i 0 w t x i e i z i 0 i 1 2 3 n the kernel function k xi x œï xi tœï x i 1 2 3 n accordingly the lssvm procedure turns into 6 f x i 1 n Œ± i k x x i b where Œ±i and b denote the answer to the system as a linear function owing to the relationship between performance and the kernel function choice the choice of the kernel function is important in this study the radial basic function rbf has been adopted as a kernel function due to its success in solving the regression function the rbf kernel is defined as follows 7 k x x i e x p Œ≥ x i x 2 where Œ≥ is the kernel parameter and lssvm performance usually depends on the appropriate choice of this parameter in the current work the ls svmlab toolbox https www esat kuleuven be sista lssvmlab has been used to develop the ls svm 3 1 2 multilayer perceptron neural network the multilayer perceptron mlp is the classical type of artificial neural network ann which has been widely used to find a function dependency between variables regression problem the ann model was first inspired and presented by mcculloch and pitts 1943 based on the behaviour of the human brain and how neurons nerves relate to each other the structure of the mlp model is based on three layers an input layer a hidden layer and a single output layer the interconnection between them occurs by weights and biases and this connection can be explained mathematically as follows 8 y f 2 i 1 m w kj f 1 a j b o where y is the output of the mlp model f 1 and f 2 are the activation functions of the hidden and output layers respectively wjk denotes neuron j s connections weight that links neurons j within the hidden layer with neuron k in the output layer and b o denotes the bias associated with neuronk 9 f 1 a j 1 1 e x p a j a j is called the summation of the inputs and can be explained as 10 a j i 1 n x i w ji b j where x i is the input variables wi j denotes the linkage weights with neuron j in the hidden layer and b j denotes the bias associated with neuron j of the hidden layer one challenge in developing mlp is the choice of the number of hidden neurons within the hidden layer in this study equation 11 was adopted to identify the number of hidden neurons 11 m 2 n 1 equation 11 has been used in several studies mirjalili 2015 aljarah et al 2018 where n denotes the number of inputs and m is the optimal number of neurons 3 1 3 multiple linear regression the multiple linear regression model mlr is based on the regression equation that illustrates the simple relationship between dependent and independent variables mlr can be considered a classic and popular model to resolve statistical regression problems huien and peter 1997 malik and kumar 2015 li et al 2017 in fact mlr is used to find a regression relationship based on the following regression function 12 q t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 y 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 Œ≤ 3 y 3 Œ≤ n y n where qt is the predicted runoff in our case Œ≤0 Œ≤1 Œ≤2 Œ≤3 Œ≤n are the regression multiplicators and y0 y1 y2 y3 yn are the independent variables in our case the independent variables based on previous runoff qt and rainfall rt 3 2 meta heuristic algorithms 3 2 1 harris hawks optimization the hho algorithm is a novel algorithm based on swarm intelligence the hho algorithm was developed and expanded by heidari et al 2019 usually the hawks work alone in nature but harris hawks work together for hunting and chasing the hho algorithm mimics the cooperative behaviour and hunting mechanisms of harris hawks the proposed hho algorithm was successfully used for optimization and engineering applications abbasi et al 2019 moayedi et al 2019a b 2020 the hunting mechanism of the proposed hho includes four movements tracing encircling approaching and attacking this mechanism is based on three principle stages first exploration second a transition from exploration to exploitation and finally exploitation fig 5 shows how hho works based on three basic stages the first stage is the capability of exploration which is listed as 13 x t 1 x rand t r 1 x rand t 2 r 2 x t i f q 0 5 x rabbit t x a t r 3 l b r 4 u b l b i f q 0 5 14 x a t 1 n 1 n x i t where xa t is the average location of the harris hawk n is the number of all harris hawks search agent number x t 1 is the location of the hawk in the following iteration t 1 xi t is the position of the current harris hawk at iteration t xrand t is a randomly selected hawk between xrabbit t is the location of the rabbit prey lb and ub are the lower and upper bands respectively and q r1 r2 r3 and r4 are random values varying between 0 and 1 the second stage is the transition fromexploration toexploitation in this stage the energy of hawks is reduced during the hunt the hunt escaping energy e can be formulated as 15 e 2 e 0 1 t t where e0 is the initial energy during each progression e0 1 1 and t is the maximum size of the iteration number in the hho algorithm the state of the rabbit may be determined based on the contrast direction of e where e stands for the energy of the rabbit and e0 1 1 represents the inlet energy for each step based on the variation in e hho can determine the state of the rabbit the exploitation phase which is the third stage of the model is predominantly designed to enhance the predefined solution local solution during exploitation and based on both values of e and r two types of besiege could be considered whether it is hard hence e 0 5 or soft and hence e 0 5 in fact there are four approaches soft besiege soft and hard besiege with progressive rapid dives and finally hard besiege to imitate the attacking stage within the hho algorithm heidari et al 2019 moayedi et al 2019b the following equations represent the hawk while in soft besiege in case the prey has energy 16 x t 1 Œ¥ x t e j x rabbit t x t 17 Œ¥ x t x rabbit t x t where Œ¥ x t denotes the time difference between x rabbit t and x t updating the solution once becomes the hard besiege as follows 18 x t 1 x rabbit t e Œ¥ x t where j is the rabbit s random jumping force while escaping which equals j 2 1 r5 and r5 is a random value between 0 and 1 when the prey has enough energy the soft besiege with progressive rapid dives step would be as follows 19 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x t the following step is to equate the current movement with the y prior dive and define the best solution between them the hawks in this research begin to dive rapidly and irregularly simulated using the rules of levy flight as shown in the following 20 z y s l e v y d where s is a random vector levy d is the levy flight and d is the dimension then the hawks will update their position in the soft besiege as follows 21 x t 1 y i f f i t y f i t x t z i f f i t z f i t x t the last case is that the rabbits did not have enough energy so the hawks move to the stage called a hard besiege with progressive rapid dives at this stage hawks reduce the distance between their mean and prey the y value can be updated as 22 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x a t the final solution will be generated as follows 23 x t 1 y i f f i t y f i t x t z i f f i t z f i t x t 3 2 2 particle swarm optimization the pso algorithm was developed based on the intelligence of the swarm which was proposed for the first time by kennedy and eberhart 1995 the pso algorithm mimics bird behaviour in nature and is considered one of the most popular algorithms in the meta heuristic literature because of its performance in finding the optimal solution pso has been used effectively in solving optimization problems and in finding optimal solutions based on two main parameters position x and velocity v the velocity can be updated according to the following equation 24 v i t 1 w v i t r 1 c 1 x pbest i x i t r 2 c 2 x gbest i x i t where pbest is the best position of the ith particle and gbest is the best global value obtained by the different particles in every iteration the new position can be updated using the following equation 25 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where x i t is the position of the particle at time step t v i t is the velocity i of the particle at time t w is the coefficient of inertia c1 and c2 are the acceleration coefficients r1 and r2 are random coefficients and v i t 1 is the new updated velocity the value of w can be determined as follows kennedy and eberhart 1995 26 w w max w max w min i max i where w min and w max are the minimum and maximum weights respectively is the number of iterations and i max is the maximum number of iterations 3 3 input selection and model development 3 3 1 input selection one of the key factors influencing the performance of models is the choice of the input combination therefore the choice of input combination is very important before applying the lssvm mlp and mlr models in this study five different scenarios were developed and investigated based on the simple cross correlation function ccf the autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf indeed the predictors used in this work are the initial basin conditions represented by the antecedent runoff and the climatic conditions given by the precipitation at different time steps so the autocorrelation and cross correlation functions have been used for the identification of the number of lags of antecedent runoff and rainfall respectively fig 6 shows the ccf acf and pacf figures the correlation values are listed in table 4 and the five proposed scenarios are shown in the table 5 ccf shows that the rainfall for two lags are effective on runoff and then the other lags fell into the confidence limit therefore rt 1 and rt 2 were included in the 1st four input combinations also pacf indicates that the 1st two lags of runoff are effective and 3rd lag qt 3 is very near to confidence limit and therefore this input was ignored the last input combination was also considered to see if the rainfall beyond the 2nd lag affects runoff at time t or not 3 3 2 model development in this paper three models were selected and compared to each other lssvm mlp and mlr for modelling rainfall runoff tasks in fact the performance of each model is usually dependent on the correct determination of its parameters including the lssvm mlp and mlr models two optimized algorithms were used to improve the parameters of these models particle swarm optimization pso kennedy and eberhart 1995 and a new metaheuristic algorithm called the harris hawks optimizer hho heidari et al 2019 the lssvm pso and lssvm hho hybrid models are the hybrid lssvm model with these two algorithms to find optimal c and Œ≥ lssvm parameters while the hybrid mlr is combined with pso and hho to build mlr pso and mlr hho models respectively to find the appropriate parameters of the mlr model equation 14 hybrid models mlp pso and mlp hho are the conjunction of simple mlp with the pso and hho algorithms respectively this hybrid depends on the improvement in the weight and biases of the mlp model mlp parameters fig 6 shows a schematic update of the position in two successive iterations of the hho and pso algorithms fig 7 demonstrates the flowcharts of the proposed hybrid models table 6 consists of the initial parameters of the pso and hho algorithms 3 4 statistical performance indicators the performance criteria of the proposed models were examined using the following criteria root mean square error rmse 27 rmse 1 n i 1 n q p i q o i 2 0 rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 28 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q p i 2 i 1 n q o i

observed runoff q p i is the predicted runoff n is the number of daily data and q o and q p are the average values of the observed and predicted runoff respectively 4 results and discussion the training and testing performances of the lssvm ann and mlr models with respect to rmse mae r and nse statistics are summarised in table 7 for different scenarios in the training stage the lssvm method generally provides better approximates or fitting runoff values than the ann and mlr for example decreases in binary rmse and mae of the ann hho and mlr hho are 24 8 14 1 and 30 29 for scenario 2 7 4 8 and 14 6 21 7 for scenario 3 13 2 5 6 and 22 1 23 5 for scenario 4 and for scenario 5 the binary rmse and mae are 2 1 3 1 and 10 1 18 9 respectively the increases in binary r and nse are 17 4 37 6 and 26 58 6 for scenario 2 5 6 11 1 and 14 7 31 1 for scenario 3 9 4 19 4 and 21 6 47 5 for scenario 4 and 2 2 3 6 and 11 2 23 for scenario 5 respectively as expected nonlinear methods lssvm and ann show better approximation results in modelling rainfall runoff processes compared to those of linear methods mlr there is a slight difference between the pso and hho algorithms in most of the cases in the training stage among all considered scenarios and methods lssvm pso or lssvm hho provided the best approximation in the training with the lowest rmse 55 6532 m3 s or 55 6554 m3 s and mae 22 9391 m3 s or 22 9401 m3 s and the highest r 0 8594 and nse 0 7379 for the 2nd scenario a similar trend is also observed for the testing stage the lssvm method generally performs better than the ann and mlr methods for example the decreases in binary rmse and mae of the ann hho and mlr hho are 8 3 and 5 6 and 15 and 17 for scenario 2 0 3 and 3 4 and 12 and 12 for scenario 3 6 2 and 3 8 and 15 and 18 for scenario 4 the increases in binary r and nse are 0 3 and 0 2 and 1 6 and 7 6 for scenario 1 4 3 and 4 2 and 3 5 and 8 8 for scenario 2 1 6 and 3 2 and 2 5 and 9 3 for scenario 4 and 0 1 and 0 7 and 1 9 and 7 for scenario 5 respectively the best lssvm pso or hho in scenario 2 method has lower rmse 28 5033 m3 s and mae 17 6754 m3 s and higher r 0 9111 and nse 0 8230 than those of the best ann hho in scenario 3 with rmse 29 6402 m3 s mae 19 2060 m3 s r 0 9061 and nse 0 8085 and the best mlr hho in scenario 2 with rmse 33 4451 m3 s mae 21 1799 m3 s r 0 8800 and nse 0 7562 in the test stage it should be noted that the lssvm and ann methods provided the best accuracy in different scenarios in other words the optimal predictors are qt 1 qt 2 rt 1 and rt 2 according to lssvm while the corresponding predictors are qt 1 qt 2 and rt 1 with respect to the ann method this might be due to the different structures and assumptions used in these methods the ann has some drawbacks important drawbacks are becoming trapped in local optima and long procedures in the choice of model architecture suykens 2001 the lssvm however uses convex optimization therefore it has strong adaptability and good generalization accuracy without becoming trapped in local minima sivapragasam et al 2001 the other important issue that can be derived from table 7 is that the accuracies of the models in the training stage are relatively less than those in the test stage see the r and nse values the main reason for this may be the more complex structure of the training data which have a more skewed distribution including much higher rainfall and runoff peaks than those of the testing data as clearly observed from table 3 and fig 4 furthermore the auto and cross correlations are lower in training compared to those in testing see table 4 fig 8 shows the scatter graphs of the test results provided by the optimal models for the 2nd scenario as clearly observed from the figure the lssvm method has less scattered estimates with higher r and fits the line equation to the exact line y x compared to those of the ann and mlr these outcomes are in good agreement with those of the previous literature kisi 2012 2013 kisi 2012 investigated the ability of lssvm to map the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment the findings of this study revealed the superiority of lssvm in comparison to ann kisi 2013 compared the accuracy of lssvm with ann and empirical methods in estimating reference evapotranspiration using climatic data from two stations in the usa and found that the first model outperformed the others the optimal parameters of lssvm obtained using the hho and pso algorithms are shown in table 8 it is apparent that the optimized values are similar in some cases Œ≥ and c values in scenario 2 and scenario 4 and c values in scenario 5 while there is a large difference between them in scenario 1 and scenario 3 table 9 denotes the mlr parameters calculated by two bioinspired algorithms here similar variations are observed so that some coefficients are quite different between hho and pso while there is a slight difference between them e g scenario 1 bias values in all scenarios this can be explained by the different working procedures of these two algorithms as explained in the methods section the optimal ann weights or parameters computed by hho and pso are shown in table 10 it is clear from the table that the differences between the corresponding weight values of the ann obtained by the two algorithms are high compared to the lssvm and mlr parameters the main reason for this may be that more parameters need to be optimized in ann compared to those of the other methods table 11 reports the variation in nse values for the applied models with respect to iteration number the convergence characteristics of the hho and pso algorithms are visually compared in fig 9 the table and figure show that the difference between two bioinspired algorithms is marginal for the lssvm method while there is a large difference between hho and pso for the ann as also mentioned before this can be explained by the complexity of the optimization problem the lssvm has only two parameters Œ≥ and c to be optimized by the hho and pso while the ann has too many weights for example the ann in scenario 2 has 4 inputs qt 1 qt 2 rt 1 and rt 2 9 hidden nodes 2 4 1 see eq 11 and one output and there are 45 weights 4 9 9 without considering bias values all these imply that the hho algorithm is more successful in catching optimal values than the pso hho uses many exploration strategies and selects the optimal movement step this ability adds extra strength to the exploitation potential of hho adaptive and time varying parameters are used in hho which allows the algorithm to cope with the difficulties of an exploration space involving local optimal outcomes deceptive optima and multimodality heidari et al 2019 5 conclusions this study focused on overcoming the common problem of data driven models in identifying the internal parameters and the suitable selection for the input output architecture of the model different data driven models namely the least squares support vector machine lssvm and multilayer perceptron mlp integrated with advanced optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso and harris hawks optimization hho were introduced the findings of this study proved the superiority of lssvm in approximating the rainfall runoff relationship compared to mlr and ann the optimum result has been achieved with the use of the lssvm model when scenario two is introduced where the input predictors are qt 1 qt 2 rt 1 and rt 2 a higher level of accuracy in predicting runoff values was achieved when lssvm was integrated with pso and hho compared with that when integrated ann however the integrated lssvm model with hho outperformed lssvm pso which indicates that the hho algorithm is more successful in catching optimal values than pso hho uses many exploration strategies and selects the optimal movement step this ability adds extra strength to the exploitation potential of hho however further studies might be required to enhance the proposed model by introducing more input variables that have not been investigated due to the lack of such information in addition presenting a more advanced optimizer to be incorporated with the data driven models might lead to more improvement in predicting runoff despite the fact that the proposed model could achieve relatively high accurate modelling for rainfall runoff model the proposed modeming approach experienced two main limitations first the required historical data for the rainfall and runoff should be reliable and available for relatively long time in order to allow the model to mimic the possible patterns between rainfall and runoff second there is a need to re structure and re generate the whole model architecture in case it is required to include different climate variables in the model input to improve the model accuracy credit authorship contribution statement yazid tikhamarine methodology software writing review editing

5240,rainfall and runoff are considered the main components in the hydrological cycle developing an accurate model to capture the dynamic connection between rainfall and runoff remains a problematic task for engineers several studies have been carried out to develop models to accurately predict the changes in runoff from rainfall however these models have limitations in terms of accuracy and complexity when large numbers of parameters are needed therefore recently with the advancement of data driven techniques a vast number of hydrologists have adopted models to predict changes in runoff however data driven models still encounter several limitations related to hyperparameter optimization and overfitting hence there is a need to improve these models to overcome these limitations in this study data driven techniques such as a multi layer perceptron mlp neural network and least squares support vector machine lssvm are integrated with an advanced nature inspired optimizer namely

autocorrelation function pacf finally for comprehensive analysis the performance of the proposed model will then be compared with integrated data driven techniques with particle swarm optimization pso the results revealed that all the augmented models with hho outperformed other integrated models with pso in predicting the changes in runoff in addition a high level of accuracy in predicting runoff values was achieved when hho was integrated with lssvm keywords runoff model nature inspired optimizers malaysia 1 introduction water is an essential natural resource that is considered the key element in social and economic development in general water resources are under heavy stress or are experiencing mismatch between water supply and demand in several areas worldwide this is due to the increase in demand and limitations in the available water quantity or mismanagement of the available water resources in fact appropriate water planning and management is the only alternative to minimize such water stress or to address the gap between water supply and demand borga and vizzaccaro 1997 abrahart and see 2000 banadkooki et al 2019 rezaie balf et al 2019 turgut et al 2019 1 1 background rainfall is considered the main component in the hydrological cycle and it is the primary source for river runoff that could be directly used and controlled to meet the water demand abrahart and see 2000 asokan and dutta 2008 several research attempts all over the world have been carried out to not only predict rainfall but also determine the interrelationship between rainfall and runoff to be able to adapt certain management strategies of the water to make it available whenever needed borga and vizzaccaro 1997 andr√©assian et al 2001 asokan and dutta 2008 these studies mainly focused on empirical numerical deterministic and statistical methods however all these models are still in the research stage and more focus on advanced model techniques is required to achieve accurate estimation of runoff from rainfall in addition these efforts have been developed at different spatial basin catchment and subcatchment levels and temporal scales daily weekly monthly and seasonal time increments abudu et al 2010 2011 in fact runoff is important for water resource planning management development and modelling of available water and flood protection and forecasting brath et al 2002 anctil and lauzon 2004 akhtar et al 2009 afan et al 2017 the conversion of rainfall that transforms and reflects runoff is considered an extremely nonlinear complex and dynamic process and includes several temporal and spatial variabilities as well there are several parameters and usually they are physical factors that affect the interrelationship between rainfall and runoff in addition even with successful identification for a particular watershed an accurate relationship for rainfall runoff is not necessarily accurate for another watershed actually developing an accurate rainfall runoff model is still considered a complex problem for engineers hydrologists and agriculturists fahimi et al 2017 tikhamarine et al 2020 several approaches have been developed since the middle of the previous century to tackle this issue such as the soil conservation curve number scs cn method soulis et al 2009 stewart et al 2012 this approach was developed to convert rainfall to surface runoff using a particular model scs uh that has been abstracted from the characteristics of the watershed hence many modifications are needed for use in another watershed furthermore different empirical and statistical methods have been applied to overcome the difficulty of collecting a large amount of data from the watershed for successful application of the scs cn method soulis and valiantzas 2012 singh et al 2013 these methods showed acceptable estimation of runoff from rainfall but only for average rainfall patterns while for extreme rainfall events the model showed poor estimation of runoff tikhamarine et al 2020 1 2 problem statement and innovation more recently with the existence of the new generation of data driven models hydrologists switched to artificial intelligence ai models to tackle the non linearity and the stochasticity problem within the rainfall and runoff including several types of the artificial neural networks anns modelling such as multi layer perceptron mlps radial basis functions rbfs recurrent neural networks rnns input delays ids adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfiss and support vector machines svms el shafie et al 2007 el shafie et al 2009 afan et al 2017 ho et al 2019 adnan et al 2019a 2019b tikhamarine et al 2019a 2019b during the past two decades several research efforts have been carried out to develop rainfall runoff models using different ai models however these models still have several drawbacks brath et al 2002 asokan and dutta 2008 these drawbacks are usually related to overfitting difficulty in initializing the internal parameters related to these models and proposing the proper input output architecture of the model ahmed et al 2019 in this context in the current study a focus on how to overcome the problem of identifying the internal parameters of the ai models and appropriate selection for the input output architecture of the model will be investigated therefore the input output architecture will be developed as a pre processing analysis for the used data by employing autocorrelation and cross correlation analysis to identify the best model architecture in addition to select the most suitable initialization for the internal parameters an advanced nature inspired optimization algorithm has been functionalized and integrated with the prediction model namely harris hawks optimization hho heidari et al 2019 in fact there are several internal parameters within all the ai models the optimization algorithm selected should be able to consider the scalability and the dimension of the optimization problem because hho as an optimizer showed outstanding performance for searching for optimal solutions for higher and multidimensional problems hho could be the best choice to be applied heidari et al 2019 moayedi et al 2019a b 1 3 objectives the chief objective of this study is to develop a rainfall runoff model that could achieve accurate estimation for runoff in addition this study proposed a process to pre process the data used by introducing autocorrelation and cross correlation analysis to identify the optimal input output architecture of the model furthermore to select the best initial values for the hyperparameters of the proposed models a new nature inspired optimizer has been integrated with the prediction model finally different ai methods and different particle swarm optimization pso methods have been developed to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the achieved results from the proposed model the proposed models have been applied to real rainfall and runoff data collected from the perak river system in malaysia 2 case study and data description 2 1 study area the perak river is among the largest rivers in malaysia with a length equal to 427 km it covers a catchment area of 15 180 km2 which occupies approximately 71 of perak state its flow starts from north of perak state through the mountainous area towards the southern part the elevation of these mountains is more than 2000 m msl a series of four dams have been built on the upper part of the perak river catchment these dams include temengor bersia kenering and chenderoh which are used for hydropower generation the elevation of the perak basin ranges from 206 m to 2156 m msl the temengor dam covers an area of 3 434 km2 which is considered the first and largest dam on the perak river fig 1 shows the location map of the perak river catchment sammen et al 2018 2 2 data acquisition rainfall measurements are considered a basis for any hydrological modelling thus rainfall data for the period from 01 january 2008 to 24 june 2014 at seven stations distributed in the temengor catchment area were collected and used to model the rainfall runoff relationship the places and details of these stations are presented in fig 2 and table 1 respectively in order to develop the model the first step is to split the data into different classes to train validate and test the model performance the main importance of such step is to assure that the model would perform with consistent level of accuracy in case that the model experienced unseen data rather than those in the training however in order to cross validate the model s performance before switching to the testing stage the training data could be split also into two parts one for training and the other for validation by this step the model could overcome the drawback of experienced over fitting problem and also assure better performance when the model moved to the testing stage in this context the collected data for this study has been split into two major parts one for training 70 of the data records in order to calibrate the model and identify the values of the internal parameters and 30 for testing to examine the model performance in the meantime the training data has been split into two parts as well one for training and the other for validation with percentage 70 for training and 30 for validation additionally a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 1 m was used all of these data were acquired from the owner of the power plant and the department of irrigation and drainage did malaysia the dem is considered necessary to identify the catchment border and size the dem for the study area was acquired from the national energy agency in malaysia the thiessen polygons approach was adopted in this study to estimate the average rainfall value from the seven stations as shown in fig 3 the mean area weights or proportion of each rainfall station that contributes to the catchment were estimated as shown in table 2 while table 3 summarizes the statistical parameters of the dataset used in this research fig 4 present the time series plot of the observed rainfall and runoff values 3 methodology 3 1 models 3 1 1 least squares support vector machine the least squares support vector machine lssvm was proposed for the first time by suykens and vandewalle 1999 the lssvm could be considered one of the models under machine learning categories that presented an enhanced form of the basic original support vector machine svm that has been established from structural risk minimization smr in structural theory lssvm has been successfully applied in regression and classification problems and has provided a robust performance chamkalani et al 2014 kalteh 2016 gholampour et al 2018 keshtegar et al 2019 the nonlinear regression function of lssvm can be given as 1 f x w t x b where œï x denotes the mapping function nonlinear function that represents the input patterns of the model through higher dimensional space the other parameters w and b can be identified using the following optimizer formula 2 min j w e 1 2 w t w Œ≥ 2 i 1 n e i 2 subjected to the following equality 3 z i w t x i b e i where Œ≥ denotes the parameter of regularization and ei is defined as a random initialized error to resolve the given optimization sequence the lagrange equation procedure is employed as follows 4 l w b e Œ± j w e i 1 n Œ± i w t x i b e i z i i 1 2 3 n where Œ±i is the multiplicator of a lagrange function the optimization requirements are listed as follows 5 l w 0 w i 1 n Œ± i x i l b 0 i 1 n Œ± i 0 l e i 0 Œ± i Œ≥ e i i 1 2 3 n l e i 0 w t x i e i z i 0 i 1 2 3 n the kernel function k xi x œï xi tœï x i 1 2 3 n accordingly the lssvm procedure turns into 6 f x i 1 n Œ± i k x x i b where Œ±i and b denote the answer to the system as a linear function owing to the relationship between performance and the kernel function choice the choice of the kernel function is important in this study the radial basic function rbf has been adopted as a kernel function due to its success in solving the regression function the rbf kernel is defined as follows 7 k x x i e x p Œ≥ x i x 2 where Œ≥ is the kernel parameter and lssvm performance usually depends on the appropriate choice of this parameter in the current work the ls svmlab toolbox https www esat kuleuven be sista lssvmlab has been used to develop the ls svm 3 1 2 multilayer perceptron neural network the multilayer perceptron mlp is the classical type of artificial neural network ann which has been widely used to find a function dependency between variables regression problem the ann model was first inspired and presented by mcculloch and pitts 1943 based on the behaviour of the human brain and how neurons nerves relate to each other the structure of the mlp model is based on three layers an input layer a hidden layer and a single output layer the interconnection between them occurs by weights and biases and this connection can be explained mathematically as follows 8 y f 2 i 1 m w kj f 1 a j b o where y is the output of the mlp model f 1 and f 2 are the activation functions of the hidden and output layers respectively wjk denotes neuron j s connections weight that links neurons j within the hidden layer with neuron k in the output layer and b o denotes the bias associated with neuronk 9 f 1 a j 1 1 e x p a j a j is called the summation of the inputs and can be explained as 10 a j i 1 n x i w ji b j where x i is the input variables wi j denotes the linkage weights with neuron j in the hidden layer and b j denotes the bias associated with neuron j of the hidden layer one challenge in developing mlp is the choice of the number of hidden neurons within the hidden layer in this study equation 11 was adopted to identify the number of hidden neurons 11 m 2 n 1 equation 11 has been used in several studies mirjalili 2015 aljarah et al 2018 where n denotes the number of inputs and m is the optimal number of neurons 3 1 3 multiple linear regression the multiple linear regression model mlr is based on the regression equation that illustrates the simple relationship between dependent and independent variables mlr can be considered a classic and popular model to resolve statistical regression problems huien and peter 1997 malik and kumar 2015 li et al 2017 in fact mlr is used to find a regression relationship based on the following regression function 12 q t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 y 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 Œ≤ 3 y 3 Œ≤ n y n where qt is the predicted runoff in our case Œ≤0 Œ≤1 Œ≤2 Œ≤3 Œ≤n are the regression multiplicators and y0 y1 y2 y3 yn are the independent variables in our case the independent variables based on previous runoff qt and rainfall rt 3 2 meta heuristic algorithms 3 2 1 harris hawks optimization the hho algorithm is a novel algorithm based on swarm intelligence the hho algorithm was developed and expanded by heidari et al 2019 usually the hawks work alone in nature but harris hawks work together for hunting and chasing the hho algorithm mimics the cooperative behaviour and hunting mechanisms of harris hawks the proposed hho algorithm was successfully used for optimization and engineering applications abbasi et al 2019 moayedi et al 2019a b 2020 the hunting mechanism of the proposed hho includes four movements tracing encircling approaching and attacking this mechanism is based on three principle stages first exploration second a transition from exploration to exploitation and finally exploitation fig 5 shows how hho works based on three basic stages the first stage is the capability of exploration which is listed as 13 x t 1 x rand t r 1 x rand t 2 r 2 x t i f q 0 5 x rabbit t x a t r 3 l b r 4 u b l b i f q 0 5 14 x a t 1 n 1 n x i t where xa t is the average location of the harris hawk n is the number of all harris hawks search agent number x t 1 is the location of the hawk in the following iteration t 1 xi t is the position of the current harris hawk at iteration t xrand t is a randomly selected hawk between xrabbit t is the location of the rabbit prey lb and ub are the lower and upper bands respectively and q r1 r2 r3 and r4 are random values varying between 0 and 1 the second stage is the transition fromexploration toexploitation in this stage the energy of hawks is reduced during the hunt the hunt escaping energy e can be formulated as 15 e 2 e 0 1 t t where e0 is the initial energy during each progression e0 1 1 and t is the maximum size of the iteration number in the hho algorithm the state of the rabbit may be determined based on the contrast direction of e where e stands for the energy of the rabbit and e0 1 1 represents the inlet energy for each step based on the variation in e hho can determine the state of the rabbit the exploitation phase which is the third stage of the model is predominantly designed to enhance the predefined solution local solution during exploitation and based on both values of e and r two types of besiege could be considered whether it is hard hence e 0 5 or soft and hence e 0 5 in fact there are four approaches soft besiege soft and hard besiege with progressive rapid dives and finally hard besiege to imitate the attacking stage within the hho algorithm heidari et al 2019 moayedi et al 2019b the following equations represent the hawk while in soft besiege in case the prey has energy 16 x t 1 Œ¥ x t e j x rabbit t x t 17 Œ¥ x t x rabbit t x t where Œ¥ x t denotes the time difference between x rabbit t and x t updating the solution once becomes the hard besiege as follows 18 x t 1 x rabbit t e Œ¥ x t where j is the rabbit s random jumping force while escaping which equals j 2 1 r5 and r5 is a random value between 0 and 1 when the prey has enough energy the soft besiege with progressive rapid dives step would be as follows 19 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x t the following step is to equate the current movement with the y prior dive and define the best solution between them the hawks in this research begin to dive rapidly and irregularly simulated using the rules of levy flight as shown in the following 20 z y s l e v y d where s is a random vector levy d is the levy flight and d is the dimension then the hawks will update their position in the soft besiege as follows 21 x t 1 y i f f i t y f i t x t z i f f i t z f i t x t the last case is that the rabbits did not have enough energy so the hawks move to the stage called a hard besiege with progressive rapid dives at this stage hawks reduce the distance between their mean and prey the y value can be updated as 22 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x a t the final solution will be generated as follows 23 x t 1 y i f f i t y f i t x t z i f f i t z f i t x t 3 2 2 particle swarm optimization the pso algorithm was developed based on the intelligence of the swarm which was proposed for the first time by kennedy and eberhart 1995 the pso algorithm mimics bird behaviour in nature and is considered one of the most popular algorithms in the meta heuristic literature because of its performance in finding the optimal solution pso has been used effectively in solving optimization problems and in finding optimal solutions based on two main parameters position x and velocity v the velocity can be updated according to the following equation 24 v i t 1 w v i t r 1 c 1 x pbest i x i t r 2 c 2 x gbest i x i t where pbest is the best position of the ith particle and gbest is the best global value obtained by the different particles in every iteration the new position can be updated using the following equation 25 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where x i t is the position of the particle at time step t v i t is the velocity i of the particle at time t w is the coefficient of inertia c1 and c2 are the acceleration coefficients r1 and r2 are random coefficients and v i t 1 is the new updated velocity the value of w can be determined as follows kennedy and eberhart 1995 26 w w max w max w min i max i where w min and w max are the minimum and maximum weights respectively is the number of iterations and i max is the maximum number of iterations 3 3 input selection and model development 3 3 1 input selection one of the key factors influencing the performance of models is the choice of the input combination therefore the choice of input combination is very important before applying the lssvm mlp and mlr models in this study five different scenarios were developed and investigated based on the simple cross correlation function ccf the autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf indeed the predictors used in this work are the initial basin conditions represented by the antecedent runoff and the climatic conditions given by the precipitation at different time steps so the autocorrelation and cross correlation functions have been used for the identification of the number of lags of antecedent runoff and rainfall respectively fig 6 shows the ccf acf and pacf figures the correlation values are listed in table 4 and the five proposed scenarios are shown in the table 5 ccf shows that the rainfall for two lags are effective on runoff and then the other lags fell into the confidence limit therefore rt 1 and rt 2 were included in the 1st four input combinations also pacf indicates that the 1st two lags of runoff are effective and 3rd lag qt 3 is very near to confidence limit and therefore this input was ignored the last input combination was also considered to see if the rainfall beyond the 2nd lag affects runoff at time t or not 3 3 2 model development in this paper three models were selected and compared to each other lssvm mlp and mlr for modelling rainfall runoff tasks in fact the performance of each model is usually dependent on the correct determination of its parameters including the lssvm mlp and mlr models two optimized algorithms were used to improve the parameters of these models particle swarm optimization pso kennedy and eberhart 1995 and a new metaheuristic algorithm called the harris hawks optimizer hho heidari et al 2019 the lssvm pso and lssvm hho hybrid models are the hybrid lssvm model with these two algorithms to find optimal c and Œ≥ lssvm parameters while the hybrid mlr is combined with pso and hho to build mlr pso and mlr hho models respectively to find the appropriate parameters of the mlr model equation 14 hybrid models mlp pso and mlp hho are the conjunction of simple mlp with the pso and hho algorithms respectively this hybrid depends on the improvement in the weight and biases of the mlp model mlp parameters fig 6 shows a schematic update of the position in two successive iterations of the hho and pso algorithms fig 7 demonstrates the flowcharts of the proposed hybrid models table 6 consists of the initial parameters of the pso and hho algorithms 3 4 statistical performance indicators the performance criteria of the proposed models were examined using the following criteria root mean square error rmse 27 rmse 1 n i 1 n q p i q o i 2 0 rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 28 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q p i 2 i 1 n q o i

observed runoff q p i is the predicted runoff n is the number of daily data and q o and q p are the average values of the observed and predicted runoff respectively 4 results and discussion the training and testing performances of the lssvm ann and mlr models with respect to rmse mae r and nse statistics are summarised in table 7 for different scenarios in the training stage the lssvm method generally provides better approximates or fitting runoff values than the ann and mlr for example decreases in binary rmse and mae of the ann hho and mlr hho are 24 8 14 1 and 30 29 for scenario 2 7 4 8 and 14 6 21 7 for scenario 3 13 2 5 6 and 22 1 23 5 for scenario 4 and for scenario 5 the binary rmse and mae are 2 1 3 1 and 10 1 18 9 respectively the increases in binary r and nse are 17 4 37 6 and 26 58 6 for scenario 2 5 6 11 1 and 14 7 31 1 for scenario 3 9 4 19 4 and 21 6 47 5 for scenario 4 and 2 2 3 6 and 11 2 23 for scenario 5 respectively as expected nonlinear methods lssvm and ann show better approximation results in modelling rainfall runoff processes compared to those of linear methods mlr there is a slight difference between the pso and hho algorithms in most of the cases in the training stage among all considered scenarios and methods lssvm pso or lssvm hho provided the best approximation in the training with the lowest rmse 55 6532 m3 s or 55 6554 m3 s and mae 22 9391 m3 s or 22 9401 m3 s and the highest r 0 8594 and nse 0 7379 for the 2nd scenario a similar trend is also observed for the testing stage the lssvm method generally performs better than the ann and mlr methods for example the decreases in binary rmse and mae of the ann hho and mlr hho are 8 3 and 5 6 and 15 and 17 for scenario 2 0 3 and 3 4 and 12 and 12 for scenario 3 6 2 and 3 8 and 15 and 18 for scenario 4 the increases in binary r and nse are 0 3 and 0 2 and 1 6 and 7 6 for scenario 1 4 3 and 4 2 and 3 5 and 8 8 for scenario 2 1 6 and 3 2 and 2 5 and 9 3 for scenario 4 and 0 1 and 0 7 and 1 9 and 7 for scenario 5 respectively the best lssvm pso or hho in scenario 2 method has lower rmse 28 5033 m3 s and mae 17 6754 m3 s and higher r 0 9111 and nse 0 8230 than those of the best ann hho in scenario 3 with rmse 29 6402 m3 s mae 19 2060 m3 s r 0 9061 and nse 0 8085 and the best mlr hho in scenario 2 with rmse 33 4451 m3 s mae 21 1799 m3 s r 0 8800 and nse 0 7562 in the test stage it should be noted that the lssvm and ann methods provided the best accuracy in different scenarios in other words the optimal predictors are qt 1 qt 2 rt 1 and rt 2 according to lssvm while the corresponding predictors are qt 1 qt 2 and rt 1 with respect to the ann method this might be due to the different structures and assumptions used in these methods the ann has some drawbacks important drawbacks are becoming trapped in local optima and long procedures in the choice of model architecture suykens 2001 the lssvm however uses convex optimization therefore it has strong adaptability and good generalization accuracy without becoming trapped in local minima sivapragasam et al 2001 the other important issue that can be derived from table 7 is that the accuracies of the models in the training stage are relatively less than those in the test stage see the r and nse values the main reason for this may be the more complex structure of the training data which have a more skewed distribution including much higher rainfall and runoff peaks than those of the testing data as clearly observed from table 3 and fig 4 furthermore the auto and cross correlations are lower in training compared to those in testing see table 4 fig 8 shows the scatter graphs of the test results provided by the optimal models for the 2nd scenario as clearly observed from the figure the lssvm method has less scattered estimates with higher r and fits the line equation to the exact line y x compared to those of the ann and mlr these outcomes are in good agreement with those of the previous literature kisi 2012 2013 kisi 2012 investigated the ability of lssvm to map the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment the findings of this study revealed the superiority of lssvm in comparison to ann kisi 2013 compared the accuracy of lssvm with ann and empirical methods in estimating reference evapotranspiration using climatic data from two stations in the usa and found that the first model outperformed the others the optimal parameters of lssvm obtained using the hho and pso algorithms are shown in table 8 it is apparent that the optimized values are similar in some cases Œ≥ and c values in scenario 2 and scenario 4 and c values in scenario 5 while there is a large difference between them in scenario 1 and scenario 3 table 9 denotes the mlr parameters calculated by two bioinspired algorithms here similar variations are observed so that some coefficients are quite different between hho and pso while there is a slight difference between them e g scenario 1 bias values in all scenarios this can be explained by the different working procedures of these two algorithms as explained in the methods section the optimal ann weights or parameters computed by hho and pso are shown in table 10 it is clear from the table that the differences between the corresponding weight values of the ann obtained by the two algorithms are high compared to the lssvm and mlr parameters the main reason for this may be that more parameters need to be optimized in ann compared to those of the other methods table 11 reports the variation in nse values for the applied models with respect to iteration number the convergence characteristics of the hho and pso algorithms are visually compared in fig 9 the table and figure show that the difference between two bioinspired algorithms is marginal for the lssvm method while there is a large difference between hho and pso for the ann as also mentioned before this can be explained by the complexity of the optimization problem the lssvm has only two parameters Œ≥ and c to be optimized by the hho and pso while the ann has too many weights for example the ann in scenario 2 has 4 inputs qt 1 qt 2 rt 1 and rt 2 9 hidden nodes 2 4 1 see eq 11 and one output and there are 45 weights 4 9 9 without considering bias values all these imply that the hho algorithm is more successful in catching optimal values than the pso hho uses many exploration strategies and selects the optimal movement step this ability adds extra strength to the exploitation potential of hho adaptive and time varying parameters are used in hho which allows the algorithm to cope with the difficulties of an exploration space involving local optimal outcomes deceptive optima and multimodality heidari et al 2019 5 conclusions this study focused on overcoming the common problem of data driven models in identifying the internal parameters and the suitable selection for the input output architecture of the model different data driven models namely the least squares support vector machine lssvm and multilayer perceptron mlp integrated with advanced optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso and harris hawks optimization hho were introduced the findings of this study proved the superiority of lssvm in approximating the rainfall runoff relationship compared to mlr and ann the optimum result has been achieved with the use of the lssvm model when scenario two is introduced where the input predictors are qt 1 qt 2 rt 1 and rt 2 a higher level of accuracy in predicting runoff values was achieved when lssvm was integrated with pso and hho compared with that when integrated ann however the integrated lssvm model with hho outperformed lssvm pso which indicates that the hho algorithm is more successful in catching optimal values than pso hho uses many exploration strategies and selects the optimal movement step this ability adds extra strength to the exploitation potential of hho however further studies might be required to enhance the proposed model by introducing more input variables that have not been investigated due to the lack of such information in addition presenting a more advanced optimizer to be incorporated with the data driven models might lead to more improvement in predicting runoff despite the fact that the proposed model could achieve relatively high accurate modelling for rainfall runoff model the proposed modeming approach experienced two main limitations first the required historical data for the rainfall and runoff should be reliable and available for relatively long time in order to allow the model to mimic the possible patterns between rainfall and runoff second there is a need to re structure and re generate the whole model architecture in case it is required to include different climate variables in the model input to improve the model accuracy credit authorship contribution statement yazid tikhamarine methodology software writing review editing

5241,ophiolitic formations play a critical role in the groundwater resource of numerous countries and areas previous studies show that the structural heterogeneities of these rocks coming from the presence of both different lithological units and multi scale discontinuities result in complex hydrogeological features that are not well characterized yet in particular there is a need for understanding how these heterogeneities impact the hydrodynamic properties of ophiolitic aquifers and the highly variable chemical composition of the water to this end we conduct various kinds of pumping experiments between two boreholes 15 m apart in the ophiolitic formation of the batin ba1 site in the wadi tayin massif of the sultanate of oman cross borehole open pumping experiments as well as multi level pumping and monitoring hydraulic tests are performed in conductive zones that were identified from temperature and flowmeter data but also in low permeability zones requiring to manage very low pumping flow rates the collected data are interpreted with a model implementing non integral flow dimension leakage and time dependent pumping flow rates the considered modeling concepts and the estimated hydrogeological properties show that the multi directional structural heterogeneities of ophiolitic aquifers are key features that must be considered in future hydrogeological models

zones e g abbate et al 1985 barker et al 2005 maury and balaji 2014 segadelli et al 2017 vacquand et al 2018 jeanpert et al 2019 these rocks extend from the alps to the himalayas through for instance cyprus syria and oman and are also present in various countries such as cuba usa papua new guinea new caledonia and newfoundland abbate et al 1985 ophiolites are important groundwater resources in some areas e g within the northern apennines segadelli et al 2017 and in cyprus barker et al 2005 in oman ophiolite water was a key resource for the population that started in 3000 bc nowadays the main fresh water supply in the towns bordering the oman gulf including muscat comes from sea water desalinisation but ophiolites still provide the only source of water for agriculture including dates growing which is often the main income for villagers in several inland areas where people built underground galleries called aflaj plural of falaj for irrigation since 5000 years villages developed close to the often intermittent rivers wadis that form from the ophiolite water sources often occurring at the peridotite gabbro interface the former forming the low permeability reservoir while the latter fractured and often altered draining the ophiolite massif water toward sources dewandel et al 2004 in a general manner ophiolites may impact strongly the chemical composition of the water e g in western serbia nikic et al 2013 and oman paukert vankeuren et al 2019 because of the high reactivity of the rock forming minerals which makes some water sources unsuitable for human use ophiolites are composed of rocks such as basalt dolerite gabbro and peridotite implying that they are characterized by the coexistence of different lithological units which can be fractured at many scales due to cooling and multiple chemical alteration mechanisms the presence of structural discontinuities that control the permeability of these systems results in some similarities with the well known and widely studied fractured granitic rock aquifers however these similarities in terms of fracturation do not result in similar overall systems since the submarine conditions of formation of ophiolitic rocks and weathering after exhumation lead to complex hydrogeological properties that are not well characterized yet e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 jeanpert et al 2019 for instance at meter to tens of meters scales far from faults hydraulic discontinuities in peridotites are often zones concentrating high density of fissures whereas granite systems are usually homogeneous poorly permeable matrix hosting pluri meter scale often sparsely distributed discrete fractures the few studies conducted on ophiolitic aquifers show that the structural heterogeneities of these systems resulting from the presence of both different lithological units and multi scale hydraulic discontinuities from fissure zones to kilometer scale faults control their inherent behavior under ambient conditions and their responses to forced conditions as a result the hydrogeological models that are built to understand and reproduce the hydrodynamic of these aquifers are based on the coexistence of various recharge and transmissivity zones which hydraulic properties depend on the lithological units and discontinuities that are associated with the zones e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 segadelli et al 2017 these properties are estimated from different characterization techniques including hydrograph analysis mercury porosity and hydraulic conductivity laboratory measurements as well as pumping tests e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 jeanpert et al 2019 the large variety of existing techniques and possible configurations that are associated with pumping experiments makes it a very useful tool for characterizing the subsurface hydraulic properties conducting these experiments in open boreholes or using single or dual packers that are moved along the boreholes provide vertically integrated or vertically distributed hydraulic properties respectively the resulting changes in pressure are monitored in either the pumped well i e single borehole experiments or observation wells i e cross borehole experiments which impacts the spatial extent and meaning of the estimated properties e g bear 1979 le borgne et al 2007 day lewis et al 2011 that being said the quality of these estimates depends on the models that are used to interpret the collected hydraulic data the line source analytical solutions e g theis solution which are widely used because they are easy to implement are well suited for interpreting the intermediate and late time responses that are collected while applying steady pumping flow rates however the assumption of a negligible effect of the pumped borehole storage might be critical when interpreting early time data related to transient pumping flow rates using more sophisticated solutions which take into account the wellbore storage effect the flow dimension related to the structural heterogeneities and the occurrence of leakage effects leads to better estimates of the hydraulic properties of the studied systems in particular when focusing on heterogeneous systems and time dependent pumping flow rates e g lods and gouze 2004 cihan et al 2011 yeh and chang 2013 in the context of ophiolitic aquifers only a few studies considered pumping tests for characterizing these hydrosystems e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 jeanpert et al 2019 for the kouris catchment in cyprus and the koniambo massif in new caledonia hydraulic conductivity estimates were obtained from single borehole pumping experiments and packer tests respectively that are interpreted with simple analytical solutions boronina et al 2003 jeanpert et al 2019 for the ophiolite hard rock aquifers in oman the interpretation of open cross borehole pumping experiments with a dual porosity or dual permeability model led to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients at various locations dewandel et al 2005 these studies emphasized that the efforts for characterizing ophiolitic aquifers with pumping experiments need to be pushed further by focusing on i conducting multi level pumping experiments i e packer tests in order to obtain vertically distributed estimates of the hydraulic properties ii using sophisticated models for improving the quality of the estimated properties iii combining the complementary information provided by open borehole experiments and packer tests where the packers can be used for multi level pumping and multi level pressure monitoring and iv developing pumping techniques and specific equipment that are adapted to low permeability zones with localized highly permeable structures in this work we address these challenges by conducting and analyzing several kinds of pumping experiments in the ophiolitic batin east site in the wadi tayin massif of the sultanate of oman to this end we start by analyzing open borehole pumping experiments that were conducted in two boreholes positioned 15 m apart and we show that the considered systems cannot be characterized with vertically integrated hydraulic properties in order to infer vertically distributed properties we then consider multi level pumping experiments as well as multi level cross borehole pressure monitoring with intervals defined from temperature and flowmeter data in light of direct geological observations and indirect data analysis we consider non integral flow dimension models with vertical leakage that are used in the context of time dependent pumping flow rates the corresponding results show the complexity of the studied system for which both the lithological units and discontinuities impact the estimated hydraulic properties in different proportions depending on the considered layer in this work we also address the issue of pumping tests in poorly permeable zones by presenting material experimental methods and interpretation procedures especially adapted to this challenge the site and methods are described in section 2 the pumping experiments and their interpretation are discussed in section 3 and the results and general conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 2 site and methods 2 1 site description the international continental scientific drilling program icdp oman

hydrogeological system and the subsurface microbiome wadi tayin massif is one of the largest and most intact massifs within the samail ophiolite the observatory lies within the mantle peridotite

several kilometres along a set of nnw trending strike slip faults e g nicolas et al 2000 a prominent nnw trending fault system with unknown sense of displacement cuts across wadi lawayni and the multi borehole observatory fig 1 the observatory consists of a multi borehole array of drill sites including ba1 ba2a ba3a and ba4a site ba1 which is the target site for this study includes one fully cored

fig 3 displays the schematic representation of the downhole part of the pumping system it is installed from the surface using a tripod equipped with an electric chain hoist as a succession of individual parts of maximum 3 m length that are assembled at the surface from the bottom to the top the dual packer system includes the lower pressure port p 1 that measures the pressure below the lower packer the lower packer the two packers are 1 m long and can be inflated individually so that one can perform single packer or dual packer pumping test depending on the objectives the pumping

measures the pressure above the upper packer p 3 œÅ g measures the water column length above the upper packer œÅ and g being the fluid density and gravitational acceleration respectively the shut in valve when the packers are inflated the valve is closed due to the weight of all the equipment pump and pipes above it it is opened by pulling the pipe assemblage from the surface with the crane a

static level wtsl the pump grundfos sqe 1 140 the downhole system displayed in fig 3 is installed below the required length of screwed pvc pipes of internal diameter 48 mm the system is linked to the surface by the electrical wire required for powering the downhole pump as well as the data wire used to transmit the multiplexed data from the pressure sensors that also measure temperature and the gas hoses for inflating deflating the packers that are included into a single cable the data including the pressure at the three measurement levels p 1 p 2 and p 3 are recorded at the surface together with the two packer pressures and the water flow rate measured by a flowmeter installed in line at the well head 2 3 experiments and models three kinds of pumping experiments are considered for characterizing the ba1 site presented in section 2 1 with the material and method described in section 2 2 i cross borehole pumping tests are conducted with the pressure being monitored in both open observation and pumped boreholes section 3 1 these experiments are denoted exp1a and exp1d when pumping in boreholes ba1a and ba1d respectively ii multi level pumping tests are conducted by using packers in order to isolate and pump in specific intervals of the pumped borehole while the pressure is monitored between the packers p 2 above the upper packer p 3 and below the lower packer p 1 as well as in the open observation borehole the intervals considered for these experiments were determined from the analysis of profiles of temperature and flowmeter data the latter profile being collected under ambient and forced hydraulic conditions this data are presented in appendix a with the pressures p 1 and p 3 that are monitored below and above the packers whereas pressure p 2 is analyzed in section 3 2 the corresponding experiments are denoted exp2a i1a and exp2a i2a when pumping is performed in the intervals i 1 a 41 65 m and i 2 a 108 132 m of borehole ba1a and exp2d i1d and exp2d i2d when pumping is performed in the intervals i 1 d 45 75 m and i 2 d 102 132 m of borehole ba1d for both boreholes we also consider the zone below 132 m i e 133 400 m denoted i 3 a and i 3 d in order to characterize the low conductivity zone that is located at the bottom of the wells the corresponding experiments are denoted exp2a i3a and exp2d i3d when pumping in borehole ba1a and ba1d respectively iii finally a cross borehole multi level monitoring pumping experiment denoted exp3d section 3 3 was conducted by using the packer system in borehole ba1a while pumping in borehole ba1d with a grundfos sq2 85 pump this test consisted in monitoring the pressure at several isolated positions in the observation borehole while the pressure is also monitored in the open pumped borehole table 1 summarizes the pumping and observation parameters of the experiments by indicating in which borehole and at which position the pumping and monitoring are done full corresponds to open boreholes whereas the numbers indicate the distances in meter from the surface to the top and bottom positions of the packers that are used to consider isolated intervals during all these experiments the pressure was also monitored in borehole ba1b 120 m nnw of ba1a and ba1d in which no response was recorded this is likely due to the low permeability of the corresponding zone as shown by the log data and core analysis of this borehole not shown from a modeling point of view the fractured nature of ophiolitic aquifers leads to consider both dual permeability and non integral flow dimension models the former modeling concept being used in some previous studies dewandel et al 2005 here we focus on the latter conceptual models because of the following reasons i direct surface observations at the scale of the test site showed numerous heterogeneously distributed centimeter to decimeter scale fractures but no large scale hydraulic discontinuities such as fractures that would have suggested the presence of two interconnected systems of distinctly different hydraulic properties and as such should have justified the use of dual permeability models ii the responses recorded above and below the isolated intervals during packer tests with the pressures p 1 and p 3 that are reported in appendix a show the presence of vertical connections that can be modeled as vertical leakages in non integral flow dimension models hamm and bidaux 1994 iii the results obtained in section 3 with non integral flow dimension models are well in agreement with the data and produce realistic estimations of the parameters and properties thus confirming that the use of more complex models such as dual permeability models is not necessary for the considered data dual permeability models involve more parameters and as such more degrees of liberty that generally require making assumptions or using external data such as geophysical or geological data in the absence of such data that would have dictated using dual permeability models the most parameter parsimonious model must be considered as the most probable model providing a fit to the data in order to interpret the data collected during these experiments we implemented a solution for transient radial flow in leaky aquifers with time dependent pumping flow rates using a fractal formalism this representation is adapted to model hierarchical multi scale fractured aquifers where the characteristic length of the heterogeneity is smaller than the volume investigated by the pumping test lods and gouze 2008 we consider the solution that is presented in appendix b which corresponds to an existing solution for transient radial flow in a fractal fractured aquifer with leakance that is extended to time dependent pumping flow rates and non linear skin effects from this solution we derived four specific models corresponding to i cylindrical flow without leakage model1 ii generalized radial flow without leakage model2 iii cylindrical flow with leakage model3 and iv generalized radial flow with leakage model4 the parameters that distinguish these models from each other are summarized in table 2 the derivation of the models the associated assumptions and their use for interpreting the data are given in appendix c the modeling strategy consists in determining the model that best reproduces the values collected in both the pumping and observation boreholes when a common model cannot be found different models and parameters are considered for each borehole we select the best fitting model by considering the quality of the overlap between the curves of the simulated and collected data as well as the physical meaning of the estimated properties for each experiment the estimated parameters of the models are presented in tables in which the parameters corresponding to the selected best fitting model are written in bold characters finally in order to have an independent estimate of the standard transmissivity t model1 the transmissivity value estimated by interpreting the end of the recovery with theis method kruseman and de ridder 1990 is also provided since our models are based on unit thickness aquifer representations for model1 as explained in appendix c the estimated hydraulic conductivity values of model1 are equivalent to transmissivity values and will be directly compared to the transmissivity estimated with theis method the quality of the best fitting models is also tested by estimating the drawdown in borehole ba1b for which as mentioned before no response is observed during the pumping tests the simulated values range from 0 to 36 07 cm showing in the latter case the impact of heterogeneities in hydraulic properties between the boreholes 3 experimental data and interpretation 3 1 cross borehole pumping tests 3 1 1 pumping test in borehole ba1a fig 4 displays the data collected during the pumping experiment exp1a in the pumped and observation boreholes black curve in figs 4a and b respectively in these figures h is the difference in hydraulic head expressed in meter of water between the beginning of the experiment t 0 and time t for technical reasons h was not monitored in the pumped well during the recovery period fig 4a fig 4c shows the pumping flow rate monitored during the experiment black curve which was applied for 551 min with an average value of 44 9 l min and the flow rate modeled with an exponential model red dashed curve the exponential model is required for interpreting some of the experiments for which the flow rate decreases noticeably for this pumping test the flow rate could have been considered rightly as constant but we applied the exponential model for matter of consistency for this pumping test no common model reproducing the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes could be found the models and parameters evaluated for each of the boreholes are given in table 3 note that in this table and in the rest of the manuscript the values of the skin factor œÉ w and aquifer specific storage s s that are estimated from the pumped borehole data are not shown because of their poor reliability kruseman and de ridder 1990 however the variations of the skin factor estimated from the pumped borehole data are presented graphically because their irregular variations reveal clogging unclogging phenomena concerning the data collected in the pumped borehole model1 and model2 provide an acceptable fit which could not be improved with the leakage properties that are considered in model3 and model4 fig 4a for model1 it is important to emphasize that additional simulations not shown demonstrate that œÉ w remains negative for s s 1 m 1 which indicates the presence of open fractures that intersect the well ahmed and meehan 2011 the presence of channelized flow in a fracture network is also indicated by the flow dimension smaller than 2 for model2 le borgne et al 2004 audouin et al 2008 verbov≈°ek 2009 from the results presented in fig 4a and table 3 this model is considered as the best fitting model for the data collected in the pumped borehole because it is the simplest model providing the best fit to the data with the most realistic estimated parameters different results are observed for the data collected in the observation borehole the transmissivity value estimated with model1 is consistent with that of the standard theis method which is equal to 1 27 10 4 m2 s this being said model2 model3 and model4 equally improve the fit between the simulated and collected data in comparison with model1 fig 4b in this case model2 is considered as the best fitting model because it is the simplest model in comparison with model4 with the most realistic estimated value of œÉ w in comparison with the large value of œÉ w estimated with model3 and shown in table 3 finally we wish to emphasize that defining a model for each borehole presents the advantage of providing heterogeneous hydraulic properties between the pumped and observation boreholes however this implies that some estimated parameters are weakly reliable and must be interpreted with caution this is the case for the skin factor œÉ w that is estimated from the adjustment done on the data collected in the observation borehole but is formally related to mechanisms occurring in the pumped borehole 3 1 2 pumping test in borehole ba1d in experiment exp1d the pumping was applied in borehole ba1d for 355 min and the flow rate decreased from 26 7 to 24 1 l min fig 5 c the collected data and the corresponding acceptable models are shown in fig 5 and table 4 as for exp1a a common model reproducing the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes could not be found concerning the data collected in the pumped borehole fig 5a model1 and model3 provide an acceptable fit and the transmissivity value estimated with model1 is consistent with that of theis method which is equal to 2 15 10 5 m2 s the best fit is obtained with model3 whereas model2 does not provide an acceptable fit and model4 does not improve the results obtained with model3 these results show the importance of leakage processes for reproducing the data observed in borehole ba1d as well as the presence of open fractures that intersect the well n 2 and œÉ w 0 for s s 3 10 2 m 1 from additional simulations regarding the data collected in the observation borehole we obtain a correct fit with all the models whereas interpreting the end of the recovery with theis s method is not possible because the recovery is not developed enough model3 is considered as the best fitting model because the large values of skin factor in model1 and model2 are not realistic and model4 does not improve the results 3 2 multi level pumping tests 3 2 1 pumping tests in borehole ba1a the multi level pumping experiments conducted in borehole ba1a lead to the data and models shown in fig 6 and table 5 for experiment exp2a i1a and fig 7 and table 6 for experiment exp2a i2a no results are presented for experiment exp2a i3a because it was not possible to pump in the considered interval 133 400 m in this case we estimate that the transmissivity of this zone is smaller than 7 10 8 m2 s which is the smallest transmissivity in which we could pump with that pumping equipment in experiment exp2a i1a a multiple step pumping flow rate is applied fig 6c the data collected in the pumped fig 6a and observation fig 6b wells are interpreted by dividing the pumping flow rate data into 5 sub steps in order to account as thinly as possible for the flow rate variations and are modeled by considering flow rate dependent values of the skin factor œÉ w fig 6d note that the flow rate dependence of the skin factor has been observed and studied in previous work in particular in step drawdown tests jacob 1947 rorabaugh 1953 van everdingen 1953 kruseman and de ridder 1990 furthermore the model parameters provided in table 5 are characteristic of flow in fractured media with œÉ w 0 when n 2 for model1 and model3 and n 1 for model2 and model4 the flow dimension of model2 and model4 indicates the presence of a channel or several independent channels that dominate the flow the high values of œÉ w estimated with these models show either i clogging of the channel that intersects the pumping well or ii the channel does not intersect the pumping well and hydraulic connection occurs through permeable porous media or fissures note that the high values of œÉ w can be explained by the fact that the interpretation of the skin factor with the generalized radial flow model is not explicit when n 2 because the pumping chamber geometry of the model does not correspond to its real geometry the difference between these two geometries impacts the value of the skin factor which could explain why high values of the skin factor can be found for low flow dimension hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 model2 is selected as the most realistic model because i it provides a much better fit with the collected data than model1 with an almost linear increase of the skin factor and ii model3 and model4 do not improve the results obtained with model2 the transmissivity values estimated with theis method are 5 times greater than those obtained for the pumped and observation boreholes with model1 which is explained by the inadequacy of model1 for experiment exp2a i2a a common model reproducing the data collected in the pumped and observation boreholes could not be found the results presented in fig 7 and table 6 show that the fit to the data that is obtained with model1 can be improved with model3 whereas model2 and model4 do not improve these results the transmissivity values estimated with theis s method are equal to 1 06 10 5 m2 s and 3 94 10 5 m2 s for the pumped and observation boreholes respectively corresponding to larger and smaller values respectively than that obtained with model1 3 2 2 pumping tests in borehole ba1d the data and models related to the multi level pumping tests conducted in borehole ba1d are shown in fig 8 and table 7 for experiment exp2d i1d fig 9 and table 8 for experiment exp2d i2d and fig 10 and table 9 for experiment exp2d i3d for experiments exp2d i1d and exp2d i2d a common model could not be found to reproduce the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes implying that the models are defined for each borehole for experiment exp2d i3d no response was observed in the observation borehole implying that the models are only defined for the pumped borehole concerning experiment exp2d i1d the results reported in fig 8a and table 7 show that model1 and model2 do not provide an acceptable fit of the recovery data recorded in the pumped borehole whereas model3 and model4 fit well the data the best fitting model model4 corresponds to a non cylindrical flow that is dominated by a channel n 1 with important leakage b 2 92 additional simulations show that œÉ w 0 when s s 2 10 1 m 1 which indicates the presence of open fractures that intersect the well similar results are observed for the data collected in the observation borehole since the fit obtained with model1 could not be improved with model2 whereas model3 and model4 fit well the data the best fit being obtained with model4 fig 8b in this case œÉ w has no effect on the results œÉ w 0 implying that the estimated values of k s s and s s are reliable the high values of s s being characteristic of semi confined aquifers finally the hydraulic conductivity values estimated with model1 are consistent with the transmissivity values obtained using theis method which give 5 53 10 6 and 1 37 10 4 m2 s for the pumped and observation well respectively when studying the interval 102 132 m experiment exp2d i2d we consider the four step pumping flow rate presented in fig 9c fig 9a shows that model1 and model2 do not fit the recovery whereas model3 and model4 provide a perfect fit to the data collected in the pumped borehole resulting in considering the simplest model i e model3 as the best fitting model for the data collected in the observation borehole all models provide an acceptable fit to the data implying that the simplest model i e model1 is considered as the best fitting model in the case of the pumped borehole models the decrease in the slope of œÉ w versus q when q 1 79 l min fig 9d is characteristic of unclogging phenomena while the good fit between the collected and simulated data suggests that these phenomena are localized in the borehole skin additional analyses point out that œÉ w is negative only when s s is smaller than 1 9 10 5 m 1 which indicates the absence of fractures that intersect the wells with apertures larger than in the formation because of the low permeability of the interval 133 400 m experiment exp2d i3d very small flow rates were applied when studying this zone fig 10b during this experiment no response was recorded in the observation borehole ba1a and the small flow rates were difficult to apply and maintain resulting in irregular initial flow rates in this case the response recorded in the pumped borehole is interpreted by dividing the pumping flow rate data into 9 sub steps the results shown in fig 10a and table 9 are obtained by using as before a step wise exponential model to reproduce the pumping flow rate in model1 model2 model3 and model4 dashed red curve in fig 10b in order to demonstrate the importance of this exponential model we also show the results obtained with model3 which considers a step wise constant pumping flow rate dash dot blue curve in fig 10b these results show that model1 does not provide an acceptable fit to the data because namely of an important increase in the drawdown at the beginning of the last pumped steps attempt to reduce these peaks leads to models with unrealistic values of the wellbore storage coefficient not shown on the contrary these peaks are eliminated with model2 model3 and model4 model3 being the best fitting model the transmissivity value estimated with model1 is consistent with that of the standard theis method which is equal to 6 71 10 8 m2 s furthermore fig 10c shows that increasing q from 0 079 to 0 267 l min with model1 model2 model3 and model4 results in decreasing œÉ w this behavior is characteristic of the occurrence of an unclogging phenomenon on the contrary when using model3 this skin factor behavior is not observed not shown and a large discrepancy is observed during the recovery between the simulated and collected data dotted balck curve in fig 10a demonstrating the importance of using a step wise exponential model for representing the pumping flow rate 3 3 cross borehole multi level monitoring pumping experiment in experiment exp3d a pumping flow rate of 20 17 l min was applied during 338 min in borehole ba1d while monitoring the pressure in the intervals i 1 a 22 107 m i 2 a 108 132 m and i 3 a 133 400 m in borehole ba1a fig 11 here the data cannot be interpreted with the models presented before because the flow rate applied to each interval is not known the data collected during this experiment are rather used to confirm and complete the information previously obtained on the connections between the pumped and observation boreholes as well as between various intervals of these boreholes from the data reported in fig 11 we determine that the reaction times of intervals i 1 a i 2 a and i 3 a are 4 1 and 9 min respectively these observations can be related to the results presented in section 3 2 1 where the multi level pumping tests conducted in borehole ba1a are interpreted with various models using model1 leads to show that i the diffusivity estimated in interval i 1 a is smaller than that of interval i 2 a since k s s 2 12 10 2 m2 s in exp2a i1a and 2 16 10 1 pumping borehole and 2 32 10 1 m2 s observation borehole in exp2a i2a and ii the transmissivity of i 3 a is below the capability of our pumping equipment since it was not possible to pump in exp2a i3a considering that interval i 1 a is included into i 1 a the reaction times defined from experiment exp3d are consistent with the results from experiments exp2a the reaction of interval i 3 a reported in fig 11 also indicates that there is a connection between this interval and borehole ba1d whereas the results of exp2d i3d show that this interval is not hydraulically connected to interval i 3 d of borehole ba1d this demonstrates that interval i 3 a is connected to borehole ba1d through non horizontal flow this is consistent with the leakage models of experiments exp2d i2d and exp2d i3d which result in the presence of vertical flow between intervals i 2 d and i 3 d 4 discussion the parameters inferred from modelling the pumped well drawdown reveal the hydraulic properties in the vicinity of the pumping well conversely those evaluated from the observation well data are effective parameters integrating all the hydraulic structures from surface to depth including local draining zones nevertheless the parameters evaluated at the observation well when different from those inferred at the pumping well enlighten the heterogeneity and probable anisotropy of the studied system fig 12 summarizes the main conclusions that are obtained from the non unique models presented in section 3 including the open borehole tests exp1a and exp1d and the cross borehole multi level hydraulic experiments exp2a and exp2d interpreting the open borehole tests exp1a and exp1d with model1 leads to a transmissivity of ba1d one order of magnitude lower than that of ba1a with leakage in the former case these results which are a first indication of the horizontal and vertical heterogeneities that characterize the system are consistent with the open borehole experiments in dewandel et al 2005 that could be interpreted with n 2 furthermore in the case of exp1d the need for considering important leakage processes can be related to the presence of an overlying aquifer zone located above ba1d casing base depth in the alluvium fig a 16 at which a productive interval 26 27 m is detected by the flowmeter fig a 14c concerning the cross borehole multi level hydraulic experiments exp2a and exp2d the presented results emphasize the strong variability of the hydraulic properties induced by the heterogeneities of the geological structures for the upper part of the system i e intervals i 1 a and i 1 d located between 41 and 75 m results indicate the presence of highly conductive fractures n 2 in exp2a i1a and exp2d i1d with different behaviors depending on the considered pumped borehole when pumping in borehole ba1a exp2a i1a a unique model with n 1 is found to interpret the data collected in both boreholes this shows that the hydraulic responses of ba1a and ba1d are driven by a highly conductive channelized structure n 1 for example an extended open or partially mineralized fracture within which a 1d channel is developed the two boreholes do not necessarily intersect the channel they can be connected to it by a conduct in which the flow rate becomes rapidly permanent on the contrary when pumping in ba1d exp2a i1d two different leakage models are required to describe the data collected in the boreholes with an increase in the hydraulic conductivity and flow dimension from the pumped to the observation borehole model in this case the need for leakage models with high values of the leakages for the pumped borehole model as well as the heterogeneities in properties between the boreholes with n 1 for the observation borehole model show that the hydraulic responses are only partially determined by the highly conductive channelized structure previously described that is the water pumped in the upper tested interval of ba1d comes from the highly conductive channelized structure previously described that connect the upper intervals of the considered boreholes horizontal connections but also from underlying and overlying rocks surrounding ba1d vertical connections thus additional vertical flow contributions are present when pumping in ba1d whereas the horizontal connections are sufficient for the pumping in ba1a with similar pumping flow rates concerning the middle part of the system i e intervals i 2 a and i 2 d located between 102 and 132 m the value of the estimated flow dimension n 2 for the pumped and observation boreholes in exp2a i2a and exp2d i2d shows that the observed hydraulic responses are not determined by the presence of conductive structures with channelized flow as for the upper part of the system conversely these models are related to leakage properties except for the observation borehole model of exp2d i2d for which a high value of the hydraulic conductivity is obtained k 1 8 10 4 m s this indicates the presence of heterogeneities in the directions of the flows that contribute to the pumping i the pumping in ba1a is supplied by both horizontal and vertical flows that are located around and far from the pumped borehole and ii the pumping in ba1d is supplied by horizontal and vertical flows close to the pumped borehole and only horizontal flows around borehole ba1a this might be related to the location of ba1a for which highly conductive structures of the upper part of the system was detected see above indeed considering that ba1a is surrounded by these structures one can speculate that they contribute to the water pumped in ba1d by flowing from the upper to the middle part of the system through borehole ba1a and flowing horizontally in the middle part of the system from ba1a to ba1d this explains that there is no vertical flow around ba1a when pumping in ba1d and that there is no counterpart behavior observed when pumping in ba1a finally the pumping experiments conducted by isolating the lower part of the system i e intervals i 3 a and i 3 d located between 133 and 400 m also show a potential impact of the localization of the wells regarding the conductive structures of the system whereas it was not possible to pump water from ba1a exp2a i3a because the transmissivity of this layer was too low we observe a different behavior in ba1d for which the data collected in the pumped borehole are well described with a leakage model exp2d i3d in this case the pumped water is supplied by vertical connections occurring around the pumped borehole which are coming from the middle part of the system that is located directly above the considered area i e without intermediary poorly permeable zones and connected to the upper highly transmissive part of the system through ba1a the differences between exp2a i3a and exp2d i3d can be explained by heterogeneities in the vertical hydraulic properties implying that there is no flow exchanges between the middle and lower parts of the system in the former case whereas these exchanges occur in the latter 5 conclusions the cross borehole multi level hydraulic experiments presented in section 3 show a complex behavior of the ophiolitic hard rock aquifer located within the ba1 site of the sultanate of oman the discussion provided in section 4 explains this behavior by the presence of highly transmissive structures in the upper part of the system and different locations of the boreholes into these structures resulting in strong geological and hydraulic heterogeneities in all directions within a 15 m area this study reveals degrees of heterogeneities going from 1d channelized flows sparsely connected to far field resources to 2d standard systems supplied by nearby surrounding zones the characterization previously described required to conduct hydraulic tests in zones with variable permeability going from highly to poorly conductive areas in the latter case pumping at very small flow rates smaller than 1 l min is a technical challenge for which decreasing flow rates cannot be avoided whereas this behavior has never been considered in the data interpretation of existing studies we developed models that are able to take into account this feature and we show that this characteristic of the pumping flow rate is critical for interpreting the experiments the experiment interpretation was done using four transient radial solutions relying on various assumptions going from cylindrical flow without leakage to generalized radial flow with leakage we believe that the data analysis methodology and the parameter estimation strategy developed for this work should be useful for interpreting other pumping experiments specifically in low permeability heterogeneous systems and when vertical leakages are important in addition the efficiency of these semi analytical models makes them an ideal tool for conducting parametric sensitivity analysis and inverting experimental data in the context of complex parameter sets the use of fractional flow models is justified in this work by direct geological observations and the need to consider vertical leakages and confirmed by the satisfying curve fitting and coherent parameter and property estimates despite the fractured nature of ophiolitic aquifers the adequacy of the dual permeability concept for describing these systems is an open question in particular because there is no evidence of large scale fractures embedded into a poorly permeable matrix as observed for granitic systems the doubt about a potential dual permeability behavior of ophiolitic aquifers requires to integrate vertical leakages in such models and to collect additional data such as breakthrough curves from chemical tracer experiments future work for the site considered in this study will focus on this characterization method with the objective of improving our ability to characterize ophiolitic aquifers and understanding their behavior notations s s aquifer specific storage m 1 k hydraulic

u s nsf grant nsf ear 1516300 to columbia university new york appendix a additional data vertical heterogeneities of boreholes ba1a and ba1d were investigated by measuring the temperature profiles in the boreholes fig a 13 and conducting flowmeter tests under ambient and forced hydraulic conditions fig a 14 the temperature profiles are obtained with the multi parameter probe alt ql40 ocean which allows measuring temperature between 0 and 50 c and the flowmeter data are obtained with the heat pulse flowmeter mount sopris hfp 2293 which allows measuring flow rates between 0 1 to 4 l min the data obtained under forced hydraulic conditions were collected while pumping at a flow rate of 18 12 and 4 47 l min in boreholes ba1a and ba1d respectively the full temperature profiles show temperature anomalies for both boreholes above 61 m fig a 13a and their enlargement between 115 and 155 m shows a temperature anomaly at depth 130 131 m in borehole ba1a fig a 13b from the flowmeter data collected in borehole ba1a we observe changes in the vertical flow rates at depth 22 29 m in fig a 14a and at depth 33 39 45 46 and 58 59 m in fig a 14b finally the flowmeter data collected in borehole ba1d and displayed in fig a 14c show changes in the vertical flow rates at depth 26 27 62 64 and 105 130 m these conductive zones are reported in table a 10 with the corresponding intervals that are considered for the packer experiments in order to characterize these zones the isolated intervals are chosen such that they include the conductive zones and they are located at comparable positions for both boreholes while conducting the packer experiments the pressure changes above and below the isolated intervals are monitored these pressures denoted p 1 below and p 3 above are reported in fig a 15 for experiments exp2a i1a exp2a i2a exp2d i1d and exp2d i2d the pressures are not shown for experiments exp2a i3a since the pumping could not be applied and exp2d i3d because p 1 is not recorded for the interval located at the bottom of the borehole and p 3 displays changes smaller than 0 06 mh2o in this case as additional information we also wish to provide the lithostratigraphy in boreholes ba1a and ba1d that is shown in fig a 16 these lithological logs were obtained during drilling by describing drill cuttings for every meter drilled the main bedrock lithologies are dunite and harzburgite whereas gabbro is a minor rock type that forms centimeter to decimeter thick dikes the alluvium on top of the bedrock is relatively thin with a thickness between 18 and 25 m followed by a relatively thick zone of dunites to a depth of 160 ba1a and 250 m ba1d below surface respectively harzburgite is present in the deeper part of both holes both the dunite and harzburgite are highly altered with serpentine lizardite and chrysotile and brucite being the dominant alteration minerals kelemen et al 2020 all conductive zones detected by flowmeter logging are within the upper dunite section of the boreholes appendix b general model we wish here to formulate a model with non integral flow dimension vertical leakage and transient pumping flow rates to this end we started from the analytical solution for transient radial flow in a fractal fractured aquifer with leakance presented in hamm and bidaux 1994 which combines the generalized radial flow model barker 1988 with leakance hantush 1956 and extend it to time dependent pumping flow rates and non linear skin effects let us consider the equations governing the drawdowns h r t m in the aquifer and h

by a flow pulse q beginning at time zero appendix c interpretation method the pumping experiments are analyzed by estimating the hydraulic parameters that give the best fit between the data collected and several analytical models these models rely on the analytical solution presented in appendix b and are used to evaluate the properties and reveal the active processes that control the hydraulic responses of the studied system as well as the flow geometry described by the flow dimension n barker 1988 with these denitions we consider the four following models i the reference cylindrical flow model without leakage model1 corresponding to solution b 3 with n 2 and 1 b 2 0 ii the generalized radial flow model without leakage model2 corresponding to solution b 3 with 1 n 3 n 2 and 1 b 2 0 iii the cylindrical flow model with leakage model3 corresponding to solution b 3 with n 2 and and 1 b 2 0 and iv the generalized radial flow model with leakage model4 corresponding to solution b 3 without restrictions except the cases n 2 and 1 b 2 0 which correspond to the previous domains for all these models the following assumptions and statements are considered i the ortho radial extent b in b 3 is set such that the exchange area between the pumped borehole and the aquifer is constant and equal to that for n 2 and b 1 m knowing that b corresponds to the unknown aquifer thickness in this case ii the correction of head data for regional trend associated with transient head changes is assumed to be not necessary because the long term monitoring performed during the year preceding the tests shows negligible variations at the scale of the tests decrease smaller than 0 07 mm h iii the wellbore storage coefficient is apriori set to 10 12 m2 for the packer tests which corresponds to a negligible pumping chamber deformation while it is apriori set to the free surface area of the pumping well for open borehole pumping tests iv the flowrate is assumed to be either constant or exponentially decreasing during each pump step the parameter estimation is done by considering that i the wellbore storage coefficient s w and the skin factor œÉ w mostly impact the drawdown data collected in the pumped borehole such that s w is evaluated by fitting the shape of the beginning of the corresponding curve and œÉ w the amplitude of this curve and ii the aquifer diffusivity value k s s hydraulic conductivity k and leakage factor b are evaluated by fitting the response delay of the observation well the slopes of the drawdown curves collected in the pumped and observation wells and the amplitude of these curves respectively when a common model reproducing the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes cannot be found we define a model for each borehole resulting in estimated properties and parameters associated with each borehole these estimations are systematically performed with the following procedure until obtaining a satisfying fit between the collected data and the considered model first the standard cylindrical flow model without leakage model1 is considered and the resulting hydraulic property values are used for tests comparison then other flow geometries without leakage are explored model2 and finally the impact of leakage is analyzed with cylindrical flow model3 and generalized radial flow model4 the best fit that is obtained manually is verified and improved if needed with an automatic fitting tool this tool which relies on the gradient algorithm with random multistart method is used to solve the corresponding least square problem with weights applied to critical parts of the head data in particular additional weights are applied on the beginning of the drawdown curve in the observation well the end of the drawdown and recovery curves in both the pumped and observation wells as well as the end of the drawdown steps when considering step by step flow rates the beginning of the drawdown curve in the observation well is carefully fitted because it allows to adjust accurately the diffusivity value finally we also provide the transmissivity values estimated from theis solution with the standard recovery interpretation method kruseman and de ridder 1990 when the conditions ensuring the reliability of this solution hold these conditions which correspond to constant pumping flow rate negligible wellbore storage and skin effects and validity of the logaritmic jacob s approximation are fulfilled by working on the end of well developed recovery curves note that the wellbore storage effect is negligible for packer tests and that theis s solution is a restriction of model1 to a constant flowrate with no pumping well storage and no skin effect 
5241,ophiolitic formations play a critical role in the groundwater resource of numerous countries and areas previous studies show that the structural heterogeneities of these rocks coming from the presence of both different lithological units and multi scale discontinuities result in complex hydrogeological features that are not well characterized yet in particular there is a need for understanding how these heterogeneities impact the hydrodynamic properties of ophiolitic aquifers and the highly variable chemical composition of the water to this end we conduct various kinds of pumping experiments between two boreholes 15 m apart in the ophiolitic formation of the batin ba1 site in the wadi tayin massif of the sultanate of oman cross borehole open pumping experiments as well as multi level pumping and monitoring hydraulic tests are performed in conductive zones that were identified from temperature and flowmeter data but also in low permeability zones requiring to manage very low pumping flow rates the collected data are interpreted with a model implementing non integral flow dimension leakage and time dependent pumping flow rates the considered modeling concepts and the estimated hydrogeological properties show that the multi directional structural heterogeneities of ophiolitic aquifers are key features that must be considered in future hydrogeological models because they drive the hydraulic responses of these systems keywords ophiolitic aquifer cross borehole hydraulic test multi level packer pumping experiment heterogeneous hydrosystems hydraulic property estimation variable flow rate model 1 introduction ophiolitic rocks are fragments of oceanic crust and upper mantle which are widespread on the surface of continents along tectonic suture zones e g abbate et al 1985 barker et al 2005 maury and balaji 2014 segadelli et al 2017 vacquand et al 2018 jeanpert et al 2019 these rocks extend from the alps to the himalayas through for instance cyprus syria and oman and are also present in various countries such as cuba usa papua new guinea new caledonia and newfoundland abbate et al 1985 ophiolites are important groundwater resources in some areas e g within the northern apennines segadelli et al 2017 and in cyprus barker et al 2005 in oman ophiolite water was a key resource for the population that started in 3000 bc nowadays the main fresh water supply in the towns bordering the oman gulf including muscat comes from sea water desalinisation but ophiolites still provide the only source of water for agriculture including dates growing which is often the main income for villagers in several inland areas where people built underground galleries called aflaj plural of falaj for irrigation since 5000 years villages developed close to the often intermittent rivers wadis that form from the ophiolite water sources often occurring at the peridotite gabbro interface the former forming the low permeability reservoir while the latter fractured and often altered draining the ophiolite massif water toward sources dewandel et al 2004 in a general manner ophiolites may impact strongly the chemical composition of the water e g in western serbia nikic et al 2013 and oman paukert vankeuren et al 2019 because of the high reactivity of the rock forming minerals which makes some water sources unsuitable for human use ophiolites are composed of rocks such as basalt dolerite gabbro and peridotite implying that they are characterized by the coexistence of different lithological units which can be fractured at many scales due to cooling and multiple chemical alteration mechanisms the presence of structural discontinuities that control the permeability of these systems results in some similarities with the well known and widely studied fractured granitic rock aquifers however these similarities in terms of fracturation do not result in similar overall systems since the submarine conditions of formation of ophiolitic rocks and weathering after exhumation lead to complex hydrogeological properties that are not well characterized yet e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 jeanpert et al 2019 for instance at meter to tens of meters scales far from faults hydraulic discontinuities in peridotites are often zones concentrating high density of fissures whereas granite systems are usually homogeneous poorly permeable matrix hosting pluri meter scale often sparsely distributed discrete fractures the few studies conducted on ophiolitic aquifers show that the structural heterogeneities of these systems resulting from the presence of both different lithological units and multi scale hydraulic discontinuities from fissure zones to kilometer scale faults control their inherent behavior under ambient conditions and their responses to forced conditions as a result the hydrogeological models that are built to understand and reproduce the hydrodynamic of these aquifers are based on the coexistence of various recharge and transmissivity zones which hydraulic properties depend on the lithological units and discontinuities that are associated with the zones e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 segadelli et al 2017 these properties are estimated from different characterization techniques including hydrograph analysis mercury porosity and hydraulic conductivity laboratory measurements as well as pumping tests e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 jeanpert et al 2019 the large variety of existing techniques and possible configurations that are associated with pumping experiments makes it a very useful tool for characterizing the subsurface hydraulic properties conducting these experiments in open boreholes or using single or dual packers that are moved along the boreholes provide vertically integrated or vertically distributed hydraulic properties respectively the resulting changes in pressure are monitored in either the pumped well i e single borehole experiments or observation wells i e cross borehole experiments which impacts the spatial extent and meaning of the estimated properties e g bear 1979 le borgne et al 2007 day lewis et al 2011 that being said the quality of these estimates depends on the models that are used to interpret the collected hydraulic data the line source analytical solutions e g theis solution which are widely used because they are easy to implement are well suited for interpreting the intermediate and late time responses that are collected while applying steady pumping flow rates however the assumption of a negligible effect of the pumped borehole storage might be critical when interpreting early time data related to transient pumping flow rates using more sophisticated solutions which take into account the wellbore storage effect the flow dimension related to the structural heterogeneities and the occurrence of leakage effects leads to better estimates of the hydraulic properties of the studied systems in particular when focusing on heterogeneous systems and time dependent pumping flow rates e g lods and gouze 2004 cihan et al 2011 yeh and chang 2013 in the context of ophiolitic aquifers only a few studies considered pumping tests for characterizing these hydrosystems e g boronina et al 2003 dewandel et al 2005 jeanpert et al 2019 for the kouris catchment in cyprus and the koniambo massif in new caledonia hydraulic conductivity estimates were obtained from single borehole pumping experiments and packer tests respectively that are interpreted with simple analytical solutions boronina et al 2003 jeanpert et al 2019 for the ophiolite hard rock aquifers in oman the interpretation of open cross borehole pumping experiments with a dual porosity or dual permeability model led to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients at various locations dewandel et al 2005 these studies emphasized that the efforts for characterizing ophiolitic aquifers with pumping experiments need to be pushed further by focusing on i conducting multi level pumping experiments i e packer tests in order to obtain vertically distributed estimates of the hydraulic properties ii using sophisticated models for improving the quality of the estimated properties iii combining the complementary information provided by open borehole experiments and packer tests where the packers can be used for multi level pumping and multi level pressure monitoring and iv developing pumping techniques and specific equipment that are adapted to low permeability zones with localized highly permeable structures in this work we address these challenges by conducting and analyzing several kinds of pumping experiments in the ophiolitic batin east site in the wadi tayin massif of the sultanate of oman to this end we start by analyzing open borehole pumping experiments that were conducted in two boreholes positioned 15 m apart and we show that the considered systems cannot be characterized with vertically integrated hydraulic properties in order to infer vertically distributed properties we then consider multi level pumping experiments as well as multi level cross borehole pressure monitoring with intervals defined from temperature and flowmeter data in light of direct geological observations and indirect data analysis we consider non integral flow dimension models with vertical leakage that are used in the context of time dependent pumping flow rates the corresponding results show the complexity of the studied system for which both the lithological units and discontinuities impact the estimated hydraulic properties in different proportions depending on the considered layer in this work we also address the issue of pumping tests in poorly permeable zones by presenting material experimental methods and interpretation procedures especially adapted to this challenge the site and methods are described in section 2 the pumping experiments and their interpretation are discussed in section 3 and the results and general conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 2 site and methods 2 1 site description the international continental scientific drilling program icdp oman

fig 3 displays the schematic representation of the downhole part of the pumping system it is installed from the surface using a tripod equipped with an electric chain hoist as a succession of individual parts of maximum 3 m length that are assembled at the surface from the bottom to the top the dual packer system includes the lower pressure port p 1 that measures the pressure below the lower packer the lower packer the two packers are 1 m long and can be inflated individually so that one can perform single packer or dual packer pumping test depending on the objectives the pumping

measures the pressure above the upper packer p 3 œÅ g measures the water column length above the upper packer œÅ and g being the fluid density and gravitational acceleration respectively the shut in valve when the packers are inflated the valve is closed due to the weight of all the equipment pump and pipes above it it is opened by pulling the pipe assemblage from the surface with the crane a

static level wtsl the pump grundfos sqe 1 140 the downhole system displayed in fig 3 is installed below the required length of screwed pvc pipes of internal diameter 48 mm the system is linked to the surface by the electrical wire required for powering the downhole pump as well as the data wire used to transmit the multiplexed data from the pressure sensors that also measure temperature and the gas hoses for inflating deflating the packers that are included into a single cable the data including the pressure at the three measurement levels p 1 p 2 and p 3 are recorded at the surface together with the two packer pressures and the water flow rate measured by a flowmeter installed in line at the well head 2 3 experiments and models three kinds of pumping experiments are considered for characterizing the ba1 site presented in section 2 1 with the material and method described in section 2 2 i cross borehole pumping tests are conducted with the pressure being monitored in both open observation and pumped boreholes section 3 1 these experiments are denoted exp1a and exp1d when pumping in boreholes ba1a and ba1d respectively ii multi level pumping tests are conducted by using packers in order to isolate and pump in specific intervals of the pumped borehole while the pressure is monitored between the packers p 2 above the upper packer p 3 and below the lower packer p 1 as well as in the open observation borehole the intervals considered for these experiments were determined from the analysis of profiles of temperature and flowmeter data the latter profile being collected under ambient and forced hydraulic conditions this data are presented in appendix a with the pressures p 1 and p 3 that are monitored below and above the packers whereas pressure p 2 is analyzed in section 3 2 the corresponding experiments are denoted exp2a i1a and exp2a i2a when pumping is performed in the intervals i 1 a 41 65 m and i 2 a 108 132 m of borehole ba1a and exp2d i1d and exp2d i2d when pumping is performed in the intervals i 1 d 45 75 m and i 2 d 102 132 m of borehole ba1d for both boreholes we also consider the zone below 132 m i e 133 400 m denoted i 3 a and i 3 d in order to characterize the low conductivity zone that is located at the bottom of the wells the corresponding experiments are denoted exp2a i3a and exp2d i3d when pumping in borehole ba1a and ba1d respectively iii finally a cross borehole multi level monitoring pumping experiment denoted exp3d section 3 3 was conducted by using the packer system in borehole ba1a while pumping in borehole ba1d with a grundfos sq2 85 pump this test consisted in monitoring the pressure at several isolated positions in the observation borehole while the pressure is also monitored in the open pumped borehole table 1 summarizes the pumping and observation parameters of the experiments by indicating in which borehole and at which position the pumping and monitoring are done full corresponds to open boreholes whereas the numbers indicate the distances in meter from the surface to the top and bottom positions of the packers that are used to consider isolated intervals during all these experiments the pressure was also monitored in borehole ba1b 120 m nnw of ba1a and ba1d in which no response was recorded this is likely due to the low permeability of the corresponding zone as shown by the log data and core analysis of this borehole not shown from a modeling point of view the fractured nature of ophiolitic aquifers leads to consider both dual permeability and non integral flow dimension models the former modeling concept being used in some previous studies dewandel et al 2005 here we focus on the latter conceptual models because of the following reasons i direct surface observations at the scale of the test site showed numerous heterogeneously distributed centimeter to decimeter scale fractures but no large scale hydraulic discontinuities such as fractures that would have suggested the presence of two interconnected systems of distinctly different hydraulic properties and as such should have justified the use of dual permeability models ii the responses recorded above and below the isolated intervals during packer tests with the pressures p 1 and p 3 that are reported in appendix a show the presence of vertical connections that can be modeled as vertical leakages in non integral flow dimension models hamm and bidaux 1994 iii the results obtained in section 3 with non integral flow dimension models are well in agreement with the data and produce realistic estimations of the parameters and properties thus confirming that the use of more complex models such as dual permeability models is not necessary for the considered data dual permeability models involve more parameters and as such more degrees of liberty that generally require making assumptions or using external data such as geophysical or geological data in the absence of such data that would have dictated using dual permeability models the most parameter parsimonious model must be considered as the most probable model providing a fit to the data in order to interpret the data collected during these experiments we implemented a solution for transient radial flow in leaky aquifers with time dependent pumping flow rates using a fractal formalism this representation is adapted to model hierarchical multi scale fractured aquifers where the characteristic length of the heterogeneity is smaller than the volume investigated by the pumping test lods and gouze 2008 we consider the solution that is presented in appendix b which corresponds to an existing solution for transient radial flow in a fractal fractured aquifer with leakance that is extended to time dependent pumping flow rates and non linear skin effects from this solution we derived four specific models corresponding to i cylindrical flow without leakage model1 ii generalized radial flow without leakage model2 iii cylindrical flow with leakage model3 and iv generalized radial flow with leakage model4 the parameters that distinguish these models from each other are summarized in table 2 the derivation of the models the associated assumptions and their use for interpreting the data are given in appendix c the modeling strategy consists in determining the model that best reproduces the values collected in both the pumping and observation boreholes when a common model cannot be found different models and parameters are considered for each borehole we select the best fitting model by considering the quality of the overlap between the curves of the simulated and collected data as well as the physical meaning of the estimated properties for each experiment the estimated parameters of the models are presented in tables in which the parameters corresponding to the selected best fitting model are written in bold characters finally in order to have an independent estimate of the standard transmissivity t model1 the transmissivity value estimated by interpreting the end of the recovery with theis method kruseman and de ridder 1990 is also provided since our models are based on unit thickness aquifer representations for model1 as explained in appendix c the estimated hydraulic conductivity values of model1 are equivalent to transmissivity values and will be directly compared to the transmissivity estimated with theis method the quality of the best fitting models is also tested by estimating the drawdown in borehole ba1b for which as mentioned before no response is observed during the pumping tests the simulated values range from 0 to 36 07 cm showing in the latter case the impact of heterogeneities in hydraulic properties between the boreholes 3 experimental data and interpretation 3 1 cross borehole pumping tests 3 1 1 pumping test in borehole ba1a fig 4 displays the data collected during the pumping experiment exp1a in the pumped and observation boreholes black curve in figs 4a and b respectively in these figures h is the difference in hydraulic head expressed in meter of water between the beginning of the experiment t 0 and time t for technical reasons h was not monitored in the pumped well during the recovery period fig 4a fig 4c shows the pumping flow rate monitored during the experiment black curve which was applied for 551 min with an average value of 44 9 l min and the flow rate modeled with an exponential model red dashed curve the exponential model is required for interpreting some of the experiments for which the flow rate decreases noticeably for this pumping test the flow rate could have been considered rightly as constant but we applied the exponential model for matter of consistency for this pumping test no common model reproducing the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes could be found the models and parameters evaluated for each of the boreholes are given in table 3 note that in this table and in the rest of the manuscript the values of the skin factor œÉ w and aquifer specific storage s s that are estimated from the pumped borehole data are not shown because of their poor reliability kruseman and de ridder 1990 however the variations of the skin factor estimated from the pumped borehole data are presented graphically because their irregular variations reveal clogging unclogging phenomena concerning the data collected in the pumped borehole model1 and model2 provide an acceptable fit which could not be improved with the leakage properties that are considered in model3 and model4 fig 4a for model1 it is important to emphasize that additional simulations not shown demonstrate that œÉ w remains negative for s s 1 m 1 which indicates the presence of open fractures that intersect the well ahmed and meehan 2011 the presence of channelized flow in a fracture network is also indicated by the flow dimension smaller than 2 for model2 le borgne et al 2004 audouin et al 2008 verbov≈°ek 2009 from the results presented in fig 4a and table 3 this model is considered as the best fitting model for the data collected in the pumped borehole because it is the simplest model providing the best fit to the data with the most realistic estimated parameters different results are observed for the data collected in the observation borehole the transmissivity value estimated with model1 is consistent with that of the standard theis method which is equal to 1 27 10 4 m2 s this being said model2 model3 and model4 equally improve the fit between the simulated and collected data in comparison with model1 fig 4b in this case model2 is considered as the best fitting model because it is the simplest model in comparison with model4 with the most realistic estimated value of œÉ w in comparison with the large value of œÉ w estimated with model3 and shown in table 3 finally we wish to emphasize that defining a model for each borehole presents the advantage of providing heterogeneous hydraulic properties between the pumped and observation boreholes however this implies that some estimated parameters are weakly reliable and must be interpreted with caution this is the case for the skin factor œÉ w that is estimated from the adjustment done on the data collected in the observation borehole but is formally related to mechanisms occurring in the pumped borehole 3 1 2 pumping test in borehole ba1d in experiment exp1d the pumping was applied in borehole ba1d for 355 min and the flow rate decreased from 26 7 to 24 1 l min fig 5 c the collected data and the corresponding acceptable models are shown in fig 5 and table 4 as for exp1a a common model reproducing the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes could not be found concerning the data collected in the pumped borehole fig 5a model1 and model3 provide an acceptable fit and the transmissivity value estimated with model1 is consistent with that of theis method which is equal to 2 15 10 5 m2 s the best fit is obtained with model3 whereas model2 does not provide an acceptable fit and model4 does not improve the results obtained with model3 these results show the importance of leakage processes for reproducing the data observed in borehole ba1d as well as the presence of open fractures that intersect the well n 2 and œÉ w 0 for s s 3 10 2 m 1 from additional simulations regarding the data collected in the observation borehole we obtain a correct fit with all the models whereas interpreting the end of the recovery with theis s method is not possible because the recovery is not developed enough model3 is considered as the best fitting model because the large values of skin factor in model1 and model2 are not realistic and model4 does not improve the results 3 2 multi level pumping tests 3 2 1 pumping tests in borehole ba1a the multi level pumping experiments conducted in borehole ba1a lead to the data and models shown in fig 6 and table 5 for experiment exp2a i1a and fig 7 and table 6 for experiment exp2a i2a no results are presented for experiment exp2a i3a because it was not possible to pump in the considered interval 133 400 m in this case we estimate that the transmissivity of this zone is smaller than 7 10 8 m2 s which is the smallest transmissivity in which we could pump with that pumping equipment in experiment exp2a i1a a multiple step pumping flow rate is applied fig 6c the data collected in the pumped fig 6a and observation fig 6b wells are interpreted by dividing the pumping flow rate data into 5 sub steps in order to account as thinly as possible for the flow rate variations and are modeled by considering flow rate dependent values of the skin factor œÉ w fig 6d note that the flow rate dependence of the skin factor has been observed and studied in previous work in particular in step drawdown tests jacob 1947 rorabaugh 1953 van everdingen 1953 kruseman and de ridder 1990 furthermore the model parameters provided in table 5 are characteristic of flow in fractured media with œÉ w 0 when n 2 for model1 and model3 and n 1 for model2 and model4 the flow dimension of model2 and model4 indicates the presence of a channel or several independent channels that dominate the flow the high values of œÉ w estimated with these models show either i clogging of the channel that intersects the pumping well or ii the channel does not intersect the pumping well and hydraulic connection occurs through permeable porous media or fissures note that the high values of œÉ w can be explained by the fact that the interpretation of the skin factor with the generalized radial flow model is not explicit when n 2 because the pumping chamber geometry of the model does not correspond to its real geometry the difference between these two geometries impacts the value of the skin factor which could explain why high values of the skin factor can be found for low flow dimension hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 model2 is selected as the most realistic model because i it provides a much better fit with the collected data than model1 with an almost linear increase of the skin factor and ii model3 and model4 do not improve the results obtained with model2 the transmissivity values estimated with theis method are 5 times greater than those obtained for the pumped and observation boreholes with model1 which is explained by the inadequacy of model1 for experiment exp2a i2a a common model reproducing the data collected in the pumped and observation boreholes could not be found the results presented in fig 7 and table 6 show that the fit to the data that is obtained with model1 can be improved with model3 whereas model2 and model4 do not improve these results the transmissivity values estimated with theis s method are equal to 1 06 10 5 m2 s and 3 94 10 5 m2 s for the pumped and observation boreholes respectively corresponding to larger and smaller values respectively than that obtained with model1 3 2 2 pumping tests in borehole ba1d the data and models related to the multi level pumping tests conducted in borehole ba1d are shown in fig 8 and table 7 for experiment exp2d i1d fig 9 and table 8 for experiment exp2d i2d and fig 10 and table 9 for experiment exp2d i3d for experiments exp2d i1d and exp2d i2d a common model could not be found to reproduce the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes implying that the models are defined for each borehole for experiment exp2d i3d no response was observed in the observation borehole implying that the models are only defined for the pumped borehole concerning experiment exp2d i1d the results reported in fig 8a and table 7 show that model1 and model2 do not provide an acceptable fit of the recovery data recorded in the pumped borehole whereas model3 and model4 fit well the data the best fitting model model4 corresponds to a non cylindrical flow that is dominated by a channel n 1 with important leakage b 2 92 additional simulations show that œÉ w 0 when s s 2 10 1 m 1 which indicates the presence of open fractures that intersect the well similar results are observed for the data collected in the observation borehole since the fit obtained with model1 could not be improved with model2 whereas model3 and model4 fit well the data the best fit being obtained with model4 fig 8b in this case œÉ w has no effect on the results œÉ w 0 implying that the estimated values of k s s and s s are reliable the high values of s s being characteristic of semi confined aquifers finally the hydraulic conductivity values estimated with model1 are consistent with the transmissivity values obtained using theis method which give 5 53 10 6 and 1 37 10 4 m2 s for the pumped and observation well respectively when studying the interval 102 132 m experiment exp2d i2d we consider the four step pumping flow rate presented in fig 9c fig 9a shows that model1 and model2 do not fit the recovery whereas model3 and model4 provide a perfect fit to the data collected in the pumped borehole resulting in considering the simplest model i e model3 as the best fitting model for the data collected in the observation borehole all models provide an acceptable fit to the data implying that the simplest model i e model1 is considered as the best fitting model in the case of the pumped borehole models the decrease in the slope of œÉ w versus q when q 1 79 l min fig 9d is characteristic of unclogging phenomena while the good fit between the collected and simulated data suggests that these phenomena are localized in the borehole skin additional analyses point out that œÉ w is negative only when s s is smaller than 1 9 10 5 m 1 which indicates the absence of fractures that intersect the wells with apertures larger than in the formation because of the low permeability of the interval 133 400 m experiment exp2d i3d very small flow rates were applied when studying this zone fig 10b during this experiment no response was recorded in the observation borehole ba1a and the small flow rates were difficult to apply and maintain resulting in irregular initial flow rates in this case the response recorded in the pumped borehole is interpreted by dividing the pumping flow rate data into 9 sub steps the results shown in fig 10a and table 9 are obtained by using as before a step wise exponential model to reproduce the pumping flow rate in model1 model2 model3 and model4 dashed red curve in fig 10b in order to demonstrate the importance of this exponential model we also show the results obtained with model3 which considers a step wise constant pumping flow rate dash dot blue curve in fig 10b these results show that model1 does not provide an acceptable fit to the data because namely of an important increase in the drawdown at the beginning of the last pumped steps attempt to reduce these peaks leads to models with unrealistic values of the wellbore storage coefficient not shown on the contrary these peaks are eliminated with model2 model3 and model4 model3 being the best fitting model the transmissivity value estimated with model1 is consistent with that of the standard theis method which is equal to 6 71 10 8 m2 s furthermore fig 10c shows that increasing q from 0 079 to 0 267 l min with model1 model2 model3 and model4 results in decreasing œÉ w this behavior is characteristic of the occurrence of an unclogging phenomenon on the contrary when using model3 this skin factor behavior is not observed not shown and a large discrepancy is observed during the recovery between the simulated and collected data dotted balck curve in fig 10a demonstrating the importance of using a step wise exponential model for representing the pumping flow rate 3 3 cross borehole multi level monitoring pumping experiment in experiment exp3d a pumping flow rate of 20 17 l min was applied during 338 min in borehole ba1d while monitoring the pressure in the intervals i 1 a 22 107 m i 2 a 108 132 m and i 3 a 133 400 m in borehole ba1a fig 11 here the data cannot be interpreted with the models presented before because the flow rate applied to each interval is not known the data collected during this experiment are rather used to confirm and complete the information previously obtained on the connections between the pumped and observation boreholes as well as between various intervals of these boreholes from the data reported in fig 11 we determine that the reaction times of intervals i 1 a i 2 a and i 3 a are 4 1 and 9 min respectively these observations can be related to the results presented in section 3 2 1 where the multi level pumping tests conducted in borehole ba1a are interpreted with various models using model1 leads to show that i the diffusivity estimated in interval i 1 a is smaller than that of interval i 2 a since k s s 2 12 10 2 m2 s in exp2a i1a and 2 16 10 1 pumping borehole and 2 32 10 1 m2 s observation borehole in exp2a i2a and ii the transmissivity of i 3 a is below the capability of our pumping equipment since it was not possible to pump in exp2a i3a considering that interval i 1 a is included into i 1 a the reaction times defined from experiment exp3d are consistent with the results from experiments exp2a the reaction of interval i 3 a reported in fig 11 also indicates that there is a connection between this interval and borehole ba1d whereas the results of exp2d i3d show that this interval is not hydraulically connected to interval i 3 d of borehole ba1d this demonstrates that interval i 3 a is connected to borehole ba1d through non horizontal flow this is consistent with the leakage models of experiments exp2d i2d and exp2d i3d which result in the presence of vertical flow between intervals i 2 d and i 3 d 4 discussion the parameters inferred from modelling the pumped well drawdown reveal the hydraulic properties in the vicinity of the pumping well conversely those evaluated from the observation well data are effective parameters integrating all the hydraulic structures from surface to depth including local draining zones nevertheless the parameters evaluated at the observation well when different from those inferred at the pumping well enlighten the heterogeneity and probable anisotropy of the studied system fig 12 summarizes the main conclusions that are obtained from the non unique models presented in section 3 including the open borehole tests exp1a and exp1d and the cross borehole multi level hydraulic experiments exp2a and exp2d interpreting the open borehole tests exp1a and exp1d with model1 leads to a transmissivity of ba1d one order of magnitude lower than that of ba1a with leakage in the former case these results which are a first indication of the horizontal and vertical heterogeneities that characterize the system are consistent with the open borehole experiments in dewandel et al 2005 that could be interpreted with n 2 furthermore in the case of exp1d the need for considering important leakage processes can be related to the presence of an overlying aquifer zone located above ba1d casing base depth in the alluvium fig a 16 at which a productive interval 26 27 m is detected by the flowmeter fig a 14c concerning the cross borehole multi level hydraulic experiments exp2a and exp2d the presented results emphasize the strong variability of the hydraulic properties induced by the heterogeneities of the geological structures for the upper part of the system i e intervals i 1 a and i 1 d located between 41 and 75 m results indicate the presence of highly conductive fractures n 2 in exp2a i1a and exp2d i1d with different behaviors depending on the considered pumped borehole when pumping in borehole ba1a exp2a i1a a unique model with n 1 is found to interpret the data collected in both boreholes this shows that the hydraulic responses of ba1a and ba1d are driven by a highly conductive channelized structure n 1 for example an extended open or partially mineralized fracture within which a 1d channel is developed the two boreholes do not necessarily intersect the channel they can be connected to it by a conduct in which the flow rate becomes rapidly permanent on the contrary when pumping in ba1d exp2a i1d two different leakage models are required to describe the data collected in the boreholes with an increase in the hydraulic conductivity and flow dimension from the pumped to the observation borehole model in this case the need for leakage models with high values of the leakages for the pumped borehole model as well as the heterogeneities in properties between the boreholes with n 1 for the observation borehole model show that the hydraulic responses are only partially determined by the highly conductive channelized structure previously described that is the water pumped in the upper tested interval of ba1d comes from the highly conductive channelized structure previously described that connect the upper intervals of the considered boreholes horizontal connections but also from underlying and overlying rocks surrounding ba1d vertical connections thus additional vertical flow contributions are present when pumping in ba1d whereas the horizontal connections are sufficient for the pumping in ba1a with similar pumping flow rates concerning the middle part of the system i e intervals i 2 a and i 2 d located between 102 and 132 m the value of the estimated flow dimension n 2 for the pumped and observation boreholes in exp2a i2a and exp2d i2d shows that the observed hydraulic responses are not determined by the presence of conductive structures with channelized flow as for the upper part of the system conversely these models are related to leakage properties except for the observation borehole model of exp2d i2d for which a high value of the hydraulic conductivity is obtained k 1 8 10 4 m s this indicates the presence of heterogeneities in the directions of the flows that contribute to the pumping i the pumping in ba1a is supplied by both horizontal and vertical flows that are located around and far from the pumped borehole and ii the pumping in ba1d is supplied by horizontal and vertical flows close to the pumped borehole and only horizontal flows around borehole ba1a this might be related to the location of ba1a for which highly conductive structures of the upper part of the system was detected see above indeed considering that ba1a is surrounded by these structures one can speculate that they contribute to the water pumped in ba1d by flowing from the upper to the middle part of the system through borehole ba1a and flowing horizontally in the middle part of the system from ba1a to ba1d this explains that there is no vertical flow around ba1a when pumping in ba1d and that there is no counterpart behavior observed when pumping in ba1a finally the pumping experiments conducted by isolating the lower part of the system i e intervals i 3 a and i 3 d located between 133 and 400 m also show a potential impact of the localization of the wells regarding the conductive structures of the system whereas it was not possible to pump water from ba1a exp2a i3a because the transmissivity of this layer was too low we observe a different behavior in ba1d for which the data collected in the pumped borehole are well described with a leakage model exp2d i3d in this case the pumped water is supplied by vertical connections occurring around the pumped borehole which are coming from the middle part of the system that is located directly above the considered area i e without intermediary poorly permeable zones and connected to the upper highly transmissive part of the system through ba1a the differences between exp2a i3a and exp2d i3d can be explained by heterogeneities in the vertical hydraulic properties implying that there is no flow exchanges between the middle and lower parts of the system in the former case whereas these exchanges occur in the latter 5 conclusions the cross borehole multi level hydraulic experiments presented in section 3 show a complex behavior of the ophiolitic hard rock aquifer located within the ba1 site of the sultanate of oman the discussion provided in section 4 explains this behavior by the presence of highly transmissive structures in the upper part of the system and different locations of the boreholes into these structures resulting in strong geological and hydraulic heterogeneities in all directions within a 15 m area this study reveals degrees of heterogeneities going from 1d channelized flows sparsely connected to far field resources to 2d standard systems supplied by nearby surrounding zones the characterization previously described required to conduct hydraulic tests in zones with variable permeability going from highly to poorly conductive areas in the latter case pumping at very small flow rates smaller than 1 l min is a technical challenge for which decreasing flow rates cannot be avoided whereas this behavior has never been considered in the data interpretation of existing studies we developed models that are able to take into account this feature and we show that this characteristic of the pumping flow rate is critical for interpreting the experiments the experiment interpretation was done using four transient radial solutions relying on various assumptions going from cylindrical flow without leakage to generalized radial flow with leakage we believe that the data analysis methodology and the parameter estimation strategy developed for this work should be useful for interpreting other pumping experiments specifically in low permeability heterogeneous systems and when vertical leakages are important in addition the efficiency of these semi analytical models makes them an ideal tool for conducting parametric sensitivity analysis and inverting experimental data in the context of complex parameter sets the use of fractional flow models is justified in this work by direct geological observations and the need to consider vertical leakages and confirmed by the satisfying curve fitting and coherent parameter and property estimates despite the fractured nature of ophiolitic aquifers the adequacy of the dual permeability concept for describing these systems is an open question in particular because there is no evidence of large scale fractures embedded into a poorly permeable matrix as observed for granitic systems the doubt about a potential dual permeability behavior of ophiolitic aquifers requires to integrate vertical leakages in such models and to collect additional data such as breakthrough curves from chemical tracer experiments future work for the site considered in this study will focus on this characterization method with the objective of improving our ability to characterize ophiolitic aquifers and understanding their behavior notations s s aquifer specific storage m 1 k hydraulic

u s nsf grant nsf ear 1516300 to columbia university new york appendix a additional data vertical heterogeneities of boreholes ba1a and ba1d were investigated by measuring the temperature profiles in the boreholes fig a 13 and conducting flowmeter tests under ambient and forced hydraulic conditions fig a 14 the temperature profiles are obtained with the multi parameter probe alt ql40 ocean which allows measuring temperature between 0 and 50 c and the flowmeter data are obtained with the heat pulse flowmeter mount sopris hfp 2293 which allows measuring flow rates between 0 1 to 4 l min the data obtained under forced hydraulic conditions were collected while pumping at a flow rate of 18 12 and 4 47 l min in boreholes ba1a and ba1d respectively the full temperature profiles show temperature anomalies for both boreholes above 61 m fig a 13a and their enlargement between 115 and 155 m shows a temperature anomaly at depth 130 131 m in borehole ba1a fig a 13b from the flowmeter data collected in borehole ba1a we observe changes in the vertical flow rates at depth 22 29 m in fig a 14a and at depth 33 39 45 46 and 58 59 m in fig a 14b finally the flowmeter data collected in borehole ba1d and displayed in fig a 14c show changes in the vertical flow rates at depth 26 27 62 64 and 105 130 m these conductive zones are reported in table a 10 with the corresponding intervals that are considered for the packer experiments in order to characterize these zones the isolated intervals are chosen such that they include the conductive zones and they are located at comparable positions for both boreholes while conducting the packer experiments the pressure changes above and below the isolated intervals are monitored these pressures denoted p 1 below and p 3 above are reported in fig a 15 for experiments exp2a i1a exp2a i2a exp2d i1d and exp2d i2d the pressures are not shown for experiments exp2a i3a since the pumping could not be applied and exp2d i3d because p 1 is not recorded for the interval located at the bottom of the borehole and p 3 displays changes smaller than 0 06 mh2o in this case as additional information we also wish to provide the lithostratigraphy in boreholes ba1a and ba1d that is shown in fig a 16 these lithological logs were obtained during drilling by describing drill cuttings for every meter drilled the main bedrock lithologies are dunite and harzburgite whereas gabbro is a minor rock type that forms centimeter to decimeter thick dikes the alluvium on top of the bedrock is relatively thin with a thickness between 18 and 25 m followed by a relatively thick zone of dunites to a depth of 160 ba1a and 250 m ba1d below surface respectively harzburgite is present in the deeper part of both holes both the dunite and harzburgite are highly altered with serpentine lizardite and chrysotile and brucite being the dominant alteration minerals kelemen et al 2020 all conductive zones detected by flowmeter logging are within the upper dunite section of the boreholes appendix b general model we wish here to formulate a model with non integral flow dimension vertical leakage and transient pumping flow rates to this end we started from the analytical solution for transient radial flow in a fractal fractured aquifer with leakance presented in hamm and bidaux 1994 which combines the generalized radial flow model barker 1988 with leakance hantush 1956 and extend it to time dependent pumping flow rates and non linear skin effects let us consider the equations governing the drawdowns h r t m in the aquifer and h

laplace domain as b 3 h h w r ŒΩ k ŒΩ Œ≥ r a and h w q p a as w p a with p the laplace variable q the laplace transform of the pumping flow rate k ŒΩ the modified bessel function of the second kind

by a flow pulse q beginning at time zero appendix c interpretation method the pumping experiments are analyzed by estimating the hydraulic parameters that give the best fit between the data collected and several analytical models these models rely on the analytical solution presented in appendix b and are used to evaluate the properties and reveal the active processes that control the hydraulic responses of the studied system as well as the flow geometry described by the flow dimension n barker 1988 with these denitions we consider the four following models i the reference cylindrical flow model without leakage model1 corresponding to solution b 3 with n 2 and 1 b 2 0 ii the generalized radial flow model without leakage model2 corresponding to solution b 3 with 1 n 3 n 2 and 1 b 2 0 iii the cylindrical flow model with leakage model3 corresponding to solution b 3 with n 2 and and 1 b 2 0 and iv the generalized radial flow model with leakage model4 corresponding to solution b 3 without restrictions except the cases n 2 and 1 b 2 0 which correspond to the previous domains for all these models the following assumptions and statements are considered i the ortho radial extent b in b 3 is set such that the exchange area between the pumped borehole and the aquifer is constant and equal to that for n 2 and b 1 m knowing that b corresponds to the unknown aquifer thickness in this case ii the correction of head data for regional trend associated with transient head changes is assumed to be not necessary because the long term monitoring performed during the year preceding the tests shows negligible variations at the scale of the tests decrease smaller than 0 07 mm h iii the wellbore storage coefficient is apriori set to 10 12 m2 for the packer tests which corresponds to a negligible pumping chamber deformation while it is apriori set to the free surface area of the pumping well for open borehole pumping tests iv the flowrate is assumed to be either constant or exponentially decreasing during each pump step the parameter estimation is done by considering that i the wellbore storage coefficient s w and the skin factor œÉ w mostly impact the drawdown data collected in the pumped borehole such that s w is evaluated by fitting the shape of the beginning of the corresponding curve and œÉ w the amplitude of this curve and ii the aquifer diffusivity value k s s hydraulic conductivity k and leakage factor b are evaluated by fitting the response delay of the observation well the slopes of the drawdown curves collected in the pumped and observation wells and the amplitude of these curves respectively when a common model reproducing the data collected in both the pumped and observation boreholes cannot be found we define a model for each borehole resulting in estimated properties and parameters associated with each borehole these estimations are systematically performed with the following procedure until obtaining a satisfying fit between the collected data and the considered model first the standard cylindrical flow model without leakage model1 is considered and the resulting hydraulic property values are used for tests comparison then other flow geometries without leakage are explored model2 and finally the impact of leakage is analyzed with cylindrical flow model3 and generalized radial flow model4 the best fit that is obtained manually is verified and improved if needed with an automatic fitting tool this tool which relies on the gradient algorithm with random multistart method is used to solve the corresponding least square problem with weights applied to critical parts of the head data in particular additional weights are applied on the beginning of the drawdown curve in the observation well the end of the drawdown and recovery curves in both the pumped and observation wells as well as the end of the drawdown steps when considering step by step flow rates the beginning of the drawdown curve in the observation well is carefully fitted because it allows to adjust accurately the diffusivity value finally we also provide the transmissivity values estimated from theis solution with the standard recovery interpretation method kruseman and de ridder 1990 when the conditions ensuring the reliability of this solution hold these conditions which correspond to constant pumping flow rate negligible wellbore storage and skin effects and validity of the logaritmic jacob s approximation are fulfilled by working on the end of well developed recovery curves note that the wellbore storage effect is negligible for packer tests and that theis s solution is a restriction of model1 to a constant flowrate with no pumping well storage and no skin effect 
5242,climate change will impact every aspect of biophysical systems and society however unlike other components of the climate system the impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently received attention this focus is due to the realization that groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and water security and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change this paper synthesizes findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the entire groundwater system and each component also we appraise the use of coupled groundwater climate and land surface models in groundwater hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate change groundwater interaction finding that most models anticipate decreases in groundwater recharge storage and levels particularly in the arid semi arid tropics reducing uncertainties in future climate projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes underlying models to improve their simulation of real world conditions remain a priority for climate and earth scientists despite the enormous progress made there are still few and inadequate local and regional aquifer studies especially in less developed regions the paper proposes two key considerations first physical basis the need for a deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with the use of more sophisticated models second the need to understand the socioeconomic dimensions of climate groundwater interaction through multidisciplinary synergy leading to the development of better groundwater climate change adaptation strategies and modeling keywords climate change groundwater physical basis socioeconomic dimension models future considerations adaptation modeling 1 introduction groundwater plays a vital role in sustaining ecosystems and ensuring human adaptation to extreme and unexpected global environmental changes particularly as surface water systems become increasingly unsustainable in the face of rapid population growth and climate change groundwater is an important component of the climate system liesch and wunsch 2019 but many potential impacts of climate change remain largely unknown because the climate system is intricate characterized by a web of complex interactions and feedbacks munday et al 2017 in general most studies envisage an intensification of the hydrological cycle creed et al 2015 gloor et al 2013 hegerl et al 2019 stagl et al 2014 trenberth 2014 wu et al 2015 higher temperatures are expected to drive increases in evaporation and evapotranspiration et hegerl et al 2012 lafontaine et al 2015 mundo molina 2015 zhang et al 2016 but a simultaneous increase in humidity and co2 could counteract the effect of temperature and leave et unchanged in a warming climate guo et al 2017 mo et al 2017 snyder 2017 precipitation is projected to increase in amount and intensity in many places while other places are projected to experience drought burke and stott 2017 nissen and ulbrich 2017 also the portion of precipitation falling as snow is likely to decrease fassnacht et al 2016 ipcc 2013 kormos et al 2016 this lesser amount of snow will melt more quickly leading to higher average annual surface runoff wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 especially in temperate climates fig 1 depicts the complex interaction between groundwater and the components of the climate system most prior studies on the potential impact of the changing climate on the hydrological cycle have focused on the surface and visible portion of the cycle precipitation atmospheric water vapor et streamflow snow cover and so on this bias is mainly due to their visibility and accessibility abiy and melesse 2017 pitz 2016 scanlon et al 2012 qualities which make for relative ease of observation measurement and investigation of its component characteristics and interaction until recently there have been fewer studies on climate change groundwater relationships garner et al 2017 haldorsen et al 2016 hu et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 the difficulties involved in probing the nature and characteristics of water below the earth surface in part account for this deficiency in understanding groundwater response to climate change forcing also groundwater is relatively insensitive to seasonal and even decadal climate variability gurdak 2017 wada 2016 providing a complete picture of groundwater response to the changing climate is even more challenging given that the impacts of climate change are often modified by human and indirect agents such as land use change and over exploitation of groundwater however given that groundwater accounts for almost 96 of the earth s unfrozen freshwater taylor et al 2013 wada 2016 and 33 of total water withdrawals worldwide famiglietti 2014 siebert et al 2010 there is growing concern focus and research on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources green et al 2011 kundzewicz and doell 2009 taylor et al 2013 the dearth in groundwater climate change studies was summed up by the ipcc s fourth assessment report which proclaimed that there has been very little research on the impact of climate change on groundwater as well as the question of how climate change will affect the relationship between surface waters and aquifers that are hydraulically connected parry et al 2007 this declaration according to some scholars e g smerdon 2017 was instrumental in driving the massive wave of publications that followed in its wake and thus provided ample material for a more robust report on climate change impact on groundwater by the fifth assessment report this review paper is organized into five sections 1 a review of the global climate change 2 an assessment of the present state of climate change impact on groundwater components 3 a review of groundwater models and climate change induced future groundwater changes 4 groundwater feedbacks to the climate system and 5 key considerations for groundwater climate change research much of the justification for the recent interest in the response of groundwater to climate change is the need for sustainable water use for various human activities particularly in drought prone areas and arid regions and to mitigate against or adapt to any adverse impacts of climate change guermazi et al 2019 kumar 2012 kumar and singh 2011 insufficient information on most of the problems mentioned above nonetheless constitute those evolving grey areas facing the successful implementation of sustainable groundwater governance across different regions of the world this review paper probes the frontiers of groundwater climate change interaction in both the physical processes and its socio economic dimension in order to advance the knowledge of groundwater climate change interaction potential future groundwater component changes were presented together with effective directional consideration for developing groundwater climate change adaptation strategies we present a broad understanding to support global groundwater policy and management by providing clarifications on the recent salient issues surrounding the impact of climate change on the global groundwater system 1 1 methodology we reviewed approximately 1000 papers that dealt with the subject of groundwater and climate change together or separately google scholar the web of science and scopus were the main repositories searched for relevant materials in line with the aims of this project papers that were older than five years were mostly excluded from the list and an emphasis was placed on those linking potential changes in groundwater components to climate change this further narrowed the list to just over 300 peer review papers in addition we sampled some review papers over the last decade 2008 2019 table 1 summarizes their spatial scale thematic focus gaps identified and proposed solutions 1 2 global climate change climate change is no longer a hypothesis ipcc 2013 there is a global consensus among climatologists and other earth scientists that the global climate is changing since the instrumentation period began the earth s climate has undergone unprecedented changes and these changes have been projected to continue well into this century for instance the last four years are the warmest years on record and the ten warmest years are all in the 21st century cheng and zhu 2018 jackson et al 2017 sorokin and mondello 2018 the global average temperature has risen almost 1 c since records began and atmospheric co2 is currently at an all time high of 416 ppm as of april 2020 1 1 atmospheric co2 https www co2 earth accessed may 2019 today climate change has remained on the front burner of world leading studies in environmental science and climatology and it remains topical at national and international levels because of its influence on policy and decision making in socioeconomic domains it is seen as a multidisciplinary subject matter and has attained a universal presence in the academic arena because its impact pervades all of earth s systems there is less agreement however about how much warming will occur in future and what effect it would have on various life forms earth s climate is subject to internal variability within the climate system itself and to external factors which may be natural or anthropogenic however contemporary changes and warming trends have been attributed solely to anthropogenic influences particularly the increased emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs some of which are now said to be unavoidable ipcc 2013 the amount of ghgs has soared considerably since the industrial era warming the atmosphere and earth surface and leading to global warming co2 in particular is a significant ghg and its increasing concentration in the atmosphere has been classically correlated with the steady rise in average global temperatures in the last 150 years wmo 2017 nevertheless there are still uncertainties in how global climate change manifests at local and regional scales and how decadal to seasonal temperature variations and extremes affect the lives of people mcgregor 2018 increasing temperatures have led to the melting and receding of glaciers and ice sheets reinforced by the arctic amplification and the cryospheric positive feedback mechanism duan et al 2019 francis 2017 haine and martin 2017 this melting of ice combined with thermal expansion of the oceans cause average sea level to rise other parts of the climate system such as the hydrological cycle respond to climate change forcing through numerous often intractable feedbacks jayakumar and lee 2017 smyth et al 2017 in all scientific knowledge of climate processes has improved climate models now produce realistic simulations of past and future climate change however many uncertainties still exist in our knowledge about specific microphysical processes and complex interactions that govern the climate system future projections of climate change and alterations to groundwater due to climate change will require sophisticated theoretical models to be more reliable 1 3 climate change and world groundwater an estimated 1 386 billion cubic kilometers of water is present on earth of this total approximately 97 is salt water found in the oceans and only 3 is freshwater most of this freshwater about 69 occur as permanent ice and snow mainly in greenland and antarctica while the remaining 30 is groundwater gleick 1993 water in surface water systems such as rivers lakes streams and swamps hold less than 1 of fresh water if we take the water locked up in the cryosphere out of the equation it would mean that only 1 is usable and 99 of this is groundwater du plessis 2017 liu et al 2011 thus groundwater is a vital source of fresh water not only for diverse human uses but also for sustaining plant and animal ecosystems in terms of human use of groundwater 1 5 3 billion people rely on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water l√≥pez morales and mesa jurado 2017 misra 2014 velis et al 2017 irrigation consumes about 60 70 of groundwater withdrawals globally bhanja et al 2017 zingaro et al 2017 siebert et al 2010 but locally this percentage varies with climate desert countries such as saudi arabia libya and burkina faso expend as much as 90 of groundwater on irrigation in contrast countries with plentiful rainfall use most of their groundwater for household needs since little is needed for irrigation the rapid increase in agricultural groundwater use in the last few decades due to technological advances in pumping techniques has created better livelihoods for farmers and food security for the world s population giordano 2009 industrial groundwater use is also growing in industrialized countries as it accounts for about 40 of water demand in france and japan margat and van der gun 2013 overall groundwater accounts for a quarter of total water withdrawals and 50 of the world s current potable water margat and van der gun 2013 groundwater is therefore crucial for the sustenance of many human and natural systems however there are legitimate concerns and reports of over exploitation of groundwater driven by increasing water demand from rapid urban and industrial development and expansion of irrigated lands gleeson and wada 2013 jia et al 2019 taylor 2014 turner et al 2019 wada and bierkens 2014 the us india and pakistan together accounted for nearly 55 of total world groundwater withdrawals grogan et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2013 in many areas of the world groundwater exploitation is carried out in an unsustainable way omole 2013 srinivasan and lele 2017 with rates of withdrawal exceeding replenishment by recharge these include the major agricultural regions in the western us the middle east india and china shown in fig 2 d√∂ll et al 2012 grogan et al 2017 wada et al 2012a left unabated this current trend of increasing societal dependence on non renewable groundwater will undermine the resilience of human systems to water shortages and threaten ecological systems that depend on them most naturally dry regions with very little precipitation have seasonally or year round surface and groundwater depletion fig 2 however even more rainy regions such as the indian sub continent and the great plains of the us show significant depletion these latter areas indicate places of intense industrial and agricultural water use fig 2 also maps the ratio of mean annual precipitation to groundwater generated rpgw both in 10 9 m3 year for 1988 to 2017 for selected countries countries with large rpgw tend to be located in dry hot climates where the little precipitation is consumed by et and groundwater recharge is severely limited most of the middle east and north africa fall into this class and watersheds in this region suffer seasonal and dry year surface and groundwater depletion the rapid growth in world population and the associated increase in water demand do not proffer a complete explanation for the massive depletion of groundwater storage many studies have established correlations between climate perturbations and groundwater levels asoka et al 2017 de graaf et al 2017 kuss and gurdak 2014 russo and lall 2017 sivarajan et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 van der knaap et al 2015 van engelenburg et al 2018 as global warming and climate change drives more intense and frequent climate extremes precipitation evaporation and surface water will become more variable making groundwater a threatened and yet critical resource in sustaining ecosystems indeed increasing groundwater demand will characterize future scenarios for water resource management and food security gamvroudis et al 2017 mustafa et al 2019 tong et al 2016 zaveri et al 2016 as it is the only viable means of meeting the water needs of rural areas and arid regions lijzen et al 2014 melo and wendland 2017 moutahir et al 2017 wang et al 2015 climate change directly fig 3 affects the totality of the groundwater system da costa et al 2019 jayakumar and lee 2017 groundwater surface water interaction scibek et al 2007 tague et al 2008 groundwater flows groundwater recharge and storage asoka et al 2017 tillman et al 2016 tillman et al 2017 groundwater discharge and groundwater quality gurdak et al 2011 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2011 of these groundwater recharge from precipitation and leakages from influent streams or other surface water systems has received the most attention and is dependent on several hydrogeological factors russo and lall 2017 the impact of climate change on groundwater systems can also be indirect through changes in groundwater abstraction asoka et al 2017 gurdak 2017 whittemore et al 2016 and through changes in land use cover fig 3 stoll et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 climate induced changes in land use involve changes in vegetation type evolving agricultural practices and potential increases in crop evaporative water demand all of which exerts a toll on groundwater alam et al 2019 studies of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater assume one of three spatial scopes global scale analyses assess the worldwide pattern of projected recharge trends and groundwater changes although they provide a quick snapshot of prevailing conditions they are often too generic to guide water policy and decision making that is both viable and beneficial on smaller scales green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 at the opposite end of spatial scope are basin aquifer specific studies that provide a deeper understanding of climate change impacts in a particular river basin or aquifer system regional studies according to meixner et al 2016 are a useful compromise between both scales as these evaluate a group of aquifers within a region with similar or different recharge mechanism 2 climate change and the groundwater system 2 1 recharge climate is the primary factor driving spatiotemporal variability in groundwater recharge and precipitation is the climate element that most directly affects groundwater recharge irrespective of the recharge pathway the significance of climate to groundwater is underscored by the universal use of gcms and precipitation data in predicting future groundwater states and on average wet conditions often result in increased recharge and storage while drought may cause the opposite effect mote et al 2013 fu et al 2019 zhou et al 2010 tillman et al 2016 and mckenna and sala 2018 quantified the projected changes in groundwater recharge in the southwestern united states under future climate scenario and found a net increase in the simulated groundwater recharge mainly due to projected increases in precipitation offsetting a decrease in recharge resulting from projected increased temperatures heavy precipitation may not necessarily lead to increasing recharge if intense et consumes the excess water bellot and chirino 2013 scanlon et al 2005 touhami et al 2013 and in fact bloomfield et al 2019 concluded that groundwater droughts are modulated by changes in evapotranspiration associated with global warming groundwater recharge is also influenced by the intensity of rainfall and not just the amount jayakumar and lee 2017 et may prevent infiltration below the root zone therefore light rainfall is not expected to contribute to groundwater recharge frot et al 2007 taylor et al 2013 tweed et al 2011 in uganda projected recharge estimates under a future climate scenario were found to be extremely sensitive to rainfall intensity mileham et al 2009 in australia rainfall intensity was also found to influence recharge estimation especially diffuse irrigation barron et al 2011 even in karst topography findings bellot and chirino 2013 touhami et al 2013 have shown that precipitation events of less than 15 mm are considered negligible for aquifer recharge while precipitation events equal to or greater than 30 mm produced high enough infiltration to lead to considerable aquifer recharge therefore regions where rainfall intensity is projected to rise may see future recharge increases provided that rainfall intensity is not too high as to exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil and preclude any extra groundwater recharge furthermore the type of precipitation event also affects recharge rates hughes et al 2011 snowmelt is for the most part a more efficient creator of recharge than rainfall all other factors being equal a move from snow to rain could sometimes bring about lower recharge to precipitation proportions earman and dettinger 2011 since more precipitation is expected to fall as rain than snow on a warming earth cold regions may suffer recharge reductions otherwise warmer winter temperatures might reduce the depth of ground frost and increase infiltration into the ground thereby increasing recharge a warmer winter may also lead to earlier and prolonged snowmelt resulting in ample winter recharge but reduced spring and summer recharge jyrkama and sykes 2007 kl√∏ve et al 2014 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2010 sutinen et al 2008 hence while future groundwater recharge will be influenced primarily by rainfall intensity in the tropics a shift in the type of precipitation event from snow to rainfall will be the primary determinant of future recharge in temperate and cold climates understanding groundwater recharge mechanisms are important for evaluating relations between climate change and groundwater recharge the combinatory study of eight aquifers in the western us by meixner et al 2016 led to the development of a uniform recharge classification scheme which identified four different recharge mechanisms diffuse focused mountain system recharge msr and irrigation diffuse recharge occurs through direct infiltration from precipitation that occurs fairly homogeneously over a large area scanlon et al 2002 sililo and tellam 2000 stamm et al 1998 wirmvem et al 2017 focused recharge on the other hand is concentrated recharge resulting from infiltration from ephemeral and perennial water bodies hughes et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 ren et al 2019 especially in areas of heterogeneous subsurface characteristics hartmann et al 2017 msr the main recharge component in arid and semi arid basins involves two related processes mountain front recharge mfr and mountain block recharge mbr mfr is recharge from stream runoff at mountain fronts to the adjacent alluvial aquifer while mbr is recharge through mountain bedrock houston 2002 meixner et al 2016 groundwater recharge by irrigation is excess irrigation water which percolates back to the water table similarly some studies have made distinctions such as localised and indirect recharge lerner 1997 and actual and potential recharge hendrickx and walker 1997 the study by meixner et al 2016 demonstrated that various recharge mechanisms would respond differently to global warming and the sensitivity of a region to climate change depends on the recharge mechanisms at work in a given aquifer system flint et al 2013 ng et al 2010 for the eight aquifers studied diffuse recharge is expected to drop as a result of the cumulative effects of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and et focused recharge is likely to increase due to the projected increase in precipitation intensity in a warmer climate dominguez et al 2012 msr is expected to decrease driven by both reduced winter precipitation and a decline in the proportion of winter precipitation arriving as snow it is noteworthy that considerable uncertainties exist in these future projections as seen in the wide range of estimates of recharge changes table 3 summarizes the findings of selected studies on the predicted future impact of climate change on different groundwater components including recharge although estimates of future recharge changes had considerable uncertainty in all recharge was found to be decreasing in most of the studies in both temperate 54 and tropical 80 climate regions even in the rainy humid tropics the majority of studies still indicate decreasing recharge by the end of this century relative to baseline estimates besides the agency of precipitation climate change may also impact recharge through changes in groundwater use the excessive abstraction of groundwater primarily for irrigation can have a significant effect on groundwater as irrigation accounts for nearly 60 70 of all freshwater extractions and 90 of consumptive uses siebert et al 2010 typically groundwater fed irrigation leads to depletion of groundwater storage but recharge increases and storage replenishments have been observed in areas of extensive irrigation return flows for example in the republican river basin of the high plains aquifer of semi arid us where irrigation has become an important supplier of crop water demand ou et al 2018 predicted that irrigation recharge would increase steadily up to 2100 due to the increase in pumping in regions where irrigation by surface water is dominant irrigation recharge is also expected to rise crosbie et al 2013 hanson et al 2012 but the net effect of excess irrigation is groundwater depletion leng et al 2014 stanton et al 2011 in all the surge in irrigation led abstraction is likely to continue into the future yihdego et al 2017 driven by climate change induced seasonal redistribution of precipitation and increased et kreins et al 2015 with an increasing population and a consequent rise in demand for food as well as greater economic development irrigation led abstraction may even become the most significant mode of climate change impact on groundwater russo and lall 2017 whittemore et al 2016 furthermore land use land cover can modify the effects of precipitation and groundwater use on groundwater recharge many studies have shown significant variation in recharge due to replacing the natural vegetation by arable land or built up surfaces oliveira et al 2017 reduction in leaf area for example through clearing forests for agriculture can increase groundwater recharge even if rainfall decreases slightly owuor et al 2016 in contrast other studies have shown decreases in groundwater recharge from an increase in vegetation density for instance through a change from grassland to woodland oliveira et al 2017 or when it involves rapid urbanization and replacement by built up surfaces in general land use cover change whether temporary vegetation change or permanent urbanization can affect recharge by modifying the water balance evaporation transpiration infiltration and surface runoff processes jyrkama and sykes 2007 kundu et al 2017 these additional influences make it difficult to assess the impacts on groundwater due exclusively to climate change green et al 2011 gurdak 2017 zhou et al 2010 2 2 discharge the movement of water from the subsurface to the surface from an aquifer to a surface water body loss to the atmosphere or withdrawal for human uses represents groundwater discharge green et al 2011 five major processes of groundwater discharge are identifiable in the literature 1 spring flow 2 transpiration by local vegetation 3 evaporation from soil and open water 4 subsurface outflow and 5 withdrawal for various human uses green et al 2011 groundwater fed springs will decrease in discharge going by current forecasts of increasingly arid climate in the southwestern us weissinger et al 2016 the sikkim himalaya tambe et al 2012 and in areas of extensive groundwater development as in niangziguan springs in shanxi china hao et al 2009 zhong et al 2016 a wetter future climate will probably lead to an increase in spring discharge but this is complicated by the many climate elements often at play for example weissinger et al 2016 found an inverse relationship between spring discharge on one hand and potential et and temperature on the other whereas higher winter precipitation led to spring discharge increases cervi et al 2018 corroborate these findings a better understanding of the interrelationship between climate and spring discharge will not only foster realistic projections of future spring discharge changes resulting from climate change but will also guide conservation efforts in spring dependent ecosystems besides spring discharges groundwater discharge is a significant contributor to streamflow especially in times of little precipitation leake and barlow 2013 for summer groundwater discharges into adjacent rivers kurylyk et al 2014b have reported a significant rise in the magnitude of discharge due to projected rises in precipitation and air temperature in new brunswick canada the major indirect impact of climate change extensive groundwater pumping to meet rising water demand for irrigation and other human uses may substantially lower the elevations of the water table and consequently baseflow contributions to streamflow the impacts of groundwater withdrawals can be transmitted to associatedlakes streams and wetlands throughdiminishedrates ofreleasefrom the aquifer to these surface water systems barlow and leake 2012 leake and barlow 2013 solder et al 2016 found evidence of declining groundwater discharge attributable to climate variability and change and to increased water demand further climate change can potentially impact the temperature of groundwater discharges from simulations kurylyk et al 2014b again reported a rise in groundwater discharge temperature of up to 3 6 c in their study area in new brunswick canada certain fish species are mostly dependent on cold groundwater discharges into streams and rivers to buffer them from temperature extremes and regulate their metabolism especially in summer months deitchman and loheide 2009 essaid and caldwell 2017 and hare et al 2017 argue that given this critical thermal conditioning role any future climate change impact on groundwater discharge temperature could endanger these already threatened species the sign of change in groundwater temperature will almost certainly be positive since average global air temperatures are projected to rise and surface air temperatures and subsurface temperatures have a strong positive correlation especially in shallow aquifers with greater thermal sensitivities gunawardhana and kazama 2012 kurylyk et al 2013 2015 therefore the probability of surpassing essential temperature thresholds in groundwater sourced thermal streams may increase considerably under the most extreme future climate scenarios 2 3 flow and storage there is much evidence in the literature that groundwater levels in many aquifers around the world are decreasing major aquifers in arid and semi arid regions fig 2 such as the high plains of the united states dong et al 2019 longuevergne et al 2010 russo and lall 2017 scanlon et al 2012 and northwest india are experiencing rapid groundwater depletion famiglietti 2014 elsewhere in humid environments such as bangladesh shamsudduha et al 2012 and brazil foster et al 2009 a decrease in groundwater storage has also been reported groundwater literature over the last few decades have debated the role of groundwater recharge and pumping on the depletion of groundwater storage it would appear intuitive and logical that when pumping exceeds natural recharge in an aquifer then depletion of aquifer storage occurs and pumping becomes unsustainable however this notion based on some erroneous assumptions spelt out in devlin and sophocleous 2005 has been widely discredited as a water budget myth see bredehoeft 2002 those against this myth argue that natural aquifer recharge is not necessarily a factor affecting sustainable pumping but the water budget myth continues to persist because groundwater represents the largest store of freshwater on earth its depletion will threaten livelihoods and ecological sustainability especially during periods of drought aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 brauman et al 2016 konikow and kendy 2005 storage loss is even deleterious for other reasons first it reduces the depth of the water table thereby increasing the cost of groundwater abstraction from deep boreholes and wells aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 fishman et al 2011 second it reduces groundwater discharge to streams springs rivers and other surface water bodies with attendant effects on the well being of gdes earman and dettinger 2011 giordano 2009 third groundwater depletion has been known to cause land subsidence due to the compaction of soil and open pore spaces that previously held water taniguchi et al 2008 andaryani et al 2019 land subsidence due to groundwater depletion has been found in venice and bologna italy tosi et al 2015 modoni et al 2013 china zhu et al 2015 iran ghazifard et al 2016 the central valley california faunt et al 2016 and elsewhere groundwater storage is comparatively less sensitive to seasonal or even multi year climatic variability pokhrel et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 and reacts slower than surface water to the effects of direct climate driven changes in precipitation and recharge rates in deep aquifer systems an extended period may be required for direct climate driven changes in recharge to be evident as a storagechange on the other hand storageconditions insmalleraquifers with smallerflow pathsare probably the mostvulnerabletodirectchanges instorage in all sudden changes in storage may suggest indirect or human induced depletion rather than direct climate effects or an aggressive combination of both as was found in the central valley region of california where droughts and over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation led to massive storage depletion alam et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 alam et al 2019 found that groundwater storage had been depleting since the middle of the 20th century and climate change will lead to a 31 increase in the rate of groundwater storage loss under rcp4 5 in california s central valley scholars generally employ one of three methods of estimating groundwater depletion 1 the flux based method wada 2016 wada et al 2010 which defines groundwater depletion as an abstraction in excess of recharge 2 the volume based method konikow 2011 and 3 the satellite based method all methods have their flaws and estimates are fraught with uncertainties nonetheless assessing the amount of groundwater present in storage has improved since the launching of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and estimation of changes in groundwater storage at regional scales has been made possible this satellite based method detects changes in total water storage tws by measuring temporal variations in the gravity field the storage changes of groundwater can be evaluated after deducting the remaining tws changes from grace resultant total tws changes tapley et al 2019 wada 2016 the grace satellite data and ground based observations have been used to ascertain the level of storage depletion in many regions of the world e g california central valley scanlon et al 2012 the amazon hu et al 2017 china hao et al 2019 lin et al 2019 and india tiwari et al 2009 however although grace provides near in situ estimates of regional groundwater depletion its coarse spatial resolution 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 precludes the assessment of small aquifers especially in data scarce areas strassberg et al 2007 wada 2016 lin et al 2019 the solution may lie in combining grace data with direct groundwater observation and groundwater modelling as hao et al 2019 has done 2 4 groundwater quality research on climate change impacts on groundwater quality is sparse and predictions are fraught with uncertainty nonetheless two modes of impact on groundwater quality in a changing climate are found in the literature 1 the flushing of chemical compounds into aquifers and 2 over exploitation of coastal aquifers kl√∏ve et al 2014 treidel et al 2011 infiltrating irrigation return flows can flush certain chemical compounds into aquifers thereby impacting groundwater quality merz and lischeid 2019 qin et al 2011 severe rainstorms in lowland areas where rates of land surface loading of contaminants are higher may encourage the downward mobilization of soluble chemicals present in the vadose zone dragoni and sukhija 2008 earman and dettinger 2011 gurdak et al 2007 kl√∏ve et al 2014 this phenomenon is most characteristic of arid and semi arid regions where high evaporation rates increase the content of salt in soils and bottom sediments of surface waters and could play an essential role in the salinization of shallow aquifers bighash and murgulet 2015 schmidt and garland 2012 in mid high latitudes future climate will be marked by warmer winter temperatures and increased snowmelt which may increase pollutant capture and solute leaching in the unsaturated zone thus impacting groundwater quality bloomfield et al 2006 sugita and nakane 2007 also mcgill et al 2019 found that climate change may worsen sanitary conditions in less developed regions resulting in the leaching of human waste from pit latrines into groundwater pulido velazquez et al 2015a have quantified the impact of climate and land use change on groundwater quality related to nitrate concentrations using the mt3dms a three dimensional multi species solute transport model see zheng et al 2012 and swat model the result reveals that nitrate concentration in groundwater increased in almost all the study locations across all the climate scenarios places that have high irrigation and recharge increases tend to increase nitrate concentrations in groundwater poor groundwater quality is a limiting factor for further planned uses such as drinking or irrigation and the long term sustainability of global groundwater resources gurdak et al 2011 mas pla et al 2019 have detailed the environmental economic social and political concerns that arise from nitrate pollution exacerbated by climate change some studies have reported increasing groundwater discharge temperatures e g kurylyk et al 2014b which is expected to rise even further due to climate change gunawardhana and kazama 2011 kurylyk et al 2014a kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 increasing groundwater temperature may alter the hydrogeochemical processes that exert control on the mobility and dissolved concentration of chemical contaminants pitz 2016 and thus influence groundwater quality riedel 2019 h√§hnlein et al 2013 riedel 2019 found that a 1 c increase in groundwater can lead to a 4 decrease in oxygen saturation and a drop of 0 02 in ph value stuart et al 2011 unesco 2008 additionally changes in precipitation and et can affect natural groundwater composition for instance a rise in et following a decline in precipitation may increase geogenic contamination of arsenic and fluoride amanambu 2015 amini et al 2008a amini et al 2008b in contrast places of excessive rainfall can ease the mobilization of geogenic contaminants amanambu 2015 the thermal response of groundwater temperature to climate change in turn affects the thermal regimes of baseflow dominated streams or rivers and their hydraulically connected aquifers menberg et al 2014 also because the temperatures of the surface and subsurface are intertwined groundwater temperature may be inferred from surface temperature beltrami 2001 gunawardhana and kazama 2012 and such linkages can provide more insight into the impact of climate change on the subsurface menberg et al 2014 benz et al 2017 observed a global link between groundwater temperatures and land surface temperature with an average offset of 1 2 1 5 c the highest differences were found in the coldest and warmest areas of the earth they therefore attributed the high offset to et and snow effect in cold regions the impact of climate change on groundwater and soil temperatures is now a significant concern especially as permafrost thaws harden et al 2012 mcguire et al 2012 in any case the indirect anthropogenic feedbacks to climate change may represent the most critical concern for groundwater quality baron et al 2013 bloomfield et al 2013 green et al 2011 li and merchant 2013 pitz 2016 stuart et al 2011 treidel et al 2011 zhou et al 2010 excessive pumping or over exploitation of wells due to increasing water demand and droughts caused by climate change and compounded by development especially in coastal areas may sufficiently lower the water table to create saltwater intrusion swi and the consequent salinization of freshwater romanazzi et al 2015 stocker 2014 van camp et al 2014 coastal aquifers in low lying areas are also particularly vulnerable to swi from sea level rise due to climate change knott et al 2019 swi threatens groundwater resources ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 ketabchi et al 2016 causing wells to be abandoned and leading to the salinization of vast quantities of fresh groundwater thus making it unfit for a variety of human uses van camp et al 2014 as groundwater abstraction increases wells run dry and must be dug to deeper levels consequently groundwater quality decreases because deeper aquifers in coastal areas tend to produce lower quality water famiglietti 2014 konikow and kendy 2005 2 5 groundwater surface water gw sw interactions many studies on groundwater climate change interaction have concluded that climate change would exert an indirect influence on groundwater as a result of interaction with surface water systems such as lakes and streams through the groundwater processes of recharge and discharge franssen 2009 bates et al 2008 dragoni and sukhija 2008 the interaction between groundwater and surface water is multifaceted fig 4 influenced by the climate and modified by landform geology and biotic factors sophocleous 2002 kl√∏ve et al 2011 identified three possible interactions between lakes and groundwater 1 groundwater inflow to the entire lake bed groundwater discharge 2 groundwater outflow from the whole lake bed groundwater recharge and 3 both situations occurring at the same time in different parts of the lake or at different times of the year in addition surface water groundwater connectivity where present may exist in various forms 1 as a connected system a gaining or losing surface water system or 2 as a disconnected system completely disconnected system or a transitional state li and merchant 2013 penna et al 2014 the systems share a common link through recharge and discharge and their interaction constitutes a vital part of the hydrologic cycle jyrkama and sykes 2007 saha et al 2017 a decrease in surface water availability caused by climate change can affect this interaction saha et al 2017 in many hydrogeologic settings natural groundwater discharges help to sustain surface waters during periods of low or no rainfall by sustaining baseflow in the upper colorado river basin ucrb baseflow alone accounts for about 50 of the total annual streamflow in the basin rumsey et al 2015 therefore future climate driven changes in temperature and precipitation and consequently recharge may potentially cause changes in baseflow and the magnitude and timing of groundwater discharges to surface water systems pitz 2016 solder et al 2016 sultana and coulibaly 2011 tague and grant 2009 earlier snowmelt for example is expected to reduce late summer recharge and baseflow ahiablame et al 2017 xie et al 2008 changes in flow patterns between surface and groundwater may be amongst the earliest and most obvious direct groundwater related implications of future climate change earman and dettinger 2011 pitz 2016 climate change may also impact gw sw interaction by increasing the need for groundwater exploitation and development due to drought or an extension of the dry season when this happens the water table falls and groundwater discharge to streams also decreases this cause and effect relationship is supported by correlation studies linking fluctuations in water table levels to lake water levels christensen and bergman 2005 williams and pelletier 2015 for example in the volta lake region of ghana yidana et al 2019 found that increasing groundwater exploitation and climate change will reverse the current situation of net outflows into the volta lake massive declines in streamflow and lake levels can harm the whole water resources of a particular region house et al 2016 sustaining volumetric flow rates to streams is vital for the survival of aquatic organisms groundwater inputs to surface water bodies help to sustain wetlands and associated plant and animal communities kl√∏ve et al 2014 yeakley et al 2014 also high precipitation may lead to an increase in surface runoff resulting in hydraulic pressures in the lower stream reaches which may consequently cause a change in the river regime from effluent to influent permeating its banks and recharging the aquifer as brunke and gonser 1997 discovered summarily an understanding of the possible impact of climate change on the relationship between subsurface and surface water is imperative for effective management of water resources barthel and banzhaf 2016 gamvroudis et al 2017 3 models in groundwater hydrology assessment of groundwater vulnerabilities in the face of climate change as well as its management for sustainable use will eventually stall unless our knowledge of groundwater systems continues to improve numerical modelling of groundwater provides the necessary tools for the continuous expansion of our understanding of groundwater processes diersch 2013 kumar and singh 2011 pitz 2016 indeed modelling is indispensable to understanding past and present conditions and in predicting and ultimately controlling the future states of geophysical and earth systems including groundwater processes the relative inaccessibility of aquifers and the complexity of subsurface processes also makes modelling indispensable the response of groundwater to important climate variables has been the focus of many studies using both statistical models bierkens et al 2001 chen et al 2002 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2010 and complex numerical models allen et al 1998 brouy√®re et al 2004 cartwright and morgenstern 2012 deng et al 2013 hanson and dettinger 2005 jyrkama and sykes 2007 ordens et al 2014 scibek et al 2007 wood et al 2015 here emphasis is placed solely on numerical models that quantify groundwater flow processes using mathematical equations founded on some simplified assumptions kumar and singh 2011 the effectiveness of these models hinges on how thoroughly the equations approximate the physical system being modelled which in turn depends on a thorough understanding and characterization of the relevant hydrogeological conditions the most internationally recognizable groundwater model is the modular groundwater flow model modflow a three dimensional finite difference model developed by the us geological survey usgs much of its initial scope has been enhanced over the years through integration with other simulations an example is the particle tracking model modpath used in contaminant transport studies after running a modflow simulation mondal and singh 2009 pollock 2016 others are feflow sutra etc kumar and singh 2011 in general groundwater models simulate the natural groundwater flow solute transport especially of dissolved chemicals and aquifer condition kumar and singh 2011 qiu et al 2015 the aim is usually to predict flow under different circumstances and to improve understanding of aquifer behavior and functioning other groundwater models probe the chemical quality of groundwater and its susceptibility to varying hydrological and climatic regime with additional capabilities for designing sustainable water management or remediation schemes and to provide information about the response of aquifers to alternative courses of action bear and verruijt 2012 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of various numerical models used in groundwater studies groundwater flow processes were once thought to be disconnected from the atmosphere and therefore were not included in most climate models taylor et al 2013 however many studies maxwell and kollet 2008 indicate that aquifers do in fact influence the atmosphere especially in areas of relatively shallow water tables where dynamic interactions between surface and groundwater can alter the surface water and energy fluxes in the boundary layer leng et al 2014 maxwell et al 2011 qian et al 2013 hence aquifers should be considered part of the lithospheric heterogeneities that climate models must seek to simulate without which reliable climate prediction especially of local or regional climate will remain elusive and climate groundwater feedback mechanisms will be poorly understood gulden et al 2007 maxwell et al 2011 accordingly to better understand the impacts of climate change on groundwater efforts have been made to represent groundwater processes in land surface models embedded in gcms or to couple complete groundwater models to surface water models or larger scale atmospheric models e g huang et al 2019 the recently developed usgs groundwater surface water code gsflow couples two usgs models the precipitation runoff modelling system prms and modflow hunt et al 2008 markstrom et al 2008 the gsflow can be applied to more than one watershed given that it simulates flow across watershed boundaries gsflow has been used to simulate flow across the land surface simultaneously and within subsurface saturated and unsaturated materials in a dense lake district in wisconsin usa hunt et al 2008 and in northwest china penna et al 2014 wu et al 2015 however a more comprehensive model which integrates all facets of the hydrosphere groundwater surface water and atmosphere is the hydrogeosphere formulated to simulate the whole terrestrial part of the hydrological cycle brunner and simmons 2012 maxwell et al 2015 others include cathy paws pihm etc see table 2 recently gis technology has become increasingly harnessed in groundwater modelling gis can be used either singly as a map based tool for gathering and manipulating a large high quality hydrogeological database rahmati et al 2016 or fully integrating it with other numerical groundwater models a process known as coupling gogu et al 2001 gossel et al 2004 huo et al 2007 integration may be achieved through developing groundwater models that work in a gis framework as in feflow huo et al 2007 and modflow gogu et al 2001 and ashraf and ahmad 2012 described this integration highlighting the unique spatial analysis and visualization capabilities that gis lends to groundwater modelling visualization can help recalibrate numerical models by showing differences between modelled interpolated and measured water levels gossel et al 2004 additionally multi layered environmental gis maps provide decision support tools for better evaluation of management options for the sustainable development of groundwater resources this ability to overlay disparate environmental data makes gis indispensable to groundwater management 3 1 modelling future climate impacts on groundwater regardless of the spatial scales of study investigating the potential impact of climate change on groundwater involves coupling gcm climate projections with models of groundwater components green 2016 smerdon 2017 the process starts with choosing a set of gcms gcm output and a carbon dioxide emissions scenario these gcm outputs often need to be downscaled to finer scales suitable for hydrological modelling for regional and aquifer specific studies because of the coarse resolution of gcms downscaled gcm outputs are then coupled with hydrological models to produce estimates of specific groundwater components kumar 2012 ng et al 2010 smerdon 2017 the whole process involves choosing among a set of gcms downscaling methods and hydrological models all of which creates uncertainties in outcomes crosbie et al 2013 green 2016 crosbie et al 2013 and nkhonjera and dinka 2017 independently sought to quantify the relative uncertainties in projections of recharge rates from gcms downscaling methods and hydrological models they found that the choice of appropriate gcm was the most crucial one because it is the most significant source of uncertainties in future projections of recharge the choice of downscaling methods and hydrological models were the second and next largest source of uncertainties in recharge projections in contrast kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 in their studies in eastern canada found that downscaling methods contributed the most uncertainties to future recharge estimates moeck et al 2016 have also explored uncertainties arising from hydrological models the different types of downscaling methods and their implications for recharge estimates are discussed in depth by green et al 2011 and holman et al 2009 to circumvent the problem of gcm and hydrological model selection many scholars now suggest as best practice the use of an ensemble or range of gcms and hydrological models to produce the most realistic range of estimates crosbie et al 2013 holman et al 2012 larocque et al 2019 a generalized conceptual framework in modelling the future impacts of climate change on groundwater is shown in fig 5 a typical modelling framework involves forcing a hydrological model with downscaled gcm climate data and simulated groundwater component variables using baseline climate data to generate future estimates for the groundwater component under investigation groundwater recharge is understandably the most popular groundwater component for which future predictions are generated simulation of groundwater components can range from simplistic numerical models where recharge for instance is related exclusively to precipitation kirn et al 2017 through more complex water balance models that take cognizance of temperature and actual et to the most sophisticated simulation of watershed characteristics including runoff soil vegetation dynamics as well a plurality of climate variables some complex watershed simulations such as that in alam et al 2019 model river runoff and reservoir storage and releases across multiple vertical levels of groundwater flows the indirect effect of climate on groundwater which includes the effect of climate on crop evaporative water demand and vegetation evolution was also accounted for the use of a heterogeneous subsurface hydrogeology and temporally evolving soil and vegetation dynamics add extra layers of complexity to the simulation of surface subsurface hydrologic processes but also permit more realistic estimates of recharge and other groundwater component variables to be made the result of potential future groundwater changes for 40 selected studies in the last 5 years is synthesized in table 3 the studies are subdivided based on the climate of their respective watershed to assess possible climatic dependencies in future groundwater changes in our scheme studies are first broadly classified as either temperate or tropical before subdividing these classes into smaller recognizable climatic regions further for each study the groundwater component investigated and the type of climate model and hydrological model used are shown in the table the size of the study area is shown by color coding the letters that specify hydrological models and the future changes in groundwater components produced by the models are provided in the penultimate column future predictive changes in groundwater component are relative to baseline conditions and produced for both the near term 2020 2030 2045 and the distant future usually 2075 2100 the last column shows the swot analysis of the predictive models as stated above the future direction of change in groundwater component resulting from climate change was organized by climate region fig 6 summarizes the result for all 40 studies of all 33 studies of future recharge change only eight studies reported an increase over the baseline the majority of studies found a decrease with only a few reporting no change a similar result was found for groundwater level and storage a breakdown of recharge studies by climate also revealed that across both temperate and tropical regions fig 6a recharge and storage are expected to decrease and surprisingly even more acutely in tropical regions 80 for all 40 studies increasing temperature and et were predicted to increase for the distant future and these appear to be exacting a stronger influence on recharge and storage especially in the tropics where some precipitation decreases are predicted where rainfall increases occur recharge may still be limited if light and very heavy rainfall which has been shown to contribute little to recharge account for much of that increase however rainfall is of course not entirely useless for recharge generation in the tropics comparison between studies in the wettest and driest parts of the tropics fig 6b revealed a better recharge outcome in the former than in the latter although a majority of studies still reported decreases in recharge and storage like in the tropics studies in temperate climates also revealed mostly decreasing groundwater recharge and storage however these decreases are not as severe as in the tropics the difference may be due to the effectiveness of snowmelt which is predicted to increase in a warmer temperate climate as a recharge generator on seasonal scales kl√∏ve et al 2014 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2010 but a warmer temperate climate also portends less snowfall and more rainfall consequently reducing snowmelt over longer periods earman and dettinger 2011 and thus reducing recharge in sum it should be noted that these 40 studies may not be representative of the broader literature on the subject matter the presence of uncertainties in estimates also precludes any engagement with these results beyond a tentative cursory level 4 groundwater feedback to the climate system vital feedbacks occur between groundwater and atmospheric processes on decadal and longer timescales barthel and banzhaf 2016 levy et al 2018 one such groundwater feedback is the contribution to sea level rise where abstracted water from aquifers becomes part of surface water flows until it drains into the ocean although some scholars are skeptical about the effectiveness of groundwater abstraction as a cause of sea level rise several studies have shown that human driven changes in land water storage including the direct effects of groundwater abstraction irrigation enclosures in reservoirs wetland drainage and deforestation play an important role in sea level changes d√∂ll et al 2001 konikow 2011 wada et al 2012b moreover groundwater depletion strongly affects the trends in regional and global land water storage richey et al 2015 employing recent developments in satellite measurement of time variable gravity from nasa s grace reager et al 2016 assessed the role of land water storage in sea level changes over the 12 years from 2002 to 2014 the results showed that human induced groundwater depletion contributed substantially to a gross negative mass trend of 0 97 mm year 1 sea level equivalent another groundwater feedback to the climate is an increase in evapotranspiration goodarzi et al 2019 through increased soil moisture from groundwater based irrigation the addition of water to an otherwise dry surface affects the surface energy balance alters the latent and sensible heat fluxes and the boundary layer with likely feedbacks on precipitation famiglietti et al 2011 leng et al 2014 qian et al 2013 with more soil moisture from irrigation and only energy as the limiting factor evapotranspiration may occur unabated in summer months further leading to increases in precipitation and river runoff deangelis et al 2010 kustu et al 2011 lo and famiglietti 2011 gaining a better understanding of groundwater climate feedback will require a more detailed representation of groundwater surface water interaction in the land surface hydrological phase of gcms taylor et al 2013 zaveri et al 2016 5 future considerations previous reviews table 1 of the past decade have indicated what needs to be done going forward but there is a need for a clear direction with evidenced examples of what when time where spatial and how the path must be future considerations are therefore tabulated in table 4 and the sections that follow provide a detailed explanation 5 1 physical basis 5 1 1 the scale of the study studies of climate change groundwater interaction should consider the limitations that spatial scales and subsurface heterogeneities place on their studies climatic effects on hydrological components including groundwater vary over the earth surface and so recharge estimates will vary depending on the spatial scale used in a study related to the above is the challenge of controlling for subsurface heterogeneities wwhich significantly alter recharge estimates yet hydrological models often assume a homogenous layer hartmann et al 2017 studies of future climate impacts on groundwater will therefore benefit from designing studies that allow for subsurface variations future projections of changes to groundwater resources should focus more on short to medium term forecasts rather than long term forecasts which are often beset by uncertainty and inadequate for serious policymaking 5 1 2 processes and mechanism more still needs to be done to comprehend better the complex hydrogeological processes of groundwater on the one hand and how these processes are being affected by climate change on the other also questions remain on the range of mechanisms governing groundwater system and climate change interactions for example little is known of advective heat transport in the groundwater system especially in permafrost areas physically based hydrological models can to a certain extent account for processes occurring at scales smaller than the grid scale but they do not accurately simulate the role of chemical and biological processes in controlling streambed permeability and the interaction between rivers and groundwater brunner et al 2017 how does climate change affect the flow rate what is the future direction and seasonality of potential effects on flow answers to these questions can only come through a deeper understanding of processes and mechanisms research on groundwater is process driven and the exclusion of these processes usually lead to uncertainties in the modeling approach many models do not incorporate complex processes inherent in groundwater and climate change relationships one limitation in modeling groundwater is the issue of models that cannot integrate the surface groundwater and the unsaturated zone when they are available they are computationally intensive and sometimes fail to incorporate all needed complex processes increasing uncertainties researchers have neglected the rebounding effect of feedback processes while investigating the impact of climate change on the groundwater system for instance there is a need for quantitative studies that will examine the influence of climate change on groundwater temperature and flow rates and the consequent effect on riverine and lacustrine thermal regimes and how these resultant effects in turn affect groundwater more work of complex feed forward and feedback processes is needed including quantifying the feedback of vegetation on water balance future models need to incorporate complex feedback fluxes of the impact of evapotranspiration due to changes in climate for example changes in climate may lead to a given flora adjusting its transpiration rate because of increased co2 and may adapt by altering its vegetation cover and development of a deep root system if co2 increases persist schaller and fan 2009 these processes will have a feedback effect on the groundwater system and models must be able to capture these processes when simulating climate change impact on groundwater processes also groundwater land surface feedbacks may impact moisture transport boundary layer development and precipitation processes at the local and regional scale ferguson and maxwell 2010 jiang et al 2009 more work is required to quantify if regional climate response to a changing climate is dependent on groundwater land surface feedbacks ferguson and maxwell 2010 models must be robust enough to track and quantify the hidden effects of feedbacks resulting from the dynamic interplay and complex processes of earth s components integrating groundwater processes land surface deep hydrological exchanges and groundwater flow directly into gcm modeling may reduce the uncertainties while examining complex processes research on the linearity of groundwater contamination and also the non linear processes with regards to system response in gdes should intensify aslam et al 2018 have suggested the use of semi distributed models in solving the problem of linearity all these must be done at local to regional scale and outcomes applied to places of similar attributes we recommend that processes mechanism within the context of modelling should be adopted in groundwater climate change studies 5 1 3 models groundwater modelling has and continues to open up entire vistas in our understanding of sub surface processes it holds the promise of enhancing our understanding of the groundwater climate relationship climate change and groundwater feedback mechanisms and consequently appropriate management options for sustainable use of water resource however models are always at the mercy of a thorough understanding of the operative physical processes and the ability to characterize and quantify them correctly hence models can differ markedly in their simulations and predictions of the same physical system and discrepancies in different gcms results are due to a misunderstanding of subtle atmospheric processes for example zhang et al 2013 argued that the hadgem2 es and other sophisticated climate models often misquantify the relative role of aerosols in cooling the earth because cloud processes are not adequately resolved quantifying aerosol cooling effects through cloud cover simulation is one of the leading causes of uncertainties in climate modeling and thus a priority for future research since it plays a role in evaluating future scenarios of the climatic element including precipitation indeed uncertainties in precipitation projections hamper estimates of projected groundwater changes and their potential feedbacks on climate models should be robust enough to simulate the complex and dynamic interactions that typify the climate system 5 1 4 gcms and downscaling uncertainties also arise from the choice of gcms the choice of downscaling methods and hydrological models these uncertainties influence the effectiveness of the results for mapping out appropriate management strategies for groundwater sustainability the ambiguity of trends and distribution in climatic parameters result in varying predictions of groundwater flow recharge storage and discharge so much so that models cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these processes researchers chang et al 2011 kingston and taylor 2010 zhang 2015 have recommended multi model approaches to reduce the impacts of uncertainty when using any downscaling techniques there is a need to quantify the uncertainties for better groundwater climate change studies researchers must focus on techniques that are robust enough to consider both climate variability and change some downscaling techniques e g delta change do not consider variability the bias corrected spatial downscaling bcsd used in plains areas does not account for terrain effect aslam et al 2018 regional climate models rcms on the other hand can account for variability and terrain effect andreasson et al 2003 and are recommended to be utilized for future studies because they produce better future estimates of climate data in smaller domains jang et al 2015 researchers must also seek to provide better justification for their choice of the downscaling method in general there is an urgent and continuous need for better models as well as improvements in modelling and downscaling techniques 5 1 5 modification by irrigation recent studies russo and lall 2017 whittemore et al 2016 have shown that groundwater levels respond faster to changes in pumping driven of course by human response to climate variability than to direct changes in recharge also driven by climate variability it has also been shown that response to pumping is strongest in irrigated agricultural areas where the water needs are urgent however in india the contributions of groundwater pumping and precipitation to groundwater variability varied regionally even though irrigation agriculture has increased in most of the country asoka et al 2017 recently there has been an increase in research studies on the interactions between climate variability and groundwater bouderbala 2017 bouderbala 2018 durrani et al 2017 hartmann et al 2017 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 yet the relative influence of indirect and direct climate variability impact on groundwater levels remains mostly unclear this complication has considerable implications for groundwater management and should be accounted for in future predictions of climate change impacts on groundwater furthermore hydro climatological models that consider variability and change like the bcsd and rcm should be considered for future research 5 2 socio economic dimension 5 2 1 multidisciplinary synergies the complex subject of groundwater and climate change relationships needs a transdisciplinary approach where biophysical and socioeconomic responses are adequately quantified in doing so there must be cooperation in research at local and regional levels that will involve shared knowledge the implication of this is likely to be a new scientific approach to climate change groundwater studies regarding models that can link climate variability and change hydrology hydrogeology demographic dynamics socio economic implications e g water demand and vegetation dynamics morsy et al 2017 asserted that this approach should be adopted to limit uncertainties through a toad s eye view rather than an eagle s eye view by linking the environment economic and social aspects also collaboration is critical among stakeholders at all levels and must cut across governments and organizations from the local to the international level cooperation will enable proper investigation of the socio economic and ecological implications of collaborative management of shared aquifers albrecht et al 2017 in the face of climate change and bridging the gap of groundwater sustainability collaboration through a multidisciplinary approach can foster protection and restoration of ecosystems that are vital water resources areas e g wetlands and mountain forests which protects recharge 5 2 2 groundwater monitoring network while the physical basis and its components as well as socio economic dimension are essential there is an urgent need for a more enduring long term groundwater data monitoring although expensive a denser network of groundwater observation sites needs to be created especially in remote areas and less developed regions to provide more data for detailed study and to supplement other data sources whose spatial resolutions are too coarse for any meaningful local application gdes as well as groundwater contaminations should be included in groundwater monitoring networks at the local to global level these detailed records can aid the improvements in the quantification of hydrogeological systems at local to regional scales 5 2 3 adaptation many studies neglect to investigate the adaptive capacity of people to groundwater systems because indicator based methodologies are requisite in the quantification of the adaptive capacity of the groundwater system aslam et al 2018 brooks and adger 2003 cullet and stephan 2017 notes that policy formulation related to sustainable future groundwater use should shift from traditional emissions reduction to groundwater adaptation strategies kipling et al 2019 have identified responsibility scope optimization information and collaboration as important adaptation specific elements and challenges in modeling climate change impacts for adaptation while these adaptation elements can represent challenges they can also serve as strategic considerations in climate change groundwater modeling for adaptation similar to kipling et al 2019 five adaptation specific elements continuous extent improve methods data aggregation and multidisciplinary synergies have been identified as key elements in modeling climate change impacts for groundwater adaptation because climate change is progressive there should be continuous short term modeling of climate change impacts fig 7 here modelers will most likely achieve a better result through multidisciplinary synergy that enhances collaboration it is therefore the responsibility of modelers to constantly communicate the climate change outcome to stakeholders for management decision cascades of complex feedbacks are generated across multiple sectors as climate change interact with biological and physical systems making impacts and adaptation studies predominantly complex kipling et al 2019 as such a decision in modeling the extent what biophysical systems should be included to which climate change affect groundwater systems given socio economic and political changes with time is paramount the modeling can follow different pathways depending on the choice of the modeler and have varying impact on societies and biophysical systems thus pathway adaptive response to climate change constantly explored will lead to a better adaptation strategy from informed decision making developing scenarios for adaptation may be complex because adaptive responses to climate change arepathway dependent uncertainties are inherent in data acquisition and because of changes in choices made by stakeholders continuous data aggregation on adaptation responses should be focused on reducing uncertainties though uncertainties generally exist in models the quality of data from human environment systems is important for modeling climate change groundwater adaptation in the face of progressive climate changes data uncertainties and stakeholder decision are expected to change and modelers must use the information to improve modeling methods for enhanced adaptation strategies fig 7 adaptation modeling and strategies may be ineffective without multidisciplinary synergy a localized collaboration between researchers within and across regions provide the possibility to consider innovative solutions by cross pollinating ideas across disciplines informed by participation of local people such as farmers fishermen and households whose income lifestyles and culture are deeply dependent on groundwater resources the response of local people to climatic changes and their perception of the risks would strongly influence inhibit future adaptation or mitigation policies the whole strategy for groundwater and climate change research must be that of integration the physical and socio economic dimensions must be well integrated to generate adequate models that will produce results thereby enabling researchers and stakeholders to outline adaptive indicators from bottom to top and vice versa this integration can be effective at both spatial and temporal scales this conclusion is similar to suggestions made by aslam et al 2018 where he proposed the integrated use of impact modelling and index based methodologies that consider an adaptive capacity for groundwater vulnerability assessment to climate change researchers and stakeholders alike must seek to identify the constituents of adaptive indicators coverage impact sustainability and replicability only then can proper groundwater legislation be created appropriately for adaptive strategies these strategies may include groundwater conservation land use protection protection of groundwater aquifers and trans boundary aquifers and other measures such as changing land use and other practices which better sustain societies and gdes 6 conclusion this paper examines the body of knowledge on the present and future impacts of climate change on groundwater differences and similarities in groundwater response to climate change forcing or varied climate change influences on groundwater systems in different regions of the earth are explored to establish fundamental climatic or geographic controls the study also exposes pertinent knowledge gaps and possible direction for future research the scourge of climate change evidenced and driven by global warming is expected to affect every component of the climate system including groundwater a synthesis of 40 modeling studies suggests that the future groundwater changes by climate will result in a decrease in groundwater recharge storage and levels particularly in the arid semi arid tropics and secondarily the humid tropics the climate system is a complex web of interactions and feedback mechanisms and so it is difficult to resolve the whole spectrum of relevant feedbacks for each component in different spatial and time scales assessing the climate groundwater relationship also becomes problematic since groundwater reacts slowly to climate forcing and it is not readily amenable to scientific probing as surface water systems are a plethora of studies have shown that groundwater is vulnerable to climate change directly through recharge replenishments and indirectly through land use cover changes and through groundwater fed irrigation hence to continue to improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on groundwater two key considerations have been proposed physical basis and socio economic dimensions these strategies provide some guidelines on how research on the impact of climate change on groundwater is to be carried out the strategies suggest an integrative consideration when assessing groundwater vulnerability to climate change and can provide a quick learning curve

5242,climate change will impact every aspect of biophysical systems and society however unlike other components of the climate system the impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently received attention this focus is due to the realization that groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and water security and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change this paper synthesizes findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the entire groundwater system and each component also we appraise the use of coupled groundwater climate and land surface models in groundwater hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate change groundwater interaction finding that most models anticipate decreases in groundwater recharge storage and levels particularly in the arid semi arid tropics reducing uncertainties in future climate projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes underlying models to improve their simulation of real world conditions remain a priority for climate and earth scientists despite the enormous progress made there are still few and inadequate local and regional aquifer studies especially in less developed regions the paper proposes two key considerations first physical basis the need for a deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with the use of more sophisticated models second the need to understand the socioeconomic dimensions of climate groundwater interaction through multidisciplinary synergy leading to the development of better groundwater climate change adaptation strategies and modeling keywords climate change groundwater physical basis socioeconomic dimension models future considerations adaptation modeling 1 introduction groundwater plays a vital role in sustaining ecosystems and ensuring human adaptation to extreme and unexpected global environmental changes particularly as surface water systems become increasingly unsustainable in the face of rapid population growth and climate change groundwater is an important component of the climate system liesch and wunsch 2019 but many potential impacts of climate change remain largely unknown because the climate system is intricate characterized by a web of complex interactions and feedbacks munday et al 2017 in general most studies envisage an intensification of the hydrological cycle creed et al 2015 gloor et al 2013 hegerl et al 2019 stagl et al 2014 trenberth 2014 wu et al 2015 higher temperatures are expected to drive increases in evaporation and evapotranspiration et hegerl et al 2012 lafontaine et al 2015 mundo molina 2015 zhang et al 2016 but a simultaneous increase in humidity and co2 could counteract the effect of temperature and leave et unchanged in a warming climate guo et al 2017 mo et al 2017 snyder 2017 precipitation is projected to increase in amount and intensity in many places while other places are projected to experience drought burke and stott 2017 nissen and ulbrich 2017 also the portion of precipitation falling as snow is likely to decrease fassnacht et al 2016 ipcc 2013 kormos et al 2016 this lesser amount of snow will melt more quickly leading to higher average annual surface runoff wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 especially in temperate climates fig 1 depicts the complex interaction between groundwater and the components of the climate system most prior studies on the potential impact of the changing climate on the hydrological cycle have focused on the surface and visible portion of the cycle precipitation atmospheric water vapor et streamflow snow cover and so on this bias is mainly due to their visibility and accessibility abiy and melesse 2017 pitz 2016 scanlon et al 2012 qualities which make for relative ease of observation measurement and investigation of its component characteristics and interaction until recently there have been fewer studies on climate change groundwater relationships garner et al 2017 haldorsen et al 2016 hu et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 the difficulties involved in probing the nature and characteristics of water below the earth surface in part account for this deficiency in understanding groundwater response to climate change forcing also groundwater is relatively insensitive to seasonal and even decadal climate variability gurdak 2017 wada 2016 providing a complete picture of groundwater response to the changing climate is even more challenging given that the impacts of climate change are often modified by human and indirect agents such as land use change and over exploitation of groundwater however given that groundwater accounts for almost 96 of the earth s unfrozen freshwater taylor et al 2013 wada 2016 and 33 of total water withdrawals worldwide famiglietti 2014 siebert et al 2010 there is growing concern focus and research on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources green et al 2011 kundzewicz and doell 2009 taylor et al 2013 the dearth in groundwater climate change studies was summed up by the ipcc s fourth assessment report which proclaimed that there has been very little research on the impact of climate change on groundwater as well as the question of how climate change will affect the relationship between surface waters and aquifers that are hydraulically connected parry et al 2007 this declaration according to some scholars e g smerdon 2017 was instrumental in driving the massive wave of publications that followed in its wake and thus provided ample material for a more robust report on climate change impact on groundwater by the fifth assessment report this review paper is organized into five sections 1 a review of the global climate change 2 an assessment of the present state of climate change impact on groundwater components 3 a review of groundwater models and climate change induced future groundwater changes 4 groundwater feedbacks to the climate system and 5 key considerations for groundwater climate change research much of the justification for the recent interest in the response of groundwater to climate change is the need for sustainable water use for various human activities particularly in drought prone areas and arid regions and to mitigate against or adapt to any adverse impacts of climate change guermazi et al 2019 kumar 2012 kumar and singh 2011 insufficient information on most of the problems mentioned above nonetheless constitute those evolving grey areas facing the successful implementation of sustainable groundwater governance across different regions of the world this review paper probes the frontiers of groundwater climate change interaction in both the physical processes and its socio economic dimension in order to advance the knowledge of groundwater climate change interaction potential future groundwater component changes were presented together with effective directional consideration for developing groundwater climate change adaptation strategies we present a broad understanding to support global groundwater policy and management by providing clarifications on the recent salient issues surrounding the impact of climate change on the global groundwater system 1 1 methodology we reviewed approximately 1000 papers that dealt with the subject of groundwater and climate change together or separately google scholar the web of science and scopus were the main repositories searched for relevant materials in line with the aims of this project papers that were older than five years were mostly excluded from the list and an emphasis was placed on those linking potential changes in groundwater components to climate change this further narrowed the list to just over 300 peer review papers in addition we sampled some review papers over the last decade 2008 2019 table 1 summarizes their spatial scale thematic focus gaps identified and proposed solutions 1 2 global climate change climate change is no longer a hypothesis ipcc 2013 there is a global consensus among climatologists and other earth scientists that the global climate is changing since the instrumentation period began the earth s climate has undergone unprecedented changes and these changes have been projected to continue well into this century for instance the last four years are the warmest years on record and the ten warmest years are all in the 21st century cheng and zhu 2018 jackson et al 2017 sorokin and mondello 2018 the global average temperature has risen almost 1 c since records began and atmospheric co2 is currently at an all time high of 416 ppm as of april 2020 1 1 atmospheric co2 https www co2 earth accessed may 2019 today climate change has remained on the front burner of world leading studies in environmental science and climatology and it remains topical at national and international levels because of its influence on policy and decision making in socioeconomic domains it is seen as a multidisciplinary subject matter and has attained a universal presence in the academic arena because its impact pervades all of earth s systems there is less agreement however about how much warming will occur in future and what effect it would have on various life forms earth s climate is subject to internal variability within the climate system itself and to external factors which may be natural or anthropogenic however contemporary changes and warming trends have been attributed solely to anthropogenic influences particularly the increased emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs some of which are now said to be unavoidable ipcc 2013 the amount of ghgs has soared considerably since the industrial era warming the atmosphere and earth surface and leading to global warming co2 in particular is a significant ghg and its increasing concentration in the atmosphere has been classically correlated with the steady rise in average global temperatures in the last 150 years wmo 2017 nevertheless there are still uncertainties in how global climate change manifests at local and regional scales and how decadal to seasonal temperature variations and extremes affect the lives of people mcgregor 2018 increasing temperatures have led to the melting and receding of glaciers and ice sheets reinforced by the arctic amplification and the cryospheric positive feedback mechanism duan et al 2019 francis 2017 haine and martin 2017 this melting of ice combined with thermal expansion of the oceans cause average sea level to rise other parts of the climate system such as the hydrological cycle respond to climate change forcing through numerous often intractable feedbacks jayakumar and lee 2017 smyth et al 2017 in all scientific knowledge of climate processes has improved climate models now produce realistic simulations of past and future climate change however many uncertainties still exist in our knowledge about specific microphysical processes and complex interactions that govern the climate system future projections of climate change and alterations to groundwater due to climate change will require sophisticated theoretical models to be more reliable 1 3 climate change and world groundwater an estimated 1 386 billion cubic kilometers of water is present on earth of this total approximately 97 is salt water found in the oceans and only 3 is freshwater most of this freshwater about 69 occur as permanent ice and snow mainly in greenland and antarctica while the remaining 30 is groundwater gleick 1993 water in surface water systems such as rivers lakes streams and swamps hold less than 1 of fresh water if we take the water locked up in the cryosphere out of the equation it would mean that only 1 is usable and 99 of this is groundwater du plessis 2017 liu et al 2011 thus groundwater is a vital source of fresh water not only for diverse human uses but also for sustaining plant and animal ecosystems in terms of human use of groundwater 1 5 3 billion people rely on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water l√≥pez morales and mesa jurado 2017 misra 2014 velis et al 2017 irrigation consumes about 60 70 of groundwater withdrawals globally bhanja et al 2017 zingaro et al 2017 siebert et al 2010 but locally this percentage varies with climate desert countries such as saudi arabia libya and burkina faso expend as much as 90 of groundwater on irrigation in contrast countries with plentiful rainfall use most of their groundwater for household needs since little is needed for irrigation the rapid increase in agricultural groundwater use in the last few decades due to technological advances in pumping techniques has created better livelihoods for farmers and food security for the world s population giordano 2009 industrial groundwater use is also growing in industrialized countries as it accounts for about 40 of water demand in france and japan margat and van der gun 2013 overall groundwater accounts for a quarter of total water withdrawals and 50 of the world s current potable water margat and van der gun 2013 groundwater is therefore crucial for the sustenance of many human and natural systems however there are legitimate concerns and reports of over exploitation of groundwater driven by increasing water demand from rapid urban and industrial development and expansion of irrigated lands gleeson and wada 2013 jia et al 2019 taylor 2014 turner et al 2019 wada and bierkens 2014 the us india and pakistan together accounted for nearly 55 of total world groundwater withdrawals grogan et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2013 in many areas of the world groundwater exploitation is carried out in an unsustainable way omole 2013 srinivasan and lele 2017 with rates of withdrawal exceeding replenishment by recharge these include the major agricultural regions in the western us the middle east india and china shown in fig 2 d√∂ll et al 2012 grogan et al 2017 wada et al 2012a left unabated this current trend of increasing societal dependence on non renewable groundwater will undermine the resilience of human systems to water shortages and threaten ecological systems that depend on them most naturally dry regions with very little precipitation have seasonally or year round surface and groundwater depletion fig 2 however even more rainy regions such as the indian sub continent and the great plains of the us show significant depletion these latter areas indicate places of intense industrial and agricultural water use fig 2 also maps the ratio of mean annual precipitation to groundwater generated rpgw both in 10 9 m3 year for 1988 to 2017 for selected countries countries with large rpgw tend to be located in dry hot climates where the little precipitation is consumed by et and groundwater recharge is severely limited most of the middle east and north africa fall into this class and watersheds in this region suffer seasonal and dry year surface and groundwater depletion the rapid growth in world population and the associated increase in water demand do not proffer a complete explanation for the massive depletion of groundwater storage many studies have established correlations between climate perturbations and groundwater levels asoka et al 2017 de graaf et al 2017 kuss and gurdak 2014 russo and lall 2017 sivarajan et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 van der knaap et al 2015 van engelenburg et al 2018 as global warming and climate change drives more intense and frequent climate extremes precipitation evaporation and surface water will become more variable making groundwater a threatened and yet critical resource in sustaining ecosystems indeed increasing groundwater demand will characterize future scenarios for water resource management and food security gamvroudis et al 2017 mustafa et al 2019 tong et al 2016 zaveri et al 2016 as it is the only viable means of meeting the water needs of rural areas and arid regions lijzen et al 2014 melo and wendland 2017 moutahir et al 2017 wang et al 2015 climate change directly fig 3 affects the totality of the groundwater system da costa et al 2019 jayakumar and lee 2017 groundwater surface water interaction scibek et al 2007 tague et al 2008 groundwater flows groundwater recharge and storage asoka et al 2017 tillman et al 2016 tillman et al 2017 groundwater discharge and groundwater quality gurdak et al 2011 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2011 of these groundwater recharge from precipitation and leakages from influent streams or other surface water systems has received the most attention and is dependent on several hydrogeological factors russo and lall 2017 the impact of climate change on groundwater systems can also be indirect through changes in groundwater abstraction asoka et al 2017 gurdak 2017 whittemore et al 2016 and through changes in land use cover fig 3 stoll et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 climate induced changes in land use involve changes in vegetation type evolving agricultural practices and potential increases in crop evaporative water demand all of which exerts a toll on groundwater alam et al 2019 studies of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater assume one of three spatial scopes global scale analyses assess the worldwide pattern of projected recharge trends and groundwater changes although they provide a quick snapshot of prevailing conditions they are often too generic to guide water policy and decision making that is both viable and beneficial on smaller scales green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 at the opposite end of spatial scope are basin aquifer specific studies that provide a deeper understanding of climate change impacts in a particular river basin or aquifer system regional studies according to meixner et al 2016 are a useful compromise between both scales as these evaluate a group of aquifers within a region with similar or different recharge mechanism 2 climate change and the groundwater system 2 1 recharge climate is the primary factor driving spatiotemporal variability in groundwater recharge and precipitation is the climate element that most directly affects groundwater recharge irrespective of the recharge pathway the significance of climate to groundwater is underscored by the universal use of gcms and precipitation data in predicting future groundwater states and on average wet conditions often result in increased recharge and storage while drought may cause the opposite effect mote et al 2013 fu et al 2019 zhou et al 2010 tillman et al 2016 and mckenna and sala 2018 quantified the projected changes in groundwater recharge in the southwestern united states under future climate scenario and found a net increase in the simulated groundwater recharge mainly due to projected increases in precipitation offsetting a decrease in recharge resulting from projected increased temperatures heavy precipitation may not necessarily lead to increasing recharge if intense et consumes the excess water bellot and chirino 2013 scanlon et al 2005 touhami et al 2013 and in fact bloomfield et al 2019 concluded that groundwater droughts are modulated by changes in evapotranspiration associated with global warming groundwater recharge is also influenced by the intensity of rainfall and not just the amount jayakumar and lee 2017 et may prevent infiltration below the root zone therefore light rainfall is not expected to contribute to groundwater recharge frot et al 2007 taylor et al 2013 tweed et al 2011 in uganda projected recharge estimates under a future climate scenario were found to be extremely sensitive to rainfall intensity mileham et al 2009 in australia rainfall intensity was also found to influence recharge estimation especially diffuse irrigation barron et al 2011 even in karst topography findings bellot and chirino 2013 touhami et al 2013 have shown that precipitation events of less than 15 mm are considered negligible for aquifer recharge while precipitation events equal to or greater than 30 mm produced high enough infiltration to lead to considerable aquifer recharge therefore regions where rainfall intensity is projected to rise may see future recharge increases provided that rainfall intensity is not too high as to exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil and preclude any extra groundwater recharge furthermore the type of precipitation event also affects recharge rates hughes et al 2011 snowmelt is for the most part a more efficient creator of recharge than rainfall all other factors being equal a move from snow to rain could sometimes bring about lower recharge to precipitation proportions earman and dettinger 2011 since more precipitation is expected to fall as rain than snow on a warming earth cold regions may suffer recharge reductions otherwise warmer winter temperatures might reduce the depth of ground frost and increase infiltration into the ground thereby increasing recharge a warmer winter may also lead to earlier and prolonged snowmelt resulting in ample winter recharge but reduced spring and summer recharge jyrkama and sykes 2007 kl√∏ve et al 2014 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2010 sutinen et al 2008 hence while future groundwater recharge will be influenced primarily by rainfall intensity in the tropics a shift in the type of precipitation event from snow to rainfall will be the primary determinant of future recharge in temperate and cold climates understanding groundwater recharge mechanisms are important for evaluating relations between climate change and groundwater recharge the combinatory study of eight aquifers in the western us by meixner et al 2016 led to the development of a uniform recharge classification scheme which identified four different recharge mechanisms diffuse focused mountain system recharge msr and irrigation diffuse recharge occurs through direct infiltration from precipitation that occurs fairly homogeneously over a large area scanlon et al 2002 sililo and tellam 2000 stamm et al 1998 wirmvem et al 2017 focused recharge on the other hand is concentrated recharge resulting from infiltration from ephemeral and perennial water bodies hughes et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 ren et al 2019 especially in areas of heterogeneous subsurface characteristics hartmann et al 2017 msr the main recharge component in arid and semi arid basins involves two related processes mountain front recharge mfr and mountain block recharge mbr mfr is recharge from stream runoff at mountain fronts to the adjacent alluvial aquifer while mbr is recharge through mountain bedrock houston 2002 meixner et al 2016 groundwater recharge by irrigation is excess irrigation water which percolates back to the water table similarly some studies have made distinctions such as localised and indirect recharge lerner 1997 and actual and potential recharge hendrickx and walker 1997 the study by meixner et al 2016 demonstrated that various recharge mechanisms would respond differently to global warming and the sensitivity of a region to climate change depends on the recharge mechanisms at work in a given aquifer system flint et al 2013 ng et al 2010 for the eight aquifers studied diffuse recharge is expected to drop as a result of the cumulative effects of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and et focused recharge is likely to increase due to the projected increase in precipitation intensity in a warmer climate dominguez et al 2012 msr is expected to decrease driven by both reduced winter precipitation and a decline in the proportion of winter precipitation arriving as snow it is noteworthy that considerable uncertainties exist in these future projections as seen in the wide range of estimates of recharge changes table 3 summarizes the findings of selected studies on the predicted future impact of climate change on different groundwater components including recharge although estimates of future recharge changes had considerable uncertainty in all recharge was found to be decreasing in most of the studies in both temperate 54 and tropical 80 climate regions even in the rainy humid tropics the majority of studies still indicate decreasing recharge by the end of this century relative to baseline estimates besides the agency of precipitation climate change may also impact recharge through changes in groundwater use the excessive abstraction of groundwater primarily for irrigation can have a significant effect on groundwater as irrigation accounts for nearly 60 70 of all freshwater extractions and 90 of consumptive uses siebert et al 2010 typically groundwater fed irrigation leads to depletion of groundwater storage but recharge increases and storage replenishments have been observed in areas of extensive irrigation return flows for example in the republican river basin of the high plains aquifer of semi arid us where irrigation has become an important supplier of crop water demand ou et al 2018 predicted that irrigation recharge would increase steadily up to 2100 due to the increase in pumping in regions where irrigation by surface water is dominant irrigation recharge is also expected to rise crosbie et al 2013 hanson et al 2012 but the net effect of excess irrigation is groundwater depletion leng et al 2014 stanton et al 2011 in all the surge in irrigation led abstraction is likely to continue into the future yihdego et al 2017 driven by climate change induced seasonal redistribution of precipitation and increased et kreins et al 2015 with an increasing population and a consequent rise in demand for food as well as greater economic development irrigation led abstraction may even become the most significant mode of climate change impact on groundwater russo and lall 2017 whittemore et al 2016 furthermore land use land cover can modify the effects of precipitation and groundwater use on groundwater recharge many studies have shown significant variation in recharge due to replacing the natural vegetation by arable land or built up surfaces oliveira et al 2017 reduction in leaf area for example through clearing forests for agriculture can increase groundwater recharge even if rainfall decreases slightly owuor et al 2016 in contrast other studies have shown decreases in groundwater recharge from an increase in vegetation density for instance through a change from grassland to woodland oliveira et al 2017 or when it involves rapid urbanization and replacement by built up surfaces in general land use cover change whether temporary vegetation change or permanent urbanization can affect recharge by modifying the water balance evaporation transpiration infiltration and surface runoff processes jyrkama and sykes 2007 kundu et al 2017 these additional influences make it difficult to assess the impacts on groundwater due exclusively to climate change green et al 2011 gurdak 2017 zhou et al 2010 2 2 discharge the movement of water from the subsurface to the surface from an aquifer to a surface water body loss to the atmosphere or withdrawal for human uses represents groundwater discharge green et al 2011 five major processes of groundwater discharge are identifiable in the literature 1 spring flow 2 transpiration by local vegetation 3 evaporation from soil and open water 4 subsurface outflow and 5 withdrawal for various human uses green et al 2011 groundwater fed springs will decrease in discharge going by current forecasts of increasingly arid climate in the southwestern us weissinger et al 2016 the sikkim himalaya tambe et al 2012 and in areas of extensive groundwater development as in niangziguan springs in shanxi china hao et al 2009 zhong et al 2016 a wetter future climate will probably lead to an increase in spring discharge but this is complicated by the many climate elements often at play for example weissinger et al 2016 found an inverse relationship between spring discharge on one hand and potential et and temperature on the other whereas higher winter precipitation led to spring discharge increases cervi et al 2018 corroborate these findings a better understanding of the interrelationship between climate and spring discharge will not only foster realistic projections of future spring discharge changes resulting from climate change but will also guide conservation efforts in spring dependent ecosystems besides spring discharges groundwater discharge is a significant contributor to streamflow especially in times of little precipitation leake and barlow 2013 for summer groundwater discharges into adjacent rivers kurylyk et al 2014b have reported a significant rise in the magnitude of discharge due to projected rises in precipitation and air temperature in new brunswick canada the major indirect impact of climate change extensive groundwater pumping to meet rising water demand for irrigation and other human uses may substantially lower the elevations of the water table and consequently baseflow contributions to streamflow the impacts of groundwater withdrawals can be transmitted to associatedlakes streams and wetlands throughdiminishedrates ofreleasefrom the aquifer to these surface water systems barlow and leake 2012 leake and barlow 2013 solder et al 2016 found evidence of declining groundwater discharge attributable to climate variability and change and to increased water demand further climate change can potentially impact the temperature of groundwater discharges from simulations kurylyk et al 2014b again reported a rise in groundwater discharge temperature of up to 3 6 c in their study area in new brunswick canada certain fish species are mostly dependent on cold groundwater discharges into streams and rivers to buffer them from temperature extremes and regulate their metabolism especially in summer months deitchman and loheide 2009 essaid and caldwell 2017 and hare et al 2017 argue that given this critical thermal conditioning role any future climate change impact on groundwater discharge temperature could endanger these already threatened species the sign of change in groundwater temperature will almost certainly be positive since average global air temperatures are projected to rise and surface air temperatures and subsurface temperatures have a strong positive correlation especially in shallow aquifers with greater thermal sensitivities gunawardhana and kazama 2012 kurylyk et al 2013 2015 therefore the probability of surpassing essential temperature thresholds in groundwater sourced thermal streams may increase considerably under the most extreme future climate scenarios 2 3 flow and storage there is much evidence in the literature that groundwater levels in many aquifers around the world are decreasing major aquifers in arid and semi arid regions fig 2 such as the high plains of the united states dong et al 2019 longuevergne et al 2010 russo and lall 2017 scanlon et al 2012 and northwest india are experiencing rapid groundwater depletion famiglietti 2014 elsewhere in humid environments such as bangladesh shamsudduha et al 2012 and brazil foster et al 2009 a decrease in groundwater storage has also been reported groundwater literature over the last few decades have debated the role of groundwater recharge and pumping on the depletion of groundwater storage it would appear intuitive and logical that when pumping exceeds natural recharge in an aquifer then depletion of aquifer storage occurs and pumping becomes unsustainable however this notion based on some erroneous assumptions spelt out in devlin and sophocleous 2005 has been widely discredited as a water budget myth see bredehoeft 2002 those against this myth argue that natural aquifer recharge is not necessarily a factor affecting sustainable pumping but the water budget myth continues to persist because groundwater represents the largest store of freshwater on earth its depletion will threaten livelihoods and ecological sustainability especially during periods of drought aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 brauman et al 2016 konikow and kendy 2005 storage loss is even deleterious for other reasons first it reduces the depth of the water table thereby increasing the cost of groundwater abstraction from deep boreholes and wells aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 fishman et al 2011 second it reduces groundwater discharge to streams springs rivers and other surface water bodies with attendant effects on the well being of gdes earman and dettinger 2011 giordano 2009 third groundwater depletion has been known to cause land subsidence due to the compaction of soil and open pore spaces that previously held water taniguchi et al 2008 andaryani et al 2019 land subsidence due to groundwater depletion has been found in venice and bologna italy tosi et al 2015 modoni et al 2013 china zhu et al 2015 iran ghazifard et al 2016 the central valley california faunt et al 2016 and elsewhere groundwater storage is comparatively less sensitive to seasonal or even multi year climatic variability pokhrel et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 and reacts slower than surface water to the effects of direct climate driven changes in precipitation and recharge rates in deep aquifer systems an extended period may be required for direct climate driven changes in recharge to be evident as a storagechange on the other hand storageconditions insmalleraquifers with smallerflow pathsare probably the mostvulnerabletodirectchanges instorage in all sudden changes in storage may suggest indirect or human induced depletion rather than direct climate effects or an aggressive combination of both as was found in the central valley region of california where droughts and over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation led to massive storage depletion alam et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 alam et al 2019 found that groundwater storage had been depleting since the middle of the 20th century and climate change will lead to a 31 increase in the rate of groundwater storage loss under rcp4 5 in california s central valley scholars generally employ one of three methods of estimating groundwater depletion 1 the flux based method wada 2016 wada et al 2010 which defines groundwater depletion as an abstraction in excess of recharge 2 the volume based method konikow 2011 and 3 the satellite based method all methods have their flaws and estimates are fraught with uncertainties nonetheless assessing the amount of groundwater present in storage has improved since the launching of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and estimation of changes in groundwater storage at regional scales has been made possible this satellite based method detects changes in total water storage tws by measuring temporal variations in the gravity field the storage changes of groundwater can be evaluated after deducting the remaining tws changes from grace resultant total tws changes tapley et al 2019 wada 2016 the grace satellite data and ground based observations have been used to ascertain the level of storage depletion in many regions of the world e g california central valley scanlon et al 2012 the amazon hu et al 2017 china hao et al 2019 lin et al 2019 and india tiwari et al 2009 however although grace provides near in situ estimates of regional groundwater depletion its coarse spatial resolution 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 precludes the assessment of small aquifers especially in data scarce areas strassberg et al 2007 wada 2016 lin et al 2019 the solution may lie in combining grace data with direct groundwater observation and groundwater modelling as hao et al 2019 has done 2 4 groundwater quality research on climate change impacts on groundwater quality is sparse and predictions are fraught with uncertainty nonetheless two modes of impact on groundwater quality in a changing climate are found in the literature 1 the flushing of chemical compounds into aquifers and 2 over exploitation of coastal aquifers kl√∏ve et al 2014 treidel et al 2011 infiltrating irrigation return flows can flush certain chemical compounds into aquifers thereby impacting groundwater quality merz and lischeid 2019 qin et al 2011 severe rainstorms in lowland areas where rates of land surface loading of contaminants are higher may encourage the downward mobilization of soluble chemicals present in the vadose zone dragoni and sukhija 2008 earman and dettinger 2011 gurdak et al 2007 kl√∏ve et al 2014 this phenomenon is most characteristic of arid and semi arid regions where high evaporation rates increase the content of salt in soils and bottom sediments of surface waters and could play an essential role in the salinization of shallow aquifers bighash and murgulet 2015 schmidt and garland 2012 in mid high latitudes future climate will be marked by warmer winter temperatures and increased snowmelt which may increase pollutant capture and solute leaching in the unsaturated zone thus impacting groundwater quality bloomfield et al 2006 sugita and nakane 2007 also mcgill et al 2019 found that climate change may worsen sanitary conditions in less developed regions resulting in the leaching of human waste from pit latrines into groundwater pulido velazquez et al 2015a have quantified the impact of climate and land use change on groundwater quality related to nitrate concentrations using the mt3dms a three dimensional multi species solute transport model see zheng et al 2012 and swat model the result reveals that nitrate concentration in groundwater increased in almost all the study locations across all the climate scenarios places that have high irrigation and recharge increases tend to increase nitrate concentrations in groundwater poor groundwater quality is a limiting factor for further planned uses such as drinking or irrigation and the long term sustainability of global groundwater resources gurdak et al 2011 mas pla et al 2019 have detailed the environmental economic social and political concerns that arise from nitrate pollution exacerbated by climate change some studies have reported increasing groundwater discharge temperatures e g kurylyk et al 2014b which is expected to rise even further due to climate change gunawardhana and kazama 2011 kurylyk et al 2014a kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 increasing groundwater temperature may alter the hydrogeochemical processes that exert control on the mobility and dissolved concentration of chemical contaminants pitz 2016 and thus influence groundwater quality riedel 2019 h√§hnlein et al 2013 riedel 2019 found that a 1 c increase in groundwater can lead to a 4 decrease in oxygen saturation and a drop of 0 02 in ph value stuart et al 2011 unesco 2008 additionally changes in precipitation and et can affect natural groundwater composition for instance a rise in et following a decline in precipitation may increase geogenic contamination of arsenic and fluoride amanambu 2015 amini et al 2008a amini et al 2008b in contrast places of excessive rainfall can ease the mobilization of geogenic contaminants amanambu 2015 the thermal response of groundwater temperature to climate change in turn affects the thermal regimes of baseflow dominated streams or rivers and their hydraulically connected aquifers menberg et al 2014 also because the temperatures of the surface and subsurface are intertwined groundwater temperature may be inferred from surface temperature beltrami 2001 gunawardhana and kazama 2012 and such linkages can provide more insight into the impact of climate change on the subsurface menberg et al 2014 benz et al 2017 observed a global link between groundwater temperatures and land surface temperature with an average offset of 1 2 1 5 c the highest differences were found in the coldest and warmest areas of the earth they therefore attributed the high offset to et and snow effect in cold regions the impact of climate change on groundwater and soil temperatures is now a significant concern especially as permafrost thaws harden et al 2012 mcguire et al 2012 in any case the indirect anthropogenic feedbacks to climate change may represent the most critical concern for groundwater quality baron et al 2013 bloomfield et al 2013 green et al 2011 li and merchant 2013 pitz 2016 stuart et al 2011 treidel et al 2011 zhou et al 2010 excessive pumping or over exploitation of wells due to increasing water demand and droughts caused by climate change and compounded by development especially in coastal areas may sufficiently lower the water table to create saltwater intrusion swi and the consequent salinization of freshwater romanazzi et al 2015 stocker 2014 van camp et al 2014 coastal aquifers in low lying areas are also particularly vulnerable to swi from sea level rise due to climate change knott et al 2019 swi threatens groundwater resources ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 ketabchi et al 2016 causing wells to be abandoned and leading to the salinization of vast quantities of fresh groundwater thus making it unfit for a variety of human uses van camp et al 2014 as groundwater abstraction increases wells run dry and must be dug to deeper levels consequently groundwater quality decreases because deeper aquifers in coastal areas tend to produce lower quality water famiglietti 2014 konikow and kendy 2005 2 5 groundwater surface water gw sw interactions many studies on groundwater climate change interaction have concluded that climate change would exert an indirect influence on groundwater as a result of interaction with surface water systems such as lakes and streams through the groundwater processes of recharge and discharge franssen 2009 bates et al 2008 dragoni and sukhija 2008 the interaction between groundwater and surface water is multifaceted fig 4 influenced by the climate and modified by landform geology and biotic factors sophocleous 2002 kl√∏ve et al 2011 identified three possible interactions between lakes and groundwater 1 groundwater inflow to the entire lake bed groundwater discharge 2 groundwater outflow from the whole lake bed groundwater recharge and 3 both situations occurring at the same time in different parts of the lake or at different times of the year in addition surface water groundwater connectivity where present may exist in various forms 1 as a connected system a gaining or losing surface water system or 2 as a disconnected system completely disconnected system or a transitional state li and merchant 2013 penna et al 2014 the systems share a common link through recharge and discharge and their interaction constitutes a vital part of the hydrologic cycle jyrkama and sykes 2007 saha et al 2017 a decrease in surface water availability caused by climate change can affect this interaction saha et al 2017 in many hydrogeologic settings natural groundwater discharges help to sustain surface waters during periods of low or no rainfall by sustaining baseflow in the upper colorado river basin ucrb baseflow alone accounts for about 50 of the total annual streamflow in the basin rumsey et al 2015 therefore future climate driven changes in temperature and precipitation and consequently recharge may potentially cause changes in baseflow and the magnitude and timing of groundwater discharges to surface water systems pitz 2016 solder et al 2016 sultana and coulibaly 2011 tague and grant 2009 earlier snowmelt for example is expected to reduce late summer recharge and baseflow ahiablame et al 2017 xie et al 2008 changes in flow patterns between surface and groundwater may be amongst the earliest and most obvious direct groundwater related implications of future climate change earman and dettinger 2011 pitz 2016 climate change may also impact gw sw interaction by increasing the need for groundwater exploitation and development due to drought or an extension of the dry season when this happens the water table falls and groundwater discharge to streams also decreases this cause and effect relationship is supported by correlation studies linking fluctuations in water table levels to lake water levels christensen and bergman 2005 williams and pelletier 2015 for example in the volta lake region of ghana yidana et al 2019 found that increasing groundwater exploitation and climate change will reverse the current situation of net outflows into the volta lake massive declines in streamflow and lake levels can harm the whole water resources of a particular region house et al 2016 sustaining volumetric flow rates to streams is vital for the survival of aquatic organisms groundwater inputs to surface water bodies help to sustain wetlands and associated plant and animal communities kl√∏ve et al 2014 yeakley et al 2014 also high precipitation may lead to an increase in surface runoff resulting in hydraulic pressures in the lower stream reaches which may consequently cause a change in the river regime from effluent to influent permeating its banks and recharging the aquifer as brunke and gonser 1997 discovered summarily an understanding of the possible impact of climate change on the relationship between subsurface and surface water is imperative for effective management of water resources barthel and banzhaf 2016 gamvroudis et al 2017 3 models in groundwater hydrology assessment of groundwater vulnerabilities in the face of climate change as well as its management for sustainable use will eventually stall unless our knowledge of groundwater systems continues to improve numerical modelling of groundwater provides the necessary tools for the continuous expansion of our understanding of groundwater processes diersch 2013 kumar and singh 2011 pitz 2016 indeed modelling is indispensable to understanding past and present conditions and in predicting and ultimately controlling the future states of geophysical and earth systems including groundwater processes the relative inaccessibility of aquifers and the complexity of subsurface processes also makes modelling indispensable the response of groundwater to important climate variables has been the focus of many studies using both statistical models bierkens et al 2001 chen et al 2002 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2010 and complex numerical models allen et al 1998 brouy√®re et al 2004 cartwright and morgenstern 2012 deng et al 2013 hanson and dettinger 2005 jyrkama and sykes 2007 ordens et al 2014 scibek et al 2007 wood et al 2015 here emphasis is placed solely on numerical models that quantify groundwater flow processes using mathematical equations founded on some simplified assumptions kumar and singh 2011 the effectiveness of these models hinges on how thoroughly the equations approximate the physical system being modelled which in turn depends on a thorough understanding and characterization of the relevant hydrogeological conditions the most internationally recognizable groundwater model is the modular groundwater flow model modflow a three dimensional finite difference model developed by the us geological survey usgs much of its initial scope has been enhanced over the years through integration with other simulations an example is the particle tracking model modpath used in contaminant transport studies after running a modflow simulation mondal and singh 2009 pollock 2016 others are feflow sutra etc kumar and singh 2011 in general groundwater models simulate the natural groundwater flow solute transport especially of dissolved chemicals and aquifer condition kumar and singh 2011 qiu et al 2015 the aim is usually to predict flow under different circumstances and to improve understanding of aquifer behavior and functioning other groundwater models probe the chemical quality of groundwater and its susceptibility to varying hydrological and climatic regime with additional capabilities for designing sustainable water management or remediation schemes and to provide information about the response of aquifers to alternative courses of action bear and verruijt 2012 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of various numerical models used in groundwater studies groundwater flow processes were once thought to be disconnected from the atmosphere and therefore were not included in most climate models taylor et al 2013 however many studies maxwell and kollet 2008 indicate that aquifers do in fact influence the atmosphere especially in areas of relatively shallow water tables where dynamic interactions between surface and groundwater can alter the surface water and energy fluxes in the boundary layer leng et al 2014 maxwell et al 2011 qian et al 2013 hence aquifers should be considered part of the lithospheric heterogeneities that climate models must seek to simulate without which reliable climate prediction especially of local or regional climate will remain elusive and climate groundwater feedback mechanisms will be poorly understood gulden et al 2007 maxwell et al 2011 accordingly to better understand the impacts of climate change on groundwater efforts have been made to represent groundwater processes in land surface models embedded in gcms or to couple complete groundwater models to surface water models or larger scale atmospheric models e g huang et al 2019 the recently developed usgs groundwater surface water code gsflow couples two usgs models the precipitation runoff modelling system prms and modflow hunt et al 2008 markstrom et al 2008 the gsflow can be applied to more than one watershed given that it simulates flow across watershed boundaries gsflow has been used to simulate flow across the land surface simultaneously and within subsurface saturated and unsaturated materials in a dense lake district in wisconsin usa hunt et al 2008 and in northwest china penna et al 2014 wu et al 2015 however a more comprehensive model which integrates all facets of the hydrosphere groundwater surface water and atmosphere is the hydrogeosphere formulated to simulate the whole terrestrial part of the hydrological cycle brunner and simmons 2012 maxwell et al 2015 others include cathy paws pihm etc see table 2 recently gis technology has become increasingly harnessed in groundwater modelling gis can be used either singly as a map based tool for gathering and manipulating a large high quality hydrogeological database rahmati et al 2016 or fully integrating it with other numerical groundwater models a process known as coupling gogu et al 2001 gossel et al 2004 huo et al 2007 integration may be achieved through developing groundwater models that work in a gis framework as in feflow huo et al 2007 and modflow gogu et al 2001 and ashraf and ahmad 2012 described this integration highlighting the unique spatial analysis and visualization capabilities that gis lends to groundwater modelling visualization can help recalibrate numerical models by showing differences between modelled interpolated and measured water levels gossel et al 2004 additionally multi layered environmental gis maps provide decision support tools for better evaluation of management options for the sustainable development of groundwater resources this ability to overlay disparate environmental data makes gis indispensable to groundwater management 3 1 modelling future climate impacts on groundwater regardless of the spatial scales of study investigating the potential impact of climate change on groundwater involves coupling gcm climate projections with models of groundwater components green 2016 smerdon 2017 the process starts with choosing a set of gcms gcm output and a carbon dioxide emissions scenario these gcm outputs often need to be downscaled to finer scales suitable for hydrological modelling for regional and aquifer specific studies because of the coarse resolution of gcms downscaled gcm outputs are then coupled with hydrological models to produce estimates of specific groundwater components kumar 2012 ng et al 2010 smerdon 2017 the whole process involves choosing among a set of gcms downscaling methods and hydrological models all of which creates uncertainties in outcomes crosbie et al 2013 green 2016 crosbie et al 2013 and nkhonjera and dinka 2017 independently sought to quantify the relative uncertainties in projections of recharge rates from gcms downscaling methods and hydrological models they found that the choice of appropriate gcm was the most crucial one because it is the most significant source of uncertainties in future projections of recharge the choice of downscaling methods and hydrological models were the second and next largest source of uncertainties in recharge projections in contrast kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 in their studies in eastern canada found that downscaling methods contributed the most uncertainties to future recharge estimates moeck et al 2016 have also explored uncertainties arising from hydrological models the different types of downscaling methods and their implications for recharge estimates are discussed in depth by green et al 2011 and holman et al 2009 to circumvent the problem of gcm and hydrological model selection many scholars now suggest as best practice the use of an ensemble or range of gcms and hydrological models to produce the most realistic range of estimates crosbie et al 2013 holman et al 2012 larocque et al 2019 a generalized conceptual framework in modelling the future impacts of climate change on groundwater is shown in fig 5 a typical modelling framework involves forcing a hydrological model with downscaled gcm climate data and simulated groundwater component variables using baseline climate data to generate future estimates for the groundwater component under investigation groundwater recharge is understandably the most popular groundwater component for which future predictions are generated simulation of groundwater components can range from simplistic numerical models where recharge for instance is related exclusively to precipitation kirn et al 2017 through more complex water balance models that take cognizance of temperature and actual et to the most sophisticated simulation of watershed characteristics including runoff soil vegetation dynamics as well a plurality of climate variables some complex watershed simulations such as that in alam et al 2019 model river runoff and reservoir storage and releases across multiple vertical levels of groundwater flows the indirect effect of climate on groundwater which includes the effect of climate on crop evaporative water demand and vegetation evolution was also accounted for the use of a heterogeneous subsurface hydrogeology and temporally evolving soil and vegetation dynamics add extra layers of complexity to the simulation of surface subsurface hydrologic processes but also permit more realistic estimates of recharge and other groundwater component variables to be made the result of potential future groundwater changes for 40 selected studies in the last 5 years is synthesized in table 3 the studies are subdivided based on the climate of their respective watershed to assess possible climatic dependencies in future groundwater changes in our scheme studies are first broadly classified as either temperate or tropical before subdividing these classes into smaller recognizable climatic regions further for each study the groundwater component investigated and the type of climate model and hydrological model used are shown in the table the size of the study area is shown by color coding the letters that specify hydrological models and the future changes in groundwater components produced by the models are provided in the penultimate column future predictive changes in groundwater component are relative to baseline conditions and produced for both the near term 2020 2030 2045 and the distant future usually 2075 2100 the last column shows the swot analysis of the predictive models as stated above the future direction of change in groundwater component resulting from climate change was organized by climate region fig 6 summarizes the result for all 40 studies of all 33 studies of future recharge change only eight studies reported an increase over the baseline the majority of studies found a decrease with only a few reporting no change a similar result was found for groundwater level and storage a breakdown of recharge studies by climate also revealed that across both temperate and tropical regions fig 6a recharge and storage are expected to decrease and surprisingly even more acutely in tropical regions 80 for all 40 studies increasing temperature and et were predicted to increase for the distant future and these appear to be exacting a stronger influence on recharge and storage especially in the tropics where some precipitation decreases are predicted where rainfall increases occur recharge may still be limited if light and very heavy rainfall which has been shown to contribute little to recharge account for much of that increase however rainfall is of course not entirely useless for recharge generation in the tropics comparison between studies in the wettest and driest parts of the tropics fig 6b revealed a better recharge outcome in the former than in the latter although a majority of studies still reported decreases in recharge and storage like in the tropics studies in temperate climates also revealed mostly decreasing groundwater recharge and storage however these decreases are not as severe as in the tropics the difference may be due to the effectiveness of snowmelt which is predicted to increase in a warmer temperate climate as a recharge generator on seasonal scales kl√∏ve et al 2014 okkonen and kl√∏ve 2010 but a warmer temperate climate also portends less snowfall and more rainfall consequently reducing snowmelt over longer periods earman and dettinger 2011 and thus reducing recharge in sum it should be noted that these 40 studies may not be representative of the broader literature on the subject matter the presence of uncertainties in estimates also precludes any engagement with these results beyond a tentative cursory level 4 groundwater feedback to the climate system vital feedbacks occur between groundwater and atmospheric processes on decadal and longer timescales barthel and banzhaf 2016 levy et al 2018 one such groundwater feedback is the contribution to sea level rise where abstracted water from aquifers becomes part of surface water flows until it drains into the ocean although some scholars are skeptical about the effectiveness of groundwater abstraction as a cause of sea level rise several studies have shown that human driven changes in land water storage including the direct effects of groundwater abstraction irrigation enclosures in reservoirs wetland drainage and deforestation play an important role in sea level changes d√∂ll et al 2001 konikow 2011 wada et al 2012b moreover groundwater depletion strongly affects the trends in regional and global land water storage richey et al 2015 employing recent developments in satellite measurement of time variable gravity from nasa s grace reager et al 2016 assessed the role of land water storage in sea level changes over the 12 years from 2002 to 2014 the results showed that human induced groundwater depletion contributed substantially to a gross negative mass trend of 0 97 mm year 1 sea level equivalent another groundwater feedback to the climate is an increase in evapotranspiration goodarzi et al 2019 through increased soil moisture from groundwater based irrigation the addition of water to an otherwise dry surface affects the surface energy balance alters the latent and sensible heat fluxes and the boundary layer with likely feedbacks on precipitation famiglietti et al 2011 leng et al 2014 qian et al 2013 with more soil moisture from irrigation and only energy as the limiting factor evapotranspiration may occur unabated in summer months further leading to increases in precipitation and river runoff deangelis et al 2010 kustu et al 2011 lo and famiglietti 2011 gaining a better understanding of groundwater climate feedback will require a more detailed representation of groundwater surface water interaction in the land surface hydrological phase of gcms taylor et al 2013 zaveri et al 2016 5 future considerations previous reviews table 1 of the past decade have indicated what needs to be done going forward but there is a need for a clear direction with evidenced examples of what when time where spatial and how the path must be future considerations are therefore tabulated in table 4 and the sections that follow provide a detailed explanation 5 1 physical basis 5 1 1 the scale of the study studies of climate change groundwater interaction should consider the limitations that spatial scales and subsurface heterogeneities place on their studies climatic effects on hydrological components including groundwater vary over the earth surface and so recharge estimates will vary depending on the spatial scale used in a study related to the above is the challenge of controlling for subsurface heterogeneities wwhich significantly alter recharge estimates yet hydrological models often assume a homogenous layer hartmann et al 2017 studies of future climate impacts on groundwater will therefore benefit from designing studies that allow for subsurface variations future projections of changes to groundwater resources should focus more on short to medium term forecasts rather than long term forecasts which are often beset by uncertainty and inadequate for serious policymaking 5 1 2 processes and mechanism more still needs to be done to comprehend better the complex hydrogeological processes of groundwater on the one hand and how these processes are being affected by climate change on the other also questions remain on the range of mechanisms governing groundwater system and climate change interactions for example little is known of advective heat transport in the groundwater system especially in permafrost areas physically based hydrological models can to a certain extent account for processes occurring at scales smaller than the grid scale but they do not accurately simulate the role of chemical and biological processes in controlling streambed permeability and the interaction between rivers and groundwater brunner et al 2017 how does climate change affect the flow rate what is the future direction and seasonality of potential effects on flow answers to these questions can only come through a deeper understanding of processes and mechanisms research on groundwater is process driven and the exclusion of these processes usually lead to uncertainties in the modeling approach many models do not incorporate complex processes inherent in groundwater and climate change relationships one limitation in modeling groundwater is the issue of models that cannot integrate the surface groundwater and the unsaturated zone when they are available they are computationally intensive and sometimes fail to incorporate all needed complex processes increasing uncertainties researchers have neglected the rebounding effect of feedback processes while investigating the impact of climate change on the groundwater system for instance there is a need for quantitative studies that will examine the influence of climate change on groundwater temperature and flow rates and the consequent effect on riverine and lacustrine thermal regimes and how these resultant effects in turn affect groundwater more work of complex feed forward and feedback processes is needed including quantifying the feedback of vegetation on water balance future models need to incorporate complex feedback fluxes of the impact of evapotranspiration due to changes in climate for example changes in climate may lead to a given flora adjusting its transpiration rate because of increased co2 and may adapt by altering its vegetation cover and development of a deep root system if co2 increases persist schaller and fan 2009 these processes will have a feedback effect on the groundwater system and models must be able to capture these processes when simulating climate change impact on groundwater processes also groundwater land surface feedbacks may impact moisture transport boundary layer development and precipitation processes at the local and regional scale ferguson and maxwell 2010 jiang et al 2009 more work is required to quantify if regional climate response to a changing climate is dependent on groundwater land surface feedbacks ferguson and maxwell 2010 models must be robust enough to track and quantify the hidden effects of feedbacks resulting from the dynamic interplay and complex processes of earth s components integrating groundwater processes land surface deep hydrological exchanges and groundwater flow directly into gcm modeling may reduce the uncertainties while examining complex processes research on the linearity of groundwater contamination and also the non linear processes with regards to system response in gdes should intensify aslam et al 2018 have suggested the use of semi distributed models in solving the problem of linearity all these must be done at local to regional scale and outcomes applied to places of similar attributes we recommend that processes mechanism within the context of modelling should be adopted in groundwater climate change studies 5 1 3 models groundwater modelling has and continues to open up entire vistas in our understanding of sub surface processes it holds the promise of enhancing our understanding of the groundwater climate relationship climate change and groundwater feedback mechanisms and consequently appropriate management options for sustainable use of water resource however models are always at the mercy of a thorough understanding of the operative physical processes and the ability to characterize and quantify them correctly hence models can differ markedly in their simulations and predictions of the same physical system and discrepancies in different gcms results are due to a misunderstanding of subtle atmospheric processes for example zhang et al 2013 argued that the hadgem2 es and other sophisticated climate models often misquantify the relative role of aerosols in cooling the earth because cloud processes are not adequately resolved quantifying aerosol cooling effects through cloud cover simulation is one of the leading causes of uncertainties in climate modeling and thus a priority for future research since it plays a role in evaluating future scenarios of the climatic element including precipitation indeed uncertainties in precipitation projections hamper estimates of projected groundwater changes and their potential feedbacks on climate models should be robust enough to simulate the complex and dynamic interactions that typify the climate system 5 1 4 gcms and downscaling uncertainties also arise from the choice of gcms the choice of downscaling methods and hydrological models these uncertainties influence the effectiveness of the results for mapping out appropriate management strategies for groundwater sustainability the ambiguity of trends and distribution in climatic parameters result in varying predictions of groundwater flow recharge storage and discharge so much so that models cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these processes researchers chang et al 2011 kingston and taylor 2010 zhang 2015 have recommended multi model approaches to reduce the impacts of uncertainty when using any downscaling techniques there is a need to quantify the uncertainties for better groundwater climate change studies researchers must focus on techniques that are robust enough to consider both climate variability and change some downscaling techniques e g delta change do not consider variability the bias corrected spatial downscaling bcsd used in plains areas does not account for terrain effect aslam et al 2018 regional climate models rcms on the other hand can account for variability and terrain effect andreasson et al 2003 and are recommended to be utilized for future studies because they produce better future estimates of climate data in smaller domains jang et al 2015 researchers must also seek to provide better justification for their choice of the downscaling method in general there is an urgent and continuous need for better models as well as improvements in modelling and downscaling techniques 5 1 5 modification by irrigation recent studies russo and lall 2017 whittemore et al 2016 have shown that groundwater levels respond faster to changes in pumping driven of course by human response to climate variability than to direct changes in recharge also driven by climate variability it has also been shown that response to pumping is strongest in irrigated agricultural areas where the water needs are urgent however in india the contributions of groundwater pumping and precipitation to groundwater variability varied regionally even though irrigation agriculture has increased in most of the country asoka et al 2017 recently there has been an increase in research studies on the interactions between climate variability and groundwater bouderbala 2017 bouderbala 2018 durrani et al 2017 hartmann et al 2017 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 yet the relative influence of indirect and direct climate variability impact on groundwater levels remains mostly unclear this complication has considerable implications for groundwater management and should be accounted for in future predictions of climate change impacts on groundwater furthermore hydro climatological models that consider variability and change like the bcsd and rcm should be considered for future research 5 2 socio economic dimension 5 2 1 multidisciplinary synergies the complex subject of groundwater and climate change relationships needs a transdisciplinary approach where biophysical and socioeconomic responses are adequately quantified in doing so there must be cooperation in research at local and regional levels that will involve shared knowledge the implication of this is likely to be a new scientific approach to climate change groundwater studies regarding models that can link climate variability and change hydrology hydrogeology demographic dynamics socio economic implications e g water demand and vegetation dynamics morsy et al 2017 asserted that this approach should be adopted to limit uncertainties through a toad s eye view rather than an eagle s eye view by linking the environment economic and social aspects also collaboration is critical among stakeholders at all levels and must cut across governments and organizations from the local to the international level cooperation will enable proper investigation of the socio economic and ecological implications of collaborative management of shared aquifers albrecht et al 2017 in the face of climate change and bridging the gap of groundwater sustainability collaboration through a multidisciplinary approach can foster protection and restoration of ecosystems that are vital water resources areas e g wetlands and mountain forests which protects recharge 5 2 2 groundwater monitoring network while the physical basis and its components as well as socio economic dimension are essential there is an urgent need for a more enduring long term groundwater data monitoring although expensive a denser network of groundwater observation sites needs to be created especially in remote areas and less developed regions to provide more data for detailed study and to supplement other data sources whose spatial resolutions are too coarse for any meaningful local application gdes as well as groundwater contaminations should be included in groundwater monitoring networks at the local to global level these detailed records can aid the improvements in the quantification of hydrogeological systems at local to regional scales 5 2 3 adaptation many studies neglect to investigate the adaptive capacity of people to groundwater systems because indicator based methodologies are requisite in the quantification of the adaptive capacity of the groundwater system aslam et al 2018 brooks and adger 2003 cullet and stephan 2017 notes that policy formulation related to sustainable future groundwater use should shift from traditional emissions reduction to groundwater adaptation strategies kipling et al 2019 have identified responsibility scope optimization information and collaboration as important adaptation specific elements and challenges in modeling climate change impacts for adaptation while these adaptation elements can represent challenges they can also serve as strategic considerations in climate change groundwater modeling for adaptation similar to kipling et al 2019 five adaptation specific elements continuous extent improve methods data aggregation and multidisciplinary synergies have been identified as key elements in modeling climate change impacts for groundwater adaptation because climate change is progressive there should be continuous short term modeling of climate change impacts fig 7 here modelers will most likely achieve a better result through multidisciplinary synergy that enhances collaboration it is therefore the responsibility of modelers to constantly communicate the climate change outcome to stakeholders for management decision cascades of complex feedbacks are generated across multiple sectors as climate change interact with biological and physical systems making impacts and adaptation studies predominantly complex kipling et al 2019 as such a decision in modeling the extent what biophysical systems should be included to which climate change affect groundwater systems given socio economic and political changes with time is paramount the modeling can follow different pathways depending on the choice of the modeler and have varying impact on societies and biophysical systems thus pathway adaptive response to climate change constantly explored will lead to a better adaptation strategy from informed decision making developing scenarios for adaptation may be complex because adaptive responses to climate change arepathway dependent uncertainties are inherent in data acquisition and because of changes in choices made by stakeholders continuous data aggregation on adaptation responses should be focused on reducing uncertainties though uncertainties generally exist in models the quality of data from human environment systems is important for modeling climate change groundwater adaptation in the face of progressive climate changes data uncertainties and stakeholder decision are expected to change and modelers must use the information to improve modeling methods for enhanced adaptation strategies fig 7 adaptation modeling and strategies may be ineffective without multidisciplinary synergy a localized collaboration between researchers within and across regions provide the possibility to consider innovative solutions by cross pollinating ideas across disciplines informed by participation of local people such as farmers fishermen and households whose income lifestyles and culture are deeply dependent on groundwater resources the response of local people to climatic changes and their perception of the risks would strongly influence inhibit future adaptation or mitigation policies the whole strategy for groundwater and climate change research must be that of integration the physical and socio economic dimensions must be well integrated to generate adequate models that will produce results thereby enabling researchers and stakeholders to outline adaptive indicators from bottom to top and vice versa this integration can be effective at both spatial and temporal scales this conclusion is similar to suggestions made by aslam et al 2018 where he proposed the integrated use of impact modelling and index based methodologies that consider an adaptive capacity for groundwater vulnerability assessment to climate change researchers and stakeholders alike must seek to identify the constituents of adaptive indicators coverage impact sustainability and replicability only then can proper groundwater legislation be created appropriately for adaptive strategies these strategies may include groundwater conservation land use protection protection of groundwater aquifers and trans boundary aquifers and other measures such as changing land use and other practices which better sustain societies and gdes 6 conclusion this paper examines the body of knowledge on the present and future impacts of climate change on groundwater differences and similarities in groundwater response to climate change forcing or varied climate change influences on groundwater systems in different regions of the earth are explored to establish fundamental climatic or geographic controls the study also exposes pertinent knowledge gaps and possible direction for future research the scourge of climate change evidenced and driven by global warming is expected to affect every component of the climate system including groundwater a synthesis of 40 modeling studies suggests that the future groundwater changes by climate will result in a decrease in groundwater recharge storage and levels particularly in the arid semi arid tropics and secondarily the humid tropics the climate system is a complex web of interactions and feedback mechanisms and so it is difficult to resolve the whole spectrum of relevant feedbacks for each component in different spatial and time scales assessing the climate groundwater relationship also becomes problematic since groundwater reacts slowly to climate forcing and it is not readily amenable to scientific probing as surface water systems are a plethora of studies have shown that groundwater is vulnerable to climate change directly through recharge replenishments and indirectly through land use cover changes and through groundwater fed irrigation hence to continue to improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on groundwater two key considerations have been proposed physical basis and socio economic dimensions these strategies provide some guidelines on how research on the impact of climate change on groundwater is to be carried out the strategies suggest an integrative consideration when assessing groundwater vulnerability to climate change and can provide a quick learning curve

5243,systemic analysis of hydrology and water quality fluctuations using a data intensive approach is an emerging research area and is significant for understanding hydrological processes however there is very limited understanding of the high frequency characteristics of water quality fluctuations in the frequency domain this study proposes a generic systemic framework to comprehensively analyse river water quality dynamics using a combination of fourier and wavelet spectral analyses with high temporal resolution measurements this framework identifies long term short term periodic aperiodic normal baseline and abnormal fluctuations with particularly focus on detecting transient anomaly events due to their importance for watershed management this study was conducted on the potomac river usa where seven parameters water temperature temp ph dissolved oxygen do conductance cond turbidity turb nitrate plus nitrite nox n and discharge disc were monitored every 15 min for two years at five sites sub catchments fast fourier transform fft revealed that temp ph and do exhibited typical low frequency periodic fluctuations such as seasonal and bi annual fluctuations as well as interesting high frequency periodic fluctuations such as 12 hour and 8 hour fluctuations which were identified as periodic anomalies cond turb and nox n presented universal temporal scaling phenomena i e 1 f fluctuation at all sites as shown by the power spectral density the scaling exponent Œ≤ ranged between 1 and 3 and presented the order of Œ≤cond Œ≤nox n Œ≤turb the continuous wavelet transform cwt associated with contour based scalograms successfully identified the time location duration and magnitude of transient anomaly events and classified two anomaly patterns abrupt changes and large swings the two patterns exhibited clearly different spectral energy distributions i e pseudo frequencies on the cwt scales a preliminary causality analysis found that the frequency of occurrence of turbidity anomaly events foaturb was proportional to the product of the developed land area percentage and foatemp and foanox n was proportional to the product of forest land area percentage and foadisc wavelet coherence analysis showed different hysteresis characteristics of different water quality parameters in particular turb and nox n presented significantly different coherent fluctuation behaviours between high frequency and low frequency regions some findings of this study are still difficult to explain at this stage high frequency monitoring combined with spectral analysis provides new insights into the details of water quality dynamics which can help to develop a new index and framework for the reliability resilience and management of watershed water quality vulnerability these results can also be used to design new algorithms for online anomaly detection keywords anomalous events coherence analysis fourier transform high frequency monitoring wavelet transform water quality

fluctuation signals can be naturally classified as periodic long term and non periodic including both long term and short term fluctuations patterns periodic patterns are the natural baseline for aquatic species variations and always include low frequency components e g seasonal annual and decadal patterns and high frequency components e g daily and weekly whitfield 1995 non periodic patterns can be long term trends e g water becoming cleaner temporal scaling behaviours chang and yeh 2018 kirchner and neal 2013 or short term transient events e g storm water and chemical spills according to the relative frequency of occurrence the consequences of events and the resulting water quality fluctuations can also be classified as normal or abnormal i e anomalous events shi et al 2018 the definition of an event as normal or abnormal is sometimes subjective the complete framework of water quality fluctuation patterns is summarized in fig 1 seasonal and diurnal cycles are well known processes that dominate the periodic component of a water quality signal graziano and jones 2017 however due to the complexity of influencing factors the long term fluctuations of chemical components will show temporal fractal or scale free characteristics in the frequency domain temporal scale free behaviour is an interesting important phenomenon of stream chemistry that has recently received increasing attention hansen and singh 2018 yang et al 2018 the concept can be originally traced back to mandelbrot the founder of fractal theory in 1981 who explained the hurst phenomenon and extended brownian motion to establish a random model of fractional brownian motion to simulate annual runoff series bloschl and sivapalan 1995 the first milestone was the work conducted by kirchner et al 2000 the possible causes of the 1 f time fractal and its influences on water quality trend detection and solute transport were explored although these works were ground breaking the temporal resolution of the study reached the precision of only a 7 hour sampling interval and other scenarios were not analysed such as analyses in a large watershed or a tidal river with the increasing use of sensors high resolution measurements of river water quality are becoming increasingly popular helping to manage the temporal patterns of the water environment in new ways blaen et al 2017 kunz et al 2017 rode et al 2016 for example hansen and singh 2018 investigated how the nitrate concentration interacts with discharge and water temperature in agricultural basins seasonal and diurnal cycles can also be recognized as anomalous events these events have been widely observed and commonly investigated in climatology and oceanography e g the el ni√±o southern oscillation grinsted et al 2004 a typical case in urban hydrology is perennial analyses of flood recurrence however this concept has rarely been studied in water quality related catchment hydrology periodic anomalous events related to the fluctuations in river water quality can be not only low frequency with a long recurrence period e g nutrient response to periodic hydrological fluctuations wang et al 2012 and eutrophication during summer but also high frequency with a short recurrence period e g tidal reach water temperature abnormalities due to regular wastewater discharge from power plant cooling and water quality abnormalities due to regular plant sewage discharge low frequency fluctuations are normally driven by natural influencing factors while high frequency fluctuations are associated with human activities long term periodic anomalous events can also be recognized as the re occurrence of a short term transient event with the same pattern and frequency it is important to identify the occurrence frequency and pattern of short term abnormal water quality events hernandez ramirez et al 2019 as early as 1997 dohan and whitfield combined 15 minute high frequency sensor monitoring with the wavelet transform wt method to identify short term abnormal events such as rainfall and pollution leakage from conductivity and temperature measurements dohan and whitfield 1997 whitfield and dohan 1997 and they identified the approximate location duration and intensity of these events by separating their periodic signals unfortunately this research has been previously ignored the paper has only ten citations google scholar this pioneering work is mainly a simple demonstration of the anomaly detection methodology that can be used for one water quality parameter conductance the corresponding influencing factors are not analysed urban water anomaly detection methods have been extensively reported and mainly focused on drainage systems laucelli et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 however the detection of catchment hydrology anomalies has not been thoroughly investigated leigh et al 2019 published anomaly detection methods can be classified as instant threshold methods alarming when the monitored values exceed a threshold baseline based methods alarming when new fluctuations exceed the historical baseline fluctuation range locality methods using only recent monitoring data and entirety methods using the whole time series data intensive methods or phenomenological modelling have been widely used to investigate water quality dynamics spectral analyses such as the fourier transform hansen and singh 2018 kirchner and neal 2013 wavelet analysis sang et al 2013 and the hilbert huang transform franceschini and tsai 2010 are useful tools spectral analysis can be unitized to create a universal analysis framework for river water quality dynamics to cover the fluctuation patterns as shown in fig 1 fourier analysis provides a rough idea of the frequency components in a particular signal it is best suited for analysing seasonal and diurnal periods power spectra based on the fast fourier transform fft are usually used for periodic analysis in hydrology duran et al 2020 this method can help estimate the extent to which transient data are present in a particular input signal the presence of significantly fewer high frequency components signifies a reduced possibility of transient events so the method can be used for transient event detection whitfield 1995 fourier transform assumes a stationary time invariant signal however transient events are non stationary and vary over time hence they do not meet the fourier transform requirements wavelet analysis is widely used for signal processing with both stationary and non stationary data chang and yeh 2018 daubechies 1988 the key to wavelet analysis is partitioning the signal variation into two domains scale and time location thus with wavelet analysis we can zoom in or out to obtain detailed variations that occur at a specific temporal scale or time kang and lin 2007 wavelet analysis has been increasingly used in hydrology such as for data cleaning he et al 2008 forecasting shi et al 2018 extrapolation nalley et al 2020 and coherence analysis liu et al 2017 sang 2013 sang et al 2013 provide a comprehensive review of this topic laurence et al 1998 was the first to apply wavelet analysis to study stream flow features in hydrology they studied 91 streams in five us hydro climatic regions wavelet analysis showed the distribution of event time scales and local hydro climatic regimes labat 2005 investigated wavelet analysis of rainfall and runoff which separated pumping and naturally intermittent runoff sub processes and found some useful temporal variations such as a fast flow response due to conduit flow and a slow response due to internal reserves previous studies have mainly focused on low frequency monthly time series anctil and coulibaly 2004 coulibaly and burn 2004 labat et al 2005 studies on wt based water quality dynamics are quite limited compared with those on streamflow dynamics p√©rez ciria and chiogna 2020 kang and lin 2007 was the first study to employ the wt to analyse the detailed temporal patterns of water quality signals over different temporal scales the temporal resolutions of the investigated nitrate chloride and sodium time series were low with sampling occurring every two weeks d√∂kmen and aslan 2013 evaluated extreme events based on monthly ph nitrate and chlorine datasets with discrete wt some studies were purely mathematical for example parmar and bhardwaj 2013 summarized the features of wt parameters on 9 water quality indicators including chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod dissolved oxygen do and ammonia using the db5 wavelet rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 is the only study that investigated water quality at an hourly temporal resolution water temperature and do were evenly sampled at a 1 hour time interval this study mainly focused on low frequency periodic characteristics thus anomalies were not mentioned therefore the above analysis shows that a very limited number of studies have explored the high frequency characteristics of water quality fluctuations in the frequency domain to gain insights into the interesting dynamics influenced by tides storms pollution human activities and other factors a comprehensive investigation under an integrated framework by using spectral analysis has not been reported in particular the anomaly characteristics of typical water quality parameters are far more recognized and understood in the big data era it is timely to remind hydrologists to implement ground breaking techniques in signal analysis that will significantly benefit catchment water quality management over short term intervals to address all these gaps the objectives of this study are 1 to establish a generic spectral analysis framework to comprehensively investigate river water quality dynamics 2 to identify periodic and aperiodic fluctuation characteristics of long term time series particularly focused on the recognition of temporal patterns of high frequency characteristics with high temporal resolution measurements 3 to identify periodic and transient anomalous river water quality events with high temporal resolution measurements and to identify the associated anomaly patterns durations and characteristics for different parameters and catchments 4 to interpret the anomalies considering natural influence factors and 5 to discuss water quality management implications for the watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 watershed description the potomac river was selected as the study area in this study this river is located in themid atlanticregion of theunited statesand flows from thepotomac highlandsinto chesapeake bay fig 1 long term and high frequency water quality data are available for multiple parameters due to support from national and local monitoring networks moreover this river has downstream tidal reaches and good hydrology meteorology land cover and land use observations as well as other associated factors many papers and reports on hydrology and environmental science have also evaluated this area all of these advantages make this river ideal for the proposed studies the river main stream and north branch is approximately 652 km long with adrainage area of approximately 38 000 km2 across four states the majority of the basin s land area is forested 54 6 of the land area agriculture covers 26 0 of the basin s land area while developed land makes up 14 1 water and wetlands comprise 5 9 of the basin s land area according to information from the nlcd 2011 database https www potomacriver org potomac basin facts although the total maximum daily load and watershed action plans that guide stream and river restoration have been measured and implemented for many years the aquatic habitat of the potomac river and its tributaries remain vulnerable to eutrophication heavy metals pesticides and other toxic chemicals overfishing alien species and pathogens associated with faecal coliform bacteria and shellfish diseases wikipedia the potomac river basin has an average annual rainfall of 485 8 mm may is the wettest month with an average rainfall of 60 9 mm july is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24 c january is the coldest month with an average temperature of 0 c 2 2 hydrological and water quality monitoring the united states geological survey associated with the interstate commission on the potomac river basin has conducted long term monitoring of hydrological conditions and water quality on the potomac river since 1984 olson 2012 however most sites have been equipped for high frequency water quality monitoring since only october 2012 or march 2013 graziano and jones 2017 four sites on the potomac river in the state of virginia in the united states were selected for analysis all streamflow and water quality data for all parameters were obtained from the usgs s national water information system nwis the data were obtained for a total span of two years monitored every 15 min from 20th may 2016 to 20th may 2018 high resolution monitoring can capture transient processes that are easily missed with infrequent monitoring water quality parameter statistics for these sites are shown in table 2 including water temperature temp ph do conductance cond turbidity turb nitrate plus nitrite nox n and discharge disc table s1 in appendix si shows the correlation values between different pairs of water quality parameters all the data series have gaps shown by the missing rate in table 2 due to either routine maintenance or seasonality the missing rate is low for all parameters except discharge at site 01632900 large data gaps longer than two weeks are not filled small gaps less than 3 h are filled by linear regression with the previous and following 4 time steps data gaps larger than 3 h are all replaced by the last previous value when this approach is compared to the auto regression used in hansen and singh 2018 there is almost no difference in the final analysis results precipitation data were downloaded from water resources virginia and the west virginia water science center https va water usgs gov webmap precip va which were monitored at a 5 min resolution by real time precipitation radar images from the national weather service meteorological stations 01652500 and 390927077330900 table 1 were selected as the two precipitation observation sites closest to the studied water quality monitoring sites both stations are approximately 40 km from the water quality site 01645762 fig 2 to match the temporal resolution of the water quality data the precipitation dataset at station 390927077330900 began on 20th may and continued until 20th may 2018 the station 01652500 dataset began on 1st september 2016 and continued until 20th may 2018 at a 15 min temporal resolution the air temperature datasets with 15 min resolution near the study area were not accessed table 2 a land use map of the potomac basin with 30 m 30 m resolution was downloaded and recreated from nlcd 2011 land cover 2011 edition amended 2014 by the national geospatial data asset ngda land use land cover jin et al 2013 usgs 2014 we assumed that only very small changes in land use and land cover occurred in the last 4 years in the study area to delineate the catchment associated with the monitoring sites a digital elevation model dem was imported into the soil and water assessment tool swat then using the burn in function the stream network was overlaid onto the dem to outline the watershed and sub watershed boundaries 2 3 spectral theory fourier and wavelet transform signal analysis consists of looking for similarities between a signal and well known mathematical functions usually supported by a clear physical meaning labat 2005 in mathematics the degree of similarity between two square continuous time integrable signals x t and y t can be indicated using the classical scalar product i x y or ixy defined as 1 i xy x t y t d t if i x y is equal to zero the two functions are said to be orthogonal any signal x t can then be projected and analysed using a set of functions y t i 1 n laurence et al 1998 where i 1 n is a set of characteristic parameters 2 i xy p i x t y t p i d t in a reverse manner x t can be expanded in terms of a linear superposition of the set of functions y t pi if the functions y t pi are orthogonal to each other the signal x t is then characterized by the values of the scalar product between the signal x t and the projection basis y t labat 2005 laurence et al 1998 trigonometric functions are typical orthogonal functions and can be analysed using the fourier transform and the wt fourier spectral analysissamples a signal over a period of time or space and divides it into its frequency components frequency domain as shown in eq 3 these components are single sinusoidal oscillations at distinct frequencies each with their own amplitude and phase the fourier transform uncovers the frequency components inherent in the signal as a sum of sinusoids therefore this method can be used to determine the periodic e g diurnal seasonal and yearly trends in hydrological parameter values the fftalgorithmcomputes thediscrete fourier

decomposes a signal into sines and cosines i e the functions localized in fourier space the wt uses functions that are localized in both the real and fourier spaces in wt we compare the signal to shifted and compressed or stretched versions of the wavelet known as wavelet scaling denoting the scale parameter by a and the position by b the wt equation is shown in eq 4 the continuous wavelet transform cwt is obtained and plotted with the scale on the y axis and time on the x axis 6 c a b f t œà t f t 1 a œà t b a d t scaling refers to the process of stretching or shrinking the signal in time if the input signal is œà t the scaled signal will be œà t a a 0 a is a scaling factor that determines how much the signal is stretched in time the scaling factor is inversely proportional to the signal frequency that is a high scaling factor stretches out the wave which indicates a low frequency a stretched wavelet helps capture slowly occurring changes in a signal whereas a compressed wavelet helps capture abrupt changes therefore in our analysis we will use the optimum scale range values to capture the major abrupt changes anomalies in the water quality signals shifting refers to the delaying or advancing of a wavelet along the length of the signal this shifting helps analyse the entire signal in a part wise manner the morlet wavelet was used in this work the compressed and dilated versions of the morlet wavelet are moved across the signal and compared with different signal segments kang and lin 2007 the degree of correspondence between the wavelet and the signal is established at different scales a compressed version of the wavelet which has high frequency can be used to identify to brief transient peaks in the signal 2 4 spectral analysis framework to investigate water quality dynamics and anomalies fig 3 presents the technical process of the proposed spectral analysis framework for high resolution water quality dynamics this process is associated with the classification of the water quality fluctuations shown in fig 1 the fft is used here to identify periodic patterns and the 1 d cwt is used to identify transient events two year high frequency monitored time series for discharge temperature ph conductivity nitrite and nitrate nitrogen and turbidity are analysed the process uses 15 min as one time step one time unit therefore one day has 96 time units the periodogram and power spectral density psd graphs yang et al 2018 are the main tools to analyse the fft results the periodogram uncovers the periodic water quality components both normal and abnormal while the psd graph uncovers its aperiodicity i e temporal scale free phenomena after calculating the average sampling time and sampling frequency for spectral analysis the fft results are normalized in the periodogram the frequency unit is set as once per day day 1 on the x axis for the sake of physical interpretation on the y axis large amplitudes denote large contributions from the corresponding periodic component the psd graph takes day 1 as the frequency unit on the x axis and uses a log log grid the welch method welch 1967 implemented by the pwelch function in matlab is used for spectrum estimation the hamming window is used and the length of windows equals the length of the analysed time series the overlap rate is set to 50 from section to section the number of fft points is equal to the length of the analysed time series the psd curves of all water quality parameters have high amplitudes in the low frequency range and the amplitude decreases with increasing frequency the utility of the cwt scalogram a plot that represents the energy percentage of each coefficient for assessing time dependent variations in high frequency river water quality was first proposed by laurence et al 1998 wavelet scalograms can precisely locate both stochastic or transient and periodic events in time and are likely to uncover fundamental structures hidden in the raw datasets laurence et al 1998 filled or unfilled contour plots of time x scale y amplitude or magnitude z are usually used to identify the location where most of the energy of the original signal is contained in terms of time and frequency there are certain errors at the beginning and end of the scalogram as a result of edge effects due to the assumption of cyclic data by cwt we attempted to identify the location duration and magnitude of anomalous events in the high resolution water quality time series during the physical interpretation of drivers wavelet coherence analysis is used with the matlab package toolbox created by grinsted et al 2004 precipitation water quality and discharge time series parameters are analysed in regions of the time frequency plane where coherence exceeds 0 5 the phase of the cross spectrum wavelet indicates the relative lag between coherent components the phase is indicated by arrows oriented in a particular direction the cone of influence coi designates the edge effect affected area and in the area outside the coi edge effects are commonly neglected liu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying periodicity and aperiodicity of long term water quality fluctuations 3 1 1 periodic characteristics of water quality fluctuations the single sided spectra of six water quality parameters at site 01646000 are shown in fig 4 as an example the periodograms for all other monitoring sites are shown in figs s10 s12 the discharge periodogram for the four major sites is shown in fig s13 in the supplementary materials the periodic signal information which was observed by identifying the periodogram peaks for the four major sites is listed in table s3 the diurnal period can be set as a subjective threshold to distinguish high and low frequencies due to the daily cycle of human activity and natural environment changes whitfield 1995 here the seasonal to annual period is marked as s and the diurnal period is marked as d see the lower left subplot in fig 4 it is easy to understand the low frequency components presented in all the water quality parameters and discharge according to the abovementioned results since yearly half yearly and seasonal fluctuations are more naturally driven kirchner 2016 particularly discharge and conductivity fluctuations in the potomac river present only yearly cycles at all stations there are no other periodic components in the literature high frequency periodic river water quality characteristics were reported much less often than seasonal and annual river water quality cycles in the potomac river water temperature ph and do present a diurnal periodic component due to earth s rotation and a semi diurnal pattern due to tides interestingly site 01632900 is far more than 100 km in flow path from the coast fig 2 but it also has a sub diurnal periodic component on the other hand cond nox n and turb relate to more complex water solutes so they did not present high frequency periodic components in fact these factors present an interesting aperiodic phenomenon temporal scaling the results illustrate that energy exchange acid base balance oxygen consumption and reaeration processes are directly controlled by daily weather variations and tidal movements for example according to physical chemistry as water temperature rises the co2 dissolved in shallow water deceases resulting in a ph increase there is a relationship ph t2 ph t1 Œ≥ t2 t1 where Œ≥ is the coefficient of ph relative to the temperature Œ≥ 0 011 however the processes involving mineral substances nutrients and suspended solids in the stream are complex and the effects of daily temperature change and tides can be easily masked an exception is that the conductivity at site 01654000 presented a semi diurnal periodic signal due to its relative proximity to the coast a high frequency periodic signal for discharge was not observed 3 1 2 aperiodic dynamics temporal scaling of water quality fluctuations if the spectral power s of the time series as a function of frequency f follows the power law then the time series is time fractal or temporal scaling s f f Œ≤ where Œ≤ is the scaling exponent in a given frequency range s decreases with f the spectral segments can be fitted by straight lines using the least square method obtaining the scale index Œ≤ the Œ≤ value can quantify the long term autocorrelation and randomness of water quality dynamics the larger the Œ≤ value is the stronger the autocorrelation is otherwise the randomness is strong a Œ≤ value in the range 0 Œ≤ 1 is stationary fractional gaussian noise a Œ≤ value in the range 1 Œ≤ 3 is the fractional brownian movement kirchner et al 2000 yang et al 2018 psd analysis shows that the temporal scaling phenomenon 1 f fluctuation of conductivity nox n and turbidity fluctuation universally exists in the potomac river this result indicates that no periodic signal has a particularly strong pitch on these water quality fluctuations as opposed to ph and do processes involving riverine mineral substances nutrients and suspended sediments are more complex and can easily mask the contribution from diurnal temperature changes and tides the values of the scaling exponent Œ≤ were between 1 and 3 as shown in table 3 the psd graphs in fig 5 site 01654000 as an example and figs s16 s21 this result indicates that the non stationary fractal brownian motion behaviour dominates the water quality dynamics in the potomac river which is consistent with the results first discovered by kirchner and neal 2013 in british rivers the difference is that the scaling exponent Œ≤ of nitrate nitrogen and conductivity here are much larger than those of british rivers where Œ≤ ranges from 1 2 to 1 4 here most Œ≤ values are close to 2 which indicates that the water quality fluctuation in the potomac river has a stronger positive autocorrelation than that in british rivers kirchner and neal 2013 which may be related to tide sensitivity and groundwater exchange in particular the nox n fluctuation characteristics are consistent with the latest results in an agriculture dominated watershed in iowa usa by hansen and singh 2018 in addition the order of the scaling exponent Œ≤ for the three solutes was significant Œ≤cond Œ≤nox n Œ≤turb and the pattern of conductivity was similar to that of nox n turb has differences between frequency components larger than 7 10 days and those less than that in contrast psd discharge has an inflection point at approximately a diurnal to semi diurnal period this factor exhibits white noise scaling for low frequencies below the diurnal period steepening to 1 f 3 at high frequencies si appendix fig s20 kirchner and neal 2013 to highlight the temporal scaling characteristics of the high frequency component a 15 day based analysis for different seasons was conducted si appendix figs s27 s30 interestingly the results show that only turbidity tends to have temporal scaling during most seasons the temporal scaling of conductance is significant in spring april and that of nox n is significant in fall october the aforementioned results extend the understanding of the high frequency performance of water quality temporal scaling 3 1 3 periodic water quality fluctuation anomalies the definition of periodic water quality fluctuation anomalies is relatively subjective compared with transient anomaly events in this study temp ph and do presented significant high frequency periodic patterns with 2 cycles per day 12 h period 3 cycles per day 8 h period or even 4 cycles per day 6 h period although the amplitude was relatively low si appendix table s3 these events can be viewed as periodic high frequency anomalous events compared with the results at reference site 01636845 which is far from the coast similar patterns of periodic changes in temp ph and do were observed these anomalies are not caused by seasonal tides but require further analysis of their cause half year components were also found for example these components were found in temp and nox n at site 01632900 ph and turb at site 01646000 nox n and turb at site 01654000 and ph at site 01645762 some parameters even have seasonal periods such as nox n at site 01654000 and ph at site 01645762 these anomalies can be recognized as periodic low frequency anomalies with a large recurrence period 3 2 short term transient water quality fluctuation anomalies the cwt and contour scalogram were mainly used to identify transient water quality events e g figs 6 and 7 the range of scaling factor a on the y axis is set from 1 to 128 since transient events are usually relative to the occurrence of high frequency signals the projections between scale a and pseudo frequencies in the cwt are listed in table 4 the increasing values of a on the y axis indicate decreasing frequency or stretching out of the analysed wave the time location factor b is shown on the x axis i e time steps with a unit of 15 min the blank portion of the plot is the area with no anomalies the coloured portion indicates the presence of an anomaly that is they express the amount of match established between the analysed wavelet and the input signal at that particular point for that particular scale the percentage of energy is measured by the scale bar on the right a red colour indicates a strong anomaly and blue indicates a weak anomaly significant anomalous events are identified and typical cases for each water quality parameter and monitoring site are listed and explained in si appendix figs s31 s37 where the y axis scale range is different for different parameters and sites depending on the amount or duration of the anomalies present these ranges were chosen by the trial and error method 3 2 1 two anomaly patterns in the frequency domain of water quality fluctuations two types of anomalies were recognized in the frequency domain from the results of the cwt scalogram section 2 4 see fig 6 type i features an abrupt change in the time domain namely a sudden rise or fall in water quality values anomalies were detected at points where the parameter value either unexpectedly increased or decreased in a short time interval type 2 features a large swing in the time domain anomalies were detected at points where the degree of parameter value fluctuation increased with a corresponding increase in the fluctuation amplitude the first anomaly type can be easily detected in the time domain while the second type is hidden and more difficult to identify in the time domain transient anomalies in discharge fluctuation mainly belong to type i si appendix fig s31 this result indicates that the drivers of discharge will not have a large shock in a short period and that large time lag effects exist the solute water quality parameters of nox n cond and turb mainly present type 1 anomalies do and temp are mainly type ii anomalies the latter is associated with period changes and the values fluctuate in a narrow fixed range 3 2 2 anomaly duration identification the anomaly duration can be easily identified from the scalograms fig 7 presents a typical do anomaly at site 01632900 in some intervals and represents a classical type ii anomaly pattern the yellow patches start to appear at 3 13x104 on 10th april 2016 at 01 00 and begin to disappear between 3 21x104 units on 21st april 2016 at 07 00 on the x axis therefore we can say that a strong anomaly occurred over the duration of approximately 11 days however the truncation of energy thresholds as anomalies is slightly subjective in this study computer vision or entropy based approaches would help automatically identify the anomaly locations and patterns heidari bafroui and ohadi 2014 3 2 3 fundamental characteristics of transient water quality anomalies 1 anomaly occurrence differed among water quality parameters do showed the most anomalies and ph showed very few anomalies temp had a fairly small number of anomalies present and the other water quality parameters showed moderate anomaly presence correspondence between the anomaly and correlation was found for only parameter pairs with high correlation values 2 anomaly duration differed among water quality parameters the order of the average anomaly durations is do 10 20 days temp 7 days nox n 4 days turb 3 days the numbers in parentheses are typical durations the anomaly durations for cond vary widely 3 regarding spatial differences the occurrences of anomalous events foa for each parameter and site were counted and are listed in table 5 more details associated with land use are discussed in the next section 4 to investigate the energy distribution characteristics coloured magnitude scalograms were used to inspect the anomalies over all frequency ranges fig 8 high spectral energy areas were mainly present in high frequency areas on a daily scale which is consistent with the setup of the contour scalogram with scales below 128 the spectral energy of do and temp in anomalous regions present symmetric distributions with the frequencies y direction in the scalograms see fig 7 and si appendix figs s34 35 the energy peak of the two parameters normally appears at a 1 day period i e scale a 78 in the x direction temporal location do usually presents a right skewed distribution which indicates that the abnormal do fluctuation accelerates in the latter part of an anomalous event this acceleration has additive effects and early stage control is efficient the spectral energies of cond turb and nox n have asymmetric frequency distributions turbidity is more skewed towards high frequencies while nox n is more skewed towards low frequencies fig 9 these factors reflect different time series fluctuation features turbidity anomalies more often occur from increasing and recovering concentrations and nox n anomalies more often occur from decreasing and recovering concentrations in the x direction the three parameters usually present symmetric distributions which indicates that the tailing effects of solute processes during transient events are not significant at a 15 minute temporal resolution 3 3 driver analysis and causality interpretation of the anomalies many factors influence the differences in riverine water quality across space and time land cover land use land management atmospheric deposition geology and soil type climate topography and catchment hydrology are the key features lintern et al 2018 among these the drivers of the river water quality time series anomalies mainly include changes in human activity and natural conditions including point source inputs e g chemical spills and combined sewer overflow non point source inputs e g storm events and rapid land cover change and internal pollution release 3 3 1 influencing factors of high frequency periodic anomalies tides are a natural driver of the periodic water quality anomalies in the potomac river basin to justify the assumption of tide impacts on periodic water quality anomalies section 3 1 3 fourier analysis was further conducted of 15 days of water quality time series at site 01632900 si appendix figs s6 s9 the whole catchment is far from the estuary and not impacted by tides periodograms for four seasons april july october and jan feb are provided in appendix si figs s23 s26 the results show that the sub diurnal cycles of water temperature ph and do are all significant except for water temperature and ph in april in winter jan 21 feb 4 the sub diurnal periodic signals are the most significant we can conclude that the half day cycle does not result from tidal movement the reason is elusive and may perhaps result from voltage variation at the automatic monitoring facilities additional localized analyses are necessary 3 3 2 influence of land use on transient anomalies land use strongly impacts river water quality variations khan et al 2018 lintern et al 2018 a land use map of the potomac river basin was produced based on the nlcd 2011 database si appendix fig s39 this map shows that the potomac river basin is 54 6 forested recently land use in the potomac river basin has been stable a map for each catchment around the five monitoring sites was produced by arcgis 10 2 as shown in fig 10 the land use type percentages are presented in table 5 the land types of the sub basins at each monitoring station are significantly different the land use types of the selected water quality monitoring stations are mainly forest developed and agricultural land different land types lead to different sub catchment water qualities and the runoff pollution is also very different developed land produces urban runoff agricultural land produces agricultural non point source pollution and forestland is only scoured by rainfall runoff catchments with more developed land have more and stronger events than catchments with large percentages of forest or agricultural land the catchment of site 01654000 has the largest percentage of developed land 75 and is most easily impacted by human activity such as urban runoff pollution this is why our results show far more anomalous events at site 01654000 than at other sites the catchment of site 01632900 has the largest proportion of agricultural land 45 8 and the strength and occurrence of anomalies at this site ranked second the other two catchments have similar land use distributions and the anomalies show similar patterns no direct linear relationship exists between land use and water quality anomalies however interestingly the frequency of occurrence of turbidity anomaly events foa is proportional to the rate of developed land area de the foa of water temperature the foa of nox n is proportional to the rate of forest land area for the foa of discharge table 5 and fig 11 this result is reasonable and can be explained by the strong direct linkage of discharge and water temperature to precipitation and air temperature and the concept of climate elasticity of water quality cewq proposed by jiang et al 2014 previous studies showed that the precipitation elasticity of total nitrogen unfiltered is proportional to the land use forest percentage ervinia et al 2019 khan et al 2017a khan et al 2017b these basic relationships are straightforward but more case studies are needed to extrapolate the regression equations for to areas e g those with different climates and human activity patterns 3 3 3 influence of storm water on transient anomalies and hysteresis characteristics stormwater is a typical driver of water quality anomalies not only in natural water but also in urban receiving water the high resolution time series of precipitation at meteorological station 390927077330900 is shown in appendix si figs s41 s42 the water quality at site 01646000 is mainly discussed here as an example the combined plot of the scalogram and the time series curves of water quality anomalies relative to precipitation events are listed in figs 12 14 and appendix si figs s43 s49 for visual inspection the order of occurrence of precipitation and water quality anomalies shows the potential causality wavelet coherence analysis was also conducted gan et al 2007 grinsted et al 2004 labat 2010 liu et al 2017 and the time frequency plots of the wavelet coherence are listed in fig 15 and si appendix figs s50 s51 the presence of high coherence regions yellow colour and the arrow directions denote the coherent relationship the coherence plots can help uncover hidden coherence rules both the combined scalogram and coherence plots show that the influence of storm water events on water temperature ph and conductance anomalies is not universal while the influence on turbidity nox n and discharge anomalies is significant and universal significant yellow areas in fig 15 and the influence on do is sometimes observed fig 13 in the combined scalogram a time lag between storm water and water quality anomalies exists we simply define the time lag as the period starting from the rail of the wavelet anomaly left to the storm water peaks fig 12a for do and the time interval between the precipitation peak and the scalogram contour peak for turbidity and nox n it is likely that the phase relationship as the characterization of time lag or lead is shown by the orientation of the arrows in the regions of high coherence see fig 15 coherence analysis presents significantly different coherent fluctuation behaviours in high frequency and low frequency regions for turbidity fig 15a the wavelet cross spectrum captures œÄ 2 1 4 cycle phase lag arrow pointing upwards at the frequency of 0 5 1 day 1 and œÄ phase lag at the frequency of 2 4 day 1 but no phase lag arrow pointing right from the two month period to the one week period this result shows that transient turbidity events follow precipitation by an average of 9 12 h as illustrated in the combined scalogram fig 14 the time lags for the turbidity peak response range from a prompt response to approximately 1 day after the storm events the lags are basically consistent one occasional finding is that the coherence of precipitation to turbidity is also significant in the super high frequency area with a 30 minute to 1 hour period super hi notation in fig 15a no such phenomenon exists for other water quality parameters or for discharge this phenomenon may be because precipitation can locally change the turbidity i e a slight increase in turbidity soon after precipitation starts due to the entry of suspended matter on both sides of the river and strong water mixing from the rainfall at this moment the discharge remains unstable since it takes time for upstream storm runoff to be generated this fine level of water quality dynamics has never before been so clearly illustrated by data this interesting phenomenon is significantly present at sites 01646000 01645762 and 01654000 but not apparent at site 01632900 probably because of the low rate of developed area at site 01632900 table 5 and or the long distance from the site to the meteorological station nox n also presents different patterns of coherence with precipitation in high frequency and low frequency regions the strangely reverse coherence is significant periods of approximately 2 months to 10 days frequency 0 01667 0 1 day 1 show anti phase behaviour arrow pointing left or lower left this means that nox n leads precipitation by a phase of œÄ 1 2 cycle to 3 4œÄ during the winter season from december 2016 to february 2017 and the winter season from january 2018 to february 2018 the 2 day 1 week period frequency 0 5 0 143 day 1 shows arrows point straight down which indicate that nox n leads precipitation by œÄ 2 1 4 cycle namely 1 3 days ahead this result is consistent with the result of the combined scalogram the strange pseudo causality is difficult to explain site 01645762 has similar characteristics but the other two sites 01654000 and 01632900 have opposite characteristics these sites have the regular phase delay of nox n fluctuation behaviour in which most nox n anomalies come after storm water starts among the identified relative nox n fluctuation anomalies si appendix fig s48 the time lag is very short and ranges from a prompt response to approximately 8 h the nox n and turbidity anomalies that cannot be explained by precipitation should be attributed to source inputs to the catchments certainly precipitation events will not always lead to water quality anomalies do presents interesting reserve coherence with precipitation from december to february at weekly and monthly periods at every site fig 12 si appendix figs s53 54 do leads precipitation by approximately one day to one week 7 days which is consistent with the combined scalogram see fig 12 the duration of the anomalies is much longer than the duration of storm events it usually occurs during summer in many cases the do anomalies stopped until significant rainfall started fig 12b d according to the time series the do fluctuation is relatively large over time during anomalous events this relationship might be due to atmospheric pressure anomalies prior to storms during summer cox 2003 nakova et al 2009 3 4 watershed management implications and new opportunities 3 4 1 flexibility of the proposed spectral analysis framework fft and cwt were adopted for water quality fluctuation measurements in this work since they are the most widely used and verified measurements in practice other optional spectral analysis techniques are also available but with only very limited studies in hydrology for example the hilbert huang transform hht franceschini and tsai 2010 as a descriptive technique for the analysis of non stationary and nonlinear time series can be used for analysis trends and frequency distribution as well as anomalies singular spectrum analysis ssa marques et al 2006 can be used to detect time varying periodic signals and extract modulated oscillations these methods are also promising for integration into the proposed framework fig 3 to extract features of trends periodicity and anomalies the selected study area the potomac river exhibits typical characteristics the periodic characteristics anomaly patterns and features are universal and can be found in other catchments by the proposed analysis framework the drivers and casualties of the periodicity and anomalies can differ from catchment to catchment particularly for those areas where the water quality is largely impacted and controlled by point sources in this circumstance on the other hand the proposed spectral analysis framework can be used to identify the pattern of point source release and improve management how the other water quality parameters perform on the frequency domain under the measurements with high temporal resolution is unknown and cannot be simply deducted from other parameters this study focused on normal water quality parameters since they are most easily and stably observed at fine intervals by sensors the main sources of these fluctuations are natural processes or agriculture toxic metals hao et al 2015 kirchner and neal 2013 are worthy of further investigation in the future where the anomaly features very likely differ from those of ordinary parameters due to different processes and sources the high resolution chemical dynamics of organic toxicity e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs franceschini and tsai 2010 hu et al 2016 are difficult to analyse due to the constraints of monitoring technology perhaps their fluctuations would be too small at a fine temporal resolution to be necessarily investigated 3 4 2 new insights into the detailed structures of water quality dynamics high frequency monitoring sensors combined with spectral analysis provide a new way to investigate the fine details of water quality dynamics the fine details and patterns of anomalies in sections 3 1 and 3 2 are reported here for the first time in the literature these results are helpful for stormwater event management marc√© et al 2016 as they consider the time lag and transit time the patterns of the do and water temperature fluctuations can reflect or perhaps even predict precipitation coherent oscillation behaviour between precipitation and water quality parameters reveals storm event hysteresis it is important to determine the randomness of water quality variables for their interpolation modelling and prediction for example the interpolation of missing data is challenging for water quality parameters with time fractal behaviour at present a process based water quality model cannot depict high resolution temporal fluctuations spectral analysis can probably help develop data driven water quality models piniewski et al 2019 in addition with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution of the river monitoring network spectral analysis combined with other tools e g virtual source analysis can help to identify pollution sources and estimate source contributions as in acoustics hosseini fouladi et al 2009 pallas et al 2008 this process provides a new point of view on the source pathway relationship 3 4 3 new index and framework for watershed water quality management high frequency monitoring sensors combined with spectral analysis can provide new evaluation indices and frameworks for watershed classification and water quality management on a watershed scale the anomaly response characteristics from the watershed or catchment can characterize its reliability resilience and vulnerability for use as a watershed health index ervinia et al 2019 the time lag of the response to external drivers the frequency of anomaly occurrence and the anomaly strengths of different water quality parameters are typical quantitative features this approach requires at least two years of continuous monitoring data most recently p√©rez ciria and chiogna 2020 developed a catchment classification tool to determine the crucial scales of variability of a non stationary runoff time series by using wt three main runoff behaviours i e classes were found at the yearly scale in the alps frameworks or tools based on anomaly characteristics have not yet been reported in addition utilizing a machine vision approach machine learning technology li and zhou 2016 zhao and zhang 2005 can capture the frequency domain characteristics from a large amount of spectral analysis results from a watershed monitoring site big data analysis directly reflects a comprehensive approach to watershed water quality dynamics 3 4 4 new algorithm for online anomaly detection and response time analysis for early warning as discussed in the introduction a wavelet based anomaly detection algorithm can recognize an anomaly only on a scalogram with sufficient recent data as well as sufficient historical baseline data fig 16 presents a typical process to establish a cwt based online water quality anomaly detection approach one core component is automatic wavelet energy identification based on the results of shift and scaling parameters a and b eq 6 many approaches have been developed such as wavelet entropy heidari bafroui and ohadi 2014 ren and sun 2008 on the one hand the use of a comprehensive method can introduce more reporting stability compared to a local alarm method on the other hand water managers need a quick response time we conducted a fundamental analysis of response time the turbidity time series at site 01646000 was selected as an example a moving window like approach was used to identify the minimum response time the latest monitoring data are added to the target time series point by point for the wt the calculation and iteration stop when a significant anomaly is detected the response time is then identified as the time elapsed in the target time series fig 17 demonstrates typical response time scenarios the response time of fig 17a is 1060 1024 4 h 1 9 h the response time of b is 3055 2993 4 h 1 15 5 h and the response time of c is 96 4 h 1 24 h 1 day therefore additional time steps may be needed for long anomalous events the online cwt based comprehensive anomaly detection approach takes 9 h to 1 day to respond if we increase the monitoring frequency i e the temporal resolution of water quality dynamics the response time will be improved as shown in fig 17d the response time improved to 1060 980 20 h 1 4 h different from the direct alarm method when a threshold is exceeded this algorithm includes historical baseline fluctuation characteristics which represents a more reliable and integrated approach this approach can complement the direct alarm method in practice to decrease the false positive rate 4 conclusions river water quality presents complex fluctuations under the influence of natural environmental movement and human activities this work systemically defines and analyses the periodicity and aperiodicity short term and long term patterns high frequency and low frequency oscillations as well as the normal baseline and abnormal fluctuations in water quality these fluctuations are integrated into a common spectral analysis framework case studies on the potomac river with two years of high temporal resolution measurements of six water quality parameters and discharge were conducted particular attention was paid to transient anomaly events the following results were achieved 1 fourier analysis shows that temp ph and do have typical low frequency periodicity such as seasonal and bi annual periodicity in particular this study is the first to discover abnormal high frequency periodic fluctuations such as fluctuations of 8 and 12 h in non tidal catchments cond turb and nox n present universal temporal scaling aperiodicity i e 1 f fluctuation at every site from the psd the scaling exponents Œ≤ range from 1 0 to 2 4 but most are near 2 and generally ordered as Œ≤cond Œ≤nox n Œ≤turb the fluctuations in the potomac river are more strongly auto correlated than those in the british rivers reported by kirchner and neal 2013 2 wavelet analysis successfully identified the time location duration and magnitude of transient anomaly events and classified two anomaly patterns abrupt changes and large swings the two patterns have clearly different pseudo frequency spectral energy distributions water quality parameters have the following order of occurrence i e foa do others ph and duration order do temp nox n turb the spectral energy distributions in anomalous regions present opposite symmetricity between the set of do and temp and the set of cond turb and nox n 3 land use type very likely influences transient water quality events foaturb is proportional to de foatemp r 0 98 p 0 005 and foanox n is proportional to for foadisc r 0 95 p 0 05 precipitation obviously influences turb nox n and discharge anomalies however the hysteresis characteristics vary for different water quality parameters significantly different coherent fluctuation behaviours exist between the high frequency and low frequency regions for turb and nox n 4 many fine details and dynamic water quality phenomena have been reported in this study for the first time some findings are difficult to explain at this stage 5 with the assistance of the proposed spectral analysis framework we can uncover new insights into the fine details of water quality dynamics develop new indices and assessment frameworks for managing the water quality reliability resilience and vulnerability of a watershed and design new comprehensive algorithms for online anomaly detection the wt based online anomaly detection algorithms can respond in 4 h with high frequency monitoring which can complement a local thresholding method this comprehensive study filled the knowledge gaps in the frequency domain characteristics of detailed water quality dynamics in the age of sensing and data intensive

5243,systemic analysis of hydrology and water quality fluctuations using a data intensive approach is an emerging research area and is significant for understanding hydrological processes however there is very limited understanding of the high frequency characteristics of water quality fluctuations in the frequency domain this study proposes a generic systemic framework to comprehensively analyse river water quality dynamics using a combination of fourier and wavelet spectral analyses with high temporal resolution measurements this framework identifies long term short term periodic aperiodic normal baseline and abnormal fluctuations with particularly focus on detecting transient anomaly events due to their importance for watershed management this study was conducted on the potomac river usa where seven parameters water temperature temp ph dissolved oxygen do conductance cond turbidity turb nitrate plus nitrite nox n and discharge disc were monitored every 15 min for two years at five sites sub catchments fast fourier transform fft revealed that temp ph and do exhibited typical low frequency periodic fluctuations such as seasonal and bi annual fluctuations as well as interesting high frequency periodic fluctuations such as 12 hour and 8 hour fluctuations which were identified as periodic anomalies cond turb and nox n presented universal temporal scaling phenomena i e 1 f fluctuation at all sites as shown by the power spectral density the scaling exponent Œ≤ ranged between 1 and 3 and presented the order of Œ≤cond Œ≤nox n Œ≤turb the continuous wavelet transform cwt associated with contour based scalograms successfully identified the time location duration and magnitude of transient anomaly events and classified two anomaly patterns abrupt changes and large swings the two patterns exhibited clearly different spectral energy distributions i e pseudo frequencies on the cwt scales a preliminary causality analysis found that the frequency of occurrence of turbidity anomaly events foaturb was proportional to the product of the developed land area percentage and foatemp and foanox n was proportional to the product of forest land area percentage and foadisc wavelet coherence analysis showed different hysteresis characteristics of different water quality parameters in particular turb and nox n presented significantly different coherent fluctuation behaviours between high frequency and low frequency regions some findings of this study are still difficult to explain at this stage high frequency monitoring combined with spectral analysis provides new insights into the details of water quality dynamics which can help to develop a new index and framework for the reliability resilience and management of watershed water quality vulnerability these results can also be used to design new algorithms for online anomaly detection keywords anomalous events coherence analysis fourier transform high frequency monitoring wavelet transform water quality 1 introduction a river or catchment can respond to external influencing factors and internal transport processes lintern et al 2018 which leads to complex water quality fluctuations called water quality dynamics kirchner et al 2004 the investigation of the multiscale characteristics of water quality signals is a fundamental research topic in environmental hydrology kirchner et al 2004 information on the nature of the water quality dynamic response to different events provides an indication of the structure and health of an aquatic ecosystem dohan and whitfield 1997 water quality fluctuation signals can be naturally classified as periodic long term and non periodic including both long term and short term fluctuations patterns periodic patterns are the natural baseline for aquatic species variations and always include low frequency components e g seasonal annual and decadal patterns and high frequency components e g daily and weekly whitfield 1995 non periodic patterns can be long term trends e g water becoming cleaner temporal scaling behaviours chang and yeh 2018 kirchner and neal 2013 or short term transient events e g storm water and chemical spills according to the relative frequency of occurrence the consequences of events and the resulting water quality fluctuations can also be classified as normal or abnormal i e anomalous events shi et al 2018 the definition of an event as normal or abnormal is sometimes subjective the complete framework of water quality fluctuation patterns is summarized in fig 1 seasonal and diurnal cycles are well known processes that dominate the periodic component of a water quality signal graziano and jones 2017 however due to the complexity of influencing factors the long term fluctuations of chemical components will show temporal fractal or scale free characteristics in the frequency domain temporal scale free behaviour is an interesting important phenomenon of stream chemistry that has recently received increasing attention hansen and singh 2018 yang et al 2018 the concept can be originally traced back to mandelbrot the founder of fractal theory in 1981 who explained the hurst phenomenon and extended brownian motion to establish a random model of fractional brownian motion to simulate annual runoff series bloschl and sivapalan 1995 the first milestone was the work conducted by kirchner et al 2000 the possible causes of the 1 f time fractal and its influences on water quality trend detection and solute transport were explored although these works were ground breaking the temporal resolution of the study reached the precision of only a 7 hour sampling interval and other scenarios were not analysed such as analyses in a large watershed or a tidal river with the increasing use of sensors high resolution measurements of river water quality are becoming increasingly popular helping to manage the temporal patterns of the water environment in new ways blaen et al 2017 kunz et al 2017 rode et al 2016 for example hansen and singh 2018 investigated how the nitrate concentration interacts with discharge and water temperature in agricultural basins seasonal and diurnal cycles can also be recognized as anomalous events these events have been widely observed and commonly investigated in climatology and oceanography e g the el ni√±o southern oscillation grinsted et al 2004 a typical case in urban hydrology is perennial analyses of flood recurrence however this concept has rarely been studied in water quality related catchment hydrology periodic anomalous events related to the fluctuations in river water quality can be not only low frequency with a long recurrence period e g nutrient response to periodic hydrological fluctuations wang et al 2012 and eutrophication during summer but also high frequency with a short recurrence period e g tidal reach water temperature abnormalities due to regular wastewater discharge from power plant cooling and water quality abnormalities due to regular plant sewage discharge low frequency fluctuations are normally driven by natural influencing factors while high frequency fluctuations are associated with human activities long term periodic anomalous events can also be recognized as the re occurrence of a short term transient event with the same pattern and frequency it is important to identify the occurrence frequency and pattern of short term abnormal water quality events hernandez ramirez et al 2019 as early as 1997 dohan and whitfield combined 15 minute high frequency sensor monitoring with the wavelet transform wt method to identify short term abnormal events such as rainfall and pollution leakage from conductivity and temperature measurements dohan and whitfield 1997 whitfield and dohan 1997 and they identified the approximate location duration and intensity of these events by separating their periodic signals unfortunately this research has been previously ignored the paper has only ten citations google scholar this pioneering work is mainly a simple demonstration of the anomaly detection methodology that can be used for one water quality parameter conductance the corresponding influencing factors are not analysed urban water anomaly detection methods have been extensively reported and mainly focused on drainage systems laucelli et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 however the detection of catchment hydrology anomalies has not been thoroughly investigated leigh et al 2019 published anomaly detection methods can be classified as instant threshold methods alarming when the monitored values exceed a threshold baseline based methods alarming when new fluctuations exceed the historical baseline fluctuation range locality methods using only recent monitoring data and entirety methods using the whole time series data intensive methods or phenomenological modelling have been widely used to investigate water quality dynamics spectral analyses such as the fourier transform hansen and singh 2018 kirchner and neal 2013 wavelet analysis sang et al 2013 and the hilbert huang transform franceschini and tsai 2010 are useful tools spectral analysis can be unitized to create a universal analysis framework for river water quality dynamics to cover the fluctuation patterns as shown in fig 1 fourier analysis provides a rough idea of the frequency components in a particular signal it is best suited for analysing seasonal and diurnal periods power spectra based on the fast fourier transform fft are usually used for periodic analysis in hydrology duran et al 2020 this method can help estimate the extent to which transient data are present in a particular input signal the presence of significantly fewer high frequency components signifies a reduced possibility of transient events so the method can be used for transient event detection whitfield 1995 fourier transform assumes a stationary time invariant signal however transient events are non stationary and vary over time hence they do not meet the fourier transform requirements wavelet analysis is widely used for signal processing with both stationary and non stationary data chang and yeh 2018 daubechies 1988 the key to wavelet analysis is partitioning the signal variation into two domains scale and time location thus with wavelet analysis we can zoom in or out to obtain detailed variations that occur at a specific temporal scale or time kang and lin 2007 wavelet analysis has been increasingly used in hydrology such as for data cleaning he et al 2008 forecasting shi et al 2018 extrapolation nalley et al 2020 and coherence analysis liu et al 2017 sang 2013 sang et al 2013 provide a comprehensive review of this topic laurence et al 1998 was the first to apply wavelet analysis to study stream flow features in hydrology they studied 91 streams in five us hydro climatic regions wavelet analysis showed the distribution of event time scales and local hydro climatic regimes labat 2005 investigated wavelet analysis of rainfall and runoff which separated pumping and naturally intermittent runoff sub processes and found some useful temporal variations such as a fast flow response due to conduit flow and a slow response due to internal reserves previous studies have mainly focused on low frequency monthly time series anctil and coulibaly 2004 coulibaly and burn 2004 labat et al 2005 studies on wt based water quality dynamics are quite limited compared with those on streamflow dynamics p√©rez ciria and chiogna 2020 kang and lin 2007 was the first study to employ the wt to analyse the detailed temporal patterns of water quality signals over different temporal scales the temporal resolutions of the investigated nitrate chloride and sodium time series were low with sampling occurring every two weeks d√∂kmen and aslan 2013 evaluated extreme events based on monthly ph nitrate and chlorine datasets with discrete wt some studies were purely mathematical for example parmar and bhardwaj 2013 summarized the features of wt parameters on 9 water quality indicators including chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod dissolved oxygen do and ammonia using the db5 wavelet rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 is the only study that investigated water quality at an hourly temporal resolution water temperature and do were evenly sampled at a 1 hour time interval this study mainly focused on low frequency periodic characteristics thus anomalies were not mentioned therefore the above analysis shows that a very limited number of studies have explored the high frequency characteristics of water quality fluctuations in the frequency domain to gain insights into the interesting dynamics influenced by tides storms pollution human activities and other factors a comprehensive investigation under an integrated framework by using spectral analysis has not been reported in particular the anomaly characteristics of typical water quality parameters are far more recognized and understood in the big data era it is timely to remind hydrologists to implement ground breaking techniques in signal analysis that will significantly benefit catchment water quality management over short term intervals to address all these gaps the objectives of this study are 1 to establish a generic spectral analysis framework to comprehensively investigate river water quality dynamics 2 to identify periodic and aperiodic fluctuation characteristics of long term time series particularly focused on the recognition of temporal patterns of high frequency characteristics with high temporal resolution measurements 3 to identify periodic and transient anomalous river water quality events with high temporal resolution measurements and to identify the associated anomaly patterns durations and characteristics for different parameters and catchments 4 to interpret the anomalies considering natural influence factors and 5 to discuss water quality management implications for the watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 watershed description the potomac river was selected as the study area in this study this river is located in themid atlanticregion of theunited statesand flows from thepotomac highlandsinto chesapeake bay fig 1 long term and high frequency water quality data are available for multiple parameters due to support from national and local monitoring networks moreover this river has downstream tidal reaches and good hydrology meteorology land cover and land use observations as well as other associated factors many papers and reports on hydrology and environmental science have also evaluated this area all of these advantages make this river ideal for the proposed studies the river main stream and north branch is approximately 652 km long with adrainage area of approximately 38 000 km2 across four states the majority of the basin s land area is forested 54 6 of the land area agriculture covers 26 0 of the basin s land area while developed land makes up 14 1 water and wetlands comprise 5 9 of the basin s land area according to information from the nlcd 2011 database https www potomacriver org potomac basin facts although the total maximum daily load and watershed action plans that guide stream and river restoration have been measured and implemented for many years the aquatic habitat of the potomac river and its tributaries remain vulnerable to eutrophication heavy metals pesticides and other toxic chemicals overfishing alien species and pathogens associated with faecal coliform bacteria and shellfish diseases wikipedia the potomac river basin has an average annual rainfall of 485 8 mm may is the wettest month with an average rainfall of 60 9 mm july is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24 c january is the coldest month with an average temperature of 0 c 2 2 hydrological and water quality monitoring the united states geological survey associated with the interstate commission on the potomac river basin has conducted long term monitoring of hydrological conditions and water quality on the potomac river since 1984 olson 2012 however most sites have been equipped for high frequency water quality monitoring since only october 2012 or march 2013 graziano and jones 2017 four sites on the potomac river in the state of virginia in the united states were selected for analysis all streamflow and water quality data for all parameters were obtained from the usgs s national water information system nwis the data were obtained for a total span of two years monitored every 15 min from 20th may 2016 to 20th may 2018 high resolution monitoring can capture transient processes that are easily missed with infrequent monitoring water quality parameter statistics for these sites are shown in table 2 including water temperature temp ph do conductance cond turbidity turb nitrate plus nitrite nox n and discharge disc table s1 in appendix si shows the correlation values between different pairs of water quality parameters all the data series have gaps shown by the missing rate in table 2 due to either routine maintenance or seasonality the missing rate is low for all parameters except discharge at site 01632900 large data gaps longer than two weeks are not filled small gaps less than 3 h are filled by linear regression with the previous and following 4 time steps data gaps larger than 3 h are all replaced by the last previous value when this approach is compared to the auto regression used in hansen and singh 2018 there is almost no difference in the final analysis results precipitation data were downloaded from water resources virginia and the west virginia water science center https va water usgs gov webmap precip va which were monitored at a 5 min resolution by real time precipitation radar images from the national weather service meteorological stations 01652500 and 390927077330900 table 1 were selected as the two precipitation observation sites closest to the studied water quality monitoring sites both stations are approximately 40 km from the water quality site 01645762 fig 2 to match the temporal resolution of the water quality data the precipitation dataset at station 390927077330900 began on 20th may and continued until 20th may 2018 the station 01652500 dataset began on 1st september 2016 and continued until 20th may 2018 at a 15 min temporal resolution the air temperature datasets with 15 min resolution near the study area were not accessed table 2 a land use map of the potomac basin with 30 m 30 m resolution was downloaded and recreated from nlcd 2011 land cover 2011 edition amended 2014 by the national geospatial data asset ngda land use land cover jin et al 2013 usgs 2014 we assumed that only very small changes in land use and land cover occurred in the last 4 years in the study area to delineate the catchment associated with the monitoring sites a digital elevation model dem was imported into the soil and water assessment tool swat then using the burn in function the stream network was overlaid onto the dem to outline the watershed and sub watershed boundaries 2 3 spectral theory fourier and wavelet transform signal analysis consists of looking for similarities between a signal and well known mathematical functions usually supported by a clear physical meaning labat 2005 in mathematics the degree of similarity between two square continuous time integrable signals x t and y t can be indicated using the classical scalar product i x y or ixy defined as 1 i xy x t y t d t if i x y is equal to zero the two functions are said to be orthogonal any signal x t can then be projected and analysed using a set of functions y t i 1 n laurence et al 1998 where i 1 n is a set of characteristic parameters 2 i xy p i x t y t p i d t in a reverse manner x t can be expanded in terms of a linear superposition of the set of functions y t pi if the functions y t pi are orthogonal to each other the signal x t is then characterized by the values of the scalar product between the signal x t and the projection basis y t labat 2005 laurence et al 1998 trigonometric functions are typical orthogonal functions and can be analysed using the fourier transform and the wt fourier spectral analysissamples a signal over a period of time or space and divides it into its frequency components frequency domain as shown in eq 3 these components are single sinusoidal oscillations at distinct frequencies each with their own amplitude and phase the fourier transform uncovers the frequency components inherent in the signal as a sum of sinusoids therefore this method can be used to determine the periodic e g diurnal seasonal and yearly trends in hydrological parameter values the fftalgorithmcomputes thediscrete fourier

shifted and compressed or stretched versions of the wavelet known as wavelet scaling denoting the scale parameter by a and the position by b the wt equation is shown in eq 4 the continuous wavelet

time if the input signal is œà t the scaled signal will be œà t a a 0 a is a scaling factor that determines how much the signal is stretched in time the scaling factor is inversely proportional to the signal frequency that is a high scaling factor stretches out the wave which indicates a low frequency a stretched wavelet helps capture slowly occurring changes in a signal whereas a compressed wavelet helps capture abrupt changes therefore in our analysis we will use the optimum scale range values to capture the major abrupt changes anomalies in the water quality signals shifting refers to the delaying or advancing of a wavelet along the length of the signal this shifting helps analyse the entire signal in a part wise manner the morlet wavelet was used in this work the compressed and dilated versions of the morlet wavelet are moved across the signal and compared with different signal segments kang and lin 2007 the degree of correspondence between the wavelet and the signal is established at different scales a compressed version of the wavelet which has high frequency can be used to identify to brief transient peaks in the signal 2 4 spectral analysis framework to investigate water quality dynamics and anomalies fig 3 presents the technical process of the proposed spectral analysis framework for high resolution water quality dynamics this process is associated with the classification of the water quality fluctuations shown in fig 1 the fft is used here to identify periodic patterns and the 1 d cwt is used to identify transient events two year high frequency monitored time series for discharge temperature ph conductivity nitrite and nitrate nitrogen and turbidity are analysed the process uses 15 min as one time step one time unit therefore one day has 96 time units the periodogram and power spectral density psd graphs yang et al 2018 are the main tools to analyse the fft results the periodogram uncovers the periodic water quality components both normal and abnormal while the psd graph uncovers its aperiodicity i e temporal scale free phenomena after calculating the average sampling time and sampling frequency for spectral analysis the fft results are normalized in the periodogram the frequency unit is set as once per day day 1 on the x axis for the sake of physical interpretation on the y axis large amplitudes denote large contributions from the corresponding periodic component the psd graph takes day 1 as the frequency unit on the x axis and uses a log log grid the welch method welch 1967 implemented by the pwelch function in matlab is used for spectrum estimation the hamming window is used and the length of windows equals the length of the analysed time series the overlap rate is set to 50 from section to section the number of fft points is equal to the length of the analysed time series the psd curves of all water quality parameters have high amplitudes in the low frequency range and the amplitude decreases with increasing frequency the utility of the cwt scalogram a plot that represents the energy percentage of each coefficient for assessing time dependent variations in high frequency river water quality was first proposed by laurence et al 1998 wavelet scalograms can precisely locate both stochastic or transient and periodic events in time and are likely to uncover fundamental structures hidden in the raw datasets laurence et al 1998 filled or unfilled contour plots of time x scale y amplitude or magnitude z are usually used to identify the location where most of the energy of the original signal is contained in terms of time and frequency there are certain errors at the beginning and end of the scalogram as a result of edge effects due to the assumption of cyclic data by cwt we attempted to identify the location duration and magnitude of anomalous events in the high resolution water quality time series during the physical interpretation of drivers wavelet coherence analysis is used with the matlab package toolbox created by grinsted et al 2004 precipitation water quality and discharge time series parameters are analysed in regions of the time frequency plane where coherence exceeds 0 5 the phase of the cross spectrum wavelet indicates the relative lag between coherent components the phase is indicated by arrows oriented in a particular direction the cone of influence coi designates the edge effect affected area and in the area outside the coi edge effects are commonly neglected liu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying periodicity and aperiodicity of long term water quality fluctuations 3 1 1 periodic characteristics of water quality fluctuations the single sided spectra of six water quality parameters at site 01646000 are shown in fig 4 as an example the periodograms for all other monitoring sites are shown in figs s10 s12 the discharge periodogram for the four major sites is shown in fig s13 in the supplementary materials the periodic signal information which was observed by identifying the periodogram peaks for the four major sites is listed in table s3 the diurnal period can be set as a subjective threshold to distinguish high and low frequencies due to the daily cycle of human activity and natural environment changes whitfield 1995 here the seasonal to annual period is marked as s and the diurnal period is marked as d see the lower left subplot in fig 4 it is easy to understand the low frequency components presented in all the water quality parameters and discharge according to the abovementioned results since yearly half yearly and seasonal fluctuations are more naturally driven kirchner 2016 particularly discharge and conductivity fluctuations in the potomac river present only yearly cycles at all stations there are no other periodic components in the literature high frequency periodic river water quality characteristics were reported much less often than seasonal and annual river water quality cycles in the potomac river water temperature ph and do present a diurnal periodic component due to earth s rotation and a semi diurnal pattern due to tides interestingly site 01632900 is far more than 100 km in flow path from the coast fig 2 but it also has a sub diurnal periodic component on the other hand cond nox n and turb relate to more complex water solutes so they did not present high frequency periodic components in fact these factors present an interesting aperiodic phenomenon temporal scaling the results illustrate that energy exchange acid base balance oxygen consumption and reaeration processes are directly controlled by daily weather variations and tidal movements for example according to physical chemistry as water temperature rises the co2 dissolved in shallow water deceases resulting in a ph increase there is a relationship ph t2 ph t1 Œ≥ t2 t1 where Œ≥ is the coefficient of ph relative to the temperature Œ≥ 0 011 however the processes involving mineral substances nutrients and suspended solids in the stream are complex and the effects of daily temperature change and tides can be easily masked an exception is that the conductivity at site 01654000 presented a semi diurnal periodic signal due to its relative proximity to the coast a high frequency periodic signal for discharge was not observed 3 1 2 aperiodic dynamics temporal scaling of water quality fluctuations if the spectral power s of the time series as a function of frequency f follows the power law then the time series is time fractal or temporal scaling s f f Œ≤ where Œ≤ is the scaling exponent in a given frequency range s decreases with f the spectral segments can be fitted by straight lines using the least square method obtaining the scale index Œ≤ the Œ≤ value can quantify the long term autocorrelation and randomness of water quality dynamics the larger the Œ≤ value is the stronger the autocorrelation is otherwise the randomness is strong a Œ≤ value in the range 0 Œ≤ 1 is stationary fractional gaussian noise a Œ≤ value in the range 1 Œ≤ 3 is the fractional brownian movement kirchner et al 2000 yang et al 2018 psd analysis shows that the temporal scaling phenomenon 1 f fluctuation of conductivity nox n and turbidity fluctuation universally exists in the potomac river this result indicates that no periodic signal has a particularly strong pitch on these water quality fluctuations as opposed to ph and do processes involving riverine mineral substances nutrients and suspended sediments are more complex and can easily mask the contribution from diurnal temperature changes and tides the values of the scaling exponent Œ≤ were between 1 and 3 as shown in table 3 the psd graphs in fig 5 site 01654000 as an example and figs s16 s21 this result indicates that the non stationary fractal brownian motion behaviour dominates the water quality dynamics in the potomac river which is consistent with the results first discovered by kirchner and neal 2013 in british rivers the difference is that the scaling exponent Œ≤ of nitrate nitrogen and conductivity here are much larger than those of british rivers where Œ≤ ranges from 1 2 to 1 4 here most Œ≤ values are close to 2 which indicates that the water quality fluctuation in the potomac river has a stronger positive autocorrelation than that in british rivers kirchner and neal 2013 which may be related to tide sensitivity and groundwater exchange in particular the nox n fluctuation characteristics are consistent with the latest results in an agriculture dominated watershed in iowa usa by hansen and singh 2018 in addition the order of the scaling exponent Œ≤ for the three solutes was significant Œ≤cond Œ≤nox n Œ≤turb and the pattern of conductivity was similar to that of nox n turb has differences between frequency components larger than 7 10 days and those less than that in contrast psd discharge has an inflection point at approximately a diurnal to semi diurnal period this factor exhibits white noise scaling for low frequencies below the diurnal period steepening to 1 f 3 at high frequencies si appendix fig s20 kirchner and neal 2013 to highlight the temporal scaling characteristics of the high frequency component a 15 day based analysis for different seasons was conducted si appendix figs s27 s30 interestingly the results show that only turbidity tends to have temporal scaling during most seasons the temporal scaling of conductance is significant in spring april and that of nox n is significant in fall october the aforementioned results extend the understanding of the high frequency performance of water quality temporal scaling 3 1 3 periodic water quality fluctuation anomalies the definition of periodic water quality fluctuation anomalies is relatively subjective compared with transient anomaly events in this study temp ph and do presented significant high frequency periodic patterns with 2 cycles per day 12 h period 3 cycles per day 8 h period or even 4 cycles per day 6 h period although the amplitude was relatively low si appendix table s3 these events can be viewed as periodic high frequency anomalous events compared with the results at reference site 01636845 which is far from the coast similar patterns of periodic changes in temp ph and do were observed these anomalies are not caused by seasonal tides but require further analysis of their cause half year components were also found for example these components were found in temp and nox n at site 01632900 ph and turb at site 01646000 nox n and turb at site 01654000 and ph at site 01645762 some parameters even have seasonal periods such as nox n at site 01654000 and ph at site 01645762 these anomalies can be recognized as periodic low frequency anomalies with a large recurrence period 3 2 short term transient water quality fluctuation anomalies the cwt and contour scalogram were mainly used to identify transient water quality events e g figs 6 and 7 the range of scaling factor a on the y axis is set from 1 to 128 since transient events are usually relative to the occurrence of high frequency signals the projections between scale a and pseudo frequencies in the cwt are listed in table 4 the increasing values of a on the y axis indicate decreasing frequency or stretching out of the analysed wave the time location factor b is shown on the x axis i e time steps with a unit of 15 min the blank portion of the plot is the area with no anomalies the coloured portion indicates the presence of an anomaly that is they express the amount of match established between the analysed wavelet and the input signal at that particular point for that particular scale the percentage of energy is measured by the scale bar on the right a red colour indicates a strong anomaly and blue indicates a weak anomaly significant anomalous events are identified and typical cases for each water quality parameter and monitoring site are listed and explained in si appendix figs s31 s37 where the y axis scale range is different for different parameters and sites depending on the amount or duration of the anomalies present these ranges were chosen by the trial and error method 3 2 1 two anomaly patterns in the frequency domain of water quality fluctuations two types of anomalies were recognized in the frequency domain from the results of the cwt scalogram section 2 4 see fig 6 type i features an abrupt change in the time domain namely a sudden rise or fall in water quality values anomalies were detected at points where the parameter value either unexpectedly increased or decreased in a short time interval type 2 features a large swing in the time domain anomalies were detected at points where the degree of parameter value fluctuation increased with a corresponding increase in the fluctuation amplitude the first anomaly type can be easily detected in the time domain while the second type is hidden and more difficult to identify in the time domain transient anomalies in discharge fluctuation mainly belong to type i si appendix fig s31 this result indicates that the drivers of discharge will not have a large shock in a short period and that large time lag effects exist the solute water quality parameters of nox n cond and turb mainly present type 1 anomalies do and temp are mainly type ii anomalies the latter is associated with period changes and the values fluctuate in a narrow fixed range 3 2 2 anomaly duration identification the anomaly duration can be easily identified from the scalograms fig 7 presents a typical do anomaly at site 01632900 in some intervals and represents a classical type ii anomaly pattern the yellow patches start to appear at 3 13x104 on 10th april 2016 at 01 00 and begin to disappear between 3 21x104 units on 21st april 2016 at 07 00 on the x axis therefore we can say that a strong anomaly occurred over the duration of approximately 11 days however the truncation of energy thresholds as anomalies is slightly subjective in this study computer vision or entropy based approaches would help automatically identify the anomaly locations and patterns heidari bafroui and ohadi 2014 3 2 3 fundamental characteristics of transient water quality anomalies 1 anomaly occurrence differed among water quality parameters do showed the most anomalies and ph showed very few anomalies temp had a fairly small number of anomalies present and the other water quality parameters showed moderate anomaly presence correspondence between the anomaly and correlation was found for only parameter pairs with high correlation values 2 anomaly duration differed among water quality parameters the order of the average anomaly durations is do 10 20 days temp 7 days nox n 4 days turb 3 days the numbers in parentheses are typical durations the anomaly durations for cond vary widely 3 regarding spatial differences the occurrences of anomalous events foa for each parameter and site were counted and are listed in table 5 more details associated with land use are discussed in the next section 4 to investigate the energy distribution characteristics coloured magnitude scalograms were used to inspect the anomalies over all frequency ranges fig 8 high spectral energy areas were mainly present in high frequency areas on a daily scale which is consistent with the setup of the contour scalogram with scales below 128 the spectral energy of do and temp in anomalous regions present symmetric distributions with the frequencies y direction in the scalograms see fig 7 and si appendix figs s34 35 the energy peak of the two parameters normally appears at a 1 day period i e scale a 78 in the x direction temporal location do usually presents a right skewed distribution which indicates that the abnormal do fluctuation accelerates in the latter part of an anomalous event this acceleration has additive effects and early stage control is efficient the spectral energies of cond turb and nox n have asymmetric frequency distributions turbidity is more skewed towards high frequencies while nox n is more skewed towards low frequencies fig 9 these factors reflect different time series fluctuation features turbidity anomalies more often occur from increasing and recovering concentrations and nox n anomalies more often occur from decreasing and recovering concentrations in the x direction the three parameters usually present symmetric distributions which indicates that the tailing effects of solute processes during transient events are not significant at a 15 minute temporal resolution 3 3 driver analysis and causality interpretation of the anomalies many factors influence the differences in riverine water quality across space and time land cover land use land management atmospheric deposition geology and soil type climate topography and catchment hydrology are the key features lintern et al 2018 among these the drivers of the river water quality time series anomalies mainly include changes in human activity and natural conditions including point source inputs e g chemical spills and combined sewer overflow non point source inputs e g storm events and rapid land cover change and internal pollution release 3 3 1 influencing factors of high frequency periodic anomalies tides are a natural driver of the periodic water quality anomalies in the potomac river basin to justify the assumption of tide impacts on periodic water quality anomalies section 3 1 3 fourier analysis was further conducted of 15 days of water quality time series at site 01632900 si appendix figs s6 s9 the whole catchment is far from the estuary and not impacted by tides periodograms for four seasons april july october and jan feb are provided in appendix si figs s23 s26 the results show that the sub diurnal cycles of water temperature ph and do are all significant except for water temperature and ph in april in winter jan 21 feb 4 the sub diurnal periodic signals are the most significant we can conclude that the half day cycle does not result from tidal movement the reason is elusive and may perhaps result from voltage variation at the automatic monitoring facilities additional localized analyses are necessary 3 3 2 influence of land use on transient anomalies land use strongly impacts river water quality variations khan et al 2018 lintern et al 2018 a land use map of the potomac river basin was produced based on the nlcd 2011 database si appendix fig s39 this map shows that the potomac river basin is 54 6 forested recently land use in the potomac river basin has been stable a map for each catchment around the five monitoring sites was produced by arcgis 10 2 as shown in fig 10 the land use type percentages are presented in table 5 the land types of the sub basins at each monitoring station are significantly different the land use types of the selected water quality monitoring stations are mainly forest developed and agricultural land different land types lead to different sub catchment water qualities and the runoff pollution is also very different developed land produces urban runoff agricultural land produces agricultural non point source pollution and forestland is only scoured by rainfall runoff catchments with more developed land have more and stronger events than catchments with large percentages of forest or agricultural land the catchment of site 01654000 has the largest percentage of developed land 75 and is most easily impacted by human activity such as urban runoff pollution this is why our results show far more anomalous events at site 01654000 than at other sites the catchment of site 01632900 has the largest proportion of agricultural land 45 8 and the strength and occurrence of anomalies at this site ranked second the other two catchments have similar land use distributions and the anomalies show similar patterns no direct linear relationship exists between land use and water quality anomalies however interestingly the frequency of occurrence of turbidity anomaly events foa is proportional to the rate of developed land area de the foa of water temperature the foa of nox n is proportional to the rate of forest land area for the foa of discharge table 5 and fig 11 this result is reasonable and can be explained by the strong direct linkage of discharge and water temperature to precipitation and air temperature and the concept of climate elasticity of water quality cewq proposed by jiang et al 2014 previous studies showed that the precipitation elasticity of total nitrogen unfiltered is proportional to the land use forest percentage ervinia et al 2019 khan et al 2017a khan et al 2017b these basic relationships are straightforward but more case studies are needed to extrapolate the regression equations for to areas e g those with different climates and human activity patterns 3 3 3 influence of storm water on transient anomalies and hysteresis characteristics stormwater is a typical driver of water quality anomalies not only in natural water but also in urban receiving water the high resolution time series of precipitation at meteorological station 390927077330900 is shown in appendix si figs s41 s42 the water quality at site 01646000 is mainly discussed here as an example the combined plot of the scalogram and the time series curves of water quality anomalies relative to precipitation events are listed in figs 12 14 and appendix si figs s43 s49 for visual inspection the order of occurrence of precipitation and water quality anomalies shows the potential causality wavelet coherence analysis was also conducted gan et al 2007 grinsted et al 2004 labat 2010 liu et al 2017 and the time frequency plots of the wavelet coherence are listed in fig 15 and si appendix figs s50 s51 the presence of high coherence regions yellow colour and the arrow directions denote the coherent relationship the coherence plots can help uncover hidden coherence rules both the combined scalogram and coherence plots show that the influence of storm water events on water temperature ph and conductance anomalies is not universal while the influence on turbidity nox n and discharge anomalies is significant and universal significant yellow areas in fig 15 and the influence on do is sometimes observed fig 13 in the combined scalogram a time lag between storm water and water quality anomalies exists we simply define the time lag as the period starting from the rail of the wavelet anomaly left to the storm water peaks fig 12a for do and the time interval between the precipitation peak and the scalogram contour peak for turbidity and nox n it is likely that the phase relationship as the characterization of time lag or lead is shown by the orientation of the arrows in the regions of high coherence see fig 15 coherence analysis presents significantly different coherent fluctuation behaviours in high frequency and low frequency regions for turbidity fig 15a the wavelet cross spectrum captures œÄ 2 1 4 cycle phase lag arrow pointing upwards at the frequency of 0 5 1 day 1 and œÄ phase lag at the frequency of 2 4 day 1 but no phase lag arrow pointing right from the two month period to the one week period this result shows that transient turbidity events follow precipitation by an average of 9 12 h as illustrated in the combined scalogram fig 14 the time lags for the turbidity peak response range from a prompt response to approximately 1 day after the storm events the lags are basically consistent one occasional finding is that the coherence of precipitation to turbidity is also significant in the super high frequency area with a 30 minute to 1 hour period super hi notation in fig 15a no such phenomenon exists for other water quality parameters or for discharge this phenomenon may be because precipitation can locally change the turbidity i e a slight increase in turbidity soon after precipitation starts due to the entry of suspended matter on both sides of the river and strong water mixing from the rainfall at this moment the discharge remains unstable since it takes time for upstream storm runoff to be generated this fine level of water quality dynamics has never before been so clearly illustrated by data this interesting phenomenon is significantly present at sites 01646000 01645762 and 01654000 but not apparent at site 01632900 probably because of the low rate of developed area at site 01632900 table 5 and or the long distance from the site to the meteorological station nox n also presents different patterns of coherence with precipitation in high frequency and low frequency regions the strangely reverse coherence is significant periods of approximately 2 months to 10 days frequency 0 01667 0 1 day 1 show anti phase behaviour arrow pointing left or lower left this means that nox n leads precipitation by a phase of œÄ 1 2 cycle to 3 4œÄ during the winter season from december 2016 to february 2017 and the winter season from january 2018 to february 2018 the 2 day 1 week period frequency 0 5 0 143 day 1 shows arrows point straight down which indicate that nox n leads precipitation by œÄ 2 1 4 cycle namely 1 3 days ahead this result is consistent with the result of the combined scalogram the strange pseudo causality is difficult to explain site 01645762 has similar characteristics but the other two sites 01654000 and 01632900 have opposite characteristics these sites have the regular phase delay of nox n fluctuation behaviour in which most nox n anomalies come after storm water starts among the identified relative nox n fluctuation anomalies si appendix fig s48 the time lag is very short and ranges from a prompt response to approximately 8 h the nox n and turbidity anomalies that cannot be explained by precipitation should be attributed to source inputs to the catchments certainly precipitation events will not always lead to water quality anomalies do presents interesting reserve coherence with precipitation from december to february at weekly and monthly periods at every site fig 12 si appendix figs s53 54 do leads precipitation by approximately one day to one week 7 days which is consistent with the combined scalogram see fig 12 the duration of the anomalies is much longer than the duration of storm events it usually occurs during summer in many cases the do anomalies stopped until significant rainfall started fig 12b d according to the time series the do fluctuation is relatively large over time during anomalous events this relationship might be due to atmospheric pressure anomalies prior to storms during summer cox 2003 nakova et al 2009 3 4 watershed management implications and new opportunities 3 4 1 flexibility of the proposed spectral analysis framework fft and cwt were adopted for water quality fluctuation measurements in this work since they are the most widely used and verified measurements in practice other optional spectral analysis techniques are also available but with only very limited studies in hydrology for example the hilbert huang transform hht franceschini and tsai 2010 as a descriptive technique for the analysis of non stationary and nonlinear time series can be used for analysis trends and frequency distribution as well as anomalies singular spectrum analysis ssa marques et al 2006 can be used to detect time varying periodic signals and extract modulated oscillations these methods are also promising for integration into the proposed framework fig 3 to extract features of trends periodicity and anomalies the selected study area the potomac river exhibits typical characteristics the periodic characteristics anomaly patterns and features are universal and can be found in other catchments by the proposed analysis framework the drivers and casualties of the periodicity and anomalies can differ from catchment to catchment particularly for those areas where the water quality is largely impacted and controlled by point sources in this circumstance on the other hand the proposed spectral analysis framework can be used to identify the pattern of point source release and improve management how the other water quality parameters perform on the frequency domain under the measurements with high temporal resolution is unknown and cannot be simply deducted from other parameters this study focused on normal water quality parameters since they are most easily and stably observed at fine intervals by sensors the main sources of these fluctuations are natural processes or agriculture toxic metals hao et al 2015 kirchner and neal 2013 are worthy of further investigation in the future where the anomaly features very likely differ from those of ordinary parameters due to different processes and sources the high resolution chemical dynamics of organic toxicity e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs franceschini and tsai 2010 hu et al 2016 are difficult to analyse due to the constraints of monitoring technology perhaps their fluctuations would be too small at a fine temporal resolution to be necessarily investigated 3 4 2 new insights into the detailed structures of water quality dynamics high frequency monitoring sensors combined with spectral analysis provide a new way to investigate the fine details of water quality dynamics the fine details and patterns of anomalies in sections 3 1 and 3 2 are reported here for the first time in the literature these results are helpful for stormwater event management marc√© et al 2016 as they consider the time lag and transit time the patterns of the do and water temperature fluctuations can reflect or perhaps even predict precipitation coherent oscillation behaviour between precipitation and water quality parameters reveals storm event hysteresis it is important to determine the randomness of water quality variables for their interpolation modelling and prediction for example the interpolation of missing data is challenging for water quality parameters with time fractal behaviour at present a process based water quality model cannot depict high resolution temporal fluctuations spectral analysis can probably help develop data driven water quality models piniewski et al 2019 in addition with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution of the river monitoring network spectral analysis combined with other tools e g virtual source analysis can help to identify pollution sources and estimate source contributions as in acoustics hosseini fouladi et al 2009 pallas et al 2008 this process provides a new point of view on the source pathway relationship 3 4 3 new index and framework for watershed water quality management high frequency monitoring sensors combined with spectral analysis can provide new evaluation indices and frameworks for watershed classification and water quality management on a watershed scale the anomaly response characteristics from the watershed or catchment can characterize its reliability resilience and vulnerability for use as a watershed health index ervinia et al 2019 the time lag of the response to external drivers the frequency of anomaly occurrence and the anomaly strengths of different water quality parameters are typical quantitative features this approach requires at least two years of continuous monitoring data most recently p√©rez ciria and chiogna 2020 developed a catchment classification tool to determine the crucial scales of variability of a non stationary runoff time series by using wt three main runoff behaviours i e classes were found at the yearly scale in the alps frameworks or tools based on anomaly characteristics have not yet been reported in addition utilizing a machine vision approach machine learning technology li and zhou 2016 zhao and zhang 2005 can capture the frequency domain characteristics from a large amount of spectral analysis results from a watershed monitoring site big data analysis directly reflects a comprehensive approach to watershed water quality dynamics 3 4 4 new algorithm for online anomaly detection and response time analysis for early warning as discussed in the introduction a wavelet based anomaly detection algorithm can recognize an anomaly only on a scalogram with sufficient recent data as well as sufficient historical baseline data fig 16 presents a typical process to establish a cwt based online water quality anomaly detection approach one core component is automatic wavelet energy identification based on the results of shift and scaling parameters a and b eq 6 many approaches have been developed such as wavelet entropy heidari bafroui and ohadi 2014 ren and sun 2008 on the one hand the use of a comprehensive method can introduce more reporting stability compared to a local alarm method on the other hand water managers need a quick response time we conducted a fundamental analysis of response time the turbidity time series at site 01646000 was selected as an example a moving window like approach was used to identify the minimum response time the latest monitoring data are added to the target time series point by point for the wt the calculation and iteration stop when a significant anomaly is detected the response time is then identified as the time elapsed in the target time series fig 17 demonstrates typical response time scenarios the response time of fig 17a is 1060 1024 4 h 1 9 h the response time of b is 3055 2993 4 h 1 15 5 h and the response time of c is 96 4 h 1 24 h 1 day therefore additional time steps may be needed for long anomalous events the online cwt based comprehensive anomaly detection approach takes 9 h to 1 day to respond if we increase the monitoring frequency i e the temporal resolution of water quality dynamics the response time will be improved as shown in fig 17d the response time improved to 1060 980 20 h 1 4 h different from the direct alarm method when a threshold is exceeded this algorithm includes historical baseline fluctuation characteristics which represents a more reliable and integrated approach this approach can complement the direct alarm method in practice to decrease the false positive rate 4 conclusions river water quality presents complex fluctuations under the influence of natural environmental movement and human activities this work systemically defines and analyses the periodicity and aperiodicity short term and long term patterns high frequency and low frequency oscillations as well as the normal baseline and abnormal fluctuations in water quality these fluctuations are integrated into a common spectral analysis framework case studies on the potomac river with two years of high temporal resolution measurements of six water quality parameters and discharge were conducted particular attention was paid to transient anomaly events the following results were achieved 1 fourier analysis shows that temp ph and do have typical low frequency periodicity such as seasonal and bi annual periodicity in particular this study is the first to discover abnormal high frequency periodic fluctuations such as fluctuations of 8 and 12 h in non tidal catchments cond turb and nox n present universal temporal scaling aperiodicity i e 1 f fluctuation at every site from the psd the scaling exponents Œ≤ range from 1 0 to 2 4 but most are near 2 and generally ordered as Œ≤cond Œ≤nox n Œ≤turb the fluctuations in the potomac river are more strongly auto correlated than those in the british rivers reported by kirchner and neal 2013 2 wavelet analysis successfully identified the time location duration and magnitude of transient anomaly events and classified two anomaly patterns abrupt changes and large swings the two patterns have clearly different pseudo frequency spectral energy distributions water quality parameters have the following order of occurrence i e foa do others ph and duration order do temp nox n turb the spectral energy distributions in anomalous regions present opposite symmetricity between the set of do and temp and the set of cond turb and nox n 3 land use type very likely influences transient water quality events foaturb is proportional to de foatemp r 0 98 p 0 005 and foanox n is proportional to for foadisc r 0 95 p 0 05 precipitation obviously influences turb nox n and discharge anomalies however the hysteresis characteristics vary for different water quality parameters significantly different coherent fluctuation behaviours exist between the high frequency and low frequency regions for turb and nox n 4 many fine details and dynamic water quality phenomena have been reported in this study for the first time some findings are difficult to explain at this stage 5 with the assistance of the proposed spectral analysis framework we can uncover new insights into the fine details of water quality dynamics develop new indices and assessment frameworks for managing the water quality reliability resilience and vulnerability of a watershed and design new comprehensive algorithms for online anomaly detection the wt based online anomaly detection algorithms can respond in 4 h with high frequency monitoring which can complement a local thresholding method this comprehensive study filled the knowledge gaps in the frequency domain characteristics of detailed water quality dynamics in the age of sensing and data intensive

5244,the role of extreme rains over peninsular florida pf in modulating the seasonal rainfall characteristics is investigated in this study the paper is motivated on its potential implication on the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf by relatively coarse global seasonal climate models a majority of these climate models are unable to resolve the weather events like tropical cyclones that produce such extreme rain events therefore a legitimate question to ask is if this limits the model s seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf in this paper extreme rain events over pf within a season are defined as days with daily rain amount at or above the 95th percentile over 39 years from 1979 to 2017 at the grid resolution of the observed rainfall dataset 0 5 0 5 the thresholds for extreme rain days range from 16 mmday 1 to 36 mmday 1 depending on the season and the location over pf while the heaviest rainfall range from 58 mmday 1 to 278 mmday 1 these extreme rain events occur most often across pf in the boreal summer season followed by the fall season with the least in the boreal winter season our study reveals that removing the days of extreme rain events has the largest impact on the corresponding seasonal anomalies and daily rainfall distribution in the dry winter season and least in the wet summer season the impact of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso on the extreme rain events was evaluated by contrasting the differences in the shape and the scale parameters of the fitted gamma distribution on daily rainfall in winter spring seasons during warm and cold phases results revealed that the warm enso phases make the tails of the daily rainfall distribution over pf heavier and longer relative to the cold enso phases in the winter and spring seasons in essence our study reveals that the extreme rain events that are critical for the overall seasonal distribution of rainfall over pf in the first half of the year is modulated by large scale phenomenon e g enso in the latter half of the year summer and fall the extreme rain events are not as critical to the seasonal rainfall anomaly or the overall seasonal distribution of rainfall over pf therefore resolving the extreme rain events need not be as critical for the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf keywords precipitation extremes florida hydroclimate seasonal predictability enso 1 introduction extreme rain events are well known for their potential to lead to collateral damage and human fatalities there is considerable interest to understand these extreme rain events especially in the us where they are known to cause considerable damage schumacher and johnson 2005 2006 curtis 2008 for example schumacher and johnson 2006 examined rain gauge observations east of the rockies and outside of florida over five years 1999 2003 and found that a majority of the extreme rain events defined as those that exceed 50 year recurrence interval occurred in the month of july they also established that nearly two thirds of these events were associated with mesoscale convective systems and about a quarter of the events were related to synoptic weather systems in a related study chan and misra 2010 showed that anomalous wet summer seasons in the southeastern us is characterized by a greater number of heavy 10 mm day precipitation events than anomalous dry seasons they further indicated that these heavy precipitation events contributed to more than half the seasonal total rainfall there is however an absence of studies that examine the role of extreme rain events in defining the hydroclimate over peninsular florida pf despite the fact that florida is identified to be a region greatly affected by landfalling tropical cyclones knight and davis 2009 klotzbach 2011 and high lightning density hodanish et al 1997 lericos et al 2002 that point to high thunderstorm activity some recent studies have examined the impact of climate change on rainfall extremes in florida nadarajah 2005 wang et al 2013 but they still do not fill the void of understanding the contribution of the extreme rain events on the seasonal hydroclimate of pf the strong seasonality of the rainfall in pf is well documented misra and dinapoli 2013 misra et al 2017 misra and bhardwaj 2020 ali et al 2000 examined the spatial temporal characteristics of monthly rainfall in central and south florida and showed that the variance of the wet season july rainfall was far higher than that in the dry season january similarly in examining the spatial patterns of daily and monthly rainfall data in the tri state area of alabama georgia and florida baigorria et al 2007 found two dominant spatial correlation patterns that suggested frontal type and convective thunderstorm events which were characteristic of the dry and wet seasons respectively keim 1996 analyzed heavy rainfall events that produced over 75 mm of rainfall across a much wider region of the southeastern united states from florida to texas and north carolina to oklahoma and concluded that frontal systems particularly cold fronts was the most dominant mechanism that induced heavy rainfall across the area moreover tropical disturbances and air mass thunderstorms were also found to be important but largely confined to coastal locations a number of studies have examined the seasonal predictability over florida which generally indicate that the winter season has higher and useful prediction skills while in the summer and fall seasons the models display relatively poor fidelity stefanova et al 2012 tian et al 2014 kirtman et al 2017 however the current climate models used to simulate florida s climate are comparatively coarse in spatial resolution 1 1 e g kirtman et al 2014 voldoire et al 2019 and are inadequate to resolve the weather systems that produce such extreme rain events iorio et al 2004 li et al 2012 therefore it is legitimate to ask if their seasonal prediction skills over florida are affected without resolving some of these extreme rain events this paper is motivated to understand the contribution of extreme rainfall events to seasonal rainfall over peninsular florida pf we seek to identify 1 the role of extreme rainfall in modulating rainfall distributions in the different seasons and 2 the impact of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso on extreme rainfall we examine the impact of enso specifically because it is one of the most widely studied and well known interannual variations cane and zebiak 1985 philander 1990 guilyardi et al 2009 capatondi et al 2014 that impacts pf significantly ropelewski and halpert 1986 1987 bove et al 1998 misra et al 2012 nag et al 2014 additionally considerable progress has been made on understanding and improving enso predictability guilyardi et al 2009 capatondi et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 chen et al 2020 we hope to provide a better perspective on the potential for seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate over pf from the analysis of the results of this study in the following section we describe the datasets used and the methodology followed by discussion of results in section 3 concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology we use the daily rainfall data from the climate prediction center cpc xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 this rainfall data is available on a 0 5 0 5 grid at daily interval from 01 january 1979 to 22 march 2018 over all continental regions this dataset uses gauge reports from over 30 000 stations including those from cooperative observer network program coop and other national and international collections a quality control is applied on these data collections before they are merged through an optimal interpolation technique following gandin 1965 to construct the global gridded rainfall analysis on 0 5 l a t 0 5 l o n grid in comparison to previous cpc products the cpc unified daily gauge analysis presents spatial patterns and temporal changes of precipitation in better agreements with station data xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 showed that continental us including florida has the highest density of rain gauges in the world the mean station to station distance is around 30 km and the bias is less than 0 5 in a comprehensive review of gridded rainfall analysis sun et al 2018 finds that the largest uncertainties of gridded analysis are found in complex mountain areas and in regions of sparse data coverage e g northern africa polar latitudes oceanic regions in contrast the flat terrain and relatively high density of rain gauges ensure a higher fidelity of the rainfall analysis over florida for this study we use the data only over pf with a spatial range of 84 25 w to 79 75 w and 24 75 n and 31 25 n we examined the impact on the statistical moments and the daily rainfall distribution from the extreme rain events to provide a complete picture on the sensitivity of the extreme rain events on seasonal rainfall the methodology is explained in four subsections that dwell on climatology defining extreme rain events fitting a gamma distribution to the daily rainfall in the season and the significance test the methodology follows a textbook type analyses to provide insight to the daily rainfall distribution within the four seasons of the year over pf this is followed by a sensitivity analysis to specifically examine the role of extreme rain events on defining the seasonal hydroclimate and its variations over pf 2 1 climatology to examine climatological characteristics of the statistical moments the 39 year mean rainfall was calculated for each season and its standard deviation skewness and kurtosis were computed based on this mean rainfall the skewness s and kurtosis k were computed as 1 s 1 n i 1 n r i r 3 1 n i 1 n r i r 2 3 and 2 k 1 n i 1 n r i r 4 1 n i 1 n r i r 2 4 where r i is the daily rainfall and r is the seasonal mean rainfall 2 2 definition of extreme rainfall extreme rainfall days were defined when the daily rain rate was at or exceeded the 95th percentile for each season from 1979 to 2017 suppiah and hennessy 1998 haylock and nicholls 2000 klein tank and konnen 2003 but instead of computing this percentile over only wet days 0 1 mmday 1 of the season we took into account all days including dry days to avoid bias stemming from any changes to the frequency of wet days e g sch√§r et al 2016 to compute the thresholds the daily rain rates for more than 3500 days for each grid were ranked in descending order with the days of equal rain rate belonging to the same rank then the rain rate at the 95th percentile was defined as the threshold for extreme rainfall in order to understand the impact of these rain events on the seasonal characteristics and daily rainfall distribution we created a modified dataset where the rain days at or exceeding the 95th percentile threshold were zeroed out all moments including the mean standard deviation kurtosis and skewness were calculated for both the original and the modified dataset furthermore the corresponding differences of these moments between the original and the modified data was also evaluated the bootstrapping method described in subsection d was used to test the differences at 95 significance level 2 3 fitting daily rainfall with gamma distribution we also analyzed the frequency distribution of precipitation by fitting empirical functions to the probability density function pdf of the daily precipitation over pf precipitation amounts are left bounded by zero and skewed to the right there are a lot of distributions that meet these two requirements and gamma distribution stands out with its versatility of shapes though in some regions gamma distribution doesn t work well vlƒçek and huth 2009 it has been widely applied to daily or monthly precipitation time series to study regional precipitation characteristics wilks 2006 becker et al 2009 husak et al 2009 the gamma distribution pdf for a given variable r is given by 1 f x x Œ≤ Œ± 1 e x Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ± x Œ± Œ≤ 0 where Œ± is the shape and Œ≤ is the scale parameters of the distribution Œ≥ Œ± is the gamma function defined by 2 Œ≥ Œ± 0 e t t Œ± 1 d t the shape and scale parameters need to be estimated from the data series the maximum likelihood estimators mle developed by thom 1958 is used the estimators Œ± and Œ≤ are calculated as follows 3 a l n x 1 n i 1 n l n x n 4 Œ± 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 Œ≤ x Œ± where n is the number of values in x and a is the sample statistic which is the difference between the logs of the arithmetic and the geometric means wilks 2006 since the sample statistic a contains natural log zero values should be discarded from original data series we determine the threshold for a wet day t as 0 1 mm day given that the measurable rain amount at an observation station is typically 0 1 mm groisman et al 1999 at each grid the frequency of wet days pw for each season is therefore defined as number of wet days divided by the number of days in the season in the 39 year period the frequency of wet days in pf is usually larger than 0 3 not shown an example of fitting gamma distribution to the wet days at one grid is provided in fig 1 a wet day threshold of te 1 mmday 1 was applied to better present the histograms in removing the dry days a zero frequency value is implied for the 0 te interval if we fit a gamma distribution over such a rainfall distribution the fitted pdf would start with zero which creates a right skewed inverted u shape function with a local maximum at x te fig 1a to avoid such bias we fit the gamma distribution to x te the difference of fitting to an unshifted and a shifted data series is shown in fig 1 as a consequence of shifting the distribution the shape of the fitted pdf changes to an exponential decay fig 1b and the shape parameter drops from larger than 1 fig 1a to below 1 fig 1b it should be noted that the shape parameter in the gamma distribution is a measure of the skewness of the distribution with smaller values of Œ± representing higher skewness in the distribution it shows that fitting the wet day data directly without dealing with the dry day frequency will lead to exaggeration of the shape parameter which is the possible reason for a shape parameter of larger than 1 over most of us in becker et al 2009 goodness of fit is tested using the chi square test following wilks 2006 the null hypothesis h0 is that the sample data at each grid is drawn from the estimated gamma distribution in this study the sample data refers to the wet day data the data is divided into unequal classes or bins and each bin is ensured to have at least 5 values the test statistic is computed as 5 œá 2 bins o b s e r v e d e x p e c t e d 2 e x p e c t e d 6 bins o b s e r v e d n p w pr d a t a i n b i n 2 n p w p r d a t a i n b i n where observed and expected correspond to the actual and computed counts of data values falling into each bin the expected is equal to the cumulative probability pw in that bin multiplied by the sample size pw n where n is the number of wet days a large œá 2 suggests that at least a few of the bins exhibit large discrepancies between the expected and observed counts and that the fit is not good enough leading to a rejection of the null hypothesis the rejection level is determined by the degrees of freedom and the significance level in this study we use a rejection level of 0 05 meaning that we reject the null hypothesis at locations with p values less than 0 05 the degrees of freedom of the time series at each grid point is estimated by the typical duration of synoptic scale systems which is 4 days holton and hakim 2013 typically in the summer season and in other seasons over pf when the duration of precipitation events is shorter bastola and misra 2013 the actual degrees of freedom will be larger than 4 days therefore our choice of 4 days for the degrees of freedom serves as a more conservative estimate of œá 2 2 4 significance tests the differences of the higher moments and the gamma distribution parameters before and after removing the extreme rain events were compared and tested by the bootstrapping method following mcclave and dietrich 1994 and efron and tibshirani 1993 for each grid point in each season the number of extreme rain days were defined by the 95th percentile thresholds after randomly deleting the same number of days in one season we calculated the higher moments and the gamma distribution parameters of the resampled seasonal rainfall data the differences of these higher moments and the gamma distribution parameters of the resampled rainfall data from the original sample were computed this process was repeated for 200 times then the differences were ranked in descending order to determine the upper 2 5 and the lower 2 5 thresholds for the significance test we claimed the statistical significance of the sensitivity of the extreme rain events on the higher moments or the distribution parameters at the 5 significance level when their rank fall either in the upper or in the lower 2 5 of the threshold we also examined the impact of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso phases on the gamma distribution parameters of the daily rainfall in the boreal winter and spring seasons the warm and cold enso phases were defined by a threshold of 0 5 c for the oceanic ni√±o index oni from climate prediction center 13 warm december january february s djf s and 13 cold djf s 7 warm march april may s mam s and 6 cold mam s were identified we fit the gamma distribution to the daily rainfall distribution in each of these seasons separately bootstrapping method is used to test the differences of the shape and the scale parameters between the warm and cold phases of enso at the 5 significance level similar to the process mentioned before 3 results 3 1 seasonal climatology of rainfall over pf the seasonal mean climatological rainfall in fig 2 a d clearly indicate that pf receives the most rainfall in the june july august jja season followed by that in the september october november son season it is interesting to note that gulf coast of pf receives the most rainfall in the jja season fig 2c while in the son season the atlantic coast and the southern tip of pf receive the most rainfall fig 2d the december january february djf season is the driest especially in south florida fig 2a followed by the march april may mam season the seasonality of the rainfall north of 30 n over pf is relatively weak with comparable seasonal rainfall in djf mam and son seasons although in jja there is a visible annual peak the corresponding standard deviation of the seasonal rainfall in fig 2e h indicate that the jja season displays the most variability across pf the atlantic coast and the southern tip of pf display relatively strong variability in the son season fig 2h while in the djf fig 2e and mam fig 2f seasons the variability is stronger north of 28 n the skewness of the seasonal rainfall in fig 2i l indicate that the djf season is most positively skewed which is understandable given that it is the driest season which reduces the seasonal mean rainfall and deviations about this mean are amplified in the skewness however the mam season which was found to be also a dry season fig 2b shows far less skewness than the djf season in fact the skewness of the daily rainfall in the rest of the seasons other than djf is comparable this potentially suggests that the tails of the daily rainfall distribution in these seasons are not relatively as heavy and or long as the djf season this may however have to be tempered with the fact that the heaviest rain rates occur in jja season but is not reflected in the skewness because the seasonal mean rain is comparatively higher than in the djf season the kurtosis in fig 2m p also indicate the djf season with the largest values while it is comparable in the rest of the seasons this supports the idea of relatively high frequency of dry days in the djf season that result in a higher peak in the daily rainfall distribution of the season additionally the higher kurtosis in the djf season compared to other seasons also suggests a heavier and or a longer tail in the daily rainfall distribution of the djf season 3 2 extreme rainfall over pf as noted before the selection of extreme rainfall events is based on daily rainfall at or exceeding the 95th percentile threshold with the percentile computed by including all days of the season including dry days the climatological rain rate at the 95th percentile threshold for all four seasons is shown in fig 3 a d interestingly fig 3a d show that the threshold of rain rate at the 95th percentile is largest in the djf and the mam seasons especially north of 30 n with comparatively much lower thresholds in the jja and the son seasons this result is partially a consequence of the jja and the son seasons having relatively more rainy days while djf and mam seasons have more dry day events since we assign the same rank for days with equal rain rate the threshold for the 95th percentile gets shifted to higher values when the rank order is shorter as in the dry seasons owing to a number of dry days in south florida the threshold of the 95th percentile event is comparable in all four seasons as a consequence the meridional gradients of the threshold of the rain rates at the 95th percentile is strongest in djf followed by that in the mam season and weakest in jja followed by that in the son season fig 3 the percentage of days in the season when the daily rain rate exceeds the 95th percentile threshold is shown in fig 4 a d the extreme rain events are most prevalent across pf in the jja season with south florida showing the highest frequency followed by the son season with a relatively moderate decrease in the frequency over southwest pf and a larger decrease towards north of 28 n the djf season fig 4a followed by the mam season fig 4b has the least frequency of the extreme rain events in order to understand the impact of these extreme rain events on the seasonal rainfall we created a new dataset wherein we zeroed out the rainfall on days of the extreme rain events we then examined the differences of these various statistics of this modified data series with the original data set to assess the impact of the extreme rain events on the seasonal rainfall over pf the climatological seasonal mean rainfall differences shown as original modified between the two data sets in fig 5 a d clearly shows that in the absence of the extreme rain events the seasonal mean rainfall declines in a statistically significant manner across pf in all four seasons furthermore the differences in fig 5e h reveal that the variability of the seasonal rainfall across pf as defined by the standard deviation also declines with the absence of the extreme rainy days likewise the differences in skewness fig 5i l and kurtosis fig 5m p also show a significant decrease when extreme rainy days are absent the relatively large differences of these metrics in the dry seasons djf and mam indicate the relative importance of these extreme rain events on the mean state of the rainfall in the mam season when both skewness fig 5j and kurtosis fig 5n increase between tampa and orlando in the modified data series it suggests that the mean state of the rainfall decreases considerably from the absence of these extreme rain events which results in higher skewness and kurtosis in the modified dataset yielding a negative difference in fig 5j and n in contrast the relatively moderate changes to the skewness and kurtosis in the rest of the year jja and son seasons suggest the potential importance of the light to moderate rain events relative to the extreme rain events to the seasonal total these results have important implications on the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate over pf for example it is well known that pf has the highest density of landfalling tropical cyclones in the continental us knight and davis 2009 klotzbach 2011 therefore one could claim that such extreme rain events could have an implication on the seasonal hydroclimate over pf during the atlantic hurricane season yet when enso has a strong influence on the landfalling tropical cyclones over pf e g klotzbach 2011 misra et al 2012 kirtman et al 2017 there is no discernible influence of enso on the seasonal precipitation anomalies of either the summer or the fall seasons over pf misra and dinapoli 2013 kirtman et al 2017 our results corroborate these findings further in suggesting that the extreme rain events as isolated by those events ranked at or above the 95th percentile which include these infrequent landfalling tropical cyclone events over pf do not significantly contribute to the overall rainfall distribution of the corresponding season 3 3 fitting the gamma distribution to understand characteristics of extreme rain in order to put the findings of the previous sub section on a more theoretical footing and to understand the contribution of the extreme rain events to the seasonal rainfall total in an alternative manner we examined the characteristics of the fitted gamma distribution to the daily rainfall distribution in each of the four seasons as mentioned earlier gamma distribution is a two parameter frequency distribution described by the shape and the scale factors the shape and scale factors inform the characteristics of the fitted gamma distribution such that shape dominated distributions suggest a weaker contribution of the extreme rains to the seasonal total vis √† vis a scale dominated distribution that would imply a greater importance of the extreme rains to the seasonal total becker et al 2009 in fig 6 a d we show the shape parameter of the fitted gamma distribution for the daily rainfall of the four seasons similarly fig 6e h displays the corresponding scale parameter of the gamma distribution grids that don t pass the chi square test are masked out there are many interesting observations from these figures that one could make based on the spatial gradients of the shape and the scale parameters of the gamma distribution including i gamma distribution is a good fit to daily rainfall distribution in all four seasons across most parts of pf ii the daily precipitation in the djf season shows a distribution with low shape parameter pointing to comparatively larger skewness that is evenly distributed across pf fig 6a at the same time we observe in djf that over northern florida north of 28 n the distribution is scale dominated suggesting heavier and or long tails with their largest values appearing north of 30 n fig 6e iii like in the djf season the shape parameter is small and uniformly distributed across pf in the mam season fig 6b the distribution is scale dominated especially in northern parts of pf which points to the significance of the extreme rain events to the seasonal total iv in the jja season the shape parameter assumes a larger value than in the previous two seasons fig 6c while the scale parameter diminishes fig 6g which connote that extreme rain events are comparatively less important and light to moderate rain rates contribute significantly to the seasonal total v in the son season the daily distribution of rainfall begin to revert to relatively smaller values of the shape parameter across pf fig 6d and larger values of the scale parameter fig 6h showing the growing importance of the extreme rain events on the seasonal total now we re fit the gamma distribution on the modified data series where in the rain events at or exceeding the 95th percentile threshold is zeroed out to assess the importance of such events on the seasonal total fig 7 the following inferences on the impact of the extreme rain events on the seasonal totals and the rainfall distribution in the season can be made from fig 7 i in each of the seasons the shape parameter increases and the scale parameter declines in the modified data series relative to the original data this suggests that the extreme rain events contribute significantly to the seasonal total in all four seasons across pf ii between the djf and the mam seasons the impact of removing the extreme rain events is slightly higher in the mam season relative to the djf season with larger changes observed to the shape and scale parameters in the mam season iii between the jja and the son seasons the shape parameter shows a larger impact in the former compared to the latter season with the jja season assuming larger values of the shape parameter in the modified data series which imply the growing influence of the light to moderate rain events on the seasonal total however in the son season the scale parameter shows a larger reduction compared to the jja season suggesting the diminishing influence of the extreme rain events on the seasonal total bastola and misra 2013 clearly showed that diurnal variations contribute significantly to seasonal rainfall over pf throughout the year in jja and son seasons diurnal variations explain nearly 50 of the total seasonal variance in parts of pf carbone and tuttle 2008 bastola and misra 2013 these diurnal variations of precipitation are associated with sea breeze type of thunderstorms blanchard and lopez 1985 hodanish et al 1997 therefore if the bulk of the seasonal rainfall comprises of such rain events it is incumbent of the seasonal prediction models to simulate these diurnal variations with reasonable fidelity however the timing and magnitude of the diurnal variations is a challenging issue for climate models dai and trenberth 2004 lewis and karoly 2013 yin and porporato 2017 wang et al 2018 this issue is further accentuated over pf because the sea breeze events require much higher spatial resolution than the current climate models offer pielke 1974 anthes et al 1982 tijm et al 1999 our results show that extreme rain events make a relatively weak contribution towards the seasonal distribution of rainfall in the summer and fall seasons the distribution of summer rainfall is not sensitive to extreme rain events which are primarily produced by tropical cyclones thus the results from our study suggest that the absence of resolving the tropical cyclones in our current climate models e g kirtman et al 2014 rebecca et al 2017 may not be as detrimental for the seasonal simulation of summer rainfall over pf however these global climate models continued to display poor prediction skills in summer and fall seasonal rainfall over pf suggesting that there are other responsible factors like the poor simulation of the diurnal variations 3 4 the role of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso the shape and the scale parameters for the warm djf and mam seasons and the corresponding differences between the warm and the cold phases for the two seasons are shown in fig 8 the gamma distribution parameters for the warm djf fig 8a and b respectively and for the warm mam fig 8c and d respectively seasons are quite similar to the corresponding shape and scale parameters fitted over all seasons in fig 6 in comparing the corresponding differences of this distribution of shape and scale parameters with the cold enso phase seasons fig 8e h we observe that in cold enso phases the scale parameter undergoes uniform reduction across pf in both seasons while the changes to shape parameter is less conclusive in other words warm phase of enso tends to make the tails of the daily rainfall distribution heavier and or longer relative to the cold phase of enso given the importance of the extreme rain events in the daily rainfall distribution of the djf and mam seasons as revealed in the previous discussions fig 8 further suggests that the enso forced signal in seasonal rainfall changes over pf can best be captured when these extreme rain events are resolved these results are significant in the context of the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf as kirtman et al 2017 suggested the remote enso forcing on the winter and spring seasonal climate over pf has a huge bearing on the fidelity of the seasonal prediction skills of the global models here we find that enso also has a bearing on the extreme rain events over pf in the djf and mam seasons and that such extreme rain events have a significant influence on the total rainfall distribution across the corresponding seasons therefore our results suggest that these global seasonal climate models that display reasonable seasonal prediction skill over pf in these dry seasons are also resolving in all likelihood the variations in the frequency of these extreme rain events 4 conclusions this paper has examined the daily rainfall distribution across pf in all four seasons we examined the daily rainfall distribution over pf both by computing well known statistical metrics e g skewness and kurtosis and also by way of looking at the shape and scale parameters of the fitted gamma distribution to the daily rainfall spread across the seasons our results indicate that extreme rain events over pf are relatively more important to the seasonal total in the drier seasons of djf and mam when the seasonal mean rainfall is small this result is encouraging in that the extreme rain bearing systems in the boreal winter are usually from the synoptic frontal systems over this region ropelewski and halpert 1986 1989 kiladis and diaz 1989 schmidt et al 2001 that could be potentially resolved in relatively coarse climate models as this study finds these extreme rain events are strongly modulated by enso in the winter and spring seasons therefore the global models which display reasonable seasonal prediction skill in depicting enso teleconnections will likely pick this signal however in terms of long term climate projections the uncertainty of projecting enso features like its frequency duration spatial structure in the equatorial pacific ocean in a future warm climate contribute to the uncertainty of extreme rain events and thereby the seasonal rainfall in the dry season over pf in the summer and fall seasons pf has some of the largest fraction of landfalling tropical cyclones in the continental us yet we observe that the skewness and kurtosis of the daily rainfall distribution in the jja and the son seasons are relatively less modulated by the removal of these extreme rain events than in the drier djf and mam seasons the seasonal distribution of rainfall in these seasons is largely made of light to moderate rain events that are related to diurnal variations or sea breeze type thunderstorm events keim 1996 baigorria et al 2007 bastola and misra 2013 therefore the lack of resolving the tropical cyclones in coarse global climate models may not be detrimental to its seasonal prediction skill over florida however unless the climate prediction models improve their simulation of light to moderate rain events there is little hope in improving the seasonal prediction skills or reducing the uncertainty in long term climate projections of the summer and fall seasons hydroclimate over pf 5 data availability the gridded rainfall

5244,the role of extreme rains over peninsular florida pf in modulating the seasonal rainfall characteristics is investigated in this study the paper is motivated on its potential implication on the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf by relatively coarse global seasonal climate models a majority of these climate models are unable to resolve the weather events like tropical cyclones that produce such extreme rain events therefore a legitimate question to ask is if this limits the model s seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf in this paper extreme rain events over pf within a season are defined as days with daily rain amount at or above the 95th percentile over 39 years from 1979 to 2017 at the grid resolution of the observed rainfall dataset 0 5 0 5 the thresholds for extreme rain days range from 16 mmday 1 to 36 mmday 1 depending on the season and the location over pf while the heaviest rainfall range from 58 mmday 1 to 278 mmday 1 these extreme rain events occur most often across pf in the boreal summer season followed by the fall season with the least in the boreal winter season our study reveals that removing the days of extreme rain events has the largest impact on the corresponding seasonal anomalies and daily rainfall distribution in the dry winter season and least in the wet summer season the impact of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso on the extreme rain events was evaluated by contrasting the differences in the shape and the scale parameters of the fitted gamma distribution on daily rainfall in winter spring seasons during warm and cold phases results revealed that the warm enso phases make the tails of the daily rainfall distribution over pf heavier and longer relative to the cold enso phases in the winter and spring seasons in essence our study reveals that the extreme rain events that are critical for the overall seasonal distribution of rainfall over pf in the first half of the year is modulated by large scale phenomenon e g enso in the latter half of the year summer and fall the extreme rain events are not as critical to the seasonal rainfall anomaly or the overall seasonal distribution of rainfall over pf therefore resolving the extreme rain events need not be as critical for the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf keywords precipitation extremes florida hydroclimate seasonal predictability enso 1 introduction extreme rain events are well known for their potential to lead to collateral damage and human fatalities there is considerable interest to understand these extreme rain events especially in the us where they are known to cause considerable damage schumacher and johnson 2005 2006 curtis 2008 for example schumacher and johnson 2006 examined rain gauge observations east of the rockies and outside of florida over five years 1999 2003 and found that a majority of the extreme rain events defined as those that exceed 50 year recurrence interval occurred in the month of july they also established that nearly two thirds of these events were associated with mesoscale convective systems and about a quarter of the events were related to synoptic weather systems in a related study chan and misra 2010 showed that anomalous wet summer seasons in the southeastern us is characterized by a greater number of heavy 10 mm day precipitation events than anomalous dry seasons they further indicated that these heavy precipitation events contributed to more than half the seasonal total rainfall there is however an absence of studies that examine the role of extreme rain events in defining the hydroclimate over peninsular florida pf despite the fact that florida is identified to be a region greatly affected by landfalling tropical cyclones knight and davis 2009 klotzbach 2011 and high lightning density hodanish et al 1997 lericos et al 2002 that point to high thunderstorm activity some recent studies have examined the impact of climate change on rainfall extremes in florida nadarajah 2005 wang et al 2013 but they still do not fill the void of understanding the contribution of the extreme rain events on the seasonal hydroclimate of pf the strong seasonality of the rainfall in pf is well documented misra and dinapoli 2013 misra et al 2017 misra and bhardwaj 2020 ali et al 2000 examined the spatial temporal characteristics of monthly rainfall in central and south florida and showed that the variance of the wet season july rainfall was far higher than that in the dry season january similarly in examining the spatial patterns of daily and monthly rainfall data in the tri state area of alabama georgia and florida baigorria et al 2007 found two dominant spatial correlation patterns that suggested frontal type and convective thunderstorm events which were characteristic of the dry and wet seasons respectively keim 1996 analyzed heavy rainfall events that produced over 75 mm of rainfall across a much wider region of the southeastern united states from florida to texas and north carolina to oklahoma and concluded that frontal systems particularly cold fronts was the most dominant mechanism that induced heavy rainfall across the area moreover tropical disturbances and air mass thunderstorms were also found to be important but largely confined to coastal locations a number of studies have examined the seasonal predictability over florida which generally indicate that the winter season has higher and useful prediction skills while in the summer and fall seasons the models display relatively poor fidelity stefanova et al 2012 tian et al 2014 kirtman et al 2017 however the current climate models used to simulate florida s climate are comparatively coarse in spatial resolution 1 1 e g kirtman et al 2014 voldoire et al 2019 and are inadequate to resolve the weather systems that produce such extreme rain events iorio et al 2004 li et al 2012 therefore it is legitimate to ask if their seasonal prediction skills over florida are affected without resolving some of these extreme rain events this paper is motivated to understand the contribution of extreme rainfall events to seasonal rainfall over peninsular florida pf we seek to identify 1 the role of extreme rainfall in modulating rainfall distributions in the different seasons and 2 the impact of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso on extreme rainfall we examine the impact of enso specifically because it is one of the most widely studied and well known interannual variations cane and zebiak 1985 philander 1990 guilyardi et al 2009 capatondi et al 2014 that impacts pf significantly ropelewski and halpert 1986 1987 bove et al 1998 misra et al 2012 nag et al 2014 additionally considerable progress has been made on understanding and improving enso predictability guilyardi et al 2009 capatondi et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 chen et al 2020 we hope to provide a better perspective on the potential for seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate over pf from the analysis of the results of this study in the following section we describe the datasets used and the methodology followed by discussion of results in section 3 concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology we use the daily rainfall data from the climate prediction center cpc xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 this rainfall data is available on a 0 5 0 5 grid at daily interval from 01 january 1979 to 22 march 2018 over all continental regions this dataset uses gauge reports from over 30 000 stations including those from cooperative observer network program coop and other national and international collections a quality control is applied on these data collections before they are merged through an optimal interpolation technique following gandin 1965 to construct the global gridded rainfall analysis on 0 5 l a t 0 5 l o n grid in comparison to previous cpc products the cpc unified daily gauge analysis presents spatial patterns and temporal changes of precipitation in better agreements with station data xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 showed that continental us including florida has the highest density of rain gauges in the world the mean station to station distance is around 30 km and the bias is less than 0 5 in a comprehensive review of gridded rainfall analysis sun et al 2018 finds that the largest uncertainties of gridded analysis are found in complex mountain areas and in regions of sparse data coverage e g northern africa polar latitudes oceanic regions in contrast the flat terrain and relatively high density of rain gauges ensure a higher fidelity of the rainfall analysis over florida for this study we use the data only over pf with a spatial range of 84 25 w to 79 75 w and 24 75 n and 31 25 n we examined the impact on the statistical moments and the daily rainfall distribution from the extreme rain events to provide a complete picture on the sensitivity of the extreme rain events on seasonal rainfall the methodology is explained in four subsections that dwell on climatology defining extreme rain events fitting a gamma distribution to the daily rainfall in the season and the significance test the methodology follows a textbook type analyses to provide insight to the daily rainfall distribution within the four seasons of the year over pf this is followed by a sensitivity analysis to specifically examine the role of extreme rain events on defining the seasonal hydroclimate and its variations over pf 2 1 climatology to examine climatological characteristics of the statistical moments the 39 year mean rainfall was calculated for each season and its standard deviation skewness and kurtosis were computed based on this mean rainfall the skewness s and kurtosis k were computed as 1 s 1 n i 1 n r i r 3 1 n i 1 n r i r 2 3 and 2 k 1 n i 1 n r i r 4 1 n i 1 n r i r 2 4 where r i is the daily rainfall and r is the seasonal mean rainfall 2 2 definition of extreme rainfall extreme rainfall days were defined when the daily rain rate was at or exceeded the 95th percentile for each season from 1979 to 2017 suppiah and hennessy 1998 haylock and nicholls 2000 klein tank and konnen 2003 but instead of computing this percentile over only wet days 0 1 mmday 1 of the season we took into account all days including dry days to avoid bias stemming from any changes to the frequency of wet days e g sch√§r et al 2016 to compute the thresholds the daily rain rates for more than 3500 days for each grid were ranked in descending order with the days of equal rain rate belonging to the same rank then the rain rate at the 95th percentile was defined as the threshold for extreme rainfall in order to understand the impact of these rain events on the seasonal characteristics and daily rainfall distribution we created a modified dataset where the rain days at or exceeding the 95th percentile threshold were zeroed out all moments including the mean standard deviation kurtosis and skewness were calculated for both the original and the modified dataset furthermore the corresponding differences of these moments between the original and the modified data was also evaluated the bootstrapping method described in subsection d was used to test the differences at 95 significance level 2 3 fitting daily rainfall with gamma distribution we also analyzed the frequency distribution of precipitation by fitting empirical functions to the probability density function pdf of the daily precipitation over pf precipitation amounts are left bounded by zero and skewed to the right there are a lot of distributions that meet these two requirements and gamma distribution stands out with its versatility of shapes though in some regions gamma distribution doesn t work well vlƒçek and huth 2009 it has been widely applied to daily or monthly precipitation time series to study regional precipitation characteristics wilks 2006 becker et al 2009 husak et al 2009 the gamma distribution pdf for a given variable r is given by 1 f x x Œ≤ Œ± 1 e x Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ± x Œ± Œ≤ 0 where Œ± is the shape and Œ≤ is the scale parameters of the distribution Œ≥ Œ± is the gamma function defined by 2 Œ≥ Œ± 0 e t t Œ± 1 d t the shape and scale parameters need to be estimated from the data series the maximum likelihood estimators mle developed by thom 1958 is used the estimators Œ± and Œ≤ are calculated as follows 3 a l n x 1 n i 1 n l n x n 4 Œ± 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 Œ≤ x Œ± where n is the number of values in x and a is the sample statistic which is the difference between the logs of the arithmetic and the geometric means wilks 2006 since the sample statistic a contains natural log zero values should be discarded from original data series we determine the threshold for a wet day t as 0 1 mm day given that the measurable rain amount at an observation station is typically 0 1 mm groisman et al 1999 at each grid the frequency of wet days pw for each season is therefore defined as number of wet days divided by the number of days in the season in the 39 year period the frequency of wet days in pf is usually larger than 0 3 not shown an example of fitting gamma distribution to the wet days at one grid is provided in fig 1 a wet day threshold of te 1 mmday 1 was applied to better present the histograms in removing the dry days a zero frequency value is implied for the 0 te interval if we fit a gamma distribution over such a rainfall distribution the fitted pdf would start with zero which creates a right skewed inverted u shape function with a local maximum at x te fig 1a to avoid such bias we fit the gamma distribution to x te the difference of fitting to an unshifted and a shifted data series is shown in fig 1 as a consequence of shifting the distribution the shape of the fitted pdf changes to an exponential decay fig 1b and the shape parameter drops from larger than 1 fig 1a to below 1 fig 1b it should be noted that the shape parameter in the gamma distribution is a measure of the skewness of the distribution with smaller values of Œ± representing higher skewness in the distribution it shows that fitting the wet day data directly without dealing with the dry day frequency will lead to exaggeration of the shape parameter which is the possible reason for a shape parameter of larger than 1 over most of us in becker et al 2009 goodness of fit is tested using the chi square test following wilks 2006 the null hypothesis h0 is that the sample data at each grid is drawn from the estimated gamma distribution in this study the sample data refers to the wet day data the data is divided into unequal classes or bins and each bin is ensured to have at least 5 values the test statistic is computed as 5 œá 2 bins o b s e r v e d e x p e c t e d 2 e x p e c t e d 6 bins o b s e r v e d n p w pr d a t a i n b i n 2 n p w p r d a t a i n b i n where observed and expected correspond to the actual and computed counts of data values falling into each bin the expected is equal to the cumulative probability pw in that bin multiplied by the sample size pw n where n is the number of wet days a large œá 2 suggests that at least a few of the bins exhibit large discrepancies between the expected and observed counts and that the fit is not good enough leading to a rejection of the null hypothesis the rejection level is determined by the degrees of freedom and the significance level in this study we use a rejection level of 0 05 meaning that we reject the null hypothesis at locations with p values less than 0 05 the degrees of freedom of the time series at each grid point is estimated by the typical duration of synoptic scale systems which is 4 days holton and hakim 2013 typically in the summer season and in other seasons over pf when the duration of precipitation events is shorter bastola and misra 2013 the actual degrees of freedom will be larger than 4 days therefore our choice of 4 days for the degrees of freedom serves as a more conservative estimate of œá 2 2 4 significance tests the differences of the higher moments and the gamma distribution parameters before and after removing the extreme rain events were compared and tested by the bootstrapping method following mcclave and dietrich 1994 and efron and tibshirani 1993 for each grid point in each season the number of extreme rain days were defined by the 95th percentile thresholds after randomly deleting the same number of days in one season we calculated the higher moments and the gamma distribution parameters of the resampled seasonal rainfall data the differences of these higher moments and the gamma distribution parameters of the resampled rainfall data from the original sample were computed this process was repeated for 200 times then the differences were ranked in descending order to determine the upper 2 5 and the lower 2 5 thresholds for the significance test we claimed the statistical significance of the sensitivity of the extreme rain events on the higher moments or the distribution parameters at the 5 significance level when their rank fall either in the upper or in the lower 2 5 of the threshold we also examined the impact of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso phases on the gamma distribution parameters of the daily rainfall in the boreal winter and spring seasons the warm and cold enso phases were defined by a threshold of 0 5 c for the oceanic ni√±o index oni from climate prediction center 13 warm december january february s djf s and 13 cold djf s 7 warm march april may s mam s and 6 cold mam s were identified we fit the gamma distribution to the daily rainfall distribution in each of these seasons separately bootstrapping method is used to test the differences of the shape and the scale parameters between the warm and cold phases of enso at the 5 significance level similar to the process mentioned before 3 results 3 1 seasonal climatology of rainfall over pf the seasonal mean climatological rainfall in fig 2 a d clearly indicate that pf receives the most rainfall in the june july august jja season followed by that in the september october november son season it is interesting to note that gulf coast of pf receives the most rainfall in the jja season fig 2c while in the son season the atlantic coast and the southern tip of pf receive the most rainfall fig 2d the december january february djf season is the driest especially in south florida fig 2a followed by the march april may mam season the seasonality of the rainfall north of 30 n over pf is relatively weak with comparable seasonal rainfall in djf mam and son seasons although in jja there is a visible annual peak the corresponding standard deviation of the seasonal rainfall in fig 2e h indicate that the jja season displays the most variability across pf the atlantic coast and the southern tip of pf display relatively strong variability in the son season fig 2h while in the djf fig 2e and mam fig 2f seasons the variability is stronger north of 28 n the skewness of the seasonal rainfall in fig 2i l indicate that the djf season is most positively skewed which is understandable given that it is the driest season which reduces the seasonal mean rainfall and deviations about this mean are amplified in the skewness however the mam season which was found to be also a dry season fig 2b shows far less skewness than the djf season in fact the skewness of the daily rainfall in the rest of the seasons other than djf is comparable this potentially suggests that the tails of the daily rainfall distribution in these seasons are not relatively as heavy and or long as the djf season this may however have to be tempered with the fact that the heaviest rain rates occur in jja season but is not reflected in the skewness because the seasonal mean rain is comparatively higher than in the djf season the kurtosis in fig 2m p also indicate the djf season with the largest values while it is comparable in the rest of the seasons this supports the idea of relatively high frequency of dry days in the djf season that result in a higher peak in the daily rainfall distribution of the season additionally the higher kurtosis in the djf season compared to other seasons also suggests a heavier and or a longer tail in the daily rainfall distribution of the djf season 3 2 extreme rainfall over pf as noted before the selection of extreme rainfall events is based on daily rainfall at or exceeding the 95th percentile threshold with the percentile computed by including all days of the season including dry days the climatological rain rate at the 95th percentile threshold for all four seasons is shown in fig 3 a d interestingly fig 3a d show that the threshold of rain rate at the 95th percentile is largest in the djf and the mam seasons especially north of 30 n with comparatively much lower thresholds in the jja and the son seasons this result is partially a consequence of the jja and the son seasons having relatively more rainy days while djf and mam seasons have more dry day events since we assign the same rank for days with equal rain rate the threshold for the 95th percentile gets shifted to higher values when the rank order is shorter as in the dry seasons owing to a number of dry days in south florida the threshold of the 95th percentile event is comparable in all four seasons as a consequence the meridional gradients of the threshold of the rain rates at the 95th percentile is strongest in djf followed by that in the mam season and weakest in jja followed by that in the son season fig 3 the percentage of days in the season when the daily rain rate exceeds the 95th percentile threshold is shown in fig 4 a d the extreme rain events are most prevalent across pf in the jja season with south florida showing the highest frequency followed by the son season with a relatively moderate decrease in the frequency over southwest pf and a larger decrease towards north of 28 n the djf season fig 4a followed by the mam season fig 4b has the least frequency of the extreme rain events in order to understand the impact of these extreme rain events on the seasonal rainfall we created a new dataset wherein we zeroed out the rainfall on days of the extreme rain events we then examined the differences of these various statistics of this modified data series with the original data set to assess the impact of the extreme rain events on the seasonal rainfall over pf the climatological seasonal mean rainfall differences shown as original modified between the two data sets in fig 5 a d clearly shows that in the absence of the extreme rain events the seasonal mean rainfall declines in a statistically significant manner across pf in all four seasons furthermore the differences in fig 5e h reveal that the variability of the seasonal rainfall across pf as defined by the standard deviation also declines with the absence of the extreme rainy days likewise the differences in skewness fig 5i l and kurtosis fig 5m p also show a significant decrease when extreme rainy days are absent the relatively large differences of these metrics in the dry seasons djf and mam indicate the relative importance of these extreme rain events on the mean state of the rainfall in the mam season when both skewness fig 5j and kurtosis fig 5n increase between tampa and orlando in the modified data series it suggests that the mean state of the rainfall decreases considerably from the absence of these extreme rain events which results in higher skewness and kurtosis in the modified dataset yielding a negative difference in fig 5j and n in contrast the relatively moderate changes to the skewness and kurtosis in the rest of the year jja and son seasons suggest the potential importance of the light to moderate rain events relative to the extreme rain events to the seasonal total these results have important implications on the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate over pf for example it is well known that pf has the highest density of landfalling tropical cyclones in the continental us knight and davis 2009 klotzbach 2011 therefore one could claim that such extreme rain events could have an implication on the seasonal hydroclimate over pf during the atlantic hurricane season yet when enso has a strong influence on the landfalling tropical cyclones over pf e g klotzbach 2011 misra et al 2012 kirtman et al 2017 there is no discernible influence of enso on the seasonal precipitation anomalies of either the summer or the fall seasons over pf misra and dinapoli 2013 kirtman et al 2017 our results corroborate these findings further in suggesting that the extreme rain events as isolated by those events ranked at or above the 95th percentile which include these infrequent landfalling tropical cyclone events over pf do not significantly contribute to the overall rainfall distribution of the corresponding season 3 3 fitting the gamma distribution to understand characteristics of extreme rain in order to put the findings of the previous sub section on a more theoretical footing and to understand the contribution of the extreme rain events to the seasonal rainfall total in an alternative manner we examined the characteristics of the fitted gamma distribution to the daily rainfall distribution in each of the four seasons as mentioned earlier gamma distribution is a two parameter frequency distribution described by the shape and the scale factors the shape and scale factors inform the characteristics of the fitted gamma distribution such that shape dominated distributions suggest a weaker contribution of the extreme rains to the seasonal total vis √† vis a scale dominated distribution that would imply a greater importance of the extreme rains to the seasonal total becker et al 2009 in fig 6 a d we show the shape parameter of the fitted gamma distribution for the daily rainfall of the four seasons similarly fig 6e h displays the corresponding scale parameter of the gamma distribution grids that don t pass the chi square test are masked out there are many interesting observations from these figures that one could make based on the spatial gradients of the shape and the scale parameters of the gamma distribution including i gamma distribution is a good fit to daily rainfall distribution in all four seasons across most parts of pf ii the daily precipitation in the djf season shows a distribution with low shape parameter pointing to comparatively larger skewness that is evenly distributed across pf fig 6a at the same time we observe in djf that over northern florida north of 28 n the distribution is scale dominated suggesting heavier and or long tails with their largest values appearing north of 30 n fig 6e iii like in the djf season the shape parameter is small and uniformly distributed across pf in the mam season fig 6b the distribution is scale dominated especially in northern parts of pf which points to the significance of the extreme rain events to the seasonal total iv in the jja season the shape parameter assumes a larger value than in the previous two seasons fig 6c while the scale parameter diminishes fig 6g which connote that extreme rain events are comparatively less important and light to moderate rain rates contribute significantly to the seasonal total v in the son season the daily distribution of rainfall begin to revert to relatively smaller values of the shape parameter across pf fig 6d and larger values of the scale parameter fig 6h showing the growing importance of the extreme rain events on the seasonal total now we re fit the gamma distribution on the modified data series where in the rain events at or exceeding the 95th percentile threshold is zeroed out to assess the importance of such events on the seasonal total fig 7 the following inferences on the impact of the extreme rain events on the seasonal totals and the rainfall distribution in the season can be made from fig 7 i in each of the seasons the shape parameter increases and the scale parameter declines in the modified data series relative to the original data this suggests that the extreme rain events contribute significantly to the seasonal total in all four seasons across pf ii between the djf and the mam seasons the impact of removing the extreme rain events is slightly higher in the mam season relative to the djf season with larger changes observed to the shape and scale parameters in the mam season iii between the jja and the son seasons the shape parameter shows a larger impact in the former compared to the latter season with the jja season assuming larger values of the shape parameter in the modified data series which imply the growing influence of the light to moderate rain events on the seasonal total however in the son season the scale parameter shows a larger reduction compared to the jja season suggesting the diminishing influence of the extreme rain events on the seasonal total bastola and misra 2013 clearly showed that diurnal variations contribute significantly to seasonal rainfall over pf throughout the year in jja and son seasons diurnal variations explain nearly 50 of the total seasonal variance in parts of pf carbone and tuttle 2008 bastola and misra 2013 these diurnal variations of precipitation are associated with sea breeze type of thunderstorms blanchard and lopez 1985 hodanish et al 1997 therefore if the bulk of the seasonal rainfall comprises of such rain events it is incumbent of the seasonal prediction models to simulate these diurnal variations with reasonable fidelity however the timing and magnitude of the diurnal variations is a challenging issue for climate models dai and trenberth 2004 lewis and karoly 2013 yin and porporato 2017 wang et al 2018 this issue is further accentuated over pf because the sea breeze events require much higher spatial resolution than the current climate models offer pielke 1974 anthes et al 1982 tijm et al 1999 our results show that extreme rain events make a relatively weak contribution towards the seasonal distribution of rainfall in the summer and fall seasons the distribution of summer rainfall is not sensitive to extreme rain events which are primarily produced by tropical cyclones thus the results from our study suggest that the absence of resolving the tropical cyclones in our current climate models e g kirtman et al 2014 rebecca et al 2017 may not be as detrimental for the seasonal simulation of summer rainfall over pf however these global climate models continued to display poor prediction skills in summer and fall seasonal rainfall over pf suggesting that there are other responsible factors like the poor simulation of the diurnal variations 3 4 the role of el ni√±o and the southern oscillation enso the shape and the scale parameters for the warm djf and mam seasons and the corresponding differences between the warm and the cold phases for the two seasons are shown in fig 8 the gamma distribution parameters for the warm djf fig 8a and b respectively and for the warm mam fig 8c and d respectively seasons are quite similar to the corresponding shape and scale parameters fitted over all seasons in fig 6 in comparing the corresponding differences of this distribution of shape and scale parameters with the cold enso phase seasons fig 8e h we observe that in cold enso phases the scale parameter undergoes uniform reduction across pf in both seasons while the changes to shape parameter is less conclusive in other words warm phase of enso tends to make the tails of the daily rainfall distribution heavier and or longer relative to the cold phase of enso given the importance of the extreme rain events in the daily rainfall distribution of the djf and mam seasons as revealed in the previous discussions fig 8 further suggests that the enso forced signal in seasonal rainfall changes over pf can best be captured when these extreme rain events are resolved these results are significant in the context of the seasonal predictability of the hydroclimate of pf as kirtman et al 2017 suggested the remote enso forcing on the winter and spring seasonal climate over pf has a huge bearing on the fidelity of the seasonal prediction skills of the global models here we find that enso also has a bearing on the extreme rain events over pf in the djf and mam seasons and that such extreme rain events have a significant influence on the total rainfall distribution across the corresponding seasons therefore our results suggest that these global seasonal climate models that display reasonable seasonal prediction skill over pf in these dry seasons are also resolving in all likelihood the variations in the frequency of these extreme rain events 4 conclusions this paper has examined the daily rainfall distribution across pf in all four seasons we examined the daily rainfall distribution over pf both by computing well known statistical metrics e g skewness and kurtosis and also by way of looking at the shape and scale parameters of the fitted gamma distribution to the daily rainfall spread across the seasons our results indicate that extreme rain events over pf are relatively more important to the seasonal total in the drier seasons of djf and mam when the seasonal mean rainfall is small this result is encouraging in that the extreme rain bearing systems in the boreal winter are usually from the synoptic frontal systems over this region ropelewski and halpert 1986 1989 kiladis and diaz 1989 schmidt et al 2001 that could be potentially resolved in relatively coarse climate models as this study finds these extreme rain events are strongly modulated by enso in the winter and spring seasons therefore the global models which display reasonable seasonal prediction skill in depicting enso teleconnections will likely pick this signal however in terms of long term climate projections the uncertainty of projecting enso features like its frequency duration spatial structure in the equatorial pacific ocean in a future warm climate contribute to the uncertainty of extreme rain events and thereby the seasonal rainfall in the dry season over pf in the summer and fall seasons pf has some of the largest fraction of landfalling tropical cyclones in the continental us yet we observe that the skewness and kurtosis of the daily rainfall distribution in the jja and the son seasons are relatively less modulated by the removal of these extreme rain events than in the drier djf and mam seasons the seasonal distribution of rainfall in these seasons is largely made of light to moderate rain events that are related to diurnal variations or sea breeze type thunderstorm events keim 1996 baigorria et al 2007 bastola and misra 2013 therefore the lack of resolving the tropical cyclones in coarse global climate models may not be detrimental to its seasonal prediction skill over florida however unless the climate prediction models improve their simulation of light to moderate rain events there is little hope in improving the seasonal prediction skills or reducing the uncertainty in long term climate projections of the summer and fall seasons hydroclimate over pf 5 data availability the gridded rainfall
