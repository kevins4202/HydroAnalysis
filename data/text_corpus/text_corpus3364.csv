16820,our previous work has reported the pretreatment of secondary sludge with free ammonia nh3 fa enhanced the methane production in batch biochemical methane potential tests however the batch biochemical methane potential test could only provide conservative results compared to continuous semi continuous anaerobic digestion also the impacts of fa pretreatment on the key anaerobic digestion parameters including volatile solids vs destruction sludge dewaterability and pathogen removal are still unknown this study for the first time investigated these impacts using semi continuous anaerobic digestion systems for 130 days pretreatment of secondary sludge for 24 h at an fa concentration of 560 mg nh3 n l improved vs destruction by 26 4 from 22 0 to 27 8 supported by a similar increase of 28 6 in methane production from 126 7 to 162 9 ml ch4 g vsfed model based analysis revealed that fa pretreatment improved the sludge degradability extent which may be the reason for the enhanced vs destruction equally importantly the dewaterability of the digested sludge with fa pretreatment was also enhanced by 9 2 from 12 0 to 13 1 in solids content of the dewatered digested sludge which could be partly attributed to the increased zeta potential from 16 7 to 14 5 mv anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment enhanced the removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts mpn most probable number ts total solids indicating fa pretreatment was effective in enhancing pathogen removal with inorganic solids representing 21 of the sludge used the volume of dewatered sludge to be disposed of was reduced by 14 5 via fa pretreatment this will substantially decrease the cost as evaluated by economic analysis in brief this study provides a promising strategy to enhance sludge reduction in anaerobic digestion and is of great significance in promoting the application of fa pretreatment strategy in the real world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion sludge reduction free ammonia secondary sludge volatile solids destruction dewaterability 1 introduction the secondary sludge is an unfavorable by product in wastewater treatment plants wwtps appels et al 2008 wang et al 2017a there are 10 17 tonnes of wet secondary sludge 70 100 kg dry solid produced when every 1000 tonnes of wastewater is processed through the activated sludge treatment metcalf 2003 the treatment and disposal of secondary sludge account for 20 60 of the total operating cost in wwtps pilli et al 2011 vlyssides and karlis 2004 anaerobic digestion for secondary sludge and primary sludge is adopted worldwide in wwtps due to the effective sludge reduction and energy recovery from sludge secondary sludge mainly consists of sludge cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps bougrier et al 2005 which is hard to release soluble carbohydrates and organic substances for biodegradation lafitte trouqué and forster 2002 compared to primary sludge secondary sludge has relatively lower biodegradability which makes it more difficult to be utilized in anaerobic digestion mottet et al 2010 ucisik and henze 2008 this greatly inhibits the efficiency of sludge reduction and energy recovery from secondary sludge in anaerobic digestion the anaerobic digestion process contains four sub processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the rate limiting process is hydrolysis batstone et al 2002 to enhance the hydrolysis of secondary sludge pretreatment strategies of secondary sludge e g thermal ultrasonic and ozonation before anaerobic digestion have been explored appels et al 2008 carrère et al 2010 wang et al 2017a however these pretreatment strategies are generally cost intensive which requires the supply of heat energy or chemicals additionally the anaerobically digested sludge needs to be dewatered to reduce its volume before its final disposal various treatment methods were explored to improve sludge dewaterability cao et al 2020 but these methods are cost intensive as well thus a cost effective pretreatment strategy for secondary sludge is highly desirable for promoting the anaerobic digestion performance and enhancing the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge free ammonia fa nh3 the un ionized form of ammonium is a waste by product existing in the anaerobic digestion liquor in the wastewater treatment plants wang 2017 wang et al 2017b fa caused cell lysis at the fa levels of hundreds of mg nh3 n l or above wei et al 2017 wei et al 2017 reported that fa pretreatment of secondary sludge at 420 680 mg nh3 n l effectively improved the biochemical methane potential and hydrolysis rate by 14 22 and 91 140 in the batch biochemical methane potential bmp tests however the bmp test could only provide conservative results compared to continuous semi continuous anaerobic sludge digestion batstone et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 furthermore the impacts of fa pretreatment on the key anaerobic digestion parameters including volatile solids vs destruction and sludge dewaterability were not evaluated in our previous bmp tests because the high amount of the inoculum in the bmp tests inoculum to secondary sludge ratio is usually 1 5 2 5 on the vs basis in the bmp tests masked the effects of fa on the digested sludge raposo et al 2006 in addition as approximately 70 of sludge is reused in agricultural land in australia australian biosolids statistics 2019 the effect of pretreatment strategy on the pathogen removal efficiency is also critical from the perspective of environmental and health risks however to date the impact of fa pretreatment on pathogen removal during anaerobic digestion remains unclear revealing these impacts will accelerate the adpotion of our patented fa pretreatment strategy in the real world applications this study aims to reveal the impact of fa pretreatment on vs destruction dewaterability and pathogen removal in semi continuous anaerobic digestion for the first time two semi continuous anaerobic digestion systems were operated for 130 days after the two systems reached parallel one of the systems worked as the experimental system fed with the fa treated secondary sludge and the other one worked as the control system fed with raw secondary sludge the vs destruction methane production ammonium release dewaterability of digested sludge and the pathogen removal were evaluated model based analysis was conducted to determine degradability extent and apparent hydrolysis rate in the two systems in order to reveal the reason for the enhanced vs destruction furthermore the economic benefits of fa pretreatment strategy were also assessed the findings provided a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of fa pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of secondary sludge and promoted the application of the fa pretreatment strategy in the real world 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic digestion systems and the setup two anaerobic digestion systems were set up through two water jacketed glass reactors with 1 4 l volume 1 l working volume each one worked as the control system and the other one worked as the experimental system fig 1 sludge feeding and discharging from each reactor were conducted simultaneously through masterflex l s peristaltic pumps 7553 89 cole parmer usa the water jacketed reactors were controlled at 37 0 1 c through the heated water which was circulated by the heating circulator cratc120 thermo fisher scientific usa the sludge in reactors was mixed evenly by magnetic stirrers at the speed of 400 440 rpm the ph in reactors was measured every day but not controlled biogas production was recorded by gas flow meters connected on the top of the reactors the biogas discharging from the gas flow meters was collected by aluminum foil bags fig 1 and used for biogas component analysis initially the systems were seeded with 1 l of the inoculum and then flushed with nitrogen for at least 20 min to construct an anaerobic atmosphere latif et al 2018 the systems were operated with a sludge retention time srt of 12 days resulting in a feeding sludge flow rate of 83 2 ml d 1 sludge discharging was operated simultaneously as feeding with a flow rate of 83 2 ml d 1 2 2 inoculum and secondary sludge the secondary sludge and inoculum anaerobically digested sludge were collected from a wastewater treatment plant in australia the secondary sludge was collected from the thickened sludge pipeline total solids 4 0 5 5 the thickened sludge was diluted with tap water to achieve 2 1 2 3 of total solids to prevent the clogging of the lab scale tubes and reactors the inoculum was collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digestion system treating a mixture of primary and secondary sludge the key properties of secondary sludge and inoculum are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental design and the monitoring protocol the experiments were divided into two phases phase i and phase ii the two systems were operated in parallel during phase i until the vs destruction and methane production in the two systems became stable and comparable then the fa pretreatment for anaerobic digestion was carried out at phase ii in phase i day 1 74 both of the two systems were operated at an srt of 12 days no pretreatment was applied in both systems the ph in reactors was measured but not controlled which was in the range of 7 4 0 1 phase i lasted for 6 srt in phase ii experimental phase day 75 130 the control system was operated the same as that in phase i without any pretreatment whereas fa pretreatment was applied in the experimental system briefly the sludge was transferred into the pretreatment reactor a stock ammonium chloride solution nh4cl 3 m was added to the pretreatment reactor resulting in a theoretical concentration of 980 mg nh4 nh3 n l the ph of the sludge in the pretreatment reactor was maintained at 9 5 0 1 by sodium hydroxide solution saturated solution resulting in an fa concentration of 560 mg n l which was based on the optimization results in our previous study wei et al 2017 the concentration of fa was calculated as s nh3 nh4 n 10ph kb kw 10ph anthonisen et al 1976 where the kb kw is equal to e6344 273 t t represents the temperature the fa pretreatment lasted for 24 h at room temperature 22 1 c then the pre treated sludge was pumped into the experiment reactor as the same operation as the control one ph in the two systems was recorded but not controlled which were 7 8 0 2 and 7 3 0 2 in the experiment and control reactors respectively an alternative experimental design was to apply the ph 9 5 pretreatment and ammonium pretreatment in the control system however it should be noted that our previous study has demonstrated that fa instead of ph or ammonium played a dominant role in improving methane production in anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 in addition while such an experimental design is of theoretical interest it is not ideal for our purpose to demonstrate the practical value of the fa pretreatment strategy the experiment was designed in order to mimic the real world application situation from the engineering point of view the practitioners in the wwtps are mainly concerned about whether the implementation of the fa pretreatment will help to save the cost in comparison with the existing case i e the case without any pretreatment based on this consideration it was decided not to include ph 9 5 pretreatment or ammonium pretreatment in control so that the two engineering designs i e with fa pretreatment and without any pretreatment could be directly compared the biogas production was measured every day and the biogas components were analysed after the two systems reached stable and convergent the vs of feed sludge and the digested sludge from the two systems were measured every three days to determine the vs destruction the ammonium concentrations in the two systems were measured once a week the ph of the digested sludge was measured every day volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations and alkalinity were measured during phase ii to make sure a steady anaerobic digestion was maintained in both reactors the dewaterability of the digested sludge was measured every three days the fecal coliforms and e coli pathogen indicators in the feed sludge and digested sludge with and without fa pretreatment were measured during the steady period of phase ii phase ii lasted for more than 4 srt 2 4 analytical methods ts and vs were measured as described in standard methods in triplicate apha 2005 the vs destruction was calculated vs destruction v s fed v s digested v s fed 100 where the vsfed was the vs of fed sludge and the vsdigested was the vs of the discharged digested sludge sludge was firstly centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane for measurement of soluble parameters including soluble chemical oxygen demand scod nh4 n vfas and alkalinity the concentrations of tcod scod nh4 n and vfas were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 the alkalinity was measured by a titrator metrohm ag switzerland with 855 robotic tirtosampler biogas components were determined by a gas chromatography 7820a agilent technology usa biogas production was measured by gas flow meters 3 2 0 1 ml bucket mgc 1 pmma ritter germany that connected to the reactors the dewaterability was evaluated using belt filter proxy test which was based on higgins et al 2014 and wei et al 2018 with some modifications briefly fecl3 solution concentration 1 0 wt working as coagulant aid was added to the sludge samples at a v v ratio of 1 50 then the commercial flocculent fo4490ssh snf pty ltd australia at the concentration of 0 15 wt was added to the sludge samples whilst gently swirling the flask containing sludge until coagulation occurred for the dewaterability test 15 ml of the flocculated sludge was centrifuged at 3273 g for 30 min afterwards the supernatant was decanted the residue solids sludge were centrifuged through a belt fiber filter at 3273 g for 10 min to obtain the sludge cake on the filter the mass of the sludge cake was measured as m1 and the sludge cake was then dried to a constant weight at 105 c the mass of dried sludge cake was measured as m2 the solids content of the sludge was determined by m2 m1 100 the belt filter proxy test was used in our study because it mimics the real world dewatering process in the wastewater treatment plants and is able to directly determine the solids content of the dewatered sludge the zeta potential of sludge samples after the flocculation was determined by a zetasizer malvern zetasizer nano zs uk to explain the dewaterability results the fecal coliform and e coli were chose as the indicators of pathogen concentrations and measured by colilert 18 reagents from the idexx laboratory http www idexx com au briefly the sludge samples were diluted by 102 105 times in several 120 ml sterilized bottles colilert 18 reagents were added into 100 ml of the diluted samples and dissolved sufficiently then the solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and sealed with a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was incubated at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h yellow wells indicated positive for the fecal coliform and light wells under uv light uv lamp 98 20951 00 idexx laboratories pty ltd australia indicated positive for e coli finally the quantity of fecal coliform and e coli in the sludge most probable number mpn was determined based on the number of positive wells and the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au the significance of difference between the control system and experimental system was carried out by t test and the significant level was set as 0 05 2 5 mathematical analysis mathematical analysis was based on the international water association anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 the modified version of aquasim 2 1d was used reichert 1994 inputs included proteins lipids carbohydrates particulate inerts ammonia and vfas which were based on a modified form of the activated sludge model no 1 asm1 adm1 interface nopens et al 2009 the main difference is that the inert fraction was mapped in terms of an overall degradability parameter batstone et al 2009 other fractions were based on cod vs nh4 n and vfas measurements as in the standard interface initial conditions of the systems were in the steady state in phase ii but were not particularly relevant because of model convergence degradability extent fd and apparent hydrolysis rate khyd were the main parameters used to evaluate and compare two systems with and without fa pretreatment in each system fd and khyd were estimated simultaneously to obtain the average optimal values using secant searches with parameter uncertainty being reported as the linear uncorrelated estimates of 95 confidence regions based on two tailed t tests batstone et al 2009 effluent vs concentration was used as a measured variable with sum of squared errors as an objective function 3 results 3 1 vs destruction the results of vs destruction methane production and ammonium release are shown in fig 2 the convergence in vs destruction and methane production in the two systems occurred around day 50 day 1 74 phase i after which the average vs destruction and methane productions in the control and experimental systems were comparable p 0 05 24 1 3 1 and 23 5 2 6 131 2 5 6 ml ch4 g vsfed and 130 7 5 6 ml ch4 g vsfed in phase ii 75 130 although the vs destruction fluctuated in the two systems the average vs destruction of 27 8 3 7 in the experimental system represented a relative increase of 26 4 p 0 05 27 8 22 0 27 8 100 compared with the average vs destruction of 22 0 3 1 in the control system when both systems reached steady state fig 3 the enhanced vs destruction probably stemmed from the enhanced release of intracellular and or extracellular constituents caused by fa pretreatment which has been demonstrated in our previous studies wang 2017 wei et al 2017 this demonstrated that fa pretreatment was effective in enhancing vs destruction during anaerobic digestion of secondary sludge it should be noted that the vs concentration of the fa pretreated sludge was comparable to that of the un pretreated sludge both at 17 6 0 2 g l therefore the enhanced vs destruction happened in the anaerobic digestion process instead of the fa pretreatment process similarly methane production was also improved by the fa pretreatment in the experimental system the average methane productions in the experimental and control systems were 162 9 10 3 ml ch4 g vsfed and 126 7 7 2 ml ch4 g vsfed respectively equivalent to an improvement of 28 6 this was in accordance with the improvement of vs destruction 26 4 as vs destruction in anaerobic digestion is accompanied by methane production batstone et al 2002 the similar improvements in methane production and vs destruction provided independent support to the vs destruction results the average methane and co2 contents in the biogas from the experimental system at the steady state of phase ii were 67 5 0 8 and 26 1 0 4 respectively in comparison to 62 0 0 6 and 31 9 0 6 in the control system the lower co2 content and consequently higher ch4 content were due to the higher ph in the experimental system than that in the control system 7 8 0 2 vs 7 3 0 2 leading to the capture of more co2 in the liquid phase to maintain a good buffer in the experimental system although a higher ph was observed in the experimental system both systems were very stable as observed during phase ii the vfas alkalinity ratios were 0 02 0 01 and 0 01 0 01 in the experimental and control systems respectively reflecting the two systems were stable since the vfas alkalinity ratios were in a reasonable range of 0 01 0 40 callaghan et al 2002 lens et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 the average nh4 nh3 n concentration 1020 8 mg l in the experimental system was 28 7 higher than that 793 0 mg l in the control system if the externally added nh4 nh3 n in the fa pretreatment was not considered the higher nh4 nh3 n concentration arose from the enhanced vs destruction in the experimental system because vs destruction in anaerobic digestion is accompanied by nh4 nh3 n production batstone et al 2002 the 28 7 higher nh4 nh3 n concentration in the experimental system is consistent with the enhanced vs destruction result 26 4 further supporting the vs destruction results 3 2 model based analysis the apparent hydrolysis rate khyd in the systems with and without fa pretreatment was not well identified because an upper limit of the apparent hydrolysis rate could not be established data not shown this was also the case in the study of batstone et al 2009 where a poor identifiability of khyd was also observed in their semi continuous long term study in contrast the degradability extent fd in the two systems with and without fa pretreatment were well identified and determined as 0 32 0 03 and 0 25 0 02 respectively this indicates that fa pretreatment enhanced the degradability extent fd of the secondary sludge by 28 3 3 dewaterability the solids contents of the dewatered digested sludge in the two systems were measured to evaluate whether fa pretreatment was effective in improving the dewaterability of the digested sludge the solids contents of dewatered digested sludge in two systems reached convergence and were similar p 0 05 in phase i however the solids content of dewatered digested sludge with fa pretreatment 13 1 0 3 was higher p 0 05 than that 12 0 0 4 without fa pretreatment at the steady state of phase ii fig 4 a this represented a relative increase of 9 2 in the solids content of the dewatered digested sludge with fa pretreatment indicating that fa pretreatment was effective in improving the dewaterability of digested sludge the zeta potential of anaerobically digested sludge 14 5 0 6 mv with fa treatment was higher p 0 05 than that without pretreatment 16 7 0 8 mv fig 4b it has been demonstrated that the sludge dewaterability increased with the decreased absolute value of sludge zeta potential li et al 2016 therefore the zeta potential results provided independent support to the solids content results further confirming that fa pretreatment was effective in improving the dewaterability of the digested sludge 3 4 pathogen removal fig 5 shows the biomass specific mpn of the fecal coliform and e coli before and after pretreatment in both control and experimental systems the average mpn of fecal coliform in the secondary sludge was 5 2 log mpn g ts which is similar to the previous studies 6 0 log mpn g ts riau et al 2010 wei et al 2018 the anaerobic digestion per se achieved the removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 7 log mpn g ts from 5 2 to 3 5 log mpn g ts and 1 6 log mpn g ts from 5 0 to 3 4 log mpn g ts respectively fig 5 in contrast fa pretreatment by itself removed fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 2 log mpn g ts respectively fig 5 also the combined anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment achieved the removals of fecal coliform and e coli both by 3 0 log mpn g ts from 5 2 log mpn g ts to 2 2 log mpn g and from 5 0 log mpn g ts to 2 0 log mpn g ts respectively fig 5 therefore the combined anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment enhanced the removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts respectively in comparison to anaerobic digestion per se indicating fa pretreatment is effective in enhancing pathogen removal in anaerobic digestion 4 discussion 4 1 fa pretreatment enhanced the vs destruction in anaerobic digestion vs destruction in the experimental system with fa pretreatment was significantly improved by 26 4 compared to the control system supported by the results of enhanced methane production and increased ammonium ammonia concentration the enhanced vs destruction was probably due to the enhanced breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances eps and or cells caused by fa pretreatment which was indicated by the enhanced scod release from 1195 7 10 6 mg l to 1524 4 20 3 mg l by fa pretreatment the experimentally observed improvement of 26 4 in vs destruction in this study was higher than the estimated improvement of 16 22 in our previous study using bmp tests wei et al 2017 this could be attributed to conservative nature of the bmp test and the difference in sludge characteristics batstone et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 it should be noted that no ph pretreatment alone or ammonium pretreatment alone was conducted in this study this is because our previous study has demonstrated that fa instead of ph or ammonium played a dominant role in improving methane production in anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 also the treatment conditions applied fa 560 mg n l treatment duration 24 h were not the results of a systematic optimisation and hence the conditions applied are not optimal this was because the aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing anaerobic digestion performance by using fa pretreatment strategy the higher vs destruction may be achieved after optimizing fa concentration and treatment duration model analysis revealed that the degradability extent fd i e degradable fraction of secondary sludge with fa pretreatment was improved by 28 which may contribute to the enhanced vs destruction in the experimental system according to the model based analysis and vs destruction the fractions of organics in secondary sludge could be divided into 1 not degradable organics i e 1 degradability extent 2 degraded fraction in the system i e vs destruction and 3 degradable but not degraded fraction i e degradability extent vs destruction fig 6 the results revealed fa pretreatment reduced the not degradable organics and increased the organics degradation in the anaerobic digestion system however the degradable but not degraded fractions in the two systems were comparable p 0 05 indicating the digestates in the two systems had similar stabilised state also approximately 12 of the degradable fraction was not degraded in both systems which may result from a short srt time of 12 days many pretreatment methods have been reported to enhance vs destruction in anaerobic digestion carrère et al 2010 wang et al 2017a for instance microwave pretreatment 70 intensity for 12 min increased vs destruction by 14 uma rani et al 2013 ultrasonic pretreatment 41 khz 1 8 w cm2 7 5 min improved vs destruction by 6 tiehm et al 2001 cacho rivero et al 2006 found hydrogen peroxide pretreatment at 2 0 g h2o2 g vs for 24 h increased vs destruction by 15 however these pretreatment strategies required intensive energy investment and or large chemical input in contrast fa is a waste by product of wastewater treatment and directly exists in the digestion liquor wang 2017 also see section 4 4 although the free nitrous acid fna hno2 pretreatment strategy also applied a waste by product of wastewater treatment wang et al 2013a the fna strategy relies on the side stream nitritation of digested liquor to convert ammonium ammonia in the digestion liquor to nitrite ph decrease accordingly to produce fna however the side stream nitritation reactor does not exist in most of the wastewater treatment plants making the fna production on site difficult furthermore our study demonstrated that fa pretreatment increased the average methane content in biogas by 8 9 in comparison to the control systems biogas purification is mandatory for methane application before entering the natural gas grid or combustion engines basu et al 2010 the current technologies for biogas upgrading including absorption high pressure scrubbing high pressure adsorption cryogenic separation and membrane separation required large investment and energy consumption uusitalo et al 2014 the higher methane proportion in biogas due to fa pretreatment could potentially reduce the cost and energy consumption in biogas upgrading lastella et al 2002 4 2 fa pretreatment enhanced dewaterability of digested sludge dewaterability indicates the quantity of water to be withdrawn in the sludge water separation process and is closely related to the physicochemical properties of sludge jiang and zhou 2020 higher dewaterability refers to lower water content and higher solids content resulting in less sludge for further transportation and disposal many pretreatment strategies for example low temperature pretreatment 55 100 c pilli et al 2015 could lead to the decrease in dewaterability of digested sludge in contrast fa pretreatment improved the dewaterability of digested sludge by 9 2 section 3 2 compared to the digested sludge without pretreatment the water in sludge can be categorized into free water and bound water free water combines with the sludge loosely and could be removed easily by mechanical techniques by contrast bound water is difficult to be removed during dewatering process because it combines with the sludge structure by chemical bonds or capillary forces cai et al 2018 kopp and dichtl 2000 li et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that the eps destruction could weaken the sludge hydrophilicity and reduce bound water content thereby improving sludge dewaterability liang et al 2020 our previous study has indicated that fa pretreatment destroyed eps and cells wei et al 2017 this may be the reason for the improved dewaterability of digested sludge with fa pretreatment in addition flocculation is widely applied in the sludge dewatering process wang et al 2013b with the addition of favourable flocculent to sludge the sludge flocculability can be improved which will lead to an improved sludge dewaterability chen et al 2001 it was reported that a decrease in negative charge corresponding to the increase of zeta potential indicates a decrement of electrostatic repulsive interaction which benefits the sludge particle collision destabilization and flocculation li et al 2016 you et al 2017 in other words a higher zeta potential indicates better flocculation and therefore better sludge dewaterability in this study the zeta potential of digested sludge with fa pretreatment was more neutral than the digested sludge without fa pretreatment section 3 2 indicating a better flocculability of the digested sludge with fa pretreatment this explains the enhanced dewaterability of digested sludge with fa pretreatment 4 3 fa pretreatment enhanced pathogen removal during anaerobic digestion pathogen removal was also enhanced through fa pretreatment which was reflected by the enhanced removal of two pathogen indicators i e the fecal coliform and e coli the concentrations of fecal coliform and e coli in the digested sludge with fa pretreatment were 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts lower than those without fa pretreatment also the fecal coliform of 2 5 log mpn g ts and e coli of 2 0 log mpn g ts in the digested sludge with fa pretreatment were under 3 log mpn g ts of fecal coliform and achieved 2 0 log mpn g ts of e coli as required for grade a biosolids by the new south wales environmental protection agency australia epa 2000 indicating combined anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment has a great potential to achieve grade a biosolids in real life applications this revealed that fa pretreatment strategy also delivers large environmental benefits and opens a door for more biosolids to be applied in agriculture this study demonstrated that both the fa pretreatment by itself and anaerobic digestion process by itself contributed to pathogen removal however some pretreatment strategies observed pathogen re growth in the anaerobic digestion process although the pretreatment itself enhanced pathogen removal for instance zhang et al 2019 observed that fna itself 250 mg hno2 n l for 24 h removed fecal coliform by 2 8 log mpn g ts however the concentration of fecal coliform increased by 2 1 log mpn g ts during the anaerobic digestion process this indicated that fna pretreatment by itself may only inactive not kill fecal coliform whereas the fa pretreatment by itself may kill fecal coliform and e coli however this still requires further investigation 4 4 implications our previous study has demonstrated that fa pretreatment is effective in enhancing methane production in batch bmp tests however the batch bmp test could only provide conservative results compared to continuous semi continuous anaerobic sludge digestion batstone et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 furthermore the effects of fa pretreatment on the other key anaerobic digestion parameters including vs destruction sludge dewaterability and pathogen removal were still unknown because our previous bmp tests could not provide an accurate assessment on these parameters due to the existence of the large amounts of inoculum this study revealed for the first time that fa pretreatment of secondary sludge could achieve multiple benefits in the anaerobic digestion including enhanced vs destruction improved sludge dewaterability and increased pathogen removal this was experimentally demonstrated in the semi continuous anaerobic digestion reactors for 130 days model analysis based on the asm1 adm1 interface revealed that enhanced degradability extent fd may contribute to the enhanced vs destruction this study is of great significance in promoting the application of fa pretreatment strategy in the real world the overall improvements and implications through fa pretreatment in anaerobic digestion were shown in fig 7 based on the enhanced vs destruction and improved dewaterability of digested sludge achieved by the fa pretreatment the overall costs for sludge disposal will be reduced due to the sludge volume reduction table s1 with inorganic solids representing 20 8 of the sludge used the volume of sludge to be disposed of was estimated to be reduced by 14 5 see si for details of the calculation due to the enhanced vs destruction in the anaerobic digestion system with fa pretreatment the capacity of the digestion system could be improved by 6 accordingly see si for details of the calculation this enhancement indicated that the sludge loading rate in the anaerobic digestion system with fa pretreatment could be potentially 6 higher than the control digestion system it revealed that the fa pretreatment strategy could provide a superior anaerobic digestion system with a higher loading rate than the current designed level which will avoid or delay the updating of the existing anaerobic digestion system this will provide real benefit for the wwtps a closed loop concept for wwtps was proposed for the fa pretreatment strategy as shown in fig 7 in our study the ammonium chloride was used for fa pretreatment through ph conditioning however in the real world operation the fa ammonia could be provided by the anaerobic digestion liquor because the digestion liquor contains high concentrations of ammonium ammonia this is more economical than the commercial ammonium ammonia source in the cases where the desirable fa concentration is not achievable from the digestion liquor a moderate amount of alkali can be added to increase the ph and therefore the fa concentration also the implementation of this fa pretreatment strategy requires minimal energy and chemical input a hypothetical wwtp of 100 megalitres including anaerobic digestion system srt 12 days was used to estimate the economic benefits of fa pretreatment strategy table s1 according to the experimental results in this study the 26 enhancement in vs destruction 9 increase in dewatered solids content and 29 improvement in methane production see fig 3 would jointly result in a higher economic benefit of approximately 240 000 per annum in the wwtp with fa pretreatment compared to wwtp without pretreatment even if the capital and operational cost of fa pretreatment unit was considered the higher benefits arose from the saved cost in reduced sludge transport and disposal expenditure 178 000 per annum and increased methane production 112 000 per annum which subtracted the cost for fa pretreatment 50 000 per annum this revealed that fa pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion was economically promising it should be noted that the economic benefit calculated above was used as an indication the economic benefit will rely on various economic factors e g local sludge disposal cost power price etc it is worthy to mention that the benefit of the enhanced pathogen removal was not included in the above economic analysis the economic benefits should be higher after considering the benefits of the enhanced pathogen removal 5 conclusions this study experimentally demonstrated that fa pretreatment enhanced vs destruction improved sludge dewaterability and enhanced pathogen removal for the first time in the semi continuous systems operated for 130 days these new results are of great significance in facilitating the application of fa pretreatment strategy in the real world the major conclusions are as following fa pretreatment enhanced the vs destruction by 26 4 in the anaerobic digestion of secondary sludge supported by the comparable increase in the methane production and ammonium ammonia release from sludge model analysis revealed that the enhanced degradability extent of secondary sludge with fa pretreatment contributed to the enhanced vs destruction the dewaterability of digested sludge through fa pretreatment was enhanced by 9 2 compared with the digested sludge without fa pretreatment this was supported by the increased zeta potential fa pretreatment was effective in enhancing pathogen removal in anaerobic digestion this was supported by the enhanced removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts fa pretreatment

16820,our previous work has reported the pretreatment of secondary sludge with free ammonia nh3 fa enhanced the methane production in batch biochemical methane potential tests however the batch biochemical methane potential test could only provide conservative results compared to continuous semi continuous anaerobic digestion also the impacts of fa pretreatment on the key anaerobic digestion parameters including volatile solids vs destruction sludge dewaterability and pathogen removal are still unknown this study for the first time investigated these impacts using semi continuous anaerobic digestion systems for 130 days pretreatment of secondary sludge for 24 h at an fa concentration of 560 mg nh3 n l improved vs destruction by 26 4 from 22 0 to 27 8 supported by a similar increase of 28 6 in methane production from 126 7 to 162 9 ml ch4 g vsfed model based analysis revealed that fa pretreatment improved the sludge degradability extent which may be the reason for the enhanced vs destruction equally importantly the dewaterability of the digested sludge with fa pretreatment was also enhanced by 9 2 from 12 0 to 13 1 in solids content of the dewatered digested sludge which could be partly attributed to the increased zeta potential from 16 7 to 14 5 mv anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment enhanced the removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts mpn most probable number ts total solids indicating fa pretreatment was effective in enhancing pathogen removal with inorganic solids representing 21 of the sludge used the volume of dewatered sludge to be disposed of was reduced by 14 5 via fa pretreatment this will substantially decrease the cost as evaluated by economic analysis in brief this study provides a promising strategy to enhance sludge reduction in anaerobic digestion and is of great significance in promoting the application of fa pretreatment strategy in the real world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion sludge reduction free ammonia secondary sludge volatile solids destruction dewaterability 1 introduction the secondary sludge is an unfavorable by product in wastewater treatment plants wwtps appels et al 2008 wang et al 2017a there are 10 17 tonnes of wet secondary sludge 70 100 kg dry solid produced when every 1000 tonnes of wastewater is processed through the activated sludge treatment metcalf 2003 the treatment and disposal of secondary sludge account for 20 60 of the total operating cost in wwtps pilli et al 2011 vlyssides and karlis 2004 anaerobic digestion for secondary sludge and primary sludge is adopted worldwide in wwtps due to the effective sludge reduction and energy recovery from sludge secondary sludge mainly consists of sludge cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps bougrier et al 2005 which is hard to release soluble carbohydrates and organic substances for biodegradation lafitte trouqué and forster 2002 compared to primary sludge secondary sludge has relatively lower biodegradability which makes it more difficult to be utilized in anaerobic digestion mottet et al 2010 ucisik and henze 2008 this greatly inhibits the efficiency of sludge reduction and energy recovery from secondary sludge in anaerobic digestion the anaerobic digestion process contains four sub processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the rate limiting process is hydrolysis batstone et al 2002 to enhance the hydrolysis of secondary sludge pretreatment strategies of secondary sludge e g thermal ultrasonic and ozonation before anaerobic digestion have been explored appels et al 2008 carrère et al 2010 wang et al 2017a however these pretreatment strategies are generally cost intensive which requires the supply of heat energy or chemicals additionally the anaerobically digested sludge needs to be dewatered to reduce its volume before its final disposal various treatment methods were explored to improve sludge dewaterability cao et al 2020 but these methods are cost intensive as well thus a cost effective pretreatment strategy for secondary sludge is highly desirable for promoting the anaerobic digestion performance and enhancing the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge free ammonia fa nh3 the un ionized form of ammonium is a waste by product existing in the anaerobic digestion liquor in the wastewater treatment plants wang 2017 wang et al 2017b fa caused cell lysis at the fa levels of hundreds of mg nh3 n l or above wei et al 2017 wei et al 2017 reported that fa pretreatment of secondary sludge at 420 680 mg nh3 n l effectively improved the biochemical methane potential and hydrolysis rate by 14 22 and 91 140 in the batch biochemical methane potential bmp tests however the bmp test could only provide conservative results compared to continuous semi continuous anaerobic sludge digestion batstone et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 furthermore the impacts of fa pretreatment on the key anaerobic digestion parameters including volatile solids vs destruction and sludge dewaterability were not evaluated in our previous bmp tests because the high amount of the inoculum in the bmp tests inoculum to secondary sludge ratio is usually 1 5 2 5 on the vs basis in the bmp tests masked the effects of fa on the digested sludge raposo et al 2006 in addition as approximately 70 of sludge is reused in agricultural land in australia australian biosolids statistics 2019 the effect of pretreatment strategy on the pathogen removal efficiency is also critical from the perspective of environmental and health risks however to date the impact of fa pretreatment on pathogen removal during anaerobic digestion remains unclear revealing these impacts will accelerate the adpotion of our patented fa pretreatment strategy in the real world applications this study aims to reveal the impact of fa pretreatment on vs destruction dewaterability and pathogen removal in semi continuous anaerobic digestion for the first time two semi continuous anaerobic digestion systems were operated for 130 days after the two systems reached parallel one of the systems worked as the experimental system fed with the fa treated secondary sludge and the other one worked as the control system fed with raw secondary sludge the vs destruction methane production ammonium release dewaterability of digested sludge and the pathogen removal were evaluated model based analysis was conducted to determine degradability extent and apparent hydrolysis rate in the two systems in order to reveal the reason for the enhanced vs destruction furthermore the economic benefits of fa pretreatment strategy were also assessed the findings provided a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of fa pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of secondary sludge and promoted the application of the fa pretreatment strategy in the real world 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic digestion systems and the setup two anaerobic digestion systems were set up through two water jacketed glass reactors with 1 4 l volume 1 l working volume each one worked as the control system and the other one worked as the experimental system fig 1 sludge feeding and discharging from each reactor were conducted simultaneously through masterflex l s peristaltic pumps 7553 89 cole parmer usa the water jacketed reactors were controlled at 37 0 1 c through the heated water which was circulated by the heating circulator cratc120 thermo fisher scientific usa the sludge in reactors was mixed evenly by magnetic stirrers at the speed of 400 440 rpm the ph in reactors was measured every day but not controlled biogas production was recorded by gas flow meters connected on the top of the reactors the biogas discharging from the gas flow meters was collected by aluminum foil bags fig 1 and used for biogas component analysis initially the systems were seeded with 1 l of the inoculum and then flushed with nitrogen for at least 20 min to construct an anaerobic atmosphere latif et al 2018 the systems were operated with a sludge retention time srt of 12 days resulting in a feeding sludge flow rate of 83 2 ml d 1 sludge discharging was operated simultaneously as feeding with a flow rate of 83 2 ml d 1 2 2 inoculum and secondary sludge the secondary sludge and inoculum anaerobically digested sludge were collected from a wastewater treatment plant in australia the secondary sludge was collected from the thickened sludge pipeline total solids 4 0 5 5 the thickened sludge was diluted with tap water to achieve 2 1 2 3 of total solids to prevent the clogging of the lab scale tubes and reactors the inoculum was collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digestion system treating a mixture of primary and secondary sludge the key properties of secondary sludge and inoculum are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental design and the monitoring protocol the experiments were divided into two phases phase i and phase ii the two systems were operated in parallel during phase i until the vs destruction and methane production in the two systems became stable and comparable then the fa pretreatment for anaerobic digestion was carried out at phase ii in phase i day 1 74 both of the two systems were operated at an srt of 12 days no pretreatment was applied in both systems the ph in reactors was measured but not controlled which was in the range of 7 4 0 1 phase i lasted for 6 srt in phase ii experimental phase day 75 130 the control system was operated the same as that in phase i without any pretreatment whereas fa pretreatment was applied in the experimental system briefly the sludge was transferred into the pretreatment reactor a stock ammonium chloride solution nh4cl 3 m was added to the pretreatment reactor resulting in a theoretical concentration of 980 mg nh4 nh3 n l the ph of the sludge in the pretreatment reactor was maintained at 9 5 0 1 by sodium hydroxide solution saturated solution resulting in an fa concentration of 560 mg n l which was based on the optimization results in our previous study wei et al 2017 the concentration of fa was calculated as s nh3 nh4 n 10ph kb kw 10ph anthonisen et al 1976 where the kb kw is equal to e6344 273 t t represents the temperature the fa pretreatment lasted for 24 h at room temperature 22 1 c then the pre treated sludge was pumped into the experiment reactor as the same operation as the control one ph in the two systems was recorded but not controlled which were 7 8 0 2 and 7 3 0 2 in the experiment and control reactors respectively an alternative experimental design was to apply the ph 9 5 pretreatment and ammonium pretreatment in the control system however it should be noted that our previous study has demonstrated that fa instead of ph or ammonium played a dominant role in improving methane production in anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 in addition while such an experimental design is of theoretical interest it is not ideal for our purpose to demonstrate the practical value of the fa pretreatment strategy the experiment was designed in order to mimic the real world application situation from the engineering point of view the practitioners in the wwtps are mainly concerned about whether the implementation of the fa pretreatment will help to save the cost in comparison with the existing case i e the case without any pretreatment based on this consideration it was decided not to include ph 9 5 pretreatment or ammonium pretreatment in control so that the two engineering designs i e with fa pretreatment and without any pretreatment could be directly compared the biogas production was measured every day and the biogas components were analysed after the two systems reached stable and convergent the vs of feed sludge and the digested sludge from the two systems were measured every three days to determine the vs destruction the ammonium concentrations in the two systems were measured once a week the ph of the digested sludge was measured every day volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations and alkalinity were measured during phase ii to make sure a steady anaerobic digestion was maintained in both reactors the dewaterability of the digested sludge was measured every three days the fecal coliforms and e coli pathogen indicators in the feed sludge and digested sludge with and without fa pretreatment were measured during the steady period of phase ii phase ii lasted for more than 4 srt 2 4 analytical methods ts and vs were measured as described in standard methods in triplicate apha 2005 the vs destruction was calculated vs destruction v s fed v s digested v s fed 100 where the vsfed was the vs of fed sludge and the vsdigested was the vs of the discharged digested sludge sludge was firstly centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane for measurement of soluble parameters including soluble chemical oxygen demand scod nh4 n vfas and alkalinity the concentrations of tcod scod nh4 n and vfas were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 the alkalinity was measured by a titrator metrohm ag switzerland with 855 robotic tirtosampler biogas components were determined by a gas chromatography 7820a agilent technology usa biogas production was measured by gas flow meters 3 2 0 1 ml bucket mgc 1 pmma ritter germany that connected to the reactors the dewaterability was evaluated using belt filter proxy test which was based on higgins et al 2014 and wei et al 2018 with some modifications briefly fecl3 solution concentration 1 0 wt working as coagulant aid was added to the sludge samples at a v v ratio of 1 50 then the commercial flocculent fo4490ssh snf pty ltd australia at the concentration of 0 15 wt was added to the sludge samples whilst gently swirling the flask containing sludge until coagulation occurred for the dewaterability test 15 ml of the flocculated sludge was centrifuged at 3273 g for 30 min afterwards the supernatant was decanted the residue solids sludge were centrifuged through a belt fiber filter at 3273 g for 10 min to obtain the sludge cake on the filter the mass of the sludge cake was measured as m1 and the sludge cake was then dried to a constant weight at 105 c the mass of dried sludge cake was measured as m2 the solids content of the sludge was determined by m2 m1 100 the belt filter proxy test was used in our study because it mimics the real world dewatering process in the wastewater treatment plants and is able to directly determine the solids content of the dewatered sludge the zeta potential of sludge samples after the flocculation was determined by a zetasizer malvern zetasizer nano zs uk to explain the dewaterability results the fecal coliform and e coli were chose as the indicators of pathogen concentrations and measured by colilert 18 reagents from the idexx laboratory http www idexx com au briefly the sludge samples were diluted by 102 105 times in several 120 ml sterilized bottles colilert 18 reagents were added into 100 ml of the diluted samples and dissolved sufficiently then the solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and sealed with a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was incubated at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h yellow wells indicated positive for the fecal coliform and light wells under uv light uv lamp 98 20951 00 idexx laboratories pty ltd australia indicated positive for e coli finally the quantity of fecal coliform and e coli in the sludge most probable number mpn was determined based on the number of positive wells and the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au the significance of difference between the control system and experimental system was carried out by t test and the significant level was set as 0 05 2 5 mathematical analysis mathematical analysis was based on the international water association anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 the modified version of aquasim 2 1d was used reichert 1994 inputs included proteins lipids carbohydrates particulate inerts ammonia and vfas which were based on a modified form of the activated sludge model no 1 asm1 adm1 interface nopens et al 2009 the main difference is that the inert fraction was mapped in terms of an overall degradability parameter batstone et al 2009 other fractions were based on cod vs nh4 n and vfas measurements as in the standard interface initial conditions of the systems were in the steady state in phase ii but were not particularly relevant because of model convergence degradability extent fd and apparent hydrolysis rate khyd were the main parameters used to evaluate and compare two systems with and without fa pretreatment in each system fd and khyd were estimated simultaneously to obtain the average optimal values using secant searches with parameter uncertainty being reported as the linear uncorrelated estimates of 95 confidence regions based on two tailed t tests batstone et al 2009 effluent vs concentration was used as a measured variable with sum of squared errors as an objective function 3 results 3 1 vs destruction the results of vs destruction methane production and ammonium release are shown in fig 2 the convergence in vs destruction and methane production in the two systems occurred around day 50 day 1 74 phase i after which the average vs destruction and methane productions in the control and experimental systems were comparable p 0 05 24 1 3 1 and 23 5 2 6 131 2 5 6 ml ch4 g vsfed and 130 7 5 6 ml ch4 g vsfed in phase ii 75 130 although the vs destruction fluctuated in the two systems the average vs destruction of 27 8 3 7 in the experimental system represented a relative increase of 26 4 p 0 05 27 8 22 0 27 8 100 compared with the average vs destruction of 22 0 3 1 in the control system when both systems reached steady state fig 3 the enhanced vs destruction probably stemmed from the enhanced release of intracellular and or extracellular constituents caused by fa pretreatment which has been demonstrated in our previous studies wang 2017 wei et al 2017 this demonstrated that fa pretreatment was effective in enhancing vs destruction during anaerobic digestion of secondary sludge it should be noted that the vs concentration of the fa pretreated sludge was comparable to that of the un pretreated sludge both at 17 6 0 2 g l therefore the enhanced vs destruction happened in the anaerobic digestion process instead of the fa pretreatment process similarly methane production was also improved by the fa pretreatment in the experimental system the average methane productions in the experimental and control systems were 162 9 10 3 ml ch4 g vsfed and 126 7 7 2 ml ch4 g vsfed respectively equivalent to an improvement of 28 6 this was in accordance with the improvement of vs destruction 26 4 as vs destruction in anaerobic digestion is accompanied by methane production batstone et al 2002 the similar improvements in methane production and vs destruction provided independent support to the vs destruction results the average methane and co2 contents in the biogas from the experimental system at the steady state of phase ii were 67 5 0 8 and 26 1 0 4 respectively in comparison to 62 0 0 6 and 31 9 0 6 in the control system the lower co2 content and consequently higher ch4 content were due to the higher ph in the experimental system than that in the control system 7 8 0 2 vs 7 3 0 2 leading to the capture of more co2 in the liquid phase to maintain a good buffer in the experimental system although a higher ph was observed in the experimental system both systems were very stable as observed during phase ii the vfas alkalinity ratios were 0 02 0 01 and 0 01 0 01 in the experimental and control systems respectively reflecting the two systems were stable since the vfas alkalinity ratios were in a reasonable range of 0 01 0 40 callaghan et al 2002 lens et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 the average nh4 nh3 n concentration 1020 8 mg l in the experimental system was 28 7 higher than that 793 0 mg l in the control system if the externally added nh4 nh3 n in the fa pretreatment was not considered the higher nh4 nh3 n concentration arose from the enhanced vs destruction in the experimental system because vs destruction in anaerobic digestion is accompanied by nh4 nh3 n production batstone et al 2002 the 28 7 higher nh4 nh3 n concentration in the experimental system is consistent with the enhanced vs destruction result 26 4 further supporting the vs destruction results 3 2 model based analysis the apparent hydrolysis rate khyd in the systems with and without fa pretreatment was not well identified because an upper limit of the apparent hydrolysis rate could not be established data not shown this was also the case in the study of batstone et al 2009 where a poor identifiability of khyd was also observed in their semi continuous long term study in contrast the degradability extent fd in the two systems with and without fa pretreatment were well identified and determined as 0 32 0 03 and 0 25 0 02 respectively this indicates that fa pretreatment enhanced the degradability extent fd of the secondary sludge by 28 3 3 dewaterability the solids contents of the dewatered digested sludge in the two systems were measured to evaluate whether fa pretreatment was effective in improving the dewaterability of the digested sludge the solids contents of dewatered digested sludge in two systems reached convergence and were similar p 0 05 in phase i however the solids content of dewatered digested sludge with fa pretreatment 13 1 0 3 was higher p 0 05 than that 12 0 0 4 without fa pretreatment at the steady state of phase ii fig 4 a this represented a relative increase of 9 2 in the solids content of the dewatered digested sludge with fa pretreatment indicating that fa pretreatment was effective in improving the dewaterability of digested sludge the zeta potential of anaerobically digested sludge 14 5 0 6 mv with fa treatment was higher p 0 05 than that without pretreatment 16 7 0 8 mv fig 4b it has been demonstrated that the sludge dewaterability increased with the decreased absolute value of sludge zeta potential li et al 2016 therefore the zeta potential results provided independent support to the solids content results further confirming that fa pretreatment was effective in improving the dewaterability of the digested sludge 3 4 pathogen removal fig 5 shows the biomass specific mpn of the fecal coliform and e coli before and after pretreatment in both control and experimental systems the average mpn of fecal coliform in the secondary sludge was 5 2 log mpn g ts which is similar to the previous studies 6 0 log mpn g ts riau et al 2010 wei et al 2018 the anaerobic digestion per se achieved the removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 7 log mpn g ts from 5 2 to 3 5 log mpn g ts and 1 6 log mpn g ts from 5 0 to 3 4 log mpn g ts respectively fig 5 in contrast fa pretreatment by itself removed fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 2 log mpn g ts respectively fig 5 also the combined anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment achieved the removals of fecal coliform and e coli both by 3 0 log mpn g ts from 5 2 log mpn g ts to 2 2 log mpn g and from 5 0 log mpn g ts to 2 0 log mpn g ts respectively fig 5 therefore the combined anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment enhanced the removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts respectively in comparison to anaerobic digestion per se indicating fa pretreatment is effective in enhancing pathogen removal in anaerobic digestion 4 discussion 4 1 fa pretreatment enhanced the vs destruction in anaerobic digestion vs destruction in the experimental system with fa pretreatment was significantly improved by 26 4 compared to the control system supported by the results of enhanced methane production and increased ammonium ammonia concentration the enhanced vs destruction was probably due to the enhanced breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances eps and or cells caused by fa pretreatment which was indicated by the enhanced scod release from 1195 7 10 6 mg l to 1524 4 20 3 mg l by fa pretreatment the experimentally observed improvement of 26 4 in vs destruction in this study was higher than the estimated improvement of 16 22 in our previous study using bmp tests wei et al 2017 this could be attributed to conservative nature of the bmp test and the difference in sludge characteristics batstone et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 it should be noted that no ph pretreatment alone or ammonium pretreatment alone was conducted in this study this is because our previous study has demonstrated that fa instead of ph or ammonium played a dominant role in improving methane production in anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 also the treatment conditions applied fa 560 mg n l treatment duration 24 h were not the results of a systematic optimisation and hence the conditions applied are not optimal this was because the aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing anaerobic digestion performance by using fa pretreatment strategy the higher vs destruction may be achieved after optimizing fa concentration and treatment duration model analysis revealed that the degradability extent fd i e degradable fraction of secondary sludge with fa pretreatment was improved by 28 which may contribute to the enhanced vs destruction in the experimental system according to the model based analysis and vs destruction the fractions of organics in secondary sludge could be divided into 1 not degradable organics i e 1 degradability extent 2 degraded fraction in the system i e vs destruction and 3 degradable but not degraded fraction i e degradability extent vs destruction fig 6 the results revealed fa pretreatment reduced the not degradable organics and increased the organics degradation in the anaerobic digestion system however the degradable but not degraded fractions in the two systems were comparable p 0 05 indicating the digestates in the two systems had similar stabilised state also approximately 12 of the degradable fraction was not degraded in both systems which may result from a short srt time of 12 days many pretreatment methods have been reported to enhance vs destruction in anaerobic digestion carrère et al 2010 wang et al 2017a for instance microwave pretreatment 70 intensity for 12 min increased vs destruction by 14 uma rani et al 2013 ultrasonic pretreatment 41 khz 1 8 w cm2 7 5 min improved vs destruction by 6 tiehm et al 2001 cacho rivero et al 2006 found hydrogen peroxide pretreatment at 2 0 g h2o2 g vs for 24 h increased vs destruction by 15 however these pretreatment strategies required intensive energy investment and or large chemical input in contrast fa is a waste by product of wastewater treatment and directly exists in the digestion liquor wang 2017 also see section 4 4 although the free nitrous acid fna hno2 pretreatment strategy also applied a waste by product of wastewater treatment wang et al 2013a the fna strategy relies on the side stream nitritation of digested liquor to convert ammonium ammonia in the digestion liquor to nitrite ph decrease accordingly to produce fna however the side stream nitritation reactor does not exist in most of the wastewater treatment plants making the fna production on site difficult furthermore our study demonstrated that fa pretreatment increased the average methane content in biogas by 8 9 in comparison to the control systems biogas purification is mandatory for methane application before entering the natural gas grid or combustion engines basu et al 2010 the current technologies for biogas upgrading including absorption high pressure scrubbing high pressure adsorption cryogenic separation and membrane separation required large investment and energy consumption uusitalo et al 2014 the higher methane proportion in biogas due to fa pretreatment could potentially reduce the cost and energy consumption in biogas upgrading lastella et al 2002 4 2 fa pretreatment enhanced dewaterability of digested sludge dewaterability indicates the quantity of water to be withdrawn in the sludge water separation process and is closely related to the physicochemical properties of sludge jiang and zhou 2020 higher dewaterability refers to lower water content and higher solids content resulting in less sludge for further transportation and disposal many pretreatment strategies for example low temperature pretreatment 55 100 c pilli et al 2015 could lead to the decrease in dewaterability of digested sludge in contrast fa pretreatment improved the dewaterability of digested sludge by 9 2 section 3 2 compared to the digested sludge without pretreatment the water in sludge can be categorized into free water and bound water free water combines with the sludge loosely and could be removed easily by mechanical techniques by contrast bound water is difficult to be removed during dewatering process because it combines with the sludge structure by chemical bonds or capillary forces cai et al 2018 kopp and dichtl 2000 li et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that the eps destruction could weaken the sludge hydrophilicity and reduce bound water content thereby improving sludge dewaterability liang et al 2020 our previous study has indicated that fa pretreatment destroyed eps and cells wei et al 2017 this may be the reason for the improved dewaterability of digested sludge with fa pretreatment in addition flocculation is widely applied in the sludge dewatering process wang et al 2013b with the addition of favourable flocculent to sludge the sludge flocculability can be improved which will lead to an improved sludge dewaterability chen et al 2001 it was reported that a decrease in negative charge corresponding to the increase of zeta potential indicates a decrement of electrostatic repulsive interaction which benefits the sludge particle collision destabilization and flocculation li et al 2016 you et al 2017 in other words a higher zeta potential indicates better flocculation and therefore better sludge dewaterability in this study the zeta potential of digested sludge with fa pretreatment was more neutral than the digested sludge without fa pretreatment section 3 2 indicating a better flocculability of the digested sludge with fa pretreatment this explains the enhanced dewaterability of digested sludge with fa pretreatment 4 3 fa pretreatment enhanced pathogen removal during anaerobic digestion pathogen removal was also enhanced through fa pretreatment which was reflected by the enhanced removal of two pathogen indicators i e the fecal coliform and e coli the concentrations of fecal coliform and e coli in the digested sludge with fa pretreatment were 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts lower than those without fa pretreatment also the fecal coliform of 2 5 log mpn g ts and e coli of 2 0 log mpn g ts in the digested sludge with fa pretreatment were under 3 log mpn g ts of fecal coliform and achieved 2 0 log mpn g ts of e coli as required for grade a biosolids by the new south wales environmental protection agency australia epa 2000 indicating combined anaerobic digestion with fa pretreatment has a great potential to achieve grade a biosolids in real life applications this revealed that fa pretreatment strategy also delivers large environmental benefits and opens a door for more biosolids to be applied in agriculture this study demonstrated that both the fa pretreatment by itself and anaerobic digestion process by itself contributed to pathogen removal however some pretreatment strategies observed pathogen re growth in the anaerobic digestion process although the pretreatment itself enhanced pathogen removal for instance zhang et al 2019 observed that fna itself 250 mg hno2 n l for 24 h removed fecal coliform by 2 8 log mpn g ts however the concentration of fecal coliform increased by 2 1 log mpn g ts during the anaerobic digestion process this indicated that fna pretreatment by itself may only inactive not kill fecal coliform whereas the fa pretreatment by itself may kill fecal coliform and e coli however this still requires further investigation 4 4 implications our previous study has demonstrated that fa pretreatment is effective in enhancing methane production in batch bmp tests however the batch bmp test could only provide conservative results compared to continuous semi continuous anaerobic sludge digestion batstone et al 2009 jensen et al 2011 furthermore the effects of fa pretreatment on the other key anaerobic digestion parameters including vs destruction sludge dewaterability and pathogen removal were still unknown because our previous bmp tests could not provide an accurate assessment on these parameters due to the existence of the large amounts of inoculum this study revealed for the first time that fa pretreatment of secondary sludge could achieve multiple benefits in the anaerobic digestion including enhanced vs destruction improved sludge dewaterability and increased pathogen removal this was experimentally demonstrated in the semi continuous anaerobic digestion reactors for 130 days model analysis based on the asm1 adm1 interface revealed that enhanced degradability extent fd may contribute to the enhanced vs destruction this study is of great significance in promoting the application of fa pretreatment strategy in the real world the overall improvements and implications through fa pretreatment in anaerobic digestion were shown in fig 7 based on the enhanced vs destruction and improved dewaterability of digested sludge achieved by the fa pretreatment the overall costs for sludge disposal will be reduced due to the sludge volume reduction table s1 with inorganic solids representing 20 8 of the sludge used the volume of sludge to be disposed of was estimated to be reduced by 14 5 see si for details of the calculation due to the enhanced vs destruction in the anaerobic digestion system with fa pretreatment the capacity of the digestion system could be improved by 6 accordingly see si for details of the calculation this enhancement indicated that the sludge loading rate in the anaerobic digestion system with fa pretreatment could be potentially 6 higher than the control digestion system it revealed that the fa pretreatment strategy could provide a superior anaerobic digestion system with a higher loading rate than the current designed level which will avoid or delay the updating of the existing anaerobic digestion system this will provide real benefit for the wwtps a closed loop concept for wwtps was proposed for the fa pretreatment strategy as shown in fig 7 in our study the ammonium chloride was used for fa pretreatment through ph conditioning however in the real world operation the fa ammonia could be provided by the anaerobic digestion liquor because the digestion liquor contains high concentrations of ammonium ammonia this is more economical than the commercial ammonium ammonia source in the cases where the desirable fa concentration is not achievable from the digestion liquor a moderate amount of alkali can be added to increase the ph and therefore the fa concentration also the implementation of this fa pretreatment strategy requires minimal energy and chemical input a hypothetical wwtp of 100 megalitres including anaerobic digestion system srt 12 days was used to estimate the economic benefits of fa pretreatment strategy table s1 according to the experimental results in this study the 26 enhancement in vs destruction 9 increase in dewatered solids content and 29 improvement in methane production see fig 3 would jointly result in a higher economic benefit of approximately 240 000 per annum in the wwtp with fa pretreatment compared to wwtp without pretreatment even if the capital and operational cost of fa pretreatment unit was considered the higher benefits arose from the saved cost in reduced sludge transport and disposal expenditure 178 000 per annum and increased methane production 112 000 per annum which subtracted the cost for fa pretreatment 50 000 per annum this revealed that fa pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion was economically promising it should be noted that the economic benefit calculated above was used as an indication the economic benefit will rely on various economic factors e g local sludge disposal cost power price etc it is worthy to mention that the benefit of the enhanced pathogen removal was not included in the above economic analysis the economic benefits should be higher after considering the benefits of the enhanced pathogen removal 5 conclusions this study experimentally demonstrated that fa pretreatment enhanced vs destruction improved sludge dewaterability and enhanced pathogen removal for the first time in the semi continuous systems operated for 130 days these new results are of great significance in facilitating the application of fa pretreatment strategy in the real world the major conclusions are as following fa pretreatment enhanced the vs destruction by 26 4 in the anaerobic digestion of secondary sludge supported by the comparable increase in the methane production and ammonium ammonia release from sludge model analysis revealed that the enhanced degradability extent of secondary sludge with fa pretreatment contributed to the enhanced vs destruction the dewaterability of digested sludge through fa pretreatment was enhanced by 9 2 compared with the digested sludge without fa pretreatment this was supported by the increased zeta potential fa pretreatment was effective in enhancing pathogen removal in anaerobic digestion this was supported by the enhanced removals of fecal coliform and e coli by 1 3 and 1 4 log mpn g ts fa pretreatment could reduce the volume of sludge to be finally disposed of the anaerobic digestion system s capacity could be potentially improved after implementing fa pretreatment indicating that fa pretreatment strategy could avoid or delay the incorporation of the new anaerobic digestion system in the wwtps with a sludge loading rate of the anaerobic digestion system above the current designed level fa pretreatment strategy could potentially bring significant economic benefits for wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16821,the addition of nano zero valent iron nzvi has been proven to improve the efficiency of the anammox process however the mechnism is not clear here the effect of nzvi on anammox microbial community was studied by metagenomic sequencing methods it was found that 50 mg l nzvi indeed promoted the removal of nh4 and no2 of the anammox reactor and significantly improved the relative abundance of anaob ca brocadia from 42 1 to 52 5 what s more 50 mg l nzvi increased the abundance of c di gmp synthesized protein from 148 rpmr to 252 rpmr in the microbial community and decreased the abundance of c di gmp degradation protein from 238 rpmr to 204 rpmr which indirectly led to the enrichment of c di gmp in the microbial community the enrichment of c di gmp reduced the motility of microorganisms in the reactor and promoted the secretion of extracellular polymers by bacteria which is beneficial to the formation of sludge particles in the anammox reactor in conclusion this

play an important role in the properties of microbial aggregates the mixed microbial communities such as the activated sludge reactor rely on quorum sensing to transmit signals between and inside of bacteria liu et al 2021 these activities are performed by intracellular and extracellular quorum sensing signal molecules yi et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 the intracellular quorum sensing signal molecules c di gmp cyclic diguanylate was first discovered and reported in 1987 and its metabolism related enzymes are ubiquitous in bacteria c di gmp can help bacteria to coordinate multiple metabolic activities such as bacterial movement biofilm formation pathogenicity and bacterial proliferation c di gmp has been found to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli k pneumonia and bacillus guo et al 2017 the synthesis and decomposition of intracellular c di gmp are accomplished by diguanylate cyclase dgcs and phosphodiesterases pdes respectively kolter and greenberg 2006 fe ions exist in both dgc and pde proteins therefore iron ions are an indispensable element for the synthesis and decomposition of c di gmp which indirectly control the formation of sludge particles and the stability of sewage treatment many studies focus on the effect of iron on the anammox process guo et al 2019 ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 iron can incorporate into protein cofactors and serves as either catalytic redox or regulatory purposes in anammox biological systems anaob relies heavily on iron containing proteins like heme c and fe s protein for their energy conservation christina et al 2017 what s more nano zero valent iron nzvi could be regarded as a useful deoxidant to create an anaerobic condition for the proliferation of anaob tiwari et al 2006 zvi was favorable for the secretion of eps which would represent the activity of anaob ren et al 2015 however it is not clear whether nzvi could affect the reaction process by affecting the signal molecule c di gmp here the effect of nzvi on anammox was studied through metagenomics and q pcr technology a possible mechanism of nzvi promoting anammox was proposed this study clarified the molecular mechanism of nzvi on anammox and provided a theoretical basis for the rapid startup and efficient operation of anammox 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor design three 600 ml opaque serum bottles were used as the uasb reactors in a continuous running mode and the serum bottles were wrapped with tin foil to inhibit the growth of photosynthetic bacteria fig s1 the nzvi powder fig s2 purity 99 purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china was added to the r1 r2 and r3 with a concentration of 0 mg l 50 mg l 1 g l respectively anammox granular sludge enriched from anaerobic granular sludge of a wastewater treatment plant zibo china was used as the seed sludge to inoculate the bioreactors after being washed three times with a phosphate buffer solution the inoculation biomass occupied up to one third of the reactor s working volume leading to an initial mlvss concentration of 8000 20 mg l the nitrogen and inorganic carbon sources used in this study mainly consisted of 2 5 mm nh4 2so4 6 mm nano2 and 5 mm khco3 the composition of the mineral medium and trace elements was described by van de graaf et al 1996 the final ph of the synthesis wastewater was kept at 7 2 the hydraulic retention time was kept at 12 hours the influent tank and reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 10 minutes every day to maintain anaerobic conditions for anammox process tap water was injected into the storage box and the heating rod was fixed on one inner wall the heating temperature was set to 33 c guo et al 2019 to verify the anammox activity of the three reactors time profiles of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n under different nzvi powder addition were detected at the end of the research 150th day the sludge in the three reactors was washed three times with phosphate buffer solution the influent wastewater was added to the opaque serum bottles to a volume of about 600 ml the three reactors were incubated at 33 c without injecting new wastewater and the nitrogen concentration ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the reactors were detected every 1 hour 2 2 analysis methods liquor samples were collected from the reactors every three days and were immediately filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were analyzed according to the standard methods section 4500 association and washington 1995 mastersizer 2000 maerwen britain was used to measure the granular size c di gmp in the sludge was extracted and detected according to literature wan et al 2013 the sampled granules were firstly freeze dried at 60 c and 0 2 g of the dried sludge was loaded in 50 ml tubes with 15 ml of milli q water lysozyme was then added to a final concentration of 1 mg ml after vortex for 15 min the mixture was then incubated at 37 c for 1 h after centrifuged at 7000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was transferred to a new 50 ml tube with double volume ethanol and vortex for 10 s the tube was incubated at 4 c for 1 h and then centrifuged at 7000 g for 15 min the precipitate was kept and incubated at 37 c for 3 h and 3 ml of milli q water was added the mixture was transferred to a 5 ml tube and centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min finally 1 ml supernatant was used to measure c di gmp concentration by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the hplc was performed on agilent 1260 with a c18 column at 40 c detection at 254 nm by a diode array detector runs were performed at 1 ml min in a mixed solvent 95 of 0 9 nacl and 5 of 100 acetonitrile 2 3 metagenome sequencing to study the effect of nzvi on the microbial community structure and microbial function in the anammox reaction metagenome sequencing of r1 r2 and r3 were performed at the end of this study 150th day two parallel sludge samples were taken from the reactors after centrifuged and removed the supernatant of the sample the sludge was frozen and stored the microbial genome was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa according to the manufacturer s protocol and the genome sample was submitted to megabio for sequencing the genes concentration were normalized and compared by targeted reads per million mapped reads rpmr 2 4 dna extraction and q pcr detection 0 5 g sludge was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove moisture the dna was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the extracted dna was stored at 20 c to avoid its inactivation ren et al 2015 qpcr was used to detect c di gmp metabolic genes in four anaob species of ca brocadia which is the most abundant genus in anammox reactor the genus ca brocadia contained four anaob species ca brocadia caroliniensis ca brocadia fulgida ca brocadia utamx and ca brocadia sinica the dgc and pde genes of the relative species were named dgc c dgc f dgc u dgc s pde c pde f pde u pde s the primers were designed using primer 5 0 software the primer sequences are shown in table s1 the target dna was amplified and quantified using a light cycler 480 ii roche switzerland 2 5 eps extraction and measurement the eps of the granular sludge was extracted by a cationic resin method liu and fang 2002 takahashi et al 2009 ps and pn are the main components of eps the ps concentration was determined according to the anthrone concentrated sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standard sample wu et al 2009 the content of pn was measured by the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard fr olund et al 1995 the sum of ps content and pn content characterizes the total amount of eps 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolution of nzvi in the reactors 50 mg l and 1 g l nzvi were added to r2 and r3 respectively at the beginning of the experiment however due to the effect of gravity nzvi precipitated at the bottom of the reactor and released fe2 and fe3 ions into the reactor stably and continuously the fe2 and fe3 ions released by nzvi are effective for the anammox process the concentration of fe2 in r2 and r3 is stable at 0 06 mg l and the concentration of fe3 in r2 and r3 is 0 19 mg l and 2 17 mg l respectively despite the high concentration of nzvi in r2 and r3 no inhibitory effect on anammox process was observed to determine the impact of abiotic effects of nzvi on nitrogen removal 50 mg l and 1 g l of nzvi and synthetic wastewater were placed in a reactor with no sludge and it was found that the nitrogen concentration was almost unchanged within 12 hours thus the abiotic effect of nzvi on the concentration of ammonium and nitrite in the reactor is negligible 3 2 effect of nzvi on nitrogen removal capacity of anammox reactors to validate the long term effects of nzvi on anammox process three parallel uasb were operated nitrogen removal was recorded and illustrated in fig 1 the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations were kept at 70 and 84 mg n l respectively from the 1st day to the 5th day ammonium removal reached a certain level in all three reactors fig 1a while the effluent nitrite concentration was slightly higher than that of influent because aob coexisted with anaob at low do concentrations and aob oxidized some ammonia to nitrite from the 8th day the removal rate of ammonium in all three reactors gradually increased and nitrate began to accumulate after the 14th day the effluent nitrite concentration of both r1 and r2 began to become lower than that of influent and this did not occur in r3 until the 20th day the effluent ammonium in the three reactors was 29 75 27 42 and 26 26 mg n l on day 14 respectively indicating that aob activity began to decrease as such an environment was more suitable for anaob from the 15th to 65th days a continuous and increasing nitrite removal rate was achieved indicating the increase of anammox activity as shown in fig 1b the effluent nitrite concentration was notably higher than that of others when adding 1 g l of nzvi powder the addition of a large amount of nzvi powder inhibited microorganisms and may be responsible for this trend guo et al 2019 from day 66 to 111 both the ammonium and nitrite removal efficiencies increased sharply the ammonium removal efficiency of r3 exceeded 85 and the effluent nitrite concentration was below 10 mg n l on day 87 ammonium and nitrite concentration was proportionally reduced and their removal efficiencies reached more than 80 from the whole anammox start up process it is clear that a high concentration of nzvi addition inhibited the process while 50 mg l of nzvi powder slightly promote the startup of anammox process fig 1c to verify the anammox activity of the three reactors time profiles of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration during a typical cycle under different nzvi powder addition were detected as shown in fig 2 the initial nh4 and no2 concentrations were 70 23 mg l and 84 85 mg l the nh4 concentration decreased to 29 23 mg l and 28 12 mg l in r1 reactor without nzvi and r3 reactor with 1 g l nzvi after 9 hours with the removal efficiencies of 58 38 and 59 96 respectively in r2 reactor with 50 mg l nzvi the concentration of nh4 decreased to 22 58 mg l after 9 hours and the removal rate reached 67 85 the difference in the removal of no2 among the three reactors was more obvious in r1 reactor the concentration of no2 dropped to 27 2 mg l while its concentration was reduced to 20 05 mg l in r3 reactor the concentration of no2 in r2 was reduced to 14 9 mg l which was the lowest in the three reactors the removal efficiencies of no2 in three reactors were 67 94 82 44 and 76 37 respectively the results indicated that the addition of low concentration 50 mg l nzvi promoted the removal of nh4 and no2 however a high concentration of nzvi is toxic for microbes you et al report that zero valent iron can remove and inactivate viruses in water you et al 2005 a strong bactericidal effect of nzvi was found under deaerated conditions high dose of nzvi in aqueous solution rapidly inactivated escherichia coli lee et al 2008 the bactericidal effect of nzvi was observed in this research the removal efficiency was decreased when the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g l 3 3 the effect of nzvi on the microbial community of anammox system the microbial community of seed anammox granular sludge was analyzed using 16s rdna amplicon sequencing genus ca brocadia was the dominant genus accounting for 20 9 of the microbial community to study the effect of nzvi on the microbial community structure and microbial function the sludge in the r1 r2 and r3 were subjected to metagenomic sequencing planctomycetes were the most abundant group at phylum level making up approximately 42 1 52 5 and 45 3 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively fig 3 a at genus level ca brocadia was dominated making up approximately 53 2 67 4 and 58 8 of the clarified otus in r1 r2 and r3 fig 3b the content of ca brocadia increased by 32 3 46 5 and 37 9 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively the microbial community composition shows that anaob in the three reactors is the dominant species and the addition of nzvi significantly improved the abundance of anaob in the reactor six anaob species were found in the reactors ca brocadia sinica ca brocadia fulgida ca scalindua brodae ca brocadia anammoxidans ca jettenia asiatica ca anammoxoglobus propionicus fig 3c the 50 mg l nzvi addition did promote the growth of anaob ca brocadia sinica is the dominant species which accounted for 19 61 and 28 46 of the total microbes in the reactors of r1 and r2 respectively the contents of other anaobs such as ca brocadia fulgida in r1 and r2 were 0 29 and 0 38 respectively the contents of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis ca jettenia asiatica were less than 0 2 in both reactors four key genes of anaob amx16s hzo hzs nir were selected and quantified with q pcr fig 3d the amx16s gene content represents the concentration of anaob the abundance of amx16s gene in r1 reactor is 7 37 107 copies ml while in r2 it was 1 92 109 copies ml which was significantly higher than that of r1 the nitrogen metabolic process in ca brocadia sinica is unique unlike the main intermediate in the process by ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis nir gene was missed in the metabolic pathway of ca brocadia sinica oshiki et al 2016 the abundance of functional genes hzo and hzs had the same trend with amx16s gene while the concentration of nir gene was extremely low compared with hzo and hzs genes consisting with the metagenomics analysis that anaob in the reactors was dominated by ca brocadia sinica by analyzing the microbial community of anammox system with metagenomics and q pcr it was demonstrated that 50 mg l nzvi addition accelerated the growth of anaob especially ca brocadia sinica compared with 50 mg l nzvi addition abundance of anaob in the reactor was decreased when the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g l the impact of nzvi on anaob abundance was consistent with nitrogen removal capacity of anammox reactors 3 4 effect of nzvi on the signal pathway of microbial community in anammox reactor c di gmp is a widely reported signaling molecular which operates at multiple levels to modulate gene expression and enzyme activity hengge 2009 römling et al 2005 for example c di gmp binds to proteins that reduce the activity of the flagellar motor regulates cell surface proteins required for attachment and mediates the biosynthesis of extracellular matrix polysaccharides of the biofilm hengge 2009 prokaryotic genomes encode various proteins that both synthesize and catabolize c di gmp dgc and pde are enzymes that synthesize and decompose c di gmp respectively as a co factor of dgc and pde nzvi affects the synthesis of the two enzymes therefore nzvi can affect the concentration of c di gmp to regulate the anammox community function by adjusting the dgc and pde synthesis compared with no nzvi addition the concentration of dgc k13590 in the community increased from 148 rpmr to 252 rpmr and the concentration of pde k13243 k13246 decreased from 238 rpmr to 204 rpmr after 50 mg l nzvi addition table s2 the addition of nzvi significantly increased the concentration of dgc compared with the control group the addition of nzvi increased the dgc gene by about 1 5 times when the nzvi addition was increased to 1 g l the concentration of dgc and pde were 150 and 223 rpmr respectively 50 mg l nzvi addition changed the concentration of dgc and pde in the microbial community thus resulted in an increase in the content of c di gmp in bacteria the c di gmp metabolic genes in four anaob species of genus ca brocadia was detected using q pcr fig 4 ca brocadia was the dominant genus in anammox reactors containing four anaob species ca brocadia caroliniensis ca brocadia fulgida ca brocadia utamx and ca brocadia sinica the dgc and pde genes of the relative species were named dgc c dgc f dgc u dgc s pde c pde f pde u pde s among the four anaobs tested ca brocadia sinica occupied the highest relative abundance of dgc and pde genes fig 4a b it is consistent with the anaob abundance information obtained by metagenomic sequencing fig 4c indicating that ca brocadia sinica is the dominant anaob species in the reactors comparing the abundance of dgc gene and pde gene it is found that in the reactors the abundance of dgc gene was much higher than that of pde fig 4a b indicating that c di gmp is accumulating in the reactor nzvi had different effects on the abundance of the two genes in anaob nzvi promoted the dgc gene more obviously since the dgc concentration of ca brocadia sinica in r1 was about 7 105 copies μl dna and the dgc concentration after adding nzvi was about 3 5 107 copies μl dna nzvi had little effect on pde the pde concentration of ca brocadia sinica in r1 was about 9 105 copies μl dna and the pde concentration after adding nzvi was about 1 1 106 copies μl dna the concentration of c di gmp in the three reactors was also detected fig 4c consist with the effect of nzvi on c di gmp metabolic genes low dose nzvi addition r2 increased the concentration of c di gmp from 18 μg g mlss r1 without nzvi addition to 31 μg g mlss however with the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g r3 the concentration of c di gmp decreased to 20 5 μg g mlss the results above indicated that low concentration nzvi addition could increase the synthesis of c di gmp by regulating its synthesis and degradation related genes 3 5 effect of nzvi on sludge morphology in anammox reactor c di gmp can accelerate granulation of activated sludge by promoting the secretion of eps czaczyk and myszka 2007 gabriela et al 2013 voběrková et al 2016 as nzvi increased the synthesis of c di gmp eps contents and particle sizes of the granular sludge were detected the eps contents of the sludge in three anammox reactors were shown in fig 5 a the difference between the three reactors was obvious though they shared the same trend in r1 reactor without nzvi the eps content is the lowest wherein the pn content is 82 88 ug g sludge r2 reactor had the highest pn content of 143 96 mg g sludge among the three reactors compared with r2 the pn content decreased in r3 which was 96 18 mg g sludge the content of ps was the same trend as the content of pn and the concentrations in the three reactors were 80 93 134 00 and 92 13 mg g sludge respectively the experimental results show that eps production was increased at a lower dosage 50 mg l and a high concentration of nzvi was unfavorable for bacterial eps production the particle sizes of the granular sludge in three reactors were examined to verify whether nzvi affects the particle sizes of the granular sludge fig 5b without addition of nzvi particle size of the granular sludge was around 2 0 2 4 mm while most particles are concentrated in 3 0 3 4 mm in r2 and the number was decreased to 2 5 2 9 mm in r3 consistent with the affection of nzvi on eps content of sludge in anammox reactors the particle size of the granular sludge was increased when the nzvi concentration was 50 g l and decreased when the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g l 3 6 possible mechanism of nzvi promoting anammox nzvi has been proven to improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox reactor but its mechanism is still unrevealed here the effect of nzvi on anammox microbial community structure and microbial community function was studied by metagenomic sequencing methods it was found that nzvi indeed promoted the removal of nh4 and no2 of the anammox reactor the addition of 50 mg l nzvi significantly improved the relative abundance of anaob ca brocadia from 42 1 to 52 5 50 mg l nzvi increased the abundance of c di gmp synthesized protein from 148 rpmr to 252 rpmr in the microbial community and decreased the abundance of c di gmp degradation protein from 238 rpmr to 204 rpmr which indirectly led to the enrichment of c di gmp in the microbial community the nitrogen removal efficiency has the same variation tendency with the abundance of c di gmp metabolism genes in this study the abundance of the dgc gene was positively correlated with the c di gmp concentration nitrogen removal efficiency eps content particle size and functional gene abundance a possible mechanism of nzvi promoting anammox was proposed based on the results above as shown in fig 6 a low concentration of nzvi stably and continuously released fe2 and fe3 ions iron ions absorbed by anaob significantly increased the abundance of the dgc gene and decreased the abundance of the pde gene which resulted in the enrichment of c di gmp in microbial cells the enrichment of c di gmp reduced the motility of microorganisms in the reactor and promoted the secretion of epss by bacteria which was beneficial to the formation of sludge particles in anammox reactor in addition c di gmp participated in the hydrolysis of the inhibitory protein of bacterial division thereby accelerating the division of anaob and increasing the abundance of anaob 4 conclusion the addition of nzvi significantly promoted the relative abundance of anaob ca brocadia increased the abundance of c di gmp synthesized protein and decreased the abundance of c di gmp degradation protein the enriched c di gmp participates in the sludge particle formation in anammox reactor and improved nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox process in addition c di gmp could accelerate the division of anaob and increase the abundance of anaob by hydrolyzing the division inhibitory protein of bacteria nzvi addition is a stable and efficient method that can be applied in engineering to shorten the start up time and improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox process this study clarified the molecular mechanism of nzvi affection on anammox process and

molecules c di gmp cyclic diguanylate was first discovered and reported in 1987 and its metabolism related enzymes are ubiquitous in bacteria c di gmp can help bacteria to coordinate multiple metabolic activities such as bacterial movement biofilm formation pathogenicity and bacterial proliferation c di gmp has been found to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli k pneumonia and bacillus guo et al 2017 the synthesis and decomposition of intracellular c di gmp are accomplished by diguanylate cyclase dgcs and phosphodiesterases pdes respectively kolter and greenberg 2006 fe ions exist in both dgc and pde proteins therefore iron ions are an indispensable element for the synthesis and decomposition of c di gmp which indirectly control the formation of sludge particles and the stability of sewage treatment many studies focus on the effect of iron on the anammox process guo et al 2019 ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 iron can incorporate into protein cofactors and serves as either catalytic redox or regulatory purposes in anammox biological systems anaob relies heavily on iron containing proteins like heme c and fe s protein for their energy conservation christina et al 2017 what s more nano zero valent iron nzvi could be regarded as a useful deoxidant to create an anaerobic condition for the proliferation of anaob tiwari et al 2006 zvi was favorable for the secretion of eps which would represent the activity of anaob ren et al 2015 however it is not clear whether nzvi could affect the reaction process by affecting the signal molecule c di gmp here the effect of nzvi on anammox was studied through metagenomics and q pcr technology a possible mechanism of nzvi promoting anammox was proposed this study clarified the molecular mechanism of nzvi on anammox and provided a theoretical basis for the rapid startup and efficient operation of anammox 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor design three 600 ml opaque serum bottles were used as the uasb reactors in a continuous running mode and the serum bottles were wrapped with tin foil to inhibit the growth of photosynthetic bacteria fig s1 the nzvi powder fig s2 purity 99 purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china was added to the r1 r2 and r3 with a concentration of 0 mg l 50 mg l 1 g l respectively anammox granular sludge enriched from anaerobic granular sludge of a wastewater treatment plant zibo china was used as the seed sludge to inoculate the bioreactors after being washed three times with a phosphate buffer solution the inoculation biomass occupied up to one third of the reactor s working volume leading to an initial mlvss concentration of 8000 20 mg l the nitrogen and inorganic carbon sources used in this study mainly consisted of 2 5 mm nh4 2so4 6 mm nano2 and 5 mm khco3 the composition of the mineral medium and trace elements was described by van de graaf et al 1996 the final ph of the synthesis wastewater was kept at 7 2 the hydraulic retention time was kept at 12 hours the influent tank and reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 10 minutes every day to maintain anaerobic conditions for anammox process tap water was injected into the storage box and the heating rod was fixed on one inner wall the heating temperature was set to 33 c guo et al 2019 to verify the anammox activity of the three reactors time profiles of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n under different nzvi powder addition were detected at the end of the research 150th day the sludge in the three reactors was washed three times with phosphate buffer solution the influent wastewater was added to the opaque serum bottles to a volume of about 600 ml the three reactors were incubated at 33 c without injecting new wastewater and the nitrogen concentration ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the reactors were detected every 1 hour 2 2 analysis methods liquor samples were collected from the reactors every three days and were immediately filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were analyzed according to the standard methods section 4500 association and washington 1995 mastersizer 2000 maerwen britain was used to measure the granular size c di gmp in the sludge was extracted and detected according to literature wan et al 2013 the sampled granules were firstly freeze dried at 60 c and 0 2 g of the dried sludge was loaded in 50 ml tubes with 15 ml of milli q water lysozyme was then added to a final concentration of 1 mg ml after vortex for 15 min the mixture was then incubated at 37 c for 1 h after centrifuged at 7000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was transferred to a new 50 ml tube with double volume ethanol and vortex for 10 s the tube was incubated at 4 c for 1 h and then centrifuged at 7000 g for 15 min the precipitate was kept and incubated at 37 c for 3 h and 3 ml of milli q water was added the mixture was transferred to a 5 ml tube and centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min finally 1 ml supernatant was used to measure c di gmp concentration by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the hplc was performed on agilent 1260 with a c18 column at 40 c detection at 254 nm by a diode array detector runs were performed at 1 ml min in a mixed solvent 95 of 0 9 nacl and 5 of 100 acetonitrile 2 3 metagenome sequencing to study the effect of nzvi on the microbial community structure and microbial function in the anammox reaction metagenome sequencing of r1 r2 and r3 were performed at the end of this study 150th day two parallel sludge samples were taken from the reactors after centrifuged and removed the supernatant of the sample the sludge was frozen and stored the microbial genome was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa according to the manufacturer s protocol and the genome sample was submitted to megabio for sequencing the genes concentration were normalized and compared by targeted reads per million mapped reads rpmr 2 4 dna extraction and q pcr detection 0 5 g sludge was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove moisture the dna was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the extracted dna was stored at 20 c to avoid its inactivation ren et al 2015 qpcr was used to detect c di gmp metabolic genes in four anaob species of ca brocadia which is the most abundant genus in anammox reactor the genus ca brocadia contained four anaob species ca brocadia caroliniensis ca brocadia fulgida ca brocadia utamx and ca brocadia sinica the dgc and pde genes of the relative species were named dgc c dgc f dgc u dgc s pde c pde f pde u pde s the primers were designed using primer 5 0 software the primer sequences are shown in table s1 the target dna was amplified and quantified using a light cycler 480 ii roche switzerland 2 5 eps extraction and measurement the eps of the granular sludge was extracted by a cationic resin method liu and fang 2002 takahashi et al 2009 ps and pn are the main components of eps the ps concentration was determined according to the anthrone concentrated sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standard sample wu et al 2009 the content of pn was measured by the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard fr olund et al 1995 the sum of ps content and pn content characterizes the total amount of eps 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolution of nzvi in the reactors 50 mg l and 1 g l nzvi were added to r2 and r3 respectively at the beginning of the experiment however due to the effect of gravity nzvi precipitated at the bottom of the reactor and released fe2 and fe3 ions into the reactor stably and continuously the fe2 and fe3 ions released by nzvi are effective for the anammox process the concentration of fe2 in r2 and r3 is stable at 0 06 mg l and the concentration of fe3 in r2 and r3 is 0 19 mg l and 2 17 mg l respectively despite the high concentration of nzvi in r2 and r3 no inhibitory effect on anammox process was observed to determine the impact of abiotic effects of nzvi on nitrogen removal 50 mg l and 1 g l of nzvi and synthetic wastewater were placed in a reactor with no sludge and it was found that the nitrogen concentration was almost unchanged within 12 hours thus the abiotic effect of nzvi on the concentration of ammonium and nitrite in the reactor is negligible 3 2 effect of nzvi on nitrogen removal capacity of anammox reactors to validate the long term effects of nzvi on anammox process three parallel uasb were operated nitrogen removal was recorded and illustrated in fig 1 the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations were kept at 70 and 84 mg n l respectively from the 1st day to the 5th day ammonium removal reached a certain level in all three reactors fig 1a while the effluent nitrite concentration was slightly higher than that of influent because aob coexisted with anaob at low do concentrations and aob oxidized some ammonia to nitrite from the 8th day the removal rate of ammonium in all three reactors gradually increased and nitrate began to accumulate after the 14th day the effluent nitrite concentration of both r1 and r2 began to become lower than that of influent and this did not occur in r3 until the 20th day the effluent ammonium in the three reactors was 29 75 27 42 and 26 26 mg n l on day 14 respectively indicating that aob activity began to decrease as such an environment was more suitable for anaob from the 15th to 65th days a continuous and increasing nitrite removal rate was achieved indicating the increase of anammox activity as shown in fig 1b the effluent nitrite concentration was notably higher than that of others when adding 1 g l of nzvi powder the addition of a large amount of nzvi powder inhibited microorganisms and may be responsible for this trend guo et al 2019 from day 66 to 111 both the ammonium and nitrite removal efficiencies increased sharply the ammonium removal efficiency of r3 exceeded 85 and the effluent nitrite concentration was below 10 mg n l on day 87 ammonium and nitrite concentration was proportionally reduced and their removal efficiencies reached more than 80 from the whole anammox start up process it is clear that a high concentration of nzvi addition inhibited the process while 50 mg l of nzvi powder slightly promote the startup of anammox process fig 1c to verify the anammox activity of the three reactors time profiles of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration during a typical cycle under different nzvi powder addition were detected as shown in fig 2 the initial nh4 and no2 concentrations were 70 23 mg l and 84 85 mg l the nh4 concentration decreased to 29 23 mg l and 28 12 mg l in r1 reactor without nzvi and r3 reactor with 1 g l nzvi after 9 hours with the removal efficiencies of 58 38 and 59 96 respectively in r2 reactor with 50 mg l nzvi the concentration of nh4 decreased to 22 58 mg l after 9 hours and the removal rate reached 67 85 the difference in the removal of no2 among the three reactors was more obvious in r1 reactor the concentration of no2 dropped to 27 2 mg l while its concentration was reduced to 20 05 mg l in r3 reactor the concentration of no2 in r2 was reduced to 14 9 mg l which was the lowest in the three reactors the removal efficiencies of no2 in three reactors were 67 94 82 44 and 76 37 respectively the results indicated that the addition of low concentration 50 mg l nzvi promoted the removal of nh4 and no2 however a high concentration of nzvi is toxic for microbes you et al report that zero valent iron can remove and inactivate viruses in water you et al 2005 a strong bactericidal effect of nzvi was found under deaerated conditions high dose of nzvi in aqueous solution rapidly inactivated escherichia coli lee et al 2008 the bactericidal effect of nzvi was observed in this research the removal efficiency was decreased when the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g l 3 3 the effect of nzvi on the microbial community of anammox system the microbial community of seed anammox granular sludge was analyzed using 16s rdna amplicon sequencing genus ca brocadia was the dominant genus accounting for 20 9 of the microbial community to study the effect of nzvi on the microbial community structure and microbial function the sludge in the r1 r2 and r3 were subjected to metagenomic sequencing planctomycetes were the most abundant group at phylum level making up approximately 42 1 52 5 and 45 3 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively fig 3 a at genus level ca brocadia was dominated making up approximately 53 2 67 4 and 58 8 of the clarified otus in r1 r2 and r3 fig 3b the content of ca brocadia increased by 32 3 46 5 and 37 9 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively the microbial community composition shows that anaob in the three reactors is the dominant species and the addition of nzvi significantly improved the abundance of anaob in the reactor six anaob species were found in the reactors ca brocadia sinica ca brocadia fulgida ca scalindua brodae ca brocadia anammoxidans ca jettenia asiatica ca anammoxoglobus propionicus fig 3c the 50 mg l nzvi addition did promote the growth of anaob ca brocadia sinica is the dominant species which accounted for 19 61 and 28 46 of the total microbes in the reactors of r1 and r2 respectively the contents of other anaobs such as ca brocadia fulgida in r1 and r2 were 0 29 and 0 38 respectively the contents of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis ca jettenia asiatica were less than 0 2 in both reactors four key genes of anaob amx16s hzo hzs nir were selected and quantified with q pcr fig 3d the amx16s gene content represents the concentration of anaob the abundance of amx16s gene in r1 reactor is 7 37 107 copies ml while in r2 it was 1 92 109 copies ml which was significantly higher than that of r1 the nitrogen metabolic process in ca brocadia sinica is unique unlike the main intermediate in the process by ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis nir gene was missed in the metabolic pathway of ca brocadia sinica oshiki et al 2016 the abundance of functional genes hzo and hzs had the same trend with amx16s gene while the concentration of nir gene was extremely low compared with hzo and hzs genes consisting with the metagenomics analysis that anaob in the reactors was dominated by ca brocadia sinica by analyzing the microbial community of anammox system with metagenomics and q pcr it was demonstrated that 50 mg l nzvi addition accelerated the growth of anaob especially ca brocadia sinica compared with 50 mg l nzvi addition abundance of anaob in the reactor was decreased when the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g l the impact of nzvi on anaob abundance was consistent with nitrogen removal capacity of anammox reactors 3 4 effect of nzvi on the signal pathway of microbial community in anammox reactor c di gmp is a widely reported signaling molecular which operates at multiple levels to modulate gene expression and enzyme activity hengge 2009 römling et al 2005 for example c di gmp binds to proteins that reduce the activity of the flagellar motor regulates cell surface proteins required for attachment and mediates the biosynthesis of extracellular matrix polysaccharides of the biofilm hengge 2009 prokaryotic genomes encode various proteins that both synthesize and catabolize c di gmp dgc and pde are enzymes that synthesize and decompose c di gmp respectively as a co factor of dgc and pde nzvi affects the synthesis of the two enzymes therefore nzvi can affect the concentration of c di gmp to regulate the anammox community function by adjusting the dgc and pde synthesis compared with no nzvi addition the concentration of dgc k13590 in the community increased from 148 rpmr to 252 rpmr and the concentration of pde k13243 k13246 decreased from 238 rpmr to 204 rpmr after 50 mg l nzvi addition table s2 the addition of nzvi significantly increased the concentration of dgc compared with the control group the addition of nzvi increased the dgc gene by about 1 5 times when the nzvi addition was increased to 1 g l the concentration of dgc and pde were 150 and 223 rpmr respectively 50 mg l nzvi addition changed the concentration of dgc and pde in the microbial community thus resulted in an increase in the content of c di gmp in bacteria the c di gmp metabolic genes in four anaob species of genus ca brocadia was detected using q pcr fig 4 ca brocadia was the dominant genus in anammox reactors containing four anaob species ca brocadia caroliniensis ca brocadia fulgida ca brocadia utamx and ca brocadia sinica the dgc and pde genes of the relative species were named dgc c dgc f dgc u dgc s pde c pde f pde u pde s among the four anaobs tested ca brocadia sinica occupied the highest relative abundance of dgc and pde genes fig 4a b it is consistent with the anaob abundance information obtained by metagenomic sequencing fig 4c indicating that ca brocadia sinica is the dominant anaob species in the reactors comparing the abundance of dgc gene and pde gene it is found that in the reactors the abundance of dgc gene was much higher than that of pde fig 4a b indicating that c di gmp is accumulating in the reactor nzvi had different effects on the abundance of the two genes in anaob nzvi promoted the dgc gene more obviously since the dgc concentration of ca brocadia sinica in r1 was about 7 105 copies μl dna and the dgc concentration after adding nzvi was about 3 5 107 copies μl dna nzvi had little effect on pde the pde concentration of ca brocadia sinica in r1 was about 9 105 copies μl dna and the pde concentration after adding nzvi was about 1 1 106 copies μl dna the concentration of c di gmp in the three reactors was also detected fig 4c consist with the effect of nzvi on c di gmp metabolic genes low dose nzvi addition r2 increased the concentration of c di gmp from 18 μg g mlss r1 without nzvi addition to 31 μg g mlss however with the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g r3 the concentration of c di gmp decreased to 20 5 μg g mlss the results above indicated that low concentration nzvi addition could increase the synthesis of c di gmp by regulating its synthesis and degradation related genes 3 5 effect of nzvi on sludge morphology in anammox reactor c di gmp can accelerate granulation of activated sludge by promoting the secretion of eps czaczyk and myszka 2007 gabriela et al 2013 voběrková et al 2016 as nzvi increased the synthesis of c di gmp eps contents and particle sizes of the granular sludge were detected the eps contents of the sludge in three anammox reactors were shown in fig 5 a the difference between the three reactors was obvious though they shared the same trend in r1 reactor without nzvi the eps content is the lowest wherein the pn content is 82 88 ug g sludge r2 reactor had the highest pn content of 143 96 mg g sludge among the three reactors compared with r2 the pn content decreased in r3 which was 96 18 mg g sludge the content of ps was the same trend as the content of pn and the concentrations in the three reactors were 80 93 134 00 and 92 13 mg g sludge respectively the experimental results show that eps production was increased at a lower dosage 50 mg l and a high concentration of nzvi was unfavorable for bacterial eps production the particle sizes of the granular sludge in three reactors were examined to verify whether nzvi affects the particle sizes of the granular sludge fig 5b without addition of nzvi particle size of the granular sludge was around 2 0 2 4 mm while most particles are concentrated in 3 0 3 4 mm in r2 and the number was decreased to 2 5 2 9 mm in r3 consistent with the affection of nzvi on eps content of sludge in anammox reactors the particle size of the granular sludge was increased when the nzvi concentration was 50 g l and decreased when the nzvi concentration increased to 1 g l 3 6 possible mechanism of nzvi promoting anammox nzvi has been proven to improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox reactor but its mechanism is still unrevealed here the effect of nzvi on anammox microbial community structure and microbial community function was studied by metagenomic sequencing methods it was found that nzvi indeed promoted the removal of nh4 and no2 of the anammox reactor the addition of 50 mg l nzvi significantly improved the relative abundance of anaob ca brocadia from 42 1 to 52 5 50 mg l nzvi increased the abundance of c di gmp synthesized protein from 148 rpmr to 252 rpmr in the microbial community and decreased the abundance of c di gmp degradation protein from 238 rpmr to 204 rpmr which indirectly led to the enrichment of c di gmp in the microbial community the nitrogen removal efficiency has the same variation tendency with the abundance of c di gmp metabolism genes in this study the abundance of the dgc gene was positively correlated with the c di gmp concentration nitrogen removal efficiency eps content particle size and functional gene abundance a possible mechanism of nzvi promoting anammox was proposed based on the results above as shown in fig 6 a low concentration of nzvi stably and continuously released fe2 and fe3 ions iron ions absorbed by anaob significantly increased the abundance of the dgc gene and decreased the abundance of the pde gene which resulted in the enrichment of c di gmp in microbial cells the enrichment of c di gmp reduced the motility of microorganisms in the reactor and promoted the secretion of epss by bacteria which was beneficial to the formation of sludge particles in anammox reactor in addition c di gmp participated in the hydrolysis of the inhibitory protein of bacterial division thereby accelerating the division of anaob and increasing the abundance of anaob 4 conclusion the addition of nzvi significantly promoted the relative abundance of anaob ca brocadia increased the abundance of c di gmp synthesized protein and decreased the abundance of c di gmp degradation protein the enriched c di gmp participates in the sludge particle formation in anammox reactor and improved nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox process in addition c di gmp could accelerate the division of anaob and increase the abundance of anaob by hydrolyzing the division inhibitory protein of bacteria nzvi addition is a stable and efficient method that can be applied in engineering to shorten the start up time and improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox process this study clarified the molecular mechanism of nzvi affection on anammox process and provided a theoretical basis for the rapid startup and efficient operation of anammox supporting information table s1 qpcr primers used for amplification of diguanylate synthase genes table s2 effect

16822,accumulation of fat oil and grease fog in the sumps of wastewater pumping stations is a common failure cause for these facilities floating solids are often not transported by the pump suction inlets and the individual solids can accumulate to stiff and thick fog layers the lack of data about the dynamics in fog layer formation still hampers the design of effective measures towards its mitigation in this article we present a low cost camera based automated system for the observation of fog layer dynamics in wastewater pumping stations at high frequency minutes over extended time windows months optical imagery is processed through a deep learning computer vision routine that allows describing fog layer dynamics e g accumulation rate and changes in shape and various hydraulic processes in the pump sump e g the water level surface flow velocity fields vorticity or circulation furthermore the system can perform in camera image processing thus allowing the transfer of

media attention in the past years for example the famous 130 tonnes fatberg found in whitechapel london and others adams 2018 despite an increase in public awareness urban disposal of cooking oils and fat through wastewater transport systems still produces significant build up of fog solids an international review by wallace et al 2016 found that this problem is ubiquitous and that its severity depends on the design and age of the wastewater system disposal habits of citizens and mitigating measures e g grease trapping the presence of fog solids in wastewater transport systems induces

reliable operation of wastewater pumping stations wwps is critical to effectively meet their functional requirements korving et al 2006 the presence of multiple phases and related transport phenomena transport of solids entrainment of gas air is known to increase wwps failure rates meanwhile gas accumulation processes are well understood and managed pothof 2011 floating fog accumulation in pump sumps are less known and receive little attention in guidelines for pump sump design e g american national hydraulic standards institute 2012 the sump geometry and configuration of most wwps do not guarantee the transport of floating solids to wastewater treatment facilities furthermore oil and fat deposits experience chemical and physical transformations e g saponification keener et al 2008 and he et al 2013 which hardens the material the mixture of hardened fog with additional materials such as textiles or plastics form a structurally stable stiff layer often covering the entire sump surface duinmeijer and clemens 2016 see figure 1 and more examples in appendix a manual removal of fog layers results in high operational costs and is a health hazard for the personnel involved for all wwps in the municipality of rotterdam the annual fog removal cost is approximately 400 000 requiring 8 000 work hours per year 2020 extrapolating this figure we estimate a cost on the order of 10

source of energy i e biofuel see jolis et al 2010 miot et al 2013 pastore et al 2015 and hence holds potential economic value which is still not widely exploited for any fog management strategy mitigation collection reuse recycling to be feasible and successfully implemented data on fog layer dynamics i e accumulation rate and transport mechanisms are required despite the economic and environmental relevance of this problem knowledge of fog layer dynamics at wwps facilities is currently limited this is mainly due to a lack of understanding of the processes involved transport bio chemical transformations and evolution of physical properties the highly heterogeneous catchment characteristics and the fact that obtaining measuring data in sewers given the physical chemical conditions and the poor accessibility of these systems is challenging nevertheless some observational data have been reported in the literature for instance nieuwenhuis et al 2018 found correlations of fog solids accumulation with socio economic parameters of the service area williams et al 2012 showed links of fog solid formation and local water composition however the discrete 1 1 the term discrete here refers to observations made only once or with irregular time intervals that do not allow for quantification of the underlaying dynamic processes nature of this data hampers a quantitative assessment of the transport and accumulation processes involved to the authors knowledge high frequency data of fog layer dynamics is missing camera based monitoring of water processes is rapidly popularizing due to access to relatively inexpensive hardware pagnutti et al 2017 and community driven open access software initiatives e g openpiv or opencv in urban drainage we can find examples such as the observation of in sewer processes shahsavari et al 2017 and regueiro picallo et al 2020 or the estimation of flow around drainage structures leitão et al 2018 duinmeijer et al 2019 martins et al 2018 and naves et al 2021 furthermore computer vision deep learning dl routines allow extracting complex information from videos and images dl allows exploiting spatial and contextual cues from imagery to extract information relevant for tasks such as object detection or classification when sufficiently trained these systems are robust to environmental changes e g lighting visual conditions and can be deployed in the field for instance for the determination of flooding area estimates jiang et al 2019 or moy de vitry et al 2019 or lab scale model surface classification den bieman et al 2020 the synergies of computer vision and dl applications will likely increase the number of variables that we are capable to measure in hydro ecological environments valero et al 2021 and for which the urban drainage community should adapt blumensaat et al 2019 this article presents the design and deployment of an embedded camera system for long term and high frequency automated monitoring of fog layer dynamics in the sump of wwps that is non invasive scalable and robust a deep learning routine was built and used to process large quantities of wwps top

installed below one of the maintenance access gates to the basin at approximately 1 2 m nap water level was maintained at an average of 4 2 m nap and a maximum level of 1 94 m nap was recorded during the measurement campaign the cameras had a 5v power supply and 4g connection for remote operation and data transfer provided by a router tp link tl mr6400 individual images were acquired using a shutter speed of 100 ms iso 800 1024 768 px resolution at 2 minutes interval two consecutive images at a user defined δt could also be collected for estimating displacement fields operational and maintenance access was granted through a 4g vpn network email alerts were scheduled for camera thermal levels none were triggered during the observation period a third camera was installed at nieuw terbregge wwps to investigate the formation of surface vortices in 2018 see duinmeijer 2020 this consisted of a commercially available ip camera axis m1125 e recording at 30 images per second with a resolution of 480 640 px in a top view configuration images were transferred through 4g network to a centralized server at the municipality of rotterdam imagery of this camera is used in this study to showcase the potential use of top view imagery to derive surface velocity characteristics and vorticity in a wwps 2 3 image pre processing a pre processing routine was applied to images collected in order to i correct for lens and sensor optical deformation intrinsic calibration ii rectify the water plane perspective and iii mosaic images to create a seamless basin image the python library opencv bradski 2000 was used for the camera calibration and perspective rectification of the images 15 images of a 17 21 chessboard pattern with 25 mm squares were taken at different orientations and positions from each camera a fish eye camera distortion model opencv manual 2014 was fitted to the detected checkerboard squares and used to correct for lens and sensor distortions figure 3 b thus preserving linear features in the image the cameras installed in pretorialaan were top down oriented at 45 degrees with the horizontal plane this induced a perspective distortion of the water plane which was corrected using known corresponding image pump sump positions a perspective warping model was applied to create 4 point perspective transform to a water plane top view position and to mosaic both camera views figure 3 c 2 4 semantic segmentation of fog layer images a convolutional neural network cnn routine was developed to discriminate between and locate three types of surfaces fog water and superstructure in pump sump images the network was built using tensorflow abadi et al 2016 and takes the form of a semantic segmentation sem seg architecture garcia garcia et al 2017 and ye and sung 2019 this algorithm processes rgb image data to retrieve dense labelled regions spatial localization and classification from a pre selected list of objects or surfaces of interest i e wwps superstructure fog and water extent the network architecture was configured as a vgg16 simonyan and zisserman 2014 encoder and a fully convolutional network fcn decoder figure 4 we used transfer learning to reduce the number of fog labelled images required during training to that effect we initialized the encoder vgg16 network parameters with weights pre trained on the imagenet dataset deng et al 2009 a multi million labelled image public repository this allowed acquiring a relatively general set of encoder filters capable of performing object classification before the application to fog layer detection a sparse categorical cross entropy loss function was used to update the network parameters representative images across different water level and fog layer extent states were manually selected to create a training database a total of 89 mosaicked images see figure 3 c were manually labelled by the same individual hence supplying masks of the extent of fog layer water and pump superstructure e g walls cables pipes gates etc a data augmentation routine was applied to increase the training size by mirroring all labelled images thus a total of 178 labelled images were used during training and validation of the network with a split of 70 30 124 training 54 validation during training both encoder and decoder parameters were updated training was performed during 250 epochs using a batch of size of 15 examples an nvidia tesla turing 4 gpu 16gb 8 1 tflops was used during the learning and testing phase during processing images from both cameras were undistorted and mosaicked to create the optically corrected basin top view then input images were resized to the input size of the sem seg network 320 800px and processed class encoded output masks were upscaled back to the original mosaic size 640 1660px and were fed to the post processing algorithm which computed geometrical properties of the fog layer over time the image segmentation routine was carried out offline using a nvidia quadro t2000 gpu 4gb with a processing time of 1 2 seconds per image also in sensor inference could be achieved at the camera using a raspberry pi 4 model b arm cpu quad core cortex a72 with a processing time of 9 8 seconds per image the camera could hence work in two modes in situ processing and transferring processed masks reduced data transfer or transfer raw rgb high resolution images for offline postprocessing 2 5 post processing 2 5 1 fog water surface ratio masks provided by the sem seg cnn output classify regions of water fog superstructure a computer vision algorithm was created to retrieve the extension and location of the layers over time this consisted in a morphological opening and closing operation on the raw masks border smoothing and noise filtering extracting contours from the labelled mask and computing surface areas since images were perspective rectified for a top view of the basin we assumed that the ratio between water surface and surface covered with fog was approximately depth invariant instantaneous fog water ratio was computed using the sem seg derived fog top view pixel area a f o g and the water pixel area a w a t e r as 1 f o g w a t e r r a t i o a f o g a f o g a w a t e r additionally in order to visualize fog layer dynamics we computed the along length fog water pixel density average from the inlet to the pump sump separation wall as depicted in figure 5 thus displaying a length time 2d fog pixel density 2 5 2 cameras for water level estimation optical gauge exploiting image data to extract water level information is a promising strategy to leverage the growing number of cctv networks in cities worldwide for instance jiang et al 2019 proposed extracting street flooding water levels by comparing landscape features of known shape moy de vitry et al 2019 on the other hand proposed a simple water area proxy as a correlated variable to water level in street video data here we applied a similar approach to de vitry et al 2019 to derive sump pump water level data as a by product of the fog monitoring system we used the observed wet area a w e t c a m a f o g a w a t e r in pixels to define a distance to camera proxy however since our imagery was strictly a top down view of a rectangular basin as opposed to street camera applications we used the square root of the instantaneous wet area to transform to a length proxy dimensions synchronized water level measurements d o b s during a period of 8 days 25 09 2020 02 10 2020 and two minutes frequency were used to calibrate a regression model from the proxy optical gauge a w e t c a m 0 5 to an estimated basin water level d w a gaussian process regression model g p was adjusted in the following form 2 d w f a we t cam 0 5 ε f g p 0 k ε n 0 σ 2 with k a squared exponential covariance matrix k x x e k p x x 2 k p a scale parameter and ε a random variable of gaussian i i d noise the calibrated regression model was used to obtain an optically derived water level estimated in the full time series and was validated using a time series of 30 days 2 min frequency 20 08 2020 20 09 2020 2 5 3 particle tracking velocimetry and vorticity estimations velocity data of the surface flow in the sump can also be derived as a by product of the camera installation this requires the presence of optical tracers e g debris or fog solids to be captured by subsequent images jeanbourquin et al 2011 or by seeding the domain with a visual tracer e g fluorescent particles naves et al 2020 these tracers can be used to find spatiotemporal correlation patterns and retrieve velocity fields by particle image velocimetry piv adrian and westerweel 2011 or particle tracking velocimetry ptv agüí and jiménez 1987 to illustrate this we use imagery from the nieuw terbregge station the geometry of this station was modified with a deflector flange installed at the inlet to enhance flow circulation and promote the generation of free surface vortices duinmeijer 2020 an undesirable process for the operation of pumping systems we acquired consecutive images with a frequency of 1 51 hz each 20 frames these were undistorted and perspective corrected at the water plane as described in section 2 3 a sequence of 244 images was used to derive particle tracking velocimetry ptv for the quantification of the surface velocity field u and flow vorticity ω u from the floating particles embedded in the flow the signal to noise ratio in the images was improved using an ensemble background subtraction and a manually defined area of interest an initial velocity estimation was obtained by a sum of correlation soc approach with 2 passes at 16 16 px with 50 overlap particle tracks and velocities were derived using the 2d ptv algorithm from davis piv software lavision version 8 0 using the soc field as initial displacement vorticity was computed directly from the soc velocity field 2 6 additional datasets a set of additional measured variables were used to describe the interaction of the fog layer with different processes of the wwps table 1 presents the main characteristics of all sensors used in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 semantic segmentation of fog surfaces the weights of the sem seg cnn structure were updated during 250 epochs when training this resulted in a final loss of 0 051 and 0 054 for training and validation respectively corresponding to 97 9 and 97 8 accuracy the progression of loss and accuracy during training is shown in figure 6 the results of training and validation of the sem seg cnn routine were deemed appropiate for the application a collection of 30 manually selected images at representative states of water level and fog cover outside the training and validation datasets were used to visually assess the behaviour of the sem seg algorithm figure 7 shows the output at six random samples of the 30 cases the color coded classification mask is shown in the middle column and a merged raw input and classified mask is shown in the right column we processed 106 000 images captured at the wwps pretorialaan generating masks for surface class i e superstructure fog and water figure 8 shows an example of the detection of water and fog cover at a time snapsot 3 2 analysis of fog layer dynamics figure 9 shows the time series processed at the wwps pretorialaan with measured rainfall intensity measured sump water level and sewer inflow the image derived dynamics of the fog water layer capture the progressive fog build up from the initially clean sump the wwps sump went from a fog water surface ratio of 2 on the 28 07 2020 until a 77 on the 31 01 2021 187 days computed as a 10 day rolling mean a video animation of the full dataset can be found in appendix d data derived from the optical location of fog water surfaces in the sump can be used to assess the accumulation and transport of fog solids over time additionally this data provides valuable information to understand interactions between the sump geometry and the wwps operational rules figure 10 presents a detailed analysis of a 13 day period 03 11 2020 16 11 2020 depicting fog water ratio 2nd row and the length wise fog layer location dynamics 3rd row we could observe that the fog layer dynamics are strongly influenced by the water level pump discharge and pump operation pattern during dry weather flow dwf the fog layer presented stable fluctuation minute day timescale due to the intermittent variation of kinetic energy generated by the inlet flow and the dwf pump switch on off levels pump 1 see figure 2 the inlet flow mobilizes the fog layer mass shifting it towards pump 1 sump section 2 high inflow during storm events wet weather flow wwf leads to an increase of water level in the pump sump and the activation of storm water pumps pump 2 to 5 the fog layer extent showed a strong sensitivity to water level this could be explained by the hydrodynamics in the sump at high water level the flow of fog towards the sump section 2 is blocked by the restriction in the middle of the sump figure 2 simultaneously the submerged inlet inflow and the activation of wwf pumps creates a surface recirculation pattern in the sump extending the fog layer towards the inlet a similar behaviour in the dynamics of the fog layer is observed in the 13th of october when pump 1 was temporally disconnected and a higher dwf pump switch on water level was maintained during several days this increased water level resulted in a restriction of fog flow towards the pump section 2 and the reduction of the sewer inflow velocity thus producing a larger fog layer length wise amplitude than with the previous dwf settings see figure 10 it should also be noted that the field of view fov of the camera mosaic did not cover the entire sump surface at extreme high water levels for a sump water level above 3 5 m the water surface view exits the fov of camera 1 the entire mosaic fov was covered by the water surface at an approximated depth of 2 8 m see figure 7 first row the degree of fov cover can be seen at figure 10 middle graph which shows the length wise location of the wet fog and water cover with respect to the camera view this may induce a bias at high water level and should be taken into consideration during the design e g use of wide angle lenses and analysis of the fog measurement campaign during the observation period the system suffered several incidents that required maintenance an automated sampler to monitor evolution of sars cov 2 was installed in view of camera 2 from 08 46 10 09 2020 onwards the sem seg algorithm filtered this view obstruction see examples 4 5 and 6 in figure 7 also camera 2 suffered intermittent loss of connection during three periods seen in the fog data gaps in figure 9 this has now been remediated by the installation of a connection monitor device it should also be noted that the dataset presented was gathered from 28 07 2020 until 31 01 2021 most of this period was under the influence of restrictions of varying severity to mitigate the covid 19 pandemic in the netherlands see figure c1 appendix c consequently this data might capture changes in behavioural patterns in the population due to restrictions and might not be fully representative of a pre or post pandemic situation 3 3 cameras as an optical gauge for water level estimations water levels were derived from a regression model see eq 1 that transformed the camera view wet area extent to a water level estimate figure 11 shows the results of training and testing the optical gauge model in the top left the gaussian process model mean and 95 ci is shown it is to be noted that intermediate high water level was well captured we observed an increase in variance at low water levels explained by the top view perspective that is expected to reduce surface differences with increasing camera to object distance on the other hand extreme water level d o b s 2 8 m n a p which fully cover the camera view could not be derived denoted by the change in slope at the end the regression plot figure 11 top left using the period of 20 08 2020 to 20 09 2020 31 days 2 minutes frequency as a test dataset resulted in a root mean square error of 0 11 m and a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 901 this shows that once calibrated the optical gauge can be used as a reliable source of water level information for wet to dry weather flow transitions or as a redundant alarm system for pump malfunction events higher accuracy can likely be achieved with a dedicated design for instance deploying a calibrated high contrast object e g white board in a wall or optimizing the camera position for water level observations 3 4 surface flow velocimetry and vortex detection in pump sumps figure 12 shows the estimation of a surface flow velocity field by means of ptv left and the estimation of the flow vorticity right in the sump of the wwps nieuw terbregge these measurements may be affected by the slip between the tracer and the water flow and thus underestimate the real flow velocity the severity of this bias will depend on the particle flow characteristics i e mass superficial density and lumping aggregation phenomena the extent and correction of these processes remains to be further investigated we observed that tracers appear to be between 0 01 to 0 2 m and often mix buoyant objects of different nature e g plastic litter with ellipsoidal fog lumps an example of the raw imagery used for the ptv processing can be found in appendix e also appendix a figure a3 a shows a typical high surface density tracer distribution at a different wwps nevertheless these estimated flow velocity and vorticity fields represent a relevant source of information even qualitatively about surface particle motion and may be used for the detection of free surface vortices in the pump sump highly relevant for the pump operation 4 conclusion this study describes the use of a programable camera system that can be deployed in wastewater pumping stations and can acquire and automatically process high frequency data of fog layer dynamics the relatively inexpensive hardware involved makes the technology widely accessible estimation of the fog layer cover through the deep learning routine resulted in a performance comparable with human classification 0 978 accuracy during validation this ai solution shows a good scalability since it can efficiently process large amounts of data high frequency long term monitoring with a reduced initial investment manual labels the sem seg routine presented in this article used only data collected at the wwps pretorialaan 89 manually labelled images and thus direct transferability of the classification algorithm to other stations cannot be guaranteed further work should aim at generalizing the fog layer detection transfer learning to a wider variety of pump sumps the monitoring solution presented is also capable of in situ processing of images we used an embedded camera system with a linux based micro computer raspberry pi 4 model b which could run the semantic segmentation machine learning routine for the detection of fog layers in 9 8 seconds per image at the camera itself hence the system can be deployed in the field and the data transfer can be limited to the post processed variables alone thus avoiding heavy raw image data transfer in sensor deep learning processing also known as edge ai computing deng et al 2020 aims at leveraging inexpensive hardware for low power inference of ml algorithms e g nvidia jetson nano or google coral tpus to reduce data transfer requirements by in situ processing this would allow for on site observation of variables in remote locations with low power low bandwidth data links e g lorawan satellite links fraire et al 2020 we believe that the presented application here shows a promising potential for monitoring other emerging bio hazards in hydro ecological environments for instance monitoring of algae blooms plastic litter fauna sediment plumes or other processes in remote locations in long term monitoring of fog the adoption of a reproducible and robust optical calibration corresponding frame to world coordinates routine is encouraged this should aim at restoring and allowing for continuity of the measurement series even under major disturbance of the camera position e g cameras moved disrupted during external maintenance also due to the complex geometries found in wwps sumps the installation of multiple cameras is often required this results in the need for robust image stitching mosaicking routines top view pump sump imagery can also be used to derive additional relevant variables for the operation of the pumping station the use of calibrated optical gauges for the estimation of water level data could help retrieving data in un gauged locations assist in model calibration de vitry and leitão 2020 or act as a redundant sensor to detect failures of wwps water level sensors e g clogging de synchronization additionally particle tracking velocimetry can be exploited to estimate the flow surface velocimetry the flow circulation and vorticity at the pump sump these variables are of high interest for the management of wwps since they could be used to detect the presence of air entrapping free surface vortices and as tools for assisting real time control systems nevertheless there are aspects of the surface velocity estimation that remains to be further investigated for instance assessing the slip between flow and particle or the definition of robust parameters for ptv piv imagery in pump sumps e g time delta pixel resolution etc on the other hand the fog layer monitoring system constitutes a ready to use data source for the planning of fog removal and maintenance operations one of the major limitations of the current measurement solution is that the top view camera can only retrieve fog surface characteristics and thus neglects vertical growth and associated dynamics due to the buoyant and disaggregated nature of the loose fog solids this does not seem to affect the ability to capture long term accumulation of fog solids until the full surface of the sump is covered by a fog layer further research is needed to devise a robust sensor for continuous monitoring of the layer depth and thus complement the measurements described in the present study to the authors knowledge this is the first documented long term high frequency fog layer dynamics database for wwps we believe that acquiring examples in a larger number of pumping stations would allow to describe fundamental processes involving accumulation and transport of fog solids

16822,accumulation of fat oil and grease fog in the sumps of wastewater pumping stations is a common failure cause for these facilities floating solids are often not transported by the pump suction inlets and the individual solids can accumulate to stiff and thick fog layers the lack of data about the dynamics in fog layer formation still hampers the design of effective measures towards its mitigation in this article we present a low cost camera based automated system for the observation of fog layer dynamics in wastewater pumping stations at high frequency minutes over extended time windows months optical imagery is processed through a deep learning computer vision routine that allows describing fog layer dynamics e g accumulation rate and changes in shape and various hydraulic processes in the pump sump e g the water level surface flow velocity fields vorticity or circulation furthermore the system can perform in camera image processing thus allowing the transfer of compressed processed datasets when deployed in remote locations edge ai computing which could be of great utility for the hydro ecological monitoring community in this study the technology applied is illustrated with a dataset six months two minute frequency collected at a wastewater pumping station at the municipality of rotterdam the netherlands this monitoring system represents a source of

monitoring fog layer dynamics low cost sensoring edge ai computing 1 introduction uncontrolled accumulation of solids of fat oil and grease fog in urban wastewater systems has drawn significant public media attention in the past years for example the famous 130 tonnes fatberg found in whitechapel london and others adams 2018 despite an increase in public awareness urban disposal of cooking oils and fat through wastewater transport systems still produces significant build up of fog solids an international review by wallace et al 2016 found that this problem is ubiquitous and that its severity depends on the design and age of the wastewater system disposal habits of citizens and mitigating measures e g grease trapping the presence of fog solids in wastewater transport systems induces reduction of hydraulic capacity ashley et al 2000 urban flooding sewage spills imposing health risks ten veldhuis et al 2010 and damage to pumping stations duinmeijer 2020 for urban drainage systems a reliable operation of wastewater pumping stations wwps is critical to effectively meet their functional requirements korving et al 2006 the presence of multiple phases and related transport phenomena transport of solids entrainment of gas air is known to increase wwps failure rates meanwhile gas accumulation processes are well understood and managed pothof 2011 floating fog accumulation in pump sumps are less known and receive little attention in guidelines for pump sump design e g american national hydraulic standards institute 2012 the sump geometry and configuration of most wwps do not guarantee the transport of floating solids to wastewater treatment facilities furthermore oil and fat deposits experience chemical and physical transformations e g saponification keener et al 2008 and he et al 2013 which hardens the material the mixture of hardened fog with additional materials such as textiles or plastics form a structurally stable stiff layer often covering the entire sump surface duinmeijer and clemens 2016 see figure 1 and more examples in appendix a manual removal of fog layers results in high operational costs and is a health hazard for the personnel involved for all wwps in the municipality of rotterdam the annual fog removal cost is approximately 400 000 requiring 8 000 work hours per year 2020 extrapolating this figure we estimate a cost on the order of 10 m year in the netherlands similar estimates are reported for the uk with 15 to 50 million pounds 18 60 m in 2016 per year wallace et al 2016 furthermore fog disposals are also regarded as a potential source of energy i e biofuel see jolis et al 2010 miot et al 2013 pastore et al 2015 and hence holds potential economic value which is still not widely exploited for any fog management strategy mitigation collection reuse recycling to be feasible and successfully implemented data on fog layer dynamics i e accumulation rate and transport mechanisms are required despite the economic and environmental relevance of this problem knowledge of fog layer dynamics at wwps facilities is currently limited this is mainly due to a lack of understanding of the processes involved transport bio chemical transformations and evolution of physical properties the highly heterogeneous catchment characteristics and the fact that obtaining measuring data in sewers given the physical chemical conditions and the poor accessibility of these systems is challenging nevertheless some observational data have been reported in the literature for instance nieuwenhuis et al 2018 found correlations of fog solids accumulation with socio economic parameters of the service area williams et al 2012 showed links of fog solid formation and local water composition however the discrete 1 1 the term discrete here refers to observations made only once or with irregular time intervals that do not allow for quantification of the underlaying dynamic processes nature of this data hampers a quantitative assessment of the transport and accumulation processes involved to the authors knowledge high frequency data of fog layer dynamics is missing camera based monitoring of water processes is rapidly popularizing due to access to relatively inexpensive hardware pagnutti et al 2017 and community driven open access software initiatives e g openpiv or opencv in urban drainage we can find examples such as the observation of in sewer processes shahsavari et al 2017 and regueiro picallo et al 2020 or the estimation of flow around drainage structures leitão et al 2018 duinmeijer et al 2019 martins et al 2018 and naves et al 2021 furthermore computer vision deep learning dl routines allow extracting complex information from videos and images dl allows exploiting spatial and contextual cues from imagery to extract information relevant for tasks such as object detection or classification when sufficiently trained these systems are robust to environmental changes e g lighting visual conditions and can be deployed in the field for instance for the determination of flooding area estimates jiang et al 2019 or moy de vitry et al 2019 or lab scale model surface classification den bieman et al 2020 the synergies of computer vision and dl applications will likely increase the number of variables that we are capable to measure in hydro ecological environments valero et al 2021 and for which the urban drainage community should adapt blumensaat et al 2019 this article presents the design and deployment of an embedded camera system for long term and high frequency automated monitoring of fog layer dynamics in the sump of wwps that is non invasive scalable and robust a deep learning routine was built and used to process large quantities of wwps top view images for the detection of fog layers we showcase the application of this system with a dataset of 6 months 2 minutes frequency collected at a wwps in the municipality of rotterdam also we discuss the possibility of extracting additional variables of interest for the management and control of wwps e g water level surface flow velocity fields and vorticity estimations the outline of the present article is as follows the hard and software designs are described in section 2 materials and methods section 3 reports and discusses the results obtained in two pilot wastewater pump sumps finally section 4 addresses the overall conclusions along with suggestions for future research and applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 case studies 2 1 1 wwps pretorialaan this pumping station discharges wastewater from a combined sewer system in the south of rotterdam the netherlands to a wastewater treatment facility the connected catchment has a size of approximately 650 ha and 120 000 inhabitants the sump of the wwps has a rectangular geometry of 18 3 m surface area see a side view in figure 2 waste and stormwater enters the sump by a 1 2 1 2 m inlet with soffit level at 4 87 m nap

1500 to 2000 m3 h in the middle of the sump there is a small restriction in the cross sectional flow area 1 9 2 1 m this restriction is used as dividing line for splitting up the sump in two sections section 1 and section 2 see figure 2 two cameras were installed in section 1 one day after the operators cleaned the sump 28 07 2020 2 1 2 wwps nieuw terbregge this wwps is also located in rotterdam

by an ø600 mm inlet and discharges by two submersible pumps with a fixed capacity of about 35 m3 h each a set of flanges were installed in the inflow channel to promote circulation in the pump duinmeijer 2020 and investigate the formation of surface vortices a top view camera was installed at this station data from this station is used in this study to showcase the potential to derive surface velocity fields and vorticity estimations in pump sumps 2 2 monitoring system the camera system was composed by a programable micro computer raspberry pi 4 4gb ram raspbian linux os an 8 megapixel camera sony imx219 mounting a 98 fov fisheye lens entaniya rp l98 a custom made 3d printed case was constructed in abs plastic with a protective paint coating and an acrylate lens protector the enclosure had a stainless steel backplate to ensure good thermal dissipation of the hardware figure b1 appendix b contains a graphical depiction of the camera case and power supply box three led floodlight lamps konig led 750 lumens 10w were used to illuminate the basin and were mounted below three access gates waterproof connectors and the tailored design of the enclosure aimed at reducing corrosion and gas condensation damage to the camera system two of these cameras were deployed fatracker 1 and 2 at section 1 of the pretorialaan station 9 3 m as shown in figure 2 the cameras were installed below one of the maintenance access gates to the basin at approximately 1 2 m nap water level was maintained at an average of 4 2 m nap and a maximum level of 1 94 m nap was recorded during the measurement campaign the cameras had a 5v power supply and 4g connection for remote operation and data transfer provided by a router tp link tl mr6400 individual images were acquired using a shutter speed of 100 ms iso 800 1024 768 px resolution at 2 minutes interval two consecutive images at a user defined δt could also be collected for estimating displacement fields operational and maintenance access was granted through a 4g vpn network email alerts were scheduled for camera thermal levels none were triggered during the observation period a third camera was installed at nieuw terbregge wwps to investigate the formation of surface vortices in 2018 see duinmeijer 2020 this consisted of a commercially available ip camera axis m1125 e recording at 30 images per second with a resolution of 480 640 px in a top view configuration images were transferred through 4g network to a centralized server at the municipality of rotterdam imagery of this camera is used in this study to showcase the potential use of top view imagery to derive surface velocity characteristics and vorticity in a wwps 2 3 image pre processing a pre processing routine was applied to images collected in order to i correct for lens and sensor optical deformation intrinsic calibration ii rectify the water plane perspective and iii mosaic images to create a seamless basin image the python library opencv bradski 2000 was used for the camera calibration and perspective rectification of the images 15 images of a 17 21 chessboard pattern with 25 mm squares were taken at different orientations and positions from each camera a fish eye camera distortion model opencv manual 2014 was fitted to the detected checkerboard squares and used to correct for lens and sensor distortions figure 3 b thus preserving linear features in the image the cameras installed in pretorialaan were top down oriented at 45 degrees with the horizontal plane this induced a perspective distortion of the water plane which was corrected using known corresponding image pump sump positions a perspective warping model was applied to create 4 point perspective transform to a water plane top view position and to mosaic both camera views figure 3 c 2 4 semantic segmentation of fog layer images a convolutional neural network cnn routine was developed to discriminate between and locate three types of surfaces fog water and superstructure in pump sump images the network was built using tensorflow abadi et al 2016 and takes the form of a semantic segmentation sem seg architecture garcia garcia et al 2017 and ye and sung 2019 this algorithm processes rgb image data to retrieve dense labelled regions spatial localization and classification from a pre selected list of objects or surfaces of interest i e wwps superstructure fog and water extent the network architecture was configured as a vgg16 simonyan and zisserman 2014 encoder and a fully convolutional network fcn decoder figure 4 we used transfer learning to reduce the number of fog labelled images required during training to that effect we initialized the encoder vgg16 network parameters with weights pre trained on the imagenet dataset deng et al 2009 a multi million labelled image public repository this allowed acquiring a relatively general set of encoder filters capable of performing object classification before the application to fog layer detection a sparse categorical cross entropy loss function was used to update the network parameters representative images across different water level and fog layer extent states were manually selected to create a training database a total of 89 mosaicked images see figure 3 c were manually labelled by the same individual hence supplying masks of the extent of fog layer water and pump superstructure e g walls cables pipes gates etc a data augmentation routine was applied to increase the training size by mirroring all labelled images thus a total of 178 labelled images were used during training and validation of the network with a split of 70 30 124 training 54 validation during training both encoder and decoder parameters were updated training was performed during 250 epochs using a batch of size of 15 examples an nvidia tesla turing 4 gpu 16gb 8 1 tflops was used during the learning and testing phase during processing images from both cameras were undistorted and mosaicked to create the optically corrected basin top view then input images were resized to the input size of the sem seg network 320 800px and processed class encoded output masks were upscaled back to the original mosaic size 640 1660px and were fed to the post processing algorithm which computed geometrical properties of the fog layer over time the image segmentation routine was carried out offline using a nvidia quadro t2000 gpu 4gb with a processing time of 1 2 seconds per image also in sensor inference could be achieved at the camera using a raspberry pi 4 model b arm cpu quad core cortex a72 with a processing time of 9 8 seconds per image the camera could hence work in two modes in situ processing and transferring processed masks reduced data transfer or transfer raw rgb high resolution images for offline postprocessing 2 5 post processing 2 5 1 fog water surface ratio masks provided by the sem seg cnn output classify regions of water fog superstructure a computer vision algorithm was created to retrieve the extension and location of the layers over time this consisted in a morphological opening and closing operation on the raw masks border smoothing and noise filtering extracting contours from the labelled mask and computing surface areas since images were perspective rectified for a top view of the basin we assumed that the ratio between water surface and surface covered with fog was approximately depth invariant instantaneous fog water ratio was computed using the sem seg derived fog top view pixel area a f o g and the water pixel area a w a t e r as 1 f o g w a t e r r a t i o a f o g a f o g a w a t e r additionally in order to visualize fog layer dynamics we computed the along length fog water pixel density average from the inlet to the pump sump separation wall as depicted in figure 5 thus displaying a length time 2d fog pixel density 2 5 2 cameras for water level estimation optical gauge exploiting image data to extract water level information is a promising strategy to leverage the growing number of cctv networks in cities worldwide for instance jiang et al 2019 proposed extracting street flooding water levels by comparing landscape features of known shape moy de vitry et al 2019 on the other hand proposed a simple water area proxy as a correlated variable to water level in street video data here we applied a similar approach to de vitry et al 2019 to derive sump pump water level data as a by product of the fog monitoring system we used the observed wet area a w e t c a m a f o g a w a t e r in pixels to define a distance to camera proxy however since our imagery was strictly a top down view of a rectangular basin as opposed to street camera applications we used the square root of the instantaneous wet area to transform to a length proxy dimensions synchronized water level measurements d o b s during a period of 8 days 25 09 2020 02 10 2020 and two minutes frequency were used to calibrate a regression model from the proxy optical gauge a w e t c a m 0 5 to an estimated basin water level d w a gaussian process regression model g p was adjusted in the following form 2 d w f a we t cam 0 5 ε f g p 0 k ε n 0 σ 2 with k a squared exponential covariance matrix k x x e k p x x 2 k p a scale parameter and ε a random variable of gaussian i i d noise the calibrated regression model was used to obtain an optically derived water level estimated in the full time series and was validated using a time series of 30 days 2 min frequency 20 08 2020 20 09 2020 2 5 3 particle tracking velocimetry and vorticity estimations velocity data of the surface flow in the sump can also be derived as a by product of the camera installation this requires the presence of optical tracers e g debris or fog solids to be captured by subsequent images jeanbourquin et al 2011 or by seeding the domain with a visual tracer e g fluorescent particles naves et al 2020 these tracers can be used to find spatiotemporal correlation patterns and retrieve velocity fields by particle image velocimetry piv adrian and westerweel 2011 or particle tracking velocimetry ptv agüí and jiménez 1987 to illustrate this we use imagery from the nieuw terbregge station the geometry of this station was modified with a deflector flange installed at the inlet to enhance flow circulation and promote the generation of free surface vortices duinmeijer 2020 an undesirable process for the operation of pumping systems we acquired consecutive images with a frequency of 1 51 hz each 20 frames these were undistorted and perspective corrected at the water plane as described in section 2 3 a sequence of 244 images was used to derive particle tracking velocimetry ptv for the quantification of the surface velocity field u and flow vorticity ω u from the floating particles embedded in the flow the signal to noise ratio in the images was improved using an ensemble background subtraction and a manually defined area of interest an initial velocity estimation was obtained by a sum of correlation soc approach with 2 passes at 16 16 px with 50 overlap particle tracks and velocities were derived using the 2d ptv algorithm from davis piv software lavision version 8 0 using the soc field as initial displacement vorticity was computed directly from the soc velocity field 2 6 additional datasets a set of additional measured variables were used to describe the interaction of the fog layer with different processes of the wwps table 1 presents the main characteristics of all sensors used in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 semantic segmentation of fog surfaces the weights of the sem seg cnn structure were updated during 250 epochs when training this resulted in a final loss of 0 051 and 0 054 for training and validation respectively corresponding to 97 9 and 97 8 accuracy the progression of loss and accuracy during training is shown in figure 6 the results of training and validation of the sem seg cnn routine were deemed appropiate for the application a collection of 30 manually selected images at representative states of water level and fog cover outside the training and validation datasets were used to visually assess the behaviour of the sem seg algorithm figure 7 shows the output at six random samples of the 30 cases the color coded classification mask is shown in the middle column and a merged raw input and classified mask is shown in the right column we processed 106 000 images captured at the wwps pretorialaan generating masks for surface class i e superstructure fog and water figure 8 shows an example of the detection of water and fog cover at a time snapsot 3 2 analysis of fog layer dynamics figure 9 shows the time series processed at the wwps pretorialaan with measured rainfall intensity measured sump water level and sewer inflow the image derived dynamics of the fog water layer capture the progressive fog build up from the initially clean sump the wwps sump went from a fog water surface ratio of 2 on the 28 07 2020 until a 77 on the 31 01 2021 187 days computed as a 10 day rolling mean a video animation of the full dataset can be found in appendix d data derived from the optical location of fog water surfaces in the sump can be used to assess the accumulation and transport of fog solids over time additionally this data provides valuable information to understand interactions between the sump geometry and the wwps operational rules figure 10 presents a detailed analysis of a 13 day period 03 11 2020 16 11 2020 depicting fog water ratio 2nd row and the length wise fog layer location dynamics 3rd row we could observe that the fog layer dynamics are strongly influenced by the water level pump discharge and pump operation pattern during dry weather flow dwf the fog layer presented stable fluctuation minute day timescale due to the intermittent variation of kinetic energy generated by the inlet flow and the dwf pump switch on off levels pump 1 see figure 2 the inlet flow mobilizes the fog layer mass shifting it towards pump 1 sump section 2 high inflow during storm events wet weather flow wwf leads to an increase of water level in the pump sump and the activation of storm water pumps pump 2 to 5 the fog layer extent showed a strong sensitivity to water level this could be explained by the hydrodynamics in the sump at high water level the flow of fog towards the sump section 2 is blocked by the restriction in the middle of the sump figure 2 simultaneously the submerged inlet inflow and the activation of wwf pumps creates a surface recirculation pattern in the sump extending the fog layer towards the inlet a similar behaviour in the dynamics of the fog layer is observed in the 13th of october when pump 1 was temporally disconnected and a higher dwf pump switch on water level was maintained during several days this increased water level resulted in a restriction of fog flow towards the pump section 2 and the reduction of the sewer inflow velocity thus producing a larger fog layer length wise amplitude than with the previous dwf settings see figure 10 it should also be noted that the field of view fov of the camera mosaic did not cover the entire sump surface at extreme high water levels for a sump water level above 3 5 m the water surface view exits the fov of camera 1 the entire mosaic fov was covered by the water surface at an approximated depth of 2 8 m see figure 7 first row the degree of fov cover can be seen at figure 10 middle graph which shows the length wise location of the wet fog and water cover with respect to the camera view this may induce a bias at high water level and should be taken into consideration during the design e g use of wide angle lenses and analysis of the fog measurement campaign during the observation period the system suffered several incidents that required maintenance an automated sampler to monitor evolution of sars cov 2 was installed in view of camera 2 from 08 46 10 09 2020 onwards the sem seg algorithm filtered this view obstruction see examples 4 5 and 6 in figure 7 also camera 2 suffered intermittent loss of connection during three periods seen in the fog data gaps in figure 9 this has now been remediated by the installation of a connection monitor device it should also be noted that the dataset presented was gathered from 28 07 2020 until 31 01 2021 most of this period was under the influence of restrictions of varying severity to mitigate the covid 19 pandemic in the netherlands see figure c1 appendix c consequently this data might capture changes in behavioural patterns in the population due to restrictions and might not be fully representative of a pre or post pandemic situation 3 3 cameras as an optical gauge for water level estimations water levels were derived from a regression model see eq 1 that transformed the camera view wet area extent to a water level estimate figure 11 shows the results of training and testing the optical gauge model in the top left the gaussian process model mean and 95 ci is shown it is to be noted that intermediate high water level was well captured we observed an increase in variance at low water levels explained by the top view perspective that is expected to reduce surface differences with increasing camera to object distance on the other hand extreme water level d o b s 2 8 m n a p which fully cover the camera view could not be derived denoted by the change in slope at the end the regression plot figure 11 top left using the period of 20 08 2020 to 20 09 2020 31 days 2 minutes frequency as a test dataset resulted in a root mean square error of 0 11 m and a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 901 this shows that once calibrated the optical gauge can be used as a reliable source of water level information for wet to dry weather flow transitions or as a redundant alarm system for pump malfunction events higher accuracy can likely be achieved with a dedicated design for instance deploying a calibrated high contrast object e g white board in a wall or optimizing the camera position for water level observations 3 4 surface flow velocimetry and vortex detection in pump sumps figure 12 shows the estimation of a surface flow velocity field by means of ptv left and the estimation of the flow vorticity right in the sump of the wwps nieuw terbregge these measurements may be affected by the slip between the tracer and the water flow and thus underestimate the real flow velocity the severity of this bias will depend on the particle flow characteristics i e mass superficial density and lumping aggregation phenomena the extent and correction of these processes remains to be further investigated we observed that tracers appear to be between 0 01 to 0 2 m and often mix buoyant objects of different nature e g plastic litter with ellipsoidal fog lumps an example of the raw imagery used for the ptv processing can be found in appendix e also appendix a figure a3 a shows a typical high surface density tracer distribution at a different wwps nevertheless these estimated flow velocity and vorticity fields represent a relevant source of information even qualitatively about surface particle motion and may be used for the detection of free surface vortices in the pump sump highly relevant for the pump operation 4 conclusion this study describes the use of a programable camera system that can be deployed in wastewater pumping stations and can acquire and automatically process high frequency data of fog layer dynamics the relatively inexpensive hardware involved makes the technology widely accessible estimation of the fog layer cover through the deep learning routine resulted in a performance comparable with human classification 0 978 accuracy during validation this ai solution shows a good scalability since it can efficiently process large amounts of data high frequency long term monitoring with a reduced initial investment manual labels the sem seg routine presented in this article used only data collected at the wwps pretorialaan 89 manually labelled images and thus direct transferability of the classification algorithm to other stations cannot be guaranteed further work should aim at generalizing the fog layer detection transfer learning to a wider variety of pump sumps the monitoring solution presented is also capable of in situ processing of images we used an embedded camera system with a linux based micro computer raspberry pi 4 model b which could run the semantic segmentation machine learning routine for the detection of fog layers in 9 8 seconds per image at the camera itself hence the system can be deployed in the field and the data transfer can be limited to the post processed variables alone thus avoiding heavy raw image data transfer in sensor deep learning processing also known as edge ai computing deng et al 2020 aims at leveraging inexpensive hardware for low power inference of ml algorithms e g nvidia jetson nano or google coral tpus to reduce data transfer requirements by in situ processing this would allow for on site observation of variables in remote locations with low power low bandwidth data links e g lorawan satellite links fraire et al 2020 we believe that the presented application here shows a promising potential for monitoring other emerging bio hazards in hydro ecological environments for instance monitoring of algae blooms plastic litter fauna sediment plumes or other processes in remote locations in long term monitoring of fog the adoption of a reproducible and robust optical calibration corresponding frame to world coordinates routine is encouraged this should aim at restoring and allowing for continuity of the measurement series even under major disturbance of the camera position e g cameras moved disrupted during external maintenance also due to the complex geometries found in wwps sumps the installation of multiple cameras is often required this results in the need for robust image stitching mosaicking routines top view pump sump imagery can also be used to derive additional relevant variables for the operation of the pumping station the use of calibrated optical gauges for the estimation of water level data could help retrieving data in un gauged locations assist in model calibration de vitry and leitão 2020 or act as a redundant sensor to detect failures of wwps water level sensors e g clogging de synchronization additionally particle tracking velocimetry can be exploited to estimate the flow surface velocimetry the flow circulation and vorticity at the pump sump these variables are of high interest for the management of wwps since they could be used to detect the presence of air entrapping free surface vortices and as tools for assisting real time control systems nevertheless there are aspects of the surface velocity estimation that remains to be further investigated for instance assessing the slip between flow and particle or the definition of robust parameters for ptv piv imagery in pump sumps e g time delta pixel resolution etc on the other hand the fog layer monitoring system constitutes a ready to use data source for the planning of fog removal and maintenance operations one of the major limitations of the current measurement solution is that the top view camera can only retrieve fog surface characteristics and thus neglects vertical growth and associated dynamics due to the buoyant and disaggregated nature of the loose fog solids this does not seem to affect the ability to capture long term accumulation of fog solids until the full surface of the sump is covered by a fog layer further research is needed to devise a robust sensor for continuous monitoring of the layer depth and thus complement the measurements described in the present study to the authors knowledge this is the first documented long term high frequency fog layer dynamics database for wwps we believe that acquiring examples in a larger number of pumping stations would allow to describe fundamental processes involving accumulation and transport of fog solids

16823,geobacter as a typical electroactive microorganism is the engine of interspecies electron transfer iet between microorganisms however it does not have a dominant position in all natural environments it is not known what performs a similar function as geobacter in coastal zones metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that desulfovibrio and methanobacterium species were the most abundant in electrochemically active aggregates metatranscriptomic analysis showed that desulfovibrio species highly expressed genes for ethanol metabolism and extracellular electron transfer involving cytochromes pili and flagella methanobacterium species in the aggregates also expressed genes for enzymes involved in reducing carbon dioxide to methane pure cultures demonstrated that the isolated desulfovibrio sp strain jy contributed to aggregate conductivity and directly transferred electrons to methanothrix harundinacea which is unable to use h2 or formate most importantly further coculture studies indicated that methanobacterium strain ysl might directly accept electrons from the desulfovibrio strain jy for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the aggregate this finding suggested that the possibility of diet by desulfovibrio similar to geobacter species in conductive methanogenic aggregates can not be excluded graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords desulfovibrio methanobacterium direct interspecies electron transfer methanogenic aggregates coastal zones 1 introduction microbial biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms that dominate microbial lifestyles and they have various applications in medicine environmental protection biomaterials and contamination treatment flemming and wuertz 2019 vert et al 2012 biofilms are complex they consist of extracellular polymeric substances eps that are self produced by microbial cells the eps usually contains polysaccharides proteins and extracellular dna which perform different functions flemming and wingender 2010 multicellular aggregates that are enclosed in eps form a unique form of biofilms for various ecological reasons such as nutrient stress claessen et al 2014 among these aggregates electrochemically active biofilms eabs can be electrically conductive and have potential applications in bioenergy chemical production and pollutant degradation in which electroactive microorganisms eams play an important role in enabling efficient electron transfer for producing high power densities babauta et al 2012 borole et al 2011 logan et al 2019 the eab aggregation not only shortens the distances between syntrophic microorganisms but also develops more effective metabolic mechanisms that improve interactions between cells among them direct interspecies electron transfer diet an alternative to h2 formate interspecies transfer hfit is more efficient in establishing syntrophic communities in various environments li et al 2017 lovley 2017a 2017b however the reason for better elucidating the importance of the diet mechanism is to obtain comprehensive information on functional communities in microbial aggregates stams and plugge 2009 van steendam et al 2019 geobacter as a typical eam is the engine of iet between microorganisms lovley 2017b reguera and kashefi 2019 the initial discovery of this role showed that aggregates formed by geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens were electrically conductive demonstrating that electrons released by g metallireducens could flow to g sulfurreducens via diet summers et al 2010 diet as an important process for iet was discovered in multispecies aggregates from a brewery wastewater digester in which geobacter and methanothrix species predominated further analysis demonstrated that the aggregate conductivity had a correlation with the abundance of geobacter species morita et al 2011 research efforts reported that highly conductive aggregates formed in cocultures of g metallireducens with either g sulfurreducens or m harundinacea methanosarcina barkeri had special extracellular agents such as electrically conductive pili e pili and cytochromes which could establish biological electrical connections for transferring electrons rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b shrestha et al 2013 subsequent studies demonstrated that the electrical connection could be replaced or enhanced by conductive materials in defined cocultures of g metallireducens g sulfurreducens or g metallireducens m barkeri in the laboratory chen et al 2014a chen et al 2014b liu et al 2012 2015 rotaru et al 2014a zheng et al 2020a zheng et al 2018 furthermore the findings documented that geobacter species were the most metabolically active bacteria in methanogenic rice paddy soils holmes et al 2017 hori et al 2010 metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that geobacter species participate in diet and provide electrons through e pili to methanothrix species for carbon dioxide reduction holmes et al 2017 in addition our research discovered that the first methanogen outside the family methanosarcinales a strain of methanobacterium that was isolated from coastal riverine sediments was capable of diet in cocultures with g metallireducens zheng et al 2020b current reports have indicated that geobacter species such as eams are the most well studied electron donating bacteria that can achieve diet with methanogens in methanogenic systems however geobacter does not have a dominant position in coastal zones instead other potential electron donating bacteria such as pseudomonas clostridium bacillus and desulfovibrio dominate in in situ sediments and enrichment cultures xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 the identity of the microbe that performs a similar function as geobacter in these natural environments is not yet known methanogenic aggregates formed by methanogens and their syntrophic partners are widely used in the conversion of organic matter to methane in anaerobic digestion systems wang et al 2016 moreover the findings indicated that diet within methanogenic aggregates is an important mechanism for iet in the process of methanogenesis morita et al 2011 li et al 2017 in addition conductive methanogenic aggregates has been identified to facilitate the establishment of electronic connections between eams and methanogens li et al 2017 our previous study has established the enrichment systems facilitated the growth of microorganisms participating in diet from coastal riverine sediments in this syntrophic co culture system methanogenic aggregates were formed in the enrichment cultures by transforming ethanol to methane and eams and methanogens appeared to participate diet zheng et al 2015 methanobacterium strain ysl grows via diet in defined cocultures with g metallireducens zheng et al 2020b it is not known what performs a similar function as geobacter in coastal zones therefore to investigate eams and methanogens in the aggregates responsible for iet and understand their roles in iet metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were used as diagnostic tools to investigate the actively dominating community structures furthermore pure culture techniques were employed to evaluate the potential for iet between eams and methanogens here we show the new possibility of diet between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium species might indicate an important strategy for electron exchange in natural methanogenic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of methanogenic aggregates and desulfovibrio sp jy isolation as previously described zheng et al 2015 methanogenic aggregates were formed in dsm 120 with 20 mmol l 1 ethanol as the electron donor by two step cultivation of coastal riverine sediments fig 1 a the medium for isolation of strain jy was anaerobic nutrient basal nb medium with ethanol as the electron donor and sulfate as the electron acceptor the medium included 0 04 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 1 g l 1

medium was distributed to anaerobic tubes under an oxygen free gas mixture of n2 co2 80 20 the tubes were sealed and autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min ethanol 20 mmol l 1 as the electron donor was added to nb medium before inoculation incubations were at 30 c methanogenic aggregates were serially diluted 10 inoculum in nb medium the highest dilution of aggregates was transferred into liquid medium amended with 2 0 agar and subjected to the hungate roll tube technique colonies were visible after 2 weeks individual colonies were picked with a disposable sterilized needle in a coy anaerobic chamber and transferred into anaerobic tubes containing 10 ml of liquid medium further purification was needed using the same method several times after one week of culture 0 5 mmol l 1 fe2 ammonium iron ii sulfate was added to 0 2 ml of pure cultures in nb medium to detect black precipitates and determine the reduction of sulfate to sulfide 2 2 microscopy the methanogenic aggregate was examined for the presence of methanogens by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm olympus fluoview fv1000 and excitation 405 nm laser and emission 430 500 nm were used to visualize methanogens for their natural autofluorescence characteristics to better visualize the aggregation state of bacterial and archaeal cells fish was performed as described elsewhere gong et al 2016 rotaru et al 2014a the

microscopy tem of cells as previously described zheng et al 2020b 2 3 electrochemical analysis of aggregates and desulfovibrio sp jy microbial fuel cells mfcs were constructed for further electrochemical analysis of aggregates and isolated desulfovibrio sp jy the electrochemical methods used in this study such as ca and cv were as previously described zheng et al 2017 when the electrochemical analysis of aggregates was conducted the anode chamber was filled with 100 ml of modified dsm120 anaerobic medium ph 7 0 and the cathode was filled with the same volume of 100 mmol l 1 tris hcl buffer solution at ph 7 0 alternatively isolated desulfovibrio sp jy was inoculated into the anode chamber which was filled with anaerobic nb medium ph 7 0 and the cathode was filled with 50 mmol l 1 potassium ferricyanide buffer solution for higher detection sensitivity ethanol 20 mmol l 1 was used as the electron donor in the anaerobic medium of anode chambers and all the electron acceptors and electron shuttles were omitted methanogenic aggregates or isolated desulfovibrio sp jy cells 10 inoculum in exponential growth phase were introduced into the anode chamber filled with anaerobic medium to culture biofilms on the surface of the electrode 20 of the medium in anode chambers was anaerobically replaced with fresh anaerobic medium every ten days the anode was covered by a dialysis bag mwco 8000 14000 d flat width 4 4 cm solarbio china and cell suspensions were added into the anodic chamber outside the dialysis bag to prevent the attachment of cells to the anode li et al 2015 anaerobic medium without cells was used as the negative control after swapping two times during biofilm development current time data from a digital multimeter were collected and the cv peaks produced by a three electrode system were detected 2 4 chemical analysis gaseous samples were regularly collected from the headspaces of cultures using a pressure lock analytical syringe the

respectively liquid samples were collected and filtered through 0 22 μm filters the concentrations of ethanol acetate and formate in cultures were analyzed using a 1260 infinity high performance liquid chromatography hplc instrument agilent technologies usa with a hi plexh column equipped with a refractive index detector rid 2 5 metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing genomic dna and total rna of aggregate cells were extracted according to standard procedures the mrna was broken into short fragments and used as templates to synthesize first strand cdna with random hexamer primers which was followed by second strand synthesis invitrogen usa short dna and cdna fragments were purified with a qiaquick pcr extraction kit qiagen and resolved for end repair adding poly a and performing sequencing adapter ligation then the products were purified by a minielute pcr purification kit before pcr amplification finally quantified libraries could be prepared for paired end sequencing using a hiseq2000 system illumina 2 6 de novo metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assembly and gene annotation all of the raw sequencing metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads of aggregates were quality checked with fastqc andrews 2014 http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc initial raw nonfiltered metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing libraries contained an average of 7 142 930 and 6 085 770 reads that were 150 bp long with insert sizes of 300 bp to obtain a clean read dataset of high quality raw sequences from the two libraries were trimmed and filtered using a custom perl script that removed reads with a significant excess of n deleted duplicated reads generated by pcr amplification cut bases from the start and end of reads of low quality and eliminated reads smaller than 50 bp then 6 721 490 and 5 458 930 quality reads were obtained from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing libraries respectively to obtain high quality contigs quality control was performed and paired end metagenomic reads were assembled using idba ud peng et al 2012 in addition de novo transcriptome assembly was conducted for the high quality metatranscriptomic data using trinity assembler grabherr et al 2011 to obtain better assembly results and increase the proportion of sequences mapped to contigs nonredundant contigs which were left after the removal of contigs duplicated from multiple assemblies by cd hit algorithms li and godzik 2006 were further assembled based on their overlap using minimus2 with a minimum percentage cutoff of 99 from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies produced using multiple k mer assemblies mason et al 2012 binning of assembled metagenomic sequences was performed using a combination of tetranucleotide frequencies contig coverage and gc content in emergent self organizing maps esom dick et al 2009 and maxbin 2 2 1 wu et al 2014 with default parameters genome completeness and contamination were estimated using checkm parks et al 2015 which uses lineage specific single copy marker genes organized into collocated marker sets to provide robust estimates genome similarity values were generated by using orthoani lee et al 2016 transcript reads were mapped to predicted proteins by blastx with bitscore 50 e 1 10 5 and percent identity 95 gene abundance was normalized to gene length and the total number of cdna reads and multiplied by 1 000 protein coding sequences from the assembly of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic contigs were predicated using metagenemark lukashin and borodovsky 1998 using the default settings ribosomal rna genes were used to identify all three rrna subunits with rnammer lagesen et al 2007 for each predicted protein coding sequence functional information was collected by a sequence similarity search against the ncbi nonredundant protein sequence nr database using blastp with e values 1 10 5 the sequences with reliable hits in the nr database were also compared against kegg orthology kanehisa and goto 2000 cog tatusov et al 2003 and pfam finn et al 2014 databases with e values 1 10 5 the metagenome was also annotated using img m https img jgi doe gov cgi bin m main cgi the taxonomic annotations of archaeal and bacterial sequences were compared against the ncbi nr database using blast with e values 1 10 5 from all assemblies of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic contigs the taxonomic information was parsed using the lowest common ancestor algorithm in megan huson et al 2007 with default parameters the relative abundance of a given bacterial or archaeal taxon was calculated as the percentage of the number of sequences assigned to this taxon relative to the sum of the total number of sequences assigned to all taxa 2 7 phylogenetic analyses using ribosomal proteins phylogenetic analysis was performed using a syntenic block of 15 universal ribosomal proteins rp l2 3 4 5 6 14 15 18 22 and 24 and s3 8 10 17 and 19 each rp was aligned along with reference sequences using mafft with auto flag katoh and standley 2013 individual rp alignments were concatenated with housekeeping r scripts and trimmed with trimal with gappyout flags capella gutierrez et al 2009 phylogenetic analysis of rp was inferred by raxml stamatakis 2014 implemented by the cipres science gateway under the lg plus gamma model of evolution protgammalg in the raxml model section and with the number of bootstraps automatically determined automre phylogenetic trees were visualized with figtree http tree bio ed ac uk software figtree 2 8 genome sequencing assembly and annotation and phylogenetic analysis of the isolate the qualified genomic dna of the isolate was fragmented by a 26g needle and fragments larger than 20 kb were selected using bluepippin after end repair a tail and sequencing adapter ligation of fragments were performed and a quantified dna library was prepared for whole genome sequencing with the pacbio sequel platform raw data were qualified and assembled with mecat2 to obtain a chromosome with a length of 4 686 982 bp and the g c content of the isolate dna was 63 89 mol a total of 4 648 coding genes were predicted by using glimmer3 delcher et al 2007 with an average length of 895 39 bp gene functional annotation was performed by using databases including the ncbi nr swiss prot kegg cog go and pfam databases the optimal blast result was obtained based on the identity e value and score by using blast and diamond against the above databases the average nucleotide identity ani value was used to identify species that share 95 dna identity among the available genomes yoon et al 2017 phylogenetic analysis of the strains of desulfovibrio and methanobacterium was performed using concatenations of 120 bacteria specific and 122 archaea specific protein markers respectively and the methods were performed as previously described parks et al 2018 2 9 cocultures of desulfovibrio sp strain jy and methanothrix harundinacea or methanobacterium sp strain ysl methanothrix harundinacea strain 6ac jcm 13211 ma et al 2006 was obtained from prof xiuzhu dong s laboratory culture collection at the institute of microbiology chinese academy of sciences wild type methanobacterium sp strain ysl was isolated from methanogenic aggregates as previously described zheng et al 2020b cocultures of the desulfovibrio sp strain jy and m harundinacea strain 6ac or methanobacterium sp strain ysl were established in dsm120 as previously described rotaru et al 2014a with 10 mmol l 1 ethanol as the electron donor but the electron acceptor sulfate was omitted both sulfide and cysteine were also tested and they were required as sulfur sources for methanogens in long term cocultures rotaru et al 2014a before the establishment of the cocultures desulfovibrio sp strain jy was grown in liquid medium with 20 mmol l 1 ethanol as the electron donor and 2 5 mmol l 1 sulfate as the electron acceptor m harundinacea strain 6ac and methanobacterium sp strain ysl was grown in liquid ms medium with 20 mmol l 1 acetate and 40 mmol l 1 formate as its substrate the individual cultures were grown until sulfate desulfovibrio sp strain jy acetate m harundinacea strain 6ac or formate methanobacterium sp strain ysl was consumed cocultures were initiated with a 10 inoculum of each partner into 40 ml of dsm120 in triplicate cocultured incubations were performed at 30 c but 37 c was better for cocultures of desulfovibrio sp strain jy and m harundinacea strain 6ac 2 10 data availability the metagenomics and metatranscriptomics sequence reads have been deposited in the sequence read archive at the national center for biotechnology information under accession nos srr5801693 and srr5801692 respectively the complete genome sequences of desulfovibrio sp strain jy and methanobacterium sp strain ysl have been deposited in elmsg https www biosino org elmsg index under accession nos lmsg g000000180 1 and lmsg g000000181 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the aggregates methanogenic aggregates were obtained from enrichments with ethanol as the electron donor by two step cultivation of riverine sediments they formed different sizes diameters 20 μm of tightly packed black aggregates fig 1a autofluorescence characteristics of methanogens were confirmed in the coculture aggregates and rod and coccus shaped cells released natural autofluorescence fig 1b fluorescence in situ hybridization fish showed that some bacterial and methanogenic cells had overlapping distributions within aggregates fig 1c the morphological characteristics of aggregate cells were visualized using scanning electron microscopy sem which showed that cells were in close physical contact and intertwined fig 1d these general characteristics of aggregates were similar to those of previously observed aggregates formed in methanogenic wastewater or cocultures of geobacter species and methanogens morita et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014a 3 2 electrochemical activity of aggregates based on the structural characteristics of aggregates microbial fuel cells mfcs were constructed to confirm the electrochemical activity of the aggregates through chronoamperometry ca and cyclic voltammetry cv badalamenti et al 2013 strycharz et al 2011 the current density over time approximately 9 6 days and voltammograms of aggregate suspensions with or without dialysis were monitored aggregate suspensions without dialysis showed a short lag of 1 5 days in current production which was followed by a rapid increase in electrical activity as a result of microbial ethanol oxidation the maximum current density was achieved during the culture time at 3 5 days the highest peak was approximately 14 34 ma m 2 and it was followed by a decrease in current production due to depletion of the electron donor however aggregate suspension with a dialysis bag prevented cells from directly contacting the electrode and generated a lower current density than that without a dialysis bag and the maximum current peak was approximately 5 29 ma m 2 at 2 3 days no significant current density was observed in the ca of the control medium fig 1e after the current density was near zero cyclic voltammograms of aggregates were recorded they showed two major redox systems and the oxidation reduction peaks were centered at approximately 0 072 v and 0 12 v vs ag agcl similarly aggregates with dialysis had two oxidation reduction peaks centered at approximately 0 138 and 0 104 v vs ag agcl no significant oxidation or reduction peak was observed in the cv of the control medium at a scan rate of 50 mv s 1 fig 1f thus higher current density and redox peak current 12 2 ma vs 9 27 ma 13 5 ma vs 8 26 ma were generated by aggregate suspensions without a dialysis bag than by suspensions with a dialysis bag suggesting that aggregate cells were involved in the electrogenic activity a majority of electrons could transfer via direct contact of the aggregate biofilm attached to the anode surface and that a small portion of electrons could also be transported via unknown soluble electron carriers this complex iet mode has been reported in geobacter coculture aggregates however secreted soluble electron carriers made only a minor contribution to iet in geobacter diet co culture huang et al 2020 based on these results it indicated that different iet and diet mechanisms might coexist in aggregate biofilms where eams producing current played an important role in iet 3 3 microbial community composition in aggregates by metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to further investigate the microbial community components participating in iet in methanogenic aggregates metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were used to analyze bacterial and archaeal species in total the number of contigs and predicted genes from merged metagenomic and metatranscriptomic results of aggregates are summarized in table s1 microbial community compositions of aggregates at the genus level indicated that both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic libraries were dominated by desulfovibrio 55 4 71 0 geobacter 12 6 3 6 and methanobacterium 5 1 3 1 fig 2 a and b both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic de novo assembly and binning revealed 16 genomic bins including those of 12 bacteria and 4 archaea completeness 14 bins 80 and 2 bins in the range of 40 70 table s2 phylogenetic analysis showed that the bacterial genomic bins including three i e b1 b4 and b13 and two i e b7 and b10 bins belonged to deltaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria respectively of these proteobacteria genomic bins b1 b4 b13 b7 and b10 were related to the genera desulfovibrio geobacter thiobacillus and simplicispira respectively other bacterial genomic bins such as b2 b5 b6 b8 b9 and b14 belonged to firmicutes and were related to firmicutes bacteria ruminiclostridium clostridia bacterium catabacter and christensenellaceae bacterium respectively furthermore b11 belonged to phycisphaerales bacterium in the planctomycetes fig 2c fig s1 and table s2 in addition for archaeal genomic bins belonging to euryarchaeota b3 and b12 were related to methanobacterium and b15 and b16 were related to methanosphaerula and methanosarcina respectively fig 2c fig s1 and table s2 therefore bin b1 desulfovibrio might be the greatest contributor to the community functions because it exhibited the highest transcript abundance and activity in methanogenic aggregates and its participation in iet with methanogens such as bin b3 b12 methanobacterium also seemed feasible 3 4 functions of desulfovibrio and methanobacterium revealed by metatranscriptomic analysis in the aggregate community gene annotation by metatranscriptomic analysis suggested that bin b1 desulfovibrio sp oxidizes ethanol and possibly transfers electrons to electron accepting partners within the aggregates genes that encode alcohol dehydrogenase adh aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase aor and nadh dehydrogenase ndh rotaru et al 2014b fig 3 b and table s5 were highly expressed in bacterial b1 desulfovibrio sp and b2 genomes furthermore a total of 2 046 cytochrome transcripts were assigned to b1 desulfovibrio sp accounting for 76 7 of the 16 bins fig 3a and table s3 for example class iii cytochrome c family protein cytochrome c554 c type cytochrome biogenesis protein cytochrome d and o ubiquinol oxidase were highly abundant in the b1 genomic bin of desulfovibrio sp in addition pili genes for pilus assembly proteins were highly expressed by b1 desulfovibrio sp a total of 2 469 pili transcripts including flp pilus assembly protein tadg pilz pseudopilin pulg pilb msha pilin protein msha and pilt were also assigned to b1 desulfovibrio sp fig 3a and table s4 these observations of high expression of cytochrome and pilus genes in b1 desulfovibrio sp suggested that they might play a potentially important role in iet in aggregates studies have suggested that geobacter species the only bacteria known to donate electrons to methanogens via diet holmes et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b wang et al 2016 require electrically conductive pili e pili and outer membrane c type cytochromes to participate in diet however geobacter related b4 b13 genomic bins did not highly express the well studied cytochromes used by geobacter species for iet such as omcb omce omcs omct and ppca shrestha et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 metatranscriptomic data showed that moderate expression of cytochrome c oxidase and pilz or pilb was detected in the geobacter related b4 genomic bin table s3 and s4 moreover a structural component of e pili the type iv pilus assembly protein pila tan et al 2017 was slightly expressed in the b5 and b6 genomes table s4 and its function needs identification in total 2 747 transcripts of genes encoded flagellar components that were also highly expressed in b1 desulfovibrio sp cells such as flagellar basal body rod protein flgc flagellar hook protein flge flagellar flil protein flagellar basal body rod protein flgg flagellar hook associated protein 2 and flagellar basal body rod protein flgb fig 3a and table s4 previous studies reported that flagella were specifically expressed in geobacter species grown on insoluble fe iii or mn iv oxide by chemotaxis childers et al 2002 tremblay et al 2012 zheng et al 2018 and were important for aggregate formation in geobacter cocultures shrestha et al 2013 a recent study reported that flagella in geobacter biofilms enhanced current generation by increasing biofilm thickness and facilitated extracellular electron transfer in electroactive biofilms liu et al 2019 though flagella were previously shown to be nonconductive sure et al 2016 however flagella associated gene transcripts were not highly expressed in the geobacter related b4 b13 genomic bins therefore the high expression of flagella in b1 desulfovibrio sp cells by metatranscriptomic analysis suggested that in addition to the widely addressed cytochromes and pili the role of flagella cannot be neglected and further work is reconsidered the bin b1 desulfovibrio sp also exhibited the capability to produce formate and hydrogen fig 3b and table s5 genes that code for formate dehydrogenase were highly expressed from the b1 desulfovibrio sp genome suggesting that formate cycling might occur meanwhile transcripts of gene sets encoding hydrogenases such as the nadp reducing hydrogenase hnda d de luca et al 1998 hydrogenase protein hypa f zheng et al 2018 energy conserving hydrogenase echa f for reducing ferredoxin pereira et al 2008 heterodisulfide reductase hdra c shrestha et al 2013 and ni fe hydrogenase hybb shrestha et al 2013 which might function in h2 metabolism were all expressed from the b1 desulfovibrio sp genome these results indicated that formate and h2 could not be ruled out as important electron carriers in aggregates genes involved in methanogenesis were analyzed by metatranscriptomic data to evaluate whether methanogens b3 b12 b15 and b16 were metabolically active in methanogenic aggregates fig 3b and table s5 a gene for formate dehydrogenase in b3 b12 methanobacterium sp genome showed expression during the growth of aggregates indicating that co2 could be produced no membrane bound h2 uptake nife hydrogenase hyb genes were expressed in methanogenic genomes and the gene set hyp which might function in h2 metabolism had low expression levels indicating that hydrogen might not be an electron donor for methanogenesis in the aggregates genes associated with acetyl coa synthetase acs and the acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase complex cdh which catalyze acetyl coa chemistry were more highly expressed in bin b3 methanobacterium sp than in bin b16 methanosarcina sp furthermore genes coding for enzymes involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane fmd ftr mch mtd frh mer mtr hdr and mcr were highly expressed from the b3 methanobacterium sp genome in addition the bin b3 methanobacterium sp also expressed genes coding for ech hydrogenases echa b f420 non reducing hydrogenases mvhadg and heterodisulfide reductases hdrabc which were reported to be associated with the reduction of ferredoxin in methanogens that grow on h2 co2 kaster et al 2011 meuer et al 2002 the generated reduced ferredoxin is required for the first step in carbon dioxide reduction to methane in b3 methanobacterium sp however further analysis will be required to identify the pathway for the generation of reduced ferredoxin in the absence of h2 genes for the carbon dioxide reduction step in methanogenesis in the b16 methanosarcina sp genome were not all or highly expressed which suggested that methanosarcina did not accept electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide table s5 therefore one possible hypothesis was that the bin b3 methanobacterium sp as electron accepting partners accepted electrons from electron donating b1 desulfovibrio sp for methane production in the complex microbial community fig 3b 3 5 syntrophic growth in cocultures of desulfovibrio and methanobacterium to determine the possibility that methanobacterium accepted electrons from desulfovibrio for carbon dioxide reduction in iet roll tubes were used to attempt to isolate strains from aggregates produced with ethanol as the sole substrate and sulfate as the electron acceptor the isolate obtained designated strain jy was vibrio shaped or sigmoid 3 0 5 0 μm x 0 4 1 μm and did not possess a flagellum as shown by tem fig 4 a strain jy metabolized ethanol to acetate with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide suggesting the following equation 2 ch3ch2oh so4 2 2ch3cooh s2 2h2o upplementary fig s3a and b analysis of its complete genome sequence 4 686 982 bp fig 4b revealed ani values of 97 36 and 90 79 respectively with the genome sequences of b1 desulfovibrio sp and desulfovibrio fructosivorans strain jj which was isolated from wastewater parks et al 2017 the results suggested that the obtained strain jy was the same strain as b1 desulfovibrio sp in the aggregates as described above mfcs were constructed to evaluate the electrochemical activity of strain jy chronoamperometric profiles were obtained during a total culture time of 140 h fig 4c the strain showed a rapid increase in electrical activity as a result of microbial ethanol oxidation the maximum current density was 208 93 ma m 2 which was achieved at 12 17 h and was followed by a decrease in current production no significant current density was observed in the ca analysis of the strain cells with a dialysis bag and the control medium after the current density reached its lowest point after 140 h a cyclic voltammogram of the strain was recorded at 10 mv s 1 it showed three major redox systems and the oxidation reduction peaks were centered at approximately 0 1 v 0 06 v and 0 13 v vs ag agcl while no significant oxidation or reduction peaks were observed in the cv analysis of the strain cells with a dialysis bag and the control medium fig 4d therefore these data indicated that strain jy had extracellular electron transfer capability and transferred electrons to electrodes via direct electron transfer to verify that desulfovibrio strain jy was capable of participating in diet with a methanogen desulfovibrio strain jy was cocultured with m harundinacea strain 6ac which does not metabolize h2 or formate ma et al 2006 this rules out the possibility of electron transfer via hfit desulfovibrio strain jy and m harundinacea grew in coculture by converting ethanol mean standard deviation 525 7 μmol n 3 to methane 397 10 μmol with the production of acetate 306 55 μmol via the following reactions fig 5 a 1 desulfovibrio strain jy metabolized ethanol to produce acetate and release electrons 2ch3ch2oh 2h2o 2ch3cooh 8h 8e 2 m harundinacea first utilized electrons for methane production co2 8e 8h ch4 2h2o and then 3 also utilized acetate produced from ethanol to generate methane and co2 or biomass ch3cooh ch4 co2 this is consistent with previously described findings that m harundinacea can accept electrons from g metallireducens for carbon dioxide reduction via diet rotaru et al 2014b these results indicated that desulfovibrio strain jy was capable of participating in diet with methanogens based on the above results it was hypothesized that desulfovibrio strain jy aggregates directly donate electrons to methanobacterium desulfovibrio strain jy was cocultured with methanobacterium strain ysl which had also been isolated from methanogenic aggregates but was incapable of using h2 as an electron donor for methane production zheng et al 2020b it was further shown that methanobacterium strain ysl was most similar to b3 methanobacterium sp with an ani value of 99 3 based on the complete genome sequence 2 509 437 bp fig s2 the coculture metabolized ethanol to methane with the accumulation of acetate fig 5b no formate detection limit 10 µmol l 1 or h2 detection limit 1 µmol l 1 was detected in the cocultures of desulfovibrio strain jy and methanobacterium strain ysl fig s3c however these results may be different from those of a previous report that the activity of mixed cultures containing primarily desulfovibrio vulgaris and methanobacterium formicicum was mediated via hfit thiele and zeikus 1988 in cocultures after three transfers ethanol consumption mean standard deviation 461 23 μmol n 3 was accompanied by the production of 190 10 μmol of methane and 438 11 μmol of acetate considering that some carbon and energy must be diverted to produce biomass this stoichiometry was close to the expected stoichiometry for ethanol metabolism to acetate and methane as the only products 2 ch3ch2oh co2 2 ch3cooh ch4 these results suggested that methanobacterium strain ysl directly accepted electrons from desulfovibrio strain jy for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane aggregates formed in the coculture fig 5c were similar in size to previously described aggregates that formed in cocultures of g metallireducens and methanobacterium strain ysl participating in diet the vibrios of desulfovibrio strain jy and rods of methanobacterium strain ysl were well intermixed fig 5d and the two species established contact through flagella on the cells of desulfovibrio strain jy fig 5d and e this finding suggested that the expression of flagella by the desulfovibrio strain jy may facilitate electron transfer in cocultures consistent with the high expression of flagella associated genes in b1 desulfovibrio sp cells in methanogenic aggregates fig 3a therefore more detailed experiments on the genetic manipulation of functional genes of both strains are required to further determine the contribution of diet to iet in cocultures 4 conclusion the results provide evidence that iet may be an operative strategy for microbial syntrophic relationships in conductive methanogenic aggregates metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data suggested that methanobacterium species actively accepted electrons from electron donating desulfovibrio species which were the most abundant metabolically active species in aggregates and had a high transcript abundance of genes encoding cytochromes pili and flagella thus the potential for iet between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium species was further considered desulfovibrio strain jy isolated from the aggregates was capable of donating electrons to electrodes or methanothrix harundinacea via direct electron transfer however unlike g metallireducens strain jy was determined to have neither outer surface cytochromes nor e pili from an analysis of the complete genome sequence it seems that desulfovibrio strain jy might perform iet by a new mechanism as a possibility the role of flagella in iet was considered in previous pure coculture studies the methanobacterium strain ysl isolated from the same aggregates directly accepted electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane by participating in diet zheng et al 2020b suggesting that methanobacterium accepts electrons from desulfovibrio in conductive methanogenic aggregates studies have indicated that membrane bound cytochromes in methanosarcinales such as methanothrix and methanosarcina could play a potential role in diet rotaru et al 2014a similarly a gene in the methanobacterium strain ysl genome was annotated as a cytochrome c type biogenesis protein with transmembrane regions thus these two isolates from aggregates may be ideal candidates for further functional analysis of iet mechanisms in conductive methanogenic aggregates supplementary information fig s1 maximum likelihood phylogeny of ribosomal proteins l2 3 4 5 6 14 15 18 22 and 24 and s3 8 10 17 and 19 showing the placement of 12 bacterial

16823,geobacter as a typical electroactive microorganism is the engine of interspecies electron transfer iet between microorganisms however it does not have a dominant position in all natural environments it is not known what performs a similar function as geobacter in coastal zones metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that desulfovibrio and methanobacterium species were the most abundant in electrochemically active aggregates metatranscriptomic analysis showed that desulfovibrio species highly expressed genes for ethanol metabolism and extracellular electron transfer involving cytochromes pili and flagella methanobacterium species in the aggregates also expressed genes for enzymes involved in reducing carbon dioxide to methane pure cultures demonstrated that the isolated desulfovibrio sp strain jy contributed to aggregate conductivity and directly transferred electrons to methanothrix harundinacea which is unable to use h2 or formate most importantly further coculture studies indicated that methanobacterium strain ysl might directly accept electrons from the desulfovibrio strain jy for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the aggregate this finding suggested that the possibility of diet by desulfovibrio similar to geobacter species in conductive methanogenic aggregates can not be excluded graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords desulfovibrio methanobacterium direct interspecies electron transfer methanogenic aggregates coastal zones 1 introduction microbial biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms that dominate microbial lifestyles and they have various applications in medicine environmental protection biomaterials and contamination treatment flemming and wuertz 2019 vert et al 2012 biofilms are complex they consist of extracellular polymeric substances eps that are self produced by microbial cells the eps usually contains polysaccharides proteins and extracellular dna which perform different functions flemming and wingender 2010 multicellular aggregates that are enclosed in eps form a unique form of biofilms for various ecological reasons such as nutrient stress claessen et al 2014 among these aggregates electrochemically active biofilms eabs can be electrically conductive and have potential applications in bioenergy chemical production and pollutant degradation in which electroactive microorganisms eams play an important role in enabling efficient electron transfer for producing high power densities babauta et al 2012 borole et al 2011 logan et al 2019 the eab aggregation not only shortens the distances between syntrophic microorganisms but also develops more effective metabolic mechanisms that improve interactions between cells among them direct interspecies electron transfer diet an alternative to h2 formate interspecies transfer hfit is more efficient in establishing syntrophic communities in various environments li et al 2017 lovley 2017a 2017b however the reason for better elucidating the importance of the diet mechanism is to obtain comprehensive information on functional communities in microbial aggregates stams and plugge 2009 van steendam et al 2019 geobacter as a typical eam is the engine of iet between microorganisms lovley 2017b reguera and kashefi 2019 the initial discovery of this role showed that aggregates formed by geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens were electrically conductive demonstrating that electrons released by g metallireducens could flow to g sulfurreducens via diet summers et al 2010 diet as an important process for iet was discovered in multispecies aggregates from a brewery wastewater digester in which geobacter and methanothrix species predominated further analysis demonstrated that the aggregate conductivity had a correlation with the abundance of geobacter species morita et al 2011 research efforts reported that highly conductive aggregates formed in cocultures of g metallireducens with either g sulfurreducens or m harundinacea methanosarcina barkeri had special extracellular agents such as electrically conductive pili e pili and cytochromes which could establish biological electrical connections for transferring electrons rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b shrestha et al 2013 subsequent studies demonstrated that the electrical connection could be replaced or enhanced by conductive materials in defined cocultures of g metallireducens g sulfurreducens or g metallireducens m barkeri in the laboratory chen et al 2014a chen et al 2014b liu et al 2012 2015 rotaru et al 2014a zheng et al 2020a zheng et al 2018 furthermore the findings documented that geobacter species were the most metabolically active bacteria in methanogenic rice paddy soils holmes et al 2017 hori et al 2010 metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that geobacter species participate in diet and provide electrons through e pili to methanothrix species for carbon dioxide reduction holmes et al 2017 in addition our research discovered that the first methanogen outside the family methanosarcinales a strain of methanobacterium that was isolated from coastal riverine sediments was capable of diet in cocultures with g metallireducens zheng et al 2020b current reports have indicated that geobacter species such as eams are the most well studied electron donating bacteria that can achieve diet with methanogens in methanogenic systems however geobacter does not have a dominant position in coastal zones instead other potential electron donating bacteria such as pseudomonas clostridium bacillus and desulfovibrio dominate in in situ sediments and enrichment cultures xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 the identity of the microbe that performs a similar function as geobacter in these natural environments is not yet known methanogenic aggregates formed by methanogens and their syntrophic partners are widely used in the conversion of organic matter to methane in anaerobic digestion systems wang et al 2016 moreover the findings indicated that diet within methanogenic aggregates is an important mechanism for iet in the process of methanogenesis morita et al 2011 li et al 2017 in addition conductive methanogenic aggregates has been identified to facilitate the establishment of electronic connections between eams and methanogens li et al 2017 our previous study has established the enrichment systems facilitated the growth of microorganisms participating in diet from coastal riverine sediments in this syntrophic co culture system methanogenic aggregates were formed in the enrichment cultures by transforming ethanol to methane and eams and methanogens appeared to participate diet zheng et al 2015 methanobacterium strain ysl grows via diet in defined cocultures with g metallireducens zheng et al 2020b it is not known what performs a similar function as geobacter in coastal zones therefore to investigate eams and methanogens in the aggregates responsible for iet and understand their roles in iet metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were used as diagnostic tools to investigate the actively dominating community structures furthermore pure culture techniques were employed to evaluate the potential for iet between eams and methanogens here we show the new possibility of diet between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium species might indicate an important strategy for electron exchange in natural methanogenic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of methanogenic aggregates and desulfovibrio sp jy isolation as previously described zheng et al 2015 methanogenic aggregates were formed in dsm 120 with 20 mmol l 1 ethanol as the electron donor by two step cultivation of coastal riverine sediments fig 1 a the medium for isolation of strain jy was anaerobic nutrient basal nb medium with ethanol as the electron donor and sulfate as the electron acceptor the medium included 0 04 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 1 g l 1 mgso4 7 h2o 1 8 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 na2co3 h2o 1 0 ml of na2seo4 1 mmol l 1 10 ml of 100 nb salt mix solution 10 ml of nb mineral elixir solution and 10 ml of filter sterilized vitamin solution the medium was distributed to anaerobic tubes under an oxygen free gas mixture of n2 co2 80 20 the tubes were sealed and autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min ethanol 20 mmol l 1 as the electron donor was added to nb medium before inoculation incubations were at 30 c methanogenic aggregates were serially diluted 10 inoculum in nb medium the highest dilution of aggregates was transferred into liquid medium amended with 2 0 agar and subjected to the hungate roll tube technique colonies were visible after 2 weeks individual colonies were picked with a disposable sterilized needle in a coy anaerobic chamber and transferred into anaerobic tubes containing 10 ml of liquid medium further purification was needed using the same method several times after one week of culture 0 5 mmol l 1 fe2 ammonium iron ii sulfate was added to 0 2 ml of pure cultures in nb medium to detect black precipitates and determine the reduction of sulfate to sulfide 2 2 microscopy the methanogenic aggregate was examined

electrochemical analysis of aggregates and isolated desulfovibrio sp jy the electrochemical methods used in this study such as ca and cv were as previously described zheng et al 2017 when the electrochemical analysis of aggregates was conducted the anode chamber was filled with 100 ml of modified dsm120 anaerobic medium ph 7 0 and the cathode was filled with the same volume of 100 mmol l 1 tris hcl buffer solution at ph 7 0 alternatively isolated desulfovibrio sp jy was inoculated into the anode chamber which was filled with anaerobic nb medium ph 7 0 and the cathode was filled with 50 mmol l 1 potassium ferricyanide buffer solution for higher detection sensitivity ethanol 20 mmol l 1 was used as the electron donor in the anaerobic medium of anode chambers and all the electron acceptors and electron shuttles were omitted methanogenic aggregates or isolated desulfovibrio sp jy cells 10 inoculum in exponential growth phase were introduced into the anode chamber filled with anaerobic medium to culture biofilms on the surface of the electrode 20 of the medium in anode chambers was anaerobically replaced with fresh anaerobic medium every ten days the anode was covered by a dialysis bag mwco 8000 14000 d flat width 4 4 cm solarbio china and cell suspensions were added into the anodic chamber outside the dialysis bag to prevent the attachment of cells to the anode li et al 2015 anaerobic medium without cells was used as the negative control after swapping two times during biofilm development current time data from a digital multimeter were collected and the cv peaks

sequencing using a hiseq2000 system illumina 2 6 de novo metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assembly and gene annotation all of the raw sequencing metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads of aggregates were quality checked with fastqc andrews 2014 http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc initial raw nonfiltered metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing libraries contained an average of 7 142 930 and 6 085 770 reads that were 150 bp long with insert sizes of 300 bp to obtain a clean read dataset of high quality raw sequences from the two libraries were trimmed and filtered using a custom perl script that removed reads with a significant excess of n deleted duplicated reads generated by pcr amplification cut bases from the start and end of reads of low quality and eliminated reads smaller than 50 bp then 6 721 490 and 5 458 930 quality reads were obtained from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing libraries respectively to obtain high quality contigs quality control was performed and paired end metagenomic reads were assembled using idba ud peng et al 2012 in addition de novo transcriptome assembly was conducted for the high

left after the removal of contigs duplicated from multiple assemblies by cd hit algorithms li and godzik 2006 were further assembled based on their overlap using minimus2 with a minimum percentage cutoff of 99 from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies produced using multiple k mer assemblies mason et al 2012 binning of assembled metagenomic sequences was performed using a combination of tetranucleotide frequencies contig coverage and gc content in emergent self organizing maps esom dick et al 2009 and maxbin 2 2 1 wu et al 2014 with default parameters genome completeness and contamination were estimated using checkm parks et al 2015 which uses lineage specific single copy marker genes organized into collocated marker sets to provide robust estimates

trimmed with trimal with gappyout flags capella gutierrez et al 2009 phylogenetic analysis of rp was inferred by raxml stamatakis 2014 implemented by the cipres science gateway under the lg plus gamma model of evolution protgammalg in the raxml model section and with the number of bootstraps automatically determined automre phylogenetic trees were visualized with figtree http tree bio ed ac uk software figtree 2 8 genome sequencing assembly and annotation and phylogenetic analysis of the isolate the qualified genomic dna of the isolate was fragmented by a 26g needle and fragments larger than 20 kb were selected using bluepippin after end repair a tail and sequencing adapter ligation of fragments were performed and a quantified dna library was prepared for whole genome sequencing with the pacbio sequel platform raw data were qualified and assembled with mecat2 to obtain a chromosome with a length of 4 686 982 bp and the g c content of the isolate dna was 63 89 mol a total of 4 648

cog go and pfam databases the optimal blast result was obtained based on the identity e value and score by using blast and diamond against the above databases the average nucleotide identity ani value was used to identify species that share 95 dna identity among the available genomes yoon et al 2017 phylogenetic analysis of the strains of desulfovibrio and methanobacterium was performed using concatenations of 120 bacteria specific and 122 archaea specific protein markers respectively and the methods were performed as previously described parks et al 2018 2 9 cocultures of desulfovibrio sp strain jy and methanothrix harundinacea or methanobacterium sp strain ysl methanothrix harundinacea strain 6ac jcm 13211 ma et al 2006 was obtained from prof xiuzhu dong s laboratory culture collection at the institute of microbiology chinese academy of sciences wild type methanobacterium sp strain ysl was isolated from methanogenic aggregates as previously described zheng et al 2020b cocultures of the desulfovibrio sp strain jy and m harundinacea strain 6ac or methanobacterium sp strain ysl were established in dsm120 as previously described rotaru et al 2014a with 10 mmol l 1 ethanol as the electron donor but the electron acceptor sulfate was omitted both sulfide and cysteine were also tested and they were required as sulfur sources for methanogens in long term cocultures rotaru et al 2014a before the establishment of the cocultures desulfovibrio sp strain jy was grown in liquid medium with 20 mmol l 1 ethanol as the electron donor and 2 5 mmol l 1 sulfate as the electron acceptor m harundinacea strain 6ac and methanobacterium sp strain ysl was grown in liquid ms medium with 20 mmol l 1 acetate and 40 mmol l 1 formate as its substrate the individual cultures were grown until sulfate desulfovibrio sp strain jy acetate m harundinacea strain 6ac or formate methanobacterium sp strain ysl was consumed cocultures were initiated with a 10 inoculum of each partner into 40 ml of dsm120 in triplicate cocultured incubations were performed at 30 c but 37 c was better for cocultures of desulfovibrio sp strain jy and m harundinacea strain 6ac 2 10 data availability the metagenomics and metatranscriptomics sequence reads have been deposited in the sequence read archive at the national center for biotechnology information under accession nos srr5801693 and srr5801692 respectively the complete genome sequences of desulfovibrio sp strain jy and methanobacterium sp strain ysl have been deposited in elmsg https www biosino org elmsg index under accession nos lmsg g000000180 1 and lmsg g000000181 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the aggregates methanogenic aggregates were obtained from enrichments with ethanol as the electron donor by two step cultivation of riverine sediments they formed different sizes diameters 20 μm of tightly packed black aggregates fig 1a autofluorescence characteristics of methanogens were confirmed in the coculture aggregates and rod and coccus shaped cells released natural autofluorescence fig 1b fluorescence in situ hybridization fish showed that some bacterial and methanogenic cells had overlapping distributions within aggregates fig 1c the morphological characteristics of aggregate cells were visualized using scanning electron microscopy sem which showed that cells were in close physical contact and intertwined fig 1d these general characteristics of aggregates were similar to those of previously observed aggregates formed in methanogenic wastewater or cocultures of geobacter species and methanogens morita et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014a 3 2 electrochemical activity of aggregates based on the structural characteristics of aggregates microbial fuel cells mfcs were constructed to confirm the electrochemical activity of the aggregates through chronoamperometry ca and cyclic voltammetry cv badalamenti et al 2013 strycharz et al 2011 the current density over time approximately 9 6 days and voltammograms of aggregate suspensions with or without dialysis were monitored aggregate suspensions without dialysis showed a short lag of 1 5 days in current production which was followed by a rapid increase in electrical activity as a result of microbial ethanol oxidation the maximum current density was achieved during the culture time at 3 5 days the highest peak was approximately 14 34 ma m 2 and it was followed by a decrease in current production due to depletion of the electron donor however aggregate suspension with a dialysis bag prevented cells from directly contacting the electrode and generated a lower current density than that without a dialysis bag and the maximum current peak was approximately 5 29 ma m 2 at 2 3 days no significant current density was observed in the ca of the control medium fig 1e after the current density was near zero cyclic voltammograms of aggregates were recorded they showed two major redox systems and the oxidation reduction peaks were centered at approximately 0 072 v and 0 12 v vs ag agcl similarly aggregates with dialysis had two oxidation reduction peaks centered at approximately 0 138 and 0 104 v vs ag agcl no significant oxidation or reduction peak was observed in the cv of the control medium at a scan rate of 50 mv s 1 fig 1f thus higher current density and redox peak current 12 2 ma vs 9 27 ma 13 5 ma vs 8 26 ma were generated by aggregate suspensions without a dialysis bag than by suspensions with a dialysis bag suggesting that aggregate cells were involved in the electrogenic activity a majority of electrons could transfer via direct contact of the aggregate biofilm attached to the anode surface and that a small portion of electrons could also be transported via unknown soluble electron carriers this complex iet mode has been reported in geobacter coculture aggregates however secreted soluble electron carriers made only a minor contribution to iet in geobacter diet co culture huang et al 2020 based on these results it indicated that different iet and diet mechanisms might coexist in aggregate biofilms where eams producing current played an important role in iet 3 3 microbial community composition in aggregates by metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to further investigate the microbial community components participating in iet in methanogenic aggregates metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were used to analyze bacterial and archaeal species in total the number of contigs and predicted genes from merged metagenomic and metatranscriptomic results of aggregates are summarized in table s1 microbial community compositions of aggregates at the genus level indicated that both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic libraries were dominated by desulfovibrio 55 4 71 0 geobacter 12 6 3 6 and methanobacterium 5 1 3 1 fig 2 a and b both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic de novo assembly and binning revealed 16 genomic bins including those of 12 bacteria and 4 archaea completeness 14 bins 80 and 2 bins in the range of 40 70 table s2 phylogenetic analysis showed that the bacterial genomic bins including three i e b1 b4 and b13 and two i e b7 and b10 bins belonged to deltaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria respectively of these proteobacteria genomic bins b1 b4 b13 b7 and b10 were related to the genera desulfovibrio geobacter thiobacillus and simplicispira respectively other bacterial genomic bins such as b2 b5 b6 b8 b9 and b14 belonged to firmicutes and were related to firmicutes bacteria ruminiclostridium clostridia bacterium catabacter and christensenellaceae bacterium respectively furthermore b11 belonged to phycisphaerales bacterium in the planctomycetes fig 2c fig s1 and table s2 in addition for archaeal genomic bins belonging to euryarchaeota b3 and b12 were related to methanobacterium and b15 and b16 were related to methanosphaerula and methanosarcina respectively fig 2c fig s1 and table s2 therefore bin b1 desulfovibrio might be the greatest contributor to the community functions because it exhibited the highest transcript abundance and activity in methanogenic aggregates and its participation in iet with methanogens such as bin b3 b12 methanobacterium also seemed feasible 3 4 functions of desulfovibrio and methanobacterium revealed by metatranscriptomic analysis in the aggregate community gene annotation by metatranscriptomic analysis suggested that bin b1 desulfovibrio sp oxidizes ethanol and possibly transfers electrons to electron accepting partners within the aggregates genes that encode alcohol dehydrogenase adh aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase aor and nadh dehydrogenase ndh rotaru et al 2014b fig 3 b and table s5 were highly expressed in bacterial b1 desulfovibrio sp and b2 genomes furthermore a total of 2 046 cytochrome transcripts were assigned to b1 desulfovibrio sp accounting for 76 7 of the 16 bins fig 3a and table s3 for example class iii cytochrome c family protein cytochrome c554 c type cytochrome biogenesis protein cytochrome d and o ubiquinol oxidase were highly abundant in the b1 genomic bin of desulfovibrio sp in addition pili genes for pilus assembly proteins were highly expressed by b1 desulfovibrio sp a total of 2 469 pili transcripts including flp pilus assembly protein tadg pilz pseudopilin pulg pilb msha pilin protein msha and pilt were also assigned to b1 desulfovibrio sp fig 3a and table s4 these observations of high expression of cytochrome and pilus genes in b1 desulfovibrio sp suggested that they might play a potentially important role in iet in aggregates studies have suggested that geobacter species the only bacteria known to donate electrons to methanogens via diet holmes et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b wang et al 2016 require electrically conductive pili e pili and outer membrane c type cytochromes to participate in diet however geobacter related b4 b13 genomic bins did not highly express the well studied cytochromes used by geobacter species for iet such as omcb omce omcs omct and ppca shrestha et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 metatranscriptomic data showed that moderate expression of cytochrome c oxidase and pilz or pilb was detected in the geobacter related b4 genomic bin table s3 and s4 moreover a structural component of e pili the type iv pilus assembly protein pila tan et al 2017 was slightly expressed in the b5 and b6 genomes table s4 and its function needs identification in total 2 747 transcripts of genes encoded flagellar components that were also highly expressed in b1 desulfovibrio sp cells such as flagellar basal body rod protein flgc flagellar hook protein flge flagellar flil protein flagellar basal body rod protein flgg flagellar hook associated protein 2 and flagellar basal body rod protein flgb fig 3a and table s4 previous studies reported that flagella were specifically expressed in geobacter species grown on insoluble fe iii or mn iv oxide by chemotaxis childers et al 2002 tremblay et al 2012 zheng et al 2018 and were important for aggregate formation in geobacter cocultures shrestha et al 2013 a recent study reported that flagella in geobacter biofilms enhanced current generation by increasing biofilm thickness and facilitated extracellular electron transfer in electroactive biofilms liu et al 2019 though flagella were previously shown to be nonconductive sure et al 2016 however flagella associated gene transcripts were not highly expressed in the geobacter related b4 b13 genomic bins therefore the high expression of flagella in b1 desulfovibrio sp cells by metatranscriptomic analysis suggested that in addition to the widely addressed cytochromes and pili the role of flagella cannot be neglected and further work is reconsidered the bin b1 desulfovibrio sp also exhibited the capability to produce formate and hydrogen fig 3b and table s5 genes that code for formate dehydrogenase were highly expressed from the b1 desulfovibrio sp genome suggesting that formate cycling might occur meanwhile transcripts of gene sets encoding hydrogenases such as the nadp reducing hydrogenase hnda d de luca et al 1998 hydrogenase protein hypa f zheng et al 2018 energy conserving hydrogenase echa f for reducing ferredoxin pereira et al 2008 heterodisulfide reductase hdra c shrestha et al 2013 and ni fe hydrogenase hybb shrestha et al 2013 which might function in h2 metabolism were all expressed from the b1 desulfovibrio sp genome these results indicated that formate and h2 could not be ruled out as important electron carriers in aggregates genes involved in methanogenesis were analyzed by metatranscriptomic data to evaluate whether methanogens b3 b12 b15 and b16 were metabolically active in methanogenic aggregates fig 3b and table s5 a gene for formate dehydrogenase in b3 b12 methanobacterium sp genome showed expression during the growth of aggregates indicating that co2 could be produced no membrane bound h2 uptake nife hydrogenase hyb genes were expressed in methanogenic genomes and the gene set hyp which might function in h2 metabolism had low expression levels indicating that hydrogen might not be an electron donor for methanogenesis in the aggregates genes associated with acetyl coa synthetase acs and the acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase complex cdh which catalyze acetyl coa chemistry were more highly expressed in bin b3 methanobacterium sp than in bin b16 methanosarcina sp furthermore genes coding for enzymes involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane fmd ftr mch mtd frh mer mtr hdr and mcr were highly expressed from the b3 methanobacterium sp genome in addition the bin b3 methanobacterium sp also expressed genes coding for ech hydrogenases echa b f420 non reducing hydrogenases mvhadg and heterodisulfide reductases hdrabc which were reported to be associated with the reduction of ferredoxin in methanogens that grow on h2 co2 kaster et al 2011 meuer et al 2002 the generated reduced ferredoxin is required for the first step in carbon dioxide reduction to methane in b3 methanobacterium sp however further analysis will be required to identify the pathway for the generation of reduced ferredoxin in the absence of h2 genes for the carbon dioxide reduction step in methanogenesis in the b16 methanosarcina sp genome were not all or highly expressed which suggested that methanosarcina did not accept electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide table s5 therefore one possible hypothesis was that the bin b3 methanobacterium sp as electron accepting partners accepted electrons from electron donating b1 desulfovibrio sp for methane production in the complex microbial community fig 3b 3 5 syntrophic growth in cocultures of desulfovibrio and methanobacterium to determine the possibility that methanobacterium accepted electrons from desulfovibrio for carbon dioxide reduction in iet roll tubes were used to attempt to isolate strains from aggregates produced with ethanol as the sole substrate and sulfate as the electron acceptor the isolate obtained designated strain jy was vibrio shaped or sigmoid 3 0 5 0 μm x 0 4 1 μm and did not possess a flagellum as shown by tem fig 4 a strain jy metabolized ethanol to acetate with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide suggesting the following equation 2 ch3ch2oh so4 2 2ch3cooh s2 2h2o upplementary fig s3a and b analysis of its complete genome sequence 4 686 982 bp fig 4b revealed ani values of 97 36 and 90 79 respectively with the genome sequences of b1 desulfovibrio sp and desulfovibrio fructosivorans strain jj which was isolated from wastewater parks et al 2017 the results suggested that the obtained strain jy was the same strain as b1 desulfovibrio sp in the aggregates as described above mfcs were constructed to evaluate the electrochemical activity of strain jy chronoamperometric profiles were obtained during a total culture time of 140 h fig 4c the strain showed a rapid increase in electrical activity as a result of microbial ethanol oxidation the maximum current density was 208 93 ma m 2 which was achieved at 12 17 h and was followed by a decrease in current production no significant current density was observed in the ca analysis of the strain cells with a dialysis bag and the control medium after the current density reached its lowest point after 140 h a cyclic voltammogram of the strain was recorded at 10 mv s 1 it showed three major redox systems and the oxidation reduction peaks were centered at approximately 0 1 v 0 06 v and 0 13 v vs ag agcl while no significant oxidation or reduction peaks were observed in the cv analysis of the strain cells with a dialysis bag and the control medium fig 4d therefore these data indicated that strain jy had extracellular electron transfer capability and transferred electrons to electrodes via direct electron transfer to verify that desulfovibrio strain jy was capable of participating in diet with a methanogen desulfovibrio strain jy was cocultured with m harundinacea strain 6ac which does not metabolize h2 or formate ma et al 2006 this rules out the possibility of electron transfer via hfit desulfovibrio strain jy and m harundinacea grew in coculture by converting ethanol mean standard deviation 525 7 μmol n 3 to methane 397 10 μmol with the production of acetate 306 55 μmol via the following reactions fig 5 a 1 desulfovibrio strain jy metabolized ethanol to produce acetate and release electrons 2ch3ch2oh 2h2o 2ch3cooh 8h 8e 2 m harundinacea first utilized electrons for methane production co2 8e 8h ch4 2h2o and then 3 also utilized acetate produced from ethanol to generate methane and co2 or biomass ch3cooh ch4 co2 this is consistent with previously described findings that m harundinacea can accept electrons from g metallireducens for carbon dioxide reduction via diet rotaru et al 2014b these results indicated that desulfovibrio strain jy was capable of participating in diet with methanogens based on the above results it was hypothesized that desulfovibrio strain jy aggregates directly donate electrons to methanobacterium desulfovibrio strain jy was cocultured with methanobacterium strain ysl which had also been isolated from methanogenic aggregates but was incapable of using h2 as an electron donor for methane production zheng et al 2020b it was further shown that methanobacterium strain ysl was most similar to b3 methanobacterium sp with an ani value of 99 3 based on the complete genome sequence 2 509 437 bp fig s2 the coculture metabolized ethanol to methane with the accumulation of acetate fig 5b no formate detection limit 10 µmol l 1 or h2 detection limit 1 µmol l 1 was detected in the cocultures of desulfovibrio strain jy and methanobacterium strain ysl fig s3c however these results may be different from those of a previous report that the activity of mixed cultures containing primarily desulfovibrio vulgaris and methanobacterium formicicum was mediated via hfit thiele and zeikus 1988 in cocultures after three transfers ethanol consumption mean standard deviation 461 23 μmol n 3 was accompanied by the production of 190 10 μmol of methane and 438 11 μmol of acetate considering that some carbon and energy must be diverted to produce biomass this stoichiometry was close to the expected stoichiometry for ethanol metabolism to acetate and methane as the only products 2 ch3ch2oh co2 2 ch3cooh ch4 these results suggested that methanobacterium strain ysl directly accepted electrons from desulfovibrio strain jy for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane aggregates formed in the coculture fig 5c were similar in size to previously described aggregates that formed in cocultures of g metallireducens and methanobacterium strain ysl participating in diet the vibrios of desulfovibrio strain jy and rods of methanobacterium strain ysl were well intermixed fig 5d and the two species established contact through flagella on the cells of desulfovibrio strain jy fig 5d and e this finding suggested that the expression of flagella by the desulfovibrio strain jy may facilitate electron transfer in cocultures consistent with the high expression of flagella associated genes in b1 desulfovibrio sp cells in methanogenic aggregates fig 3a therefore more detailed experiments on the genetic manipulation of functional genes of both strains are required to further determine the contribution of diet to iet in cocultures 4 conclusion the results provide evidence that iet may be an operative strategy for microbial syntrophic relationships in conductive methanogenic aggregates metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data suggested that methanobacterium species actively accepted electrons from electron donating desulfovibrio species which were the most abundant metabolically active species in aggregates and had a high transcript abundance of genes encoding cytochromes pili and flagella thus the potential for iet between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium species was further considered desulfovibrio strain jy isolated from the aggregates was capable of donating electrons to electrodes or methanothrix harundinacea via direct electron transfer however unlike g metallireducens strain jy was determined to have neither outer surface cytochromes nor e pili from an analysis of the complete genome sequence it seems that desulfovibrio strain jy might perform iet by a new mechanism as a possibility the role of flagella in iet was considered in previous pure coculture studies the methanobacterium strain ysl isolated from the same aggregates directly accepted electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane by participating in diet zheng et al 2020b suggesting that methanobacterium accepts electrons from desulfovibrio in conductive methanogenic aggregates studies have indicated that membrane bound cytochromes in methanosarcinales such as methanothrix and methanosarcina could play a potential role in diet rotaru et al 2014a similarly a gene in the methanobacterium strain ysl genome was annotated as a cytochrome c type biogenesis protein with transmembrane regions thus these two isolates from aggregates may be ideal candidates for further functional analysis of iet mechanisms in conductive methanogenic aggregates supplementary information fig s1 maximum likelihood phylogeny of ribosomal proteins l2 3 4 5 6 14 15 18 22 and 24 and s3 8 10 17 and 19 showing the placement of 12 bacterial

pmd membrane water vapor can be generated on the membrane feed surface transported through membrane pores and condensed at permeate side to obtain freshwater thus tackling the challenge of obtaining clean water using green energy the pmd process avoids heating the entire bulk feed water and feed transportation from heat units to membrane modules which save substantial amounts of energy the interfacial localized heating intrinsically mitigates the temperature polarization across the membrane the latent heat from vapor condensation can be effectively recovered via multi level pmd configurations as great efforts have been made to exploit pmd process it is imperative to review the state of the art progress of pmd and shed light on its future trend here we briefly illustrate pmd mechanisms and membrane requirements photothermal materials feasible for developing pmd membranes along with their light to heat mechanisms this is followed by reviewing diverse approaches to prepare pmd membranes which are classified into one step fabrication and multi step modification methods comprehensive discussion about pmd membrane performance in different configurations and their small pilot scaled applications are provided the effects of operational parameters and module designs are discussed in section 6 finally the current challenges and future perspectives of pmd process are emphasized with the aim of providing guidance for future works graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords photothermal membrane distillation solar energy decentralized desalination membrane

distillation 1 introduction rapid economic development and population growth exacerbate the global water crisis ahmad et al 2020 elimelech and phillip 2011 zhang et al 2019 the 2030 agenda for sustainable development from the united nations proposes that every person should have sufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation within ten years stefan uhlenbrook 2017 however the united nations world water development report 2020 points out that 2 2 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water and 4 2 billion people 55 of the world s population are deprived of adequate sanitation facilities chen et al 2020 in addition north africa and middle east are the most water scarce regions and are characterized as below water poverty line which urgently needs effective measures to narrow the gap between water supply and demand hameed et al 2019 to address the water shortage issues various fresh water production technologies have been developed including desalination and wastewater treatment among these technologies membrane distillation md is a thermal driven membrane process using a hydrophobic membrane to separate a hot feed solution from a cold permeate on the opposite side liao et al 2014 driven by the temperature difference across the feed and permeation sides the water evaporates at the membrane surface on the feed side transports through hydrophobic membrane pores and finally condenses on the cold permeation side as freshwater rezaei et al 2018 md has attracted increasing attention due to its moderate operational temperature theoretically 100 salt rejection rate capacity to utilize low grade thermal energy and modest requirement of membrane mechanical robustness rezaei et al 2018 however the conventional md process has formidable drawbacks such as high energy consumption for heating bulk feed water inevitable heat loss during the feed transportation from heating units to membrane modules and requirements of large centralized facility for pumping etc additionally another key obstacle impeding its applications is its low thermal efficiency due to temperature polarization anvari et al 2020 the inherent phenomenon of temperature polarization is the consequence of latent heat and conductive heat transfer across the hydrophobic microporous md membrane the temperature at the membrane surface feed interface tfm is lower than the temperature of bulk feed water tf due to water vaporization and membrane thermal conductivity meanwhile the temperature at the membrane permeate interface tpm could be higher than the bulk permeate temperature tp which can be attributed to vapor condensation as well as the thermal conductivity of membrane thus the temperature polarization phenomenon reduces the effective temperature difference across the membrane it has been reported that optimization of md operational condition such as increase of feed flow rate could reduce the boundary layer thickness on membrane surface alleviate temperature polarization effects and enhance membrane performance kuang et al 2019 however the effects of optimizing operational conditions on reducing the negative influences from temperature polarization are restricted these drawbacks greatly hinder its practical application especially in the energy scarce regions offshore areas small villages and off grid locales without low grade thermal resources thanks to the rapid development of various photothermal materials and inspired by the solar steam generation ssg systems an emerging md configuration termed photothermal membrane distillation pmd or solar driven membrane distillation smd has been proposed recently it harnesses the abundant and renewable solar energy for localized heating at the membrane feed interface by using photothermal materials instead of heating bulk feed solutions guo et al 2017 guo et al 2018 jun et al 2019 yang et al 2018 while the energy consumption of conventional md processes mainly comes from heating the bulk feed saline solutions and pumping feed and permeation solutions the energy consumption of pmd is mainly due to the dynamical energy consumption of circulating solutions in addition the feed and permeate flow rates of pmd system feed side 3 25 ml min permeate side 18 250 ml min are usually much lower than those of conventional md processes which are usually in turbulent flow status feed flow rate 500 ml min permeate flow rate 500 ml min wu et al 2021 wu et al 2018 meanwhile for conventional md the heat energy would be lost during the feed storage and on the way of feed transportation from heating units to membrane modules due to heat transmission radiation and convection it eventually leads to the low thermal efficiency of conventional md in contrast the thermal energy is directly applied on the photothermal layer of the pmd membranes which avoids heat loss from feed storage and transportation according to the literatures the thermal energy efficiencies of traditional md process are usually below 10 while the thermal energy efficiency of pmd is around 60 10 zuo et al 2020 moreover the pmd process eliminates the requirements of complex equipment and power generation systems it has the great potential to develop highly integrated and portable equipment that can be applied to remote off grid areas for instance li s group produced an integrated pmd system and verified it outdoors in houston situated at 29 7604 n in texas usa dongare et al 2017 the water production rate of pmd could reach 6 l m 2 h 1 after using fresnel lens to focus sunlight 25 times enabling it to produce sufficient drinking water for three people assuming 2 l per person within one hour in this review for convenience and for easier understanding these processes are collectively dubbed pmd in the pmd process the functional photothermal materials are incorporated into membrane the substrate or onto the membrane surface to convert solar energy into thermal energy chen et al 2019 rice et al 2020 tao et al 2018 zuo et al 2020 the pmd process effectively addresses issues pertaining to conventional md processes such as energy intensive usage thermal loss and temperature polarization through localized heat generation on the membrane surface and providing highly effective transmembrane temperature gradient for vapor transportation furthermore these are accomplished by requiring lower external thermal input lower electricity input and less incidence of membrane fouling zuo et al 2020 to date many review articles have been published about the photothermal materials ssg design and development and other potential applications of photothermal materials there is still not a critical review focusing on the up to date progress and future development directions of pmd technology therefore given the recent significant achievements in the pmd process and its promising potential for decentralized desalination it is opportune to comprehensively review the recent progress of pmd its current state and potential prospects as done in the present article for the first time after illustrating the pmd mechanisms in the next section the photothermal materials feasible for pmd membrane fabrication are summarized in section 3 the light to heat conversion mechanisms of various photothermal materials including plasma particles inorganic semiconductor materials carbon based and polymer based materials are described in this section next the strategies to develop photothermal membranes are classified and illustrated and the merits and demerits of each fabrication approach are highlighted in the following section the performance of as developed membranes in pmd process is assessed whose strengths and weaknesses are highlighted the effects of operational parameter and membrane module designs on pmd performance are discussed in section 6 the current challenges and future perspectives of pmd technology are presented in section 7 it is anticipated that this state of the art review would acquaint the readers with the fundamental principles and current status of pmd process motivate and inspire more readers to further develop effective photothermal membranes for pmd and address the current obstacles impeding its practical applications 2 mechanisms of pmd process for the next generation water purification technology the use of highly sustainable and accessible solar energy is the most promising alternative to that of conventional energy especially in remote water energy stressed areas chen et al 2019 since 1950 the solar energy has been utilized to generate heat distill seawater and produce freshwater bloch et al 1951 in contrast with the photovoltaic power generated by converting sunlight into electricity via solar panels it is more cost and energy effective to directly convert solar energy into thermal energy by photothermal materials jun et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 in the pmd processes photothermal materials can be incorporated into bulk membrane or onto membrane surface which convert solar energy into thermal energy and localize the heat on the membrane surface ashoor et al 2016 politano et al 2017 thus the feed temperature on the membrane surface tfm is higher than the bulk feed temperature tf providing a highly effective temperature difference for driving vapor transportation zhang et al 2019 similar to the conventional md configurations the permeate side of pmd processes can be cool permeate water vacuum or air gap as in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd and air gap membrane distillation agmd respectively compared to the conventional md process the pmd process exhibits its unique advantages including 1 the energy electric energy fossil fuel and etc consumed to heat up feed solutions can be saved to a great extent 2 the feed flow rate in pmd system is significantly lower than that in conventional md configurations thus reducing the energy consumption of pumping feed solutions 3 as the heating process is localized on the membrane surface the heat loss due to transportation of hot feed solutions can be eliminated 4 since the pmd process is usually operated at room temperature scalants in the feed solutions exhibit crystal status which results in less heterogeneous crystal nucleation and scaling on the membrane surface ashoor et al 2016 rezaei et al 2018 due to these merits of pmd process it is highly appealing to overcome the water energy nexus and produce purified freshwater in the off grid regions as a low cost low energy small footprint and portable system in the pmd system the primary part is the pmd membrane which must fulfill the requirements of the md membrane as follows rezaei et al 2018 1 the membranes should have sufficient hydrophobicity with a high liquid entry pressure of water lepw which prevent feed solutions from penetrating into membrane pores and achieve long term stability 2 the membranes should exhibit high vapor permeability and less vapor transfer resistance the membrane flux can be enhanced by increasing membrane pore size and porosity reducing membrane thickness and tortuosity 3 the membranes should possess appropriate thicknesses to offer less mass transfer resistance and lower thermal loss 4 the membranes should possess satisfactory anti fouling and anti scaling properties 5 the chemical and thermal stabilities of membrane materials are critical for their long term operation especially in the pmd process ashoor et al 2016 rezaei et al 2018 rice et al 2020 su et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 under solar radiation the membrane materials may be degraded or decomposed which could dramatically impair their performance and stability apart from these key membrane properties for conventional md process the thermal efficiency is essential for pmd membranes jun et al 2019 the photothermal efficiency η can be defined as the ratio between the energy utilized to generate vapor and total energy input by solar radiation which can be estimated by the following equation li et al 2019 1 η m h vap c opt p 0 where m is the water flux in steady state kg m 2 h 1 hvap is the total enthalpy change due to liquid to vapor phase transition j kg 1 p0 is the solar irradiance at sea level at a given latitude on a cloudless day around 1 0 kw m 2 copt is the optical concentration factor 3 photothermal materials and their light to heat conversion mechanisms the performance of pmd process is closely related to the incident light adsorption properties and light to heat conversion efficiencies of photothermal materials incorporated in the pmd membranes besides the broadband light absorption and photothermal efficiency the appealing photothermal materials should be low cost and easily manufacturable table 1 summarizes various types of photothermal materials utilized to fabricate pmd membranes the photothermal materials can be generally divided into four categories i plasmonic particles such as silver ag aluminum al and gold au nanoparticles nps ii inorganic semiconductor materials such as metal oxides and metal sulfides iii carbon based materials such as carbon black cb and carbon nanotubes cnts iv polymer materials such as polydopamine pda chen et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 2 a when the frequency of incident photon matches the oscillation frequency of delocalized electrons in the metal nps plasmon resonance is triggered which excites free electrons and produces hot electrons the hot electrons oscillate in the electromagnetic field to generate heat chang et al 2016 chen et al 2019 however the critical challenge of these plasmonic metal nps is that they only absorb ultraviolet light wavelengths instead of broader wavelengths which reduce their light to heat efficiency chen et al 2019 therefore metal nps need to be tuned with specific shape size and nanostructure or combined with other photothermal materials to broaden the absorption wavelength for example the metal nps such as au ag and al have been modified into different sizes and shapes to improve their photothermal efficiency liu et al 2015 xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the nanomaterials with core shell structures have been developed for achieving broader light absorption and higher light to heat conversion properties due to the synergistic effects of different materials wu et al 2019 for instance hedayati et al developed a ssg with a nanocomposite au sio2 upper layer which can absorb 100 wavelength range from ultraviolet to near infrared light which was attributed to the combined light absorbing abilities of metal nanoparticle au and semiconductor sio2 hedayati et al 2012 in addition to the high cost metal nps low cost and low toxic inorganic semiconductors have been utilized for ssg and pmd membranes fabrication wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b there is a forbidden band between valence and conduction bands in semiconductor materials when the incident light energy is greater than or equal to the band gap of semiconductor the electrons in the valence band transit to the conduction band and generate electron hole pairs these electron hole pairs above the band gap relax to the edge of the band gap converting extra energy into heat chen et al 2019 shi et al designed a solar evaporation system using semiconductor material fe3o4 shi et al 2017 the magnetic fe3o4nps effectively captured light converted photo energy into thermal energy heat and accelerated water evaporation besides some emerging two dimensional semiconductor materials such as mos2 mxene and black phosphorus have been utilized as photothermal materials for ssg and pmd processes guo et al 2018 tan et al 2018 moreover the carbon materials are widely used as photothermal materials because of their outstanding light absorption capabilities making them appear black jun et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 compared to plasmonic metals and semiconductors the carbonaceous materials display obvious advantages in terms of abundance scalability low cost and excellent stability chen et al 2019 jia et al 2017 in the carbonaceous materials a great amount of loose electrons can be easily excited from π orbital to π orbital under light gao et al 2019 as shown in fig 2c when the photon energy of incident light coincides with the electron transition in the molecule the electrons can be excited from the ground state with the highest occupied molecular orbital homo to a higher energy orbital with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo as the excited electron returns to its ground state homo heat can be released chen et al 2019 thus far carbon based materials including cb cnts and graphene have been utilized as photothermal fillers cui et al 2018 finnerty et al 2017 qi et al 2020 yang et al 2017 the light to heat conversion mechanism of polymers is similar to that of carbon based materials the photothermal polymeric materials are capable to absorb intensive light and convert it into heat with very little luminous loss for instance the environmentally benign pda a black viscous substance secreted by shellfish has been widely used as a photothermal material because of its adhesive ability to various substrates independent of their shape and material jiang et al 2017 another critical factor influencing the light absorbing property of photothermal materials is reflection it is suggested that photothermal materials could be fabricated with nano porous structures with multiple reflections within the pores which would maximize light absorbance efficiency jiang et al 2016 during the past decade the rapid development of novel photothermal materials and their micro nano structure design have successfully endowed photothermal materials with full solar spectrum adsorptions and high light to heat conversion efficiencies chen et al 2019 thanks to this progress the pmd process has the potential to offer safe freshwater using green solar energy in remote regions facing water and energy shortage in addition to photothermal materials the methods of their incorporation into pmd membranes and maximization of their effectiveness are also crucial 4 design and development of effective pmd membranes as summarized in table 1 the pmd membrane fabrication methods can be classified into one step preparation using mixed dope solutions and multi step surface modifications the photothermal materials should be homogenously dispersed in polymeric solutions prior to the one step fabrication method via non solvent induced phase separation nips or electrospinning which produce mixed matrix photothermal membranes besides the dual layer photothermal membranes can be obtained by localizing functional photothermal materials on the surface of hydrophobic membranes by post modifications such as vacuum filtration dip coating and spray coating zhang et al 2019 the advantages and disadvantages of each method are summarized in table 1 4 1 one step fabrication using mixed dope solutions in the one step fabrication methods the photothermal materials dispersed mixed dope solutions are fabricated into membranes by nips or electrospinning nips is a demixing process whereby the as prepared polymeric dope solution is transformed from a liquid to a solid state in a non solvent coagulation bath liao et al 2018 for instance politano et al developed a agnps embedded polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf composite membrane by nips politano et al 2017 the agnps were entrapped and well dispersed throughout the pvdf matrix as shown in fig 3 a with an increasing amount of agnps loaded into membrane the membrane color showed an obvious gradation from white to brown the uv lamp radiation could raise the surface temperature of agnps loaded pvdf membranes by 4 5 k while the temperature of unloaded pvdf membrane showed 2 5 k increase besides nips electrospinning has attracted special attention over the last decade as a facile method to obtain nanofibrous membranes liao et al 2018 compared to the membranes developed by phase inversion the electrospun membranes are composed of overlapped nanofibers which exhibit high porosity and specific surface area liao et al 2018 for example dongare et al has successfully developed a dual layer photothermal membrane dongare et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b a photothermal layer composed of polyvinyl alcohol pva cb nanofibers was electrospun on the commercial pvdf membrane surface the pva cb composite surface layer can ensure temperature difference across the membrane in the range of 14 20 c under solar irradiation in addition huang et al prepared photothermal pvdf antimony doped tin oxide ato composite nanofibrous membranes by incorporating ato a mixture of sno2 and sb2o3 with a certain mass ratio into pvdf nanofibers fig 3c huang et al 2019 it was found that the temperature on the ato loaded pvdf nanofibrous membrane surface could reach 93 8 c under infrared radiation the primary advantage of one step fabrication methods is that the photothermal materials can be homogenously dispersed and embedded in the polymeric membrane substrates therefore the risk of photothermal materials leakage into permeate water is eliminated meanwhile these methods are easy to scale up compared to post modification methods however it requires a great amount of highly costly photothermal materials which are buried under the membrane surface and do not contribute to the light to heat conversion efficiency 4 2 multi step surface modifications 4 2 1 vacuum filtration during the vacuum filtration process various photothermal materials can be easily deposited on the membrane surface in addition to facile nature of the operation the thickness of the coating layer can be easily controlled by volume and photothermal material concentration of the coating solutions as shown in fig 4 a a novel emerging 2d material mxene was synthesized and coated onto the surface of a commercial pvdf microfiltration mf membrane by vacuum filtration tan et al 2018 mxenes are transition metal carbides and nitrides with a formula of mn 1xntx gao et al 2020 the transition metals m with n 1 layers are interleaved with n layers of carbon or nitrogen where tx means various functional groups such as hydroxyl and chlorine due to the excellent optical absorption and photothermal efficiency of mxenes they are filtrated on the surface of pvdf membrane to provide a photothermal skin layer with localized heating property the infrared ir thermal image clearly demonstrated that the mxene coated pvdf membrane exhibited a significant temperature increase of 49 c after one min of 50 w led irradiation in addition to commercial membrane substrate the electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been used as promising substrates for vacuum coating photothermal layers as shown in fig 4b for pmd applications the fe3o4nps were vacuum filtered and uniformly distributed on the nanofibrous pvdf membrane surface li et al 2020 due to the high light absorption and photothermal conversion capacity of fe3o4nps the membrane surface temperature increased from 25 to 50 c in 10 min of illumination under 1 0 kw m 2 however these photothermal materials are non biocompatible and non biodegradable the disposal of which could pose great threat to the environment and ecosystem therefore the biocompatible biodegradable and abundant hydroxyapatite ha nanowires were developed for fabricating high performance pmd membranes as shown in fig 4c cao et al 2020 a highly efficient dual layer photothermal membrane was fabricated by filtering pda coated ha ha pda nanowires on the chitosan cs bonded ha nanowires substrate the dual layered architecture composed of flexible ha nanowires offered a highly porous network and a great amount of channels for vapor transportation after 1 0 and 9 0 kw m 2 irradiation for 120 s the surface temperatures of the bilayer membrane could reach around 46 and 245 c respectively this excellent photothermal property could be ascribed to the broadband light absorption of pda and interconnected porous architecture of nanowire structure which reflect light within the surface layer and ensure high light absorption although the vacuum filtration method possesses its unique merits such as easy operation the photothermal membranes prepared by vacuum filtration are difficult to scale up due to the limited size of the vacuum system additionally the thermal and chemical stabilities of the coating layers should be concerned as there are rare bonding forces between the surface layers and membrane substrates 4 2 2 spray coating the spray coating method is popular in coating various functional materials on membrane surfaces liao et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 a cb nps was spray coated on the surface of pvdf nanofibrous membrane to obtain a multilevel rough membrane with localized heating capacity gong et al 2019b the multilevel roughness and interconnected micro nano channels endowed the membrane with good light absorption improved vapor permeability and omniphobicity it could efficiently capture solar energy via multiple internal reflection the cb nps mediate localized heating layer could heat the membrane surface from 18 6 to 32 3 c within 150 s and stabilize the surface temperature to 41 6 c at 5 min under illumination with an intensity of 1 0 kw m 2 besides other carbon based nanotube and nanosheets nss were sprayed on hydrophobic microporous membrane surface to obtain efficient pmd membranes huang et al 2020a as shown in fig 5b to fabricate a polydimethylsiloxane pdms cnts pvdf membrane the cnts were spray coated on the electrospun pvdf membrane surface followed by post treatment hot pressing huang et al 2020a the produced membrane thus exhibited a cnts stacked morphology due to its broad light absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency the membrane displayed a stable temperature above 70 c under 1 0 kw m 2 illumination after a few minutes moreover the graphene nss were deposited onto ptfe membrane surface with pda and trichloro 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyl silane ftcs by spray coating as shown in fig 5c ghim et al 2021 the aggregated graphenes were accumulated on the ptfe membrane surface the resultant membrane can rapidly reach 52 c after 60 s of 0 75 kw m 2 illumination although the spray coating method is effective in coating functional materials on membrane surface the uniformity of coating layer is a concern besides the long term stability of spray coating layer should be considered 4 2 3 chemical modifications using polydopamine as a glue the mussel inspired polymer pda can be easily coated on various surfaces regardless of their surface energy and morphologies via self polymerization liao et al 2013 additionally pda has broad light absorption and excellent photothermal conversion properties moreover the low toxicity and biocompatibility of pda endow it with an environmentally friendly property for water treatment thus some works have utilized pda as a chemical modified layer or an intermediate glue for fabricating pmd membranes as shown in fig 6 a a pda layer was self polymerized on a commercial pvdf mf membrane wu et al 2018 the pda activated membrane was subsequently modified to be hydrophobic using ftcs as shown in fig 6b and c the ftcs modified membrane ftcs pda pvdf clearly displayed a uniform microporous surface the ir images demonstrated fig 6d that the surface temperature of dry ftcs pda pvdf membrane would promptly increase from 20 to 35 ⁰c under irradiation with an intensity of 0 75 kw m 2 and 97 c at 7 0 kw m 2 which were the best among pda pvdf ftcs pvdf and ftcs pda pvdf membranes in addition to serving as a photothermal surface layer itself the pda layer can be used as an intermediate layer grafted on other photothermal materials qilin li and her group have attached sio2 au nss and cb nps on the commercial pvdf membrane surface using pda as the glue chen et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the hierarchical structure of cb nps on membrane surface not only absorbed light and provided localized heating for pmd but also endowed the membrane with an omniphobic property after the 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane fas17 coating the enhanced thermal efficiency and excellent anti wetting property make the membrane highly competitive for pmd applications more efficient photothermal materials can be grafted on the surface of membrane substrates with the assistance of pda in the future 4 2 4 dip coating dip coating is a simple method to deposit photothermal materials on membrane surface by immersing membrane substrates into photothermal materials dispersed solutions an azobenzene dye disperse red 1 dr1 and non azobenzene dye disperse blue 14 db14 were dip coated onto commercial ptfe membranes to obtain pmd membranes fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 both red dyed and blue dyed membranes were active to convert irradiated visible light to heat which warmed the water on membrane surface and drove water vapor pass through the membrane pores han et al developed composite membranes from eggshells for pmd process han et al 2019 as shown in fig 7 the eggshell membranes esms were obtained by mold assisted vacuum drying eggshells which were then annealed to carbonized eggshell membrane cesm in order to obtain rgo wrapped eggshell membranes the esm was soaked in graphene oxide go dispersion followed by carbonization and go reduction the carbonized esm cnts membrane was fabricated by dipping the esms in a precursor solution followed by cnts growth solution the cesm and rgo wrapped esm presented similar porous morphologies while the cnts functionalized membrane exhibited a fluffy structure covered by cnts due to the excellent light absorption feature of both cesm and cnts the cesm cnts showed a rapid temperature rising to 330 k which laid the foundation for its pmd application although dip coating can easily endow the membranes with photothermal properties the uniform distribution of the photothermal materials on substrates the thickness and stability of coating layers in long term use need further investigations especially under harsh conditions 5 evaluation of pmd performance in different configurations during the pmd process the light energy radiates on the pmd membrane surface in feed side triggers the light to heat conversion and helps to produce water vapor which transports through membrane pores and condenses on the permeate side the system efficiency not only depends on the pmd membrane but is also highly dependent on the system configuration such as the design of permeate collector based on different permeate sides characteristics pmd can be divided into dcmd based vmd based and agmd based configurations besides the multi level pmd configuration has been proposed to recover the latent heat and further enhance the photothermal efficiency of pmd system small pilot pmd systems were constructed to assess their potential for producing freshwater in remote communities without electrical grids the performance of the photothermal membranes in various pmd processes their operational and irradiation conditions are summarized in table 2 5 1 dcmd based pmd process similar to the conventional dcmd configuration the most studied pmd configuration involves direct application of solar illumination on membrane surface at the feed side while the permeate side is cold distilled water the cb pva coated pvdf dual layer membrane developed by li s group was tested in a dcmd based pmd process dongare et al 2017 in the pmd test conducted at room temperature 20 c the membrane obtained a permeate flux of 5 38 kg m 2 h 1 under the simulated illumination of 17 5 kw m 2 it was found that the pmd and conventional dcmd processes had obviously different temperature profiles as shown in fig 8 a and b in the dcmd process the temperature was the highest at feed inlet which provided the largest temperature gradient across the membrane during the pmd process as the feed temperature increased along with the feed flow channel the largest temperature difference was generated close to the feed outlet instead of inlet therefore in contrast to the conventional dcmd process the scale up of pmd membrane module could increase its permeate flux another advantage of pmd configuration is its modest flow velocity pmd is more efficient at a lower feed flow rate which allows sufficient time for water heating by illuminated membrane surface and thus a larger temperature gradient in contrast the conventional md configurations require a higher feed velocity to alleviate the negative effects from temperature polarization and concentration polarization liao et al 2013 2014 however the solar energy conversion efficiency of this system was only around 20 this unsatisfactory efficiency should be due to a dense photothermal surface layer with a thickness of 25 7 μm as the pvdf substrate layer was around 100 μm the additional cb pva layer increased the membrane thickness by 25 a photothermal layer with an appropriate higher thickness and a desirable structure could enhance the internal reflection and improve the photo thermal conversion efficiency especially in ssg systems the structural engineering of photothermal layer with rough surfaces or straight pores can enhance light absorption by multi scattering effects distinctive from the ssg where water evaporate on the surface of the photothermal layer the water vapor generated in the pmd process need to pass through the photothermal layer and membrane substrate and finally condense at the permeate side thus a thick photothermal layer could result in higher mass transfer resistance of the pmd membranes an environmentally benign material ha nanowires was vacuum filtered on the chitosan membrane with pda to obtain a dual layer photothermal membrane cao et al 2020 the resultant membrane exhibited an excellent photothermal efficiency of 62 and a water flux of 0 89 kg m 2 h 1 under 1 0 kw m 2 irradiation the pda wrapped ha nanowires formed an intertwined network with numerous channels for vapor transportation meanwhile as shown in fig 8c it was demonstrated that a thermal insulation layer is also critical to maintain a high temperature difference across the membrane the heat transferring through the membrane could raise the temperature on the permeate side which would reduce the temperature gradient across the membrane the loss of driving force could be minimized by a thermal insulator layer additionally other functional properties such as superhydrophobic omniphobic anti scaling bactericidal properties have been bestowed to pmd membranes gong et al 2019b huang et al 2020b li et al 2020 tan et al 2018 wu et al 2021 the superhydrophobic pdms mwcnt pvdf pmd membrane could achieve a water flux of 0 65 kg m 2 h 1 for a 3 5 wt nacl solution under 1 0 sun illumination huang et al 2020b an omniphobic pmd membrane developed by immobilizing nps on nanofibrous membranes could yield a water flux of 9 01 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar intensity of 10 0 kw m 2 gong et al 2019b the membrane also displayed excellent anti fouling and anti wetting properties when treating oil contaminated and highly saline solutions which should be attributed to having the lowest contact area between membrane surface and feed solutions besides the mxene coated pvdf membrane exhibited better antibacterial and anti biofouling properties during the pmd operation tan et al 2018 this is due to the weaker hydrophobic interaction and greater electrostatic repulsion between mxene and foulants moreover the bacterial nanocellulose coated pmd membrane showed interfacial photothermal disinfection property for killing bacteria which is able to prolong the membrane lifespan wu et al 2021 in spite of these advances in the dcmd based pmd process as both membrane surfaces keep contact with hot feed and cold permeate solutions in this configuration the effective temperature difference across the membrane is reduced due to the membrane thermal conductivity the vmd or agmd based pmd configurations can potentially minimize the heat loss by modifying the permeate side 5 2 vmd based pmd process in the vmd based pmd configuration the simulated light is illuminated on the membrane surface at the feed side while a vacuum pressure is applied on the permeate side to extract vapor outside of the system as shown in fig 9 a politano et al 2017 the vacuum system can promote transportation and collection of generated vapor as the condensation of water conducts outside the membrane module the insulation layer of membrane is not that crucial thus the photothermal materials incorporated mixed matrix membranes have been utilized in this system the agnps pvdf mixed matrix membrane prepared by nips showed notably increasing temperature on the membrane surface in a vmd based pmd system under ultraviolet light politano et al 2017 a permeate flux of 25 7 kg m 2 h 1 was obtained under the light intensity of 23 0 kw m 2 the agnps loaded pvdf membrane exhibited an eleven fold higher flux than the unloaded pvdf membrane for a 0 5 m nacl feed solution compared to a standard ro filtration system the vmd based pmd prototype achieved an energy reduction of 25 in addition huang et al prepared the ato loaded nanofibrous membrane for the vmd based pmd process huang et al 2019 before and after the infrared lamp was turned on the membrane permeation flux increased from 8 0 to 27 0 kg m 2 h 1 it was demonstrated that the photo energy effectively raised the temperature on membrane surface mitigated the influence from temperature polarization and enhanced membrane permeate flux the vmd based pmd can alleviate the reduction of temperature difference caused by membrane thermal conduction and can result in higher permeation flux however due to the vacuum pressure on the permeate side this process has much stricter requirements for anti wetting properties of membranes 5 3 agmd based pmd process as shown in fig 9b during an agmd based pmd test the vapor generated on the membrane surface need to pass through hydrophobic membrane pores transport through an air gap and finally condense as produced water a dye modified ptfe membrane has been utilized in an agmd based pmd configuration fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 the membrane could achieve a permeable flux of 0 78 kg m 2 h 1 under simulated sunlight at 1 0 kw m 2 zhang et al developed a high performance tin pva pvdf membrane for agmd based pmd process zhang et al 2020 a final permeation flux was 0 94 kg m 2 h 1 and a solar energy conversion efficiency of 64 1 were obtained under 1 0 kw m 2 solar irradiation the permeate water exhibited a potable quality proving that pmd technology is promising for providing fresh water in remote off grid and less developed regions although the agmd based pmd configuration reduces heat loss and alleviates membrane wetting tendency due to its air gap layer the permeate flux of this configuration is usually low due to the additional mass transfer resistance from the air gap 5 4 multi level pmd processes in order to further enhance thermal efficiency novel pmd configurations with latent heat recovery systems have been developed as shown in fig 9c huang et al designed a dual layer pmd device huang et al 2020a in the first layer the upper part has a water channel with a height of 2 mm while the bottom is a condensate pool composed of several aluminum pieces for steam condensation the first layer was separated by a pdms cnt pvdf membrane and a stainless steel support net the second layer was insulated by a pva foam for delivering seawater by capillary action the condensed heat is recycled in the second layer to heat seawater absorbed by pva sponge which drove an additional md process the dual layer pmd system could achieve a water permeation flux of 1 42 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar illumination of 1 0 kw m 2 which was 0 9 kg m 2 h 1 for the single level pmd structure additionally the pmd systems with multiple latent heat recovery systems have been constructed to further raise thermal efficiency as shown in fig 9d ghim et al synthesized a graphenenanosheets pda ftcs deposited ptfe membrane for a multi layer stacked pmd system ghim et al 2021 owing to its photothermal property the membrane surface had a higher temperature than the water in contact with its surface which impelled water vapor to pass through the membrane and condense on the cold plate beneath the surface the latent heat from vapor condensation transferred to the cold feed water under an aluminum foil and thus created another temperature gradient across the hydrophobic ptfe membrane on the lower layer which drove another md process the water vapor generated due to the recovered latent heat was subsequently condensed at the bottom layer by optimizing the air gap thickness and stacking multiple heat recovery layers a water flux of 1 17 kg m 2 h 1could be achieved under the simulated solar illumination of 0 75 kw m 2 which is equivalent to the solar intensity under cloudy sky although the multi layer stacked pmd system can obtain outstanding thermal efficiency by recovering latent heat the photothermal layers are still under feed water in the above systems the water layer as a physical barrier can significantly reduce the intensity of incident light arriving at the photothermal layer due to refraction and reflection meanwhile in these underwater configurations the photothermal materials deposited on the membrane surface need sufficient adhesion with membrane surface and robust mechanical stability to avoid material release into produced water as shown in fig 9e a new multi level pmd system was designed to separate photothermal membranes from feed water xue et al 2018 in this system the saline water was adsorbed by pva sponge to the bottom surface of a photothermal membrane where it generated vapor under solar irradiation the vapor then passed through a hydrophobic membrane and condensed on the collector the first collector acted as a thermal source to heat the next stage pva sponge which helped generate the vapor passing through the next hydrophobic membrane the vapor was then condensed in the second collector due to the latent heat cycle this system achieved water productivity of 1 02 kg m 2 h 1 with a solar efficiency of 72 under 1 0 kw m 2 illumination the previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of enhancing thermal efficiency through latent heat recovery in these multi level pmd systems as the feed water is circulated by automatically absorbing via hydrophilic materials in the multi level pmd systems these systems are highly competitive as point of use apparatus for emergency situations and offshore seawater desalination therefore among various pmd configurations the multi level pmd systems are more suitable for small scaled practical applications due to high thermal efficiency and simple facility 5 5 pilot scaled pmd applications besides the lab scaled trial experiments a few studies have been conducted to estimate the potential practical applications of pmd technology by small pilot scaled systems as shown in fig 10 a and b a pmd reactor with a two flow chamber was constructed to demonstrate its desalination capacity under different solar intensities said et al 2019 the pilot system is composed of a 1 5 mm top channel between a transparent window and pmd membrane and a 1 0 mm bottom channel to vacuum draw the water vapor outside of the membrane module the feed water evaporated at the interface of feed solution and membrane transported through membrane pores and collected in the permeate reservoir this pilot system was equipped with a solar panel to provide electricity for pumping feed water it could achieve a water flux around 0 12 kg m 2 h 1 under cloudy condition and 0 77 kg m 2 h 1 under sunny condition with a salt rejection rate of 99 8 when treating a 40 g l nacl solution additionally a pilot plant shown in fig 10c was constructed to verify the feasibility of pmd practical application li et al 2020 in this pilot system the permeate flux of fe3o4 pvdf hfp pmd membrane was increased by 11 from 19 73 to 21 99 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar irradiation intensity of 3 0 kw m 2 in contrast to the lab scaled model the performance enhancement of pilot scaled model was less significant due to shorter retention time under solar irritation shorter in situ heating time and more heat loss the performance of pilot pmd systems could be enhanced by using vmd or agmd based configurations to minimize the heating loss due to the heat exchange between feed and cold permeate sides chiavazzo et al constructed and tested a passive modular and low cost pmd system on the roof chiavazzo et al 2018 under the solar radiation of 0 6 kw m 2 the permeate flux of a ten stage distiller was 1 32 kg m 2 h 1 which exceeded the thermodynamic limit of the single stage solar distiller in order to further improve the thermal efficiency under natural sunlight the focusing optics were used to enhance the light intensity on the surface of the photothermal membrane as shown in fig 10d halas et al used a fresnel lens to concentrate sunlight by 25 times which achieved a higher flux of 5 20 kg m 2 h 1 compared to the unfocused case 0 22 kg m 2 h 1 dongare et al 2017 these low cost passive potable and easy to implement pmd systems are particularly suitable to provide freshwater in emergency situations or in offshore and remote off grid areas the thermal efficiencies of these pmd systems could be further enhanced by improving the system designs recovering latent heats optimizing photothermal efficiencies of pmd membranes mitigating membrane fouling and scaling in long term operation 6 effects of operational parameters and module designs besides the photothermal membrane characteristics the operational conditions and designs of membrane modules could affect the performance of pmd process the key operational conditions in the pmd process mainly include the feed velocity temperature and composition the effects of the operational conditions in permeate side are similar as conventional md processes while the effects of feed velocity on membrane performance are opposite for pmd and md dongare et al 2017 wu et al 2018 the thermal efficiency of pmd process is higher at a lower feed velocity while the permeate flux in conventional md processes could be improved at a higher feed velocity due to alleviation of temperature polarization a lower feed velocity allows sufficient time to heat feed solutions by the pmd membrane and thus generate a larger temperature gradient across membrane resulting in a higher distillate flux meanwhile the heat loss from the feed solution layer on membrane surface to the bulk solution would be faster at a higher feed velocity the operation of pmd system at a modest feed velocity would be a significant superiority over conventional md systems additionally the effects of auxiliary feed heating on permeate flux were investigated by huang et al 2020b the feed solution was pre heated to 30 50 c prior to entering into pmd membrane module the permeate flux increased with the increasing feed temperature which was similar as the conventional md processes when the membrane module was irradiated under the light with an intensity of 1 kw m 2 the membrane flux could be enhanced this increment suggests that the pmd process can be combined with auxiliary heating systems to further improve performance for example the wind energy and industrial waste heat can be used to further reduce energy consumption and cost of pmd systems moreover the complex compositions of real feed solutions may foul and wet the pmd membranes at a lower operational temperature of pmd process the calcite and gypsum scalants tend to remain dissolved in the feed solution than deposition on membrane surface rice et al 2020 meanwhile the precipitation kinetics of these scalants are slower at a lower temperature which delay the scaling on membrane surface thus membrane scaling is lower in pmd process than conventional md processes besides the wetting resistance of pmd membrane towards surfactant solutions was investigated by chen et al 2020 the better anti wetting property of the pmd membrane was due to the spherical re entrant structures of the photothermal coating layer the re entrant structure could effectively support the liquid vapor interface and prevent the adsorption of surfactants in membrane pores which subsequently restrained membrane wetting the designs of membrane modules also have influences on the permeate flux of the pmd systems as the feed solution is heated by the light to heat conversion on the pmd membrane surface the feed temperature increases along the feed flow channel due to longer heating time thus the temperature difference on the feed outflow side is the largest increasing the size of the membrane module should be beneficial to the permeate flux dongare et al 2017 besides the membrane module design decides the depth of the water layer on pmd membrane surface at the feed side a thicker water layer at the feed channel could reduce the amount of solar energy absorbed by the photothermal layer because of refraction and scattering thereby reducing the photothermal efficiency li et al 2020 furthermore the thickness of the photothermal layer and concentration of the photothermal materials on the pmd membrane surface affect its photothermal efficiency as illustrated in section 5 1 the light to heat conversion efficiency could be enhanced by a thicker photothermal layer with a desirable structure due to multiple reflections wang 2018 however a thicker photothermal layer might have negative effects on the permeate fluxes as it could block the membrane pores and increase water vapor mass transfer resistance chen et al 2020 meanwhile an increasing concentration of photothermal materials could absorb more light leading to higher light absorption coefficients dongare et al 2017 it was found that the quasi steady state surface temperature of pmd membrane could increase from 42 4 to 48 0 c when the coated cb concentration was increased from 0 2 to 1 0 wt chen et al 2020 a higher cb loaded membrane showed a membrane flux enhancement by 54 9 while the membrane with a lower cb concentration showed a lower flux increasing by 9 5 7 challenges and perspectives the potential applications of pmd technology have been well demonstrated in previous research works in spite of these remarkable achievements there are still some critical challenges hindering its large scaled applications as follows it is unreliable to compare the photothermal efficiency of different pmd membranes and systems based on their reported values because they were obtained under different experimental conditions some pmd systems were operated under simulated sunlight having much higher intensity e g 10 kw m 2 than natural irradiance making it impossible to operate efficiently under either sunny condition 1 0 kw m 2 or cloudy weather 0 75 kw m 2 therefore a uniform and scientific evaluation methodology is necessary to make reasonable and fair comparison of the performances from different systems although the pmd systems have achieved higher thermal efficiencies around 60 than conventional md processes below 10 they are still lower than the those of ssg systems up to 90 the previous works reported that most pmd membranes exhibited a water flux below 1 0 kg m 2 h 1 under the sunny condition 1 0 kw m 2 and just few cases using multi level pmd systems can reach or exceed 1 0 kg m 2 h 1 therefore more works should be carried out to develop photothermal materials with effective light adsorption and efficient light to heat conversion in addition the photothermal layer surface can be endowed with micro nano rough structures or straight pores to maximize the light multi scattering within the surface layer minimize light transmittance and reflection enhance light absorption and photothermal efficiencies moreover the fundamental understanding of the underlying membrane structure property relationships is still absent the behaviors and kinetics of light adsorption vapor generation and transportation and thermal diffusion of pmd membranes are essential to guide future pmd membrane designs simulation and real time monitoring could be effective approaches to obtain insights into the fundamental principles the stability of pmd membranes needs demonstration prior to commercialization ahmed et al 2019 as light to heat conversion is directly conducted on the membrane surface the membrane surface will be heated to a much higher temperature than conventional md membranes since most membrane materials are polymers they may be degraded and fail when exposed to sunlight for a long time thus the stability and life cycles of pmd membranes should be examined more endeavors should be conducted to study and improve the long term photothermal stability of pmd membranes by structure designs and surface coating the robust attachment of photothermal nanoparticles on membrane surface is another critical issue for practical applications the detachment of nanoparticles during the long term pmd operation not only impair membrane photothermal efficiency but also threaten the environmental safety as secondary pollutions therefore the strong adhesive force between the functional nanoparticles and membrane substrate under outdoor conditions in long term operations should be fully evaluated more research works should be conducted to systematically investigate the membrane wetting fouling and scaling in the pmd process especially in the treatment of brine water and hazardous wastewater with complex compositions in particular the fouling and scaling layers on the pmd membrane surface are able to significantly reduce its light to heat efficiency the anti fouling properties of pmd membranes can be enhanced by endowing membrane surfaces with super liquid repellent properties such as superhydrophobicity and underwater superoleophobicity pmd membranes can be endowed with other functions such as antimicrobial and catalysis in the future the applications of multi functional pmd membranes can be expanded in more fields disinfection catalysis and etc linking water energy and environment in a mutually beneficial way apart from pmd membrane optimization there are still gaps among lab scaled and pilot scaled pmd applications although high photothermal efficiencies can be obtained from lab scaled set ups the thermal efficiencies of pilot scaled pmd systems using natural light still need improvement zheng et al 2018 in addition the pilot scaled membrane module design especially the design of feed channel is critical for pmd applications the spiral wound or hollow fiber membrane modules are not able to have sufficient membrane surface area to receive adequate light thus it is suggested to use plate and frame membrane modules for pmd membranes moreover in order to efficiently operate at cloudy day and night the solar photovoltaic panels could be installed into pmd systems to store solar energy as electricity which can be used for driving the process by heating the feed solutions or joule heated md membranes zuo et al 2020 besides the scalability low costs of pmd membranes and systems are critical to evaluate the competitiveness of this technology the recent studies of pmd did not provide the costs of as developed membranes and systems which make it difficult in estimating their competitiveness compared to conventional desalination technologies in the field of desalination and water treatment in remote communities design and development of novel membranes and systems would further lower their costs and warrant their applications especially in off grid areas 8 conclusions in this article recent studies about the emerging pmd technology including its mechanisms photothermal materials and light to heat conversion mechanisms fabrication of pmd membranes and their evaluation in different pmd configurations as well as the challenges and future perspectives are comprehensively summarized and discussed the pmd technology integrates the photothermal process with existing md technology it uses abundant and sustainable solar energy to localize heating on pmd membrane surface via the photothermal effect and create the temperature gradient across the membrane thereby driving the process and obtaining distillate water the localized heating solves some key issues of conventional md processes such as low thermal efficiencies and temperature polarization the pmd technology is not desired to replace conventional desalination technologies such as conventional md reverse osmosis ro or electrodialysis ed instead pmd is a promising technology that targets as a potable water treatment instrument in rural and off grid communities where electricity or waste heat are not accessible although the last few years have witnessed rapid progress in research activities regarding the pmd process for seawater desalination and wastewater treatment it is still in the initial stage of both academic studies and industrial applications it is envisioned that the comprehensive review presented here can inspire more researchers to further explore this novel

16824,the conventional membrane distillation md process is accompanied by large energy consumption low thermal efficiency and inevitable requirements of centralized infrastructures which impede its practical applications especially in the offshore and remote off grid areas thanks to the rapid development of efficient photothermal materials over the last decade a new photothermal membrane distillation pmd process has emerged to harness abundant solar energy and localize heating on the membrane feed water interface via photothermal effects driven by the temperature difference across the pmd membrane water vapor can be generated on the membrane feed surface transported through membrane pores and condensed at permeate side to obtain freshwater thus tackling the challenge of obtaining clean water using green energy the pmd process avoids heating the entire bulk feed water and feed transportation from heat units to membrane modules which save substantial amounts of energy the interfacial localized heating intrinsically mitigates the temperature polarization across the membrane the latent heat from vapor condensation can be effectively recovered via multi level pmd configurations as great efforts have been made to exploit pmd process it is imperative to review the state of the art progress of pmd and shed light on its future trend here we briefly illustrate pmd mechanisms and membrane requirements photothermal materials feasible for developing pmd membranes along with their light to heat mechanisms this is followed by reviewing diverse approaches to prepare pmd membranes which are classified into one step fabrication and multi step modification methods comprehensive discussion about pmd membrane performance in different configurations and their small pilot scaled applications are provided the effects of operational parameters and module designs are discussed in section 6 finally the current challenges and future perspectives of pmd process are

distillation 1 introduction rapid economic development and population growth exacerbate the global water crisis ahmad et al 2020 elimelech and phillip 2011 zhang et al 2019 the 2030 agenda for sustainable development from the united nations proposes that every person should have sufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation within ten years stefan uhlenbrook 2017 however the united nations world water development report 2020 points out that 2 2 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water and 4 2 billion people 55 of the world s population are deprived of adequate sanitation facilities chen et al 2020 in addition north africa and middle east are the most water scarce regions and are characterized as below water poverty line which urgently needs effective measures to narrow the gap between water supply and demand hameed et al 2019 to address the water shortage issues various fresh water production technologies have been developed including desalination and wastewater treatment among these technologies membrane distillation md is a thermal driven membrane process using a hydrophobic membrane to separate a hot feed solution from a cold permeate on the opposite side liao et al 2014 driven by the temperature difference across the feed and permeation sides the water evaporates at the membrane surface on the feed side transports through hydrophobic membrane pores and finally condenses on the cold permeation side as freshwater rezaei et al 2018 md has attracted increasing attention due to its moderate operational temperature theoretically 100 salt rejection rate capacity to utilize low grade thermal energy and modest requirement of membrane mechanical robustness rezaei et al 2018 however the conventional md process has formidable drawbacks such as high energy consumption for heating bulk feed water inevitable heat loss during the feed transportation from heating units to membrane modules and requirements of large centralized facility for pumping etc additionally another key obstacle impeding its applications is its low thermal efficiency due to temperature polarization anvari et al 2020 the inherent phenomenon of temperature polarization is the consequence of latent heat and conductive heat transfer across the hydrophobic microporous md membrane the temperature at the membrane surface feed interface tfm is lower than the temperature of bulk feed water tf due to water vaporization and membrane thermal conductivity meanwhile the temperature at the membrane permeate interface tpm could be higher than the bulk permeate temperature tp which can be attributed to vapor condensation as well as the thermal conductivity of membrane thus the temperature polarization phenomenon reduces the effective temperature difference across the membrane it has been reported that optimization of md operational condition such as increase of feed flow rate could reduce the boundary layer thickness on membrane surface alleviate temperature polarization effects and enhance membrane performance kuang et al 2019 however the effects of optimizing operational conditions on reducing the negative influences from temperature polarization are restricted these drawbacks greatly hinder its practical application especially in the energy scarce regions offshore areas small villages and off grid locales without low grade thermal resources thanks to the rapid development of various photothermal materials and inspired by the solar steam generation ssg systems an emerging md configuration termed photothermal membrane distillation pmd or solar driven membrane distillation smd has been proposed recently it harnesses the abundant and renewable solar energy for localized heating at the membrane feed interface by using photothermal materials instead of heating bulk feed solutions guo et al 2017 guo et al 2018 jun et al 2019 yang et al 2018 while the energy consumption of conventional md processes mainly comes from heating the bulk feed saline solutions and pumping feed and permeation solutions the energy consumption of pmd is mainly due to the dynamical energy consumption of circulating solutions in addition the feed and permeate flow rates of pmd system feed side 3 25 ml min permeate side 18 250 ml min are usually much lower than those of conventional md processes which are usually in turbulent flow status feed flow rate 500 ml min permeate flow rate 500 ml min wu et al 2021 wu et al 2018 meanwhile for conventional md the heat energy would be lost during the feed storage and on the way of feed transportation from heating units to membrane modules due to heat transmission radiation and convection it eventually leads to the low thermal efficiency of conventional md in contrast the thermal energy is directly applied on the photothermal layer of the pmd membranes which avoids heat loss from feed storage and transportation according to the literatures the thermal energy efficiencies of traditional md process are usually below 10 while the thermal energy efficiency of pmd is around 60 10 zuo et al 2020 moreover the pmd process eliminates the requirements of complex equipment and power generation systems it has the great potential to develop highly integrated and portable equipment that can be applied to remote off grid areas for instance li s group produced an integrated pmd system and verified it outdoors in houston situated at 29 7604 n in texas usa dongare et al 2017 the water production rate of pmd could reach 6 l m 2 h 1 after using fresnel lens to focus sunlight 25 times enabling it to produce sufficient drinking water for three people assuming 2 l per person within one hour in this review for convenience and for easier understanding these processes are collectively dubbed pmd in the pmd process the functional photothermal materials are incorporated into membrane the substrate or onto the membrane surface to convert solar energy into thermal energy chen et al 2019 rice et al 2020 tao et al 2018 zuo et al 2020 the pmd process effectively addresses issues pertaining to conventional md processes such as energy intensive usage thermal loss and temperature polarization through localized heat generation on the membrane surface and providing highly effective transmembrane temperature gradient for vapor transportation furthermore these are accomplished by requiring lower external thermal input lower electricity input and less incidence of membrane fouling zuo et al 2020 to date many review articles have been published about the photothermal materials ssg design and development and other potential applications of photothermal materials there is still not a critical review focusing on the up to date progress and future development directions of pmd technology therefore given the recent significant achievements in the pmd process and its promising potential for decentralized desalination it is opportune to comprehensively review the recent progress of pmd its current state and potential prospects as done in the present article for the first time after illustrating the pmd mechanisms in the next section the photothermal materials feasible for pmd membrane fabrication are summarized in section 3 the light to heat conversion mechanisms of various photothermal materials including plasma particles inorganic semiconductor materials carbon based and polymer based materials are described in this section next the strategies to develop photothermal membranes are classified and illustrated and the merits and demerits of each fabrication approach are highlighted in the following section the performance of as developed membranes in pmd process is assessed whose strengths and weaknesses are highlighted the effects of operational parameter and membrane module designs on pmd performance are discussed in section 6 the current challenges and future perspectives of pmd technology are presented in section 7 it is anticipated that this state of the art review would acquaint the readers with the fundamental principles and current status of pmd process motivate and inspire more readers to further develop effective photothermal membranes for pmd and address the current obstacles impeding its practical applications 2 mechanisms of pmd process for the next generation water purification technology the use of highly sustainable and accessible solar energy is the most promising alternative to that of conventional energy especially in remote water energy stressed areas chen et al 2019 since 1950 the solar energy has been utilized to generate heat distill seawater and produce freshwater bloch et al 1951 in contrast with the photovoltaic power generated by converting sunlight into electricity via solar panels it is more cost and energy effective to directly convert solar energy into thermal energy by photothermal materials jun et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 in the pmd processes photothermal materials can be incorporated into bulk membrane or onto membrane surface which convert solar energy into thermal energy and localize the heat on the membrane surface ashoor et al 2016 politano et al 2017 thus the feed temperature on the membrane surface tfm is higher than the bulk feed temperature tf providing a highly effective temperature difference for driving vapor transportation zhang et al 2019 similar to the conventional md configurations the permeate side of pmd processes can be cool permeate water vacuum or air gap as in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd and air gap membrane distillation agmd respectively compared to the conventional md process the pmd process exhibits its unique advantages including 1 the energy electric energy fossil fuel and etc consumed to heat up feed solutions can be saved to a great extent 2 the feed flow rate in pmd system is significantly lower than that in conventional md configurations thus reducing the energy consumption of pumping feed solutions 3 as the heating process is localized on the membrane surface the heat loss due to transportation of hot feed solutions can be eliminated 4 since the pmd process is usually operated at room temperature scalants in the feed solutions exhibit crystal status which results in less heterogeneous crystal nucleation and scaling on the membrane surface ashoor et al 2016 rezaei et al 2018 due to these merits of pmd process it is highly appealing to overcome the water energy nexus and produce purified freshwater in the off grid regions as a low cost low energy small footprint and portable system in the pmd system the primary part is the pmd membrane which must fulfill the requirements of the md membrane as follows rezaei et al 2018 1 the membranes should have sufficient hydrophobicity with a high liquid entry pressure of water lepw which prevent feed solutions from penetrating into membrane pores and achieve long term stability 2 the membranes should exhibit high vapor permeability and less vapor transfer resistance the membrane flux can be enhanced by increasing membrane pore size and porosity reducing membrane thickness and tortuosity 3 the membranes should possess appropriate thicknesses to offer less mass transfer resistance and lower thermal loss 4 the membranes should possess satisfactory anti fouling and anti scaling properties 5 the chemical and thermal stabilities of membrane materials are critical for their long term operation especially in the pmd process ashoor et al 2016 rezaei et al 2018 rice et al 2020 su et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 under solar radiation the membrane materials may be degraded or decomposed which could dramatically impair their performance and stability apart from these key membrane properties for conventional md process the thermal efficiency is essential for pmd membranes jun et al 2019 the photothermal efficiency η can be defined as the ratio between the energy utilized to generate vapor and total energy input by solar radiation which can be estimated by the following equation li et al 2019 1 η m h vap c opt p 0 where m is the water flux in steady state kg m 2 h 1 hvap is the total enthalpy change due to liquid to vapor phase transition j kg 1 p0 is the solar irradiance at sea level at a given latitude on a cloudless day around 1 0 kw m 2 copt is the optical concentration factor 3 photothermal materials and their light to heat conversion mechanisms the performance of pmd process is closely related to the incident light adsorption properties and light to heat conversion efficiencies of photothermal materials incorporated in the pmd membranes besides the broadband light absorption and photothermal efficiency the appealing photothermal materials should be low cost and easily manufacturable table 1 summarizes various types of photothermal materials utilized to fabricate pmd membranes the photothermal materials can be generally divided into four categories i plasmonic particles such as silver ag aluminum al and gold au nanoparticles nps ii inorganic semiconductor materials such as metal oxides and metal sulfides iii carbon based materials such as carbon black cb and carbon nanotubes cnts iv polymer materials such as polydopamine pda chen et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 2 a when the frequency of incident photon matches the oscillation frequency of delocalized electrons in the metal nps plasmon resonance is triggered which excites free electrons and produces hot electrons the hot electrons oscillate in the electromagnetic field to generate heat chang et al 2016 chen et al 2019 however the critical challenge of these plasmonic metal nps is that they only absorb ultraviolet light wavelengths instead of broader wavelengths which reduce their light to heat efficiency chen et al 2019 therefore metal nps need to be tuned with specific shape size and nanostructure or combined with other photothermal materials to broaden the absorption wavelength for example the metal nps such as au ag and al have been modified into different sizes and shapes to improve their photothermal efficiency liu et al 2015 xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the nanomaterials with core shell structures have been developed for achieving broader light absorption and higher light to heat conversion properties due to the synergistic effects of different materials wu et al 2019 for instance hedayati et al developed a ssg with a nanocomposite au sio2 upper layer which can absorb 100 wavelength range from ultraviolet to near infrared light which was attributed to the combined light absorbing abilities of metal nanoparticle au and semiconductor sio2 hedayati et al 2012 in addition to the high cost metal nps low cost and low toxic inorganic semiconductors have been utilized for ssg and pmd membranes fabrication wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b there is a forbidden band between valence and conduction bands in semiconductor materials when the incident light energy is greater than or equal to the band gap of semiconductor the electrons in the valence band transit to the conduction band and generate electron hole pairs these electron hole pairs above the band gap relax to the edge of the band gap converting extra energy into heat chen et al 2019 shi et al designed a solar evaporation system using semiconductor material fe3o4 shi et al 2017 the magnetic fe3o4nps effectively captured light converted photo energy into thermal energy heat and accelerated water evaporation besides some emerging two dimensional semiconductor materials such as mos2 mxene and black phosphorus have been utilized as photothermal materials for ssg and pmd processes guo et al 2018 tan et al 2018 moreover the carbon materials are widely used as photothermal materials because of their outstanding light absorption capabilities making them appear black jun et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 compared to plasmonic metals and semiconductors the carbonaceous materials display obvious advantages in terms of abundance scalability low cost and excellent stability chen et al 2019 jia et al 2017 in the carbonaceous materials a great amount of loose electrons can be easily excited from π orbital to π orbital under light gao et al 2019 as shown in fig 2c when the photon energy of incident light coincides with the electron transition in the molecule the electrons can be excited from the ground state with the highest occupied molecular orbital homo to a higher energy orbital with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo as the excited electron returns to its ground state homo heat can be released chen et al 2019 thus far carbon based materials including cb cnts and graphene have been utilized as photothermal fillers cui et al 2018 finnerty et al 2017 qi et al 2020 yang et al 2017 the light to heat conversion mechanism of polymers is similar to that of carbon based materials the photothermal polymeric materials are capable to absorb intensive light and convert it into heat with very little luminous loss for instance the environmentally benign pda a black viscous substance secreted by shellfish has been widely used as a photothermal material because of its adhesive ability to various substrates independent of their shape and material jiang et al 2017 another critical factor influencing the light absorbing property of photothermal materials is reflection it is suggested that photothermal materials could be fabricated with nano porous structures with multiple reflections within the pores which would maximize light absorbance efficiency jiang et al 2016 during the past decade the rapid development of novel photothermal materials and their micro nano structure design have successfully endowed photothermal materials with full solar spectrum adsorptions and high light to heat conversion efficiencies chen et al 2019 thanks to this progress the pmd process has the potential to offer safe freshwater using green solar energy in remote regions facing water and energy shortage in addition to photothermal materials the methods of their incorporation into pmd membranes and maximization of their effectiveness are also crucial 4 design and development of effective pmd membranes as summarized in table 1 the pmd membrane fabrication methods can be classified into one step preparation using mixed dope solutions and multi step surface modifications the photothermal materials should be homogenously dispersed in polymeric solutions prior to the one step fabrication method via non solvent induced phase separation nips or electrospinning which produce mixed matrix photothermal membranes besides the dual layer photothermal membranes can be obtained by localizing functional photothermal materials on the surface of hydrophobic membranes by post modifications such as vacuum filtration dip coating and spray coating zhang et al 2019 the advantages and disadvantages of each method are summarized in table 1 4 1 one step fabrication using mixed dope solutions in the one step fabrication methods the photothermal materials dispersed mixed dope solutions are fabricated into membranes by nips or electrospinning nips is a demixing process whereby the as prepared polymeric dope solution is transformed from a liquid to a solid state in a non solvent coagulation bath liao et al 2018 for instance politano et al developed a agnps embedded polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf composite membrane by nips politano et al 2017 the agnps were entrapped and well dispersed throughout the pvdf matrix as shown in fig 3 a with an increasing amount of agnps loaded into membrane the membrane color showed an obvious gradation from white to brown the uv lamp radiation could raise the surface temperature of agnps loaded pvdf membranes by 4 5 k while the temperature of unloaded pvdf membrane showed 2 5 k increase besides nips electrospinning has attracted special attention over the last decade as a facile method to obtain nanofibrous membranes liao et al 2018 compared to the membranes developed by phase inversion the electrospun membranes are composed of overlapped nanofibers which exhibit high porosity and specific surface area liao et al 2018 for example dongare et al has successfully developed a dual layer photothermal membrane dongare et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b a photothermal layer composed of polyvinyl alcohol pva cb nanofibers was electrospun on the commercial pvdf membrane surface the pva cb composite surface layer can ensure temperature difference across the membrane in the range of 14 20 c under solar irradiation in addition huang et al prepared photothermal pvdf antimony doped tin oxide ato composite nanofibrous membranes by incorporating ato a mixture of sno2 and sb2o3 with a certain mass ratio into pvdf nanofibers fig 3c huang et al 2019 it was found that the temperature on the ato loaded pvdf nanofibrous membrane surface could reach 93 8 c under infrared radiation the primary advantage of one step fabrication methods is that the photothermal materials can be homogenously dispersed and embedded in the polymeric membrane substrates therefore the risk of photothermal materials leakage into permeate water is eliminated meanwhile these methods are easy to scale up compared to post modification methods however it requires a great amount of highly costly photothermal materials which are buried under the membrane surface and do not contribute to the light to heat conversion efficiency 4 2 multi step surface modifications 4 2 1 vacuum filtration during the vacuum filtration process various photothermal materials can be easily deposited on the membrane surface in addition to facile nature of the operation the thickness of the coating layer can be easily controlled by volume and photothermal material concentration of the coating solutions as shown in fig 4 a a novel emerging 2d material mxene was synthesized and coated onto the surface of a commercial pvdf microfiltration mf membrane by vacuum filtration tan et al 2018 mxenes are transition metal carbides and nitrides with a formula of mn 1xntx gao et al 2020 the transition metals m with n 1 layers are interleaved with n layers of carbon or nitrogen where tx means various functional groups such as hydroxyl and chlorine due to the excellent optical absorption and photothermal efficiency of mxenes they are filtrated on the surface of pvdf membrane to provide a photothermal skin layer with localized heating property the infrared ir thermal image clearly demonstrated that the mxene coated pvdf membrane exhibited a significant temperature increase of 49 c after one min of 50 w led irradiation in addition to commercial membrane substrate the electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been used as promising substrates for vacuum coating photothermal layers as shown in fig 4b for pmd applications the fe3o4nps were vacuum filtered and uniformly distributed on the nanofibrous pvdf membrane surface li et al 2020 due to the high light absorption and photothermal conversion capacity of fe3o4nps the membrane surface temperature increased from 25 to 50 c in 10 min of illumination under 1 0 kw m 2 however these photothermal materials are non biocompatible and non biodegradable the disposal of which could pose great threat to the environment and ecosystem therefore the biocompatible biodegradable and abundant hydroxyapatite ha nanowires were developed for fabricating high performance pmd membranes as shown in fig 4c cao et al 2020 a highly efficient dual layer photothermal membrane was fabricated by filtering pda coated ha ha pda nanowires on the chitosan cs bonded ha nanowires substrate the dual layered architecture composed of flexible ha nanowires offered a highly porous network and a great amount of channels for vapor transportation after 1 0 and 9 0 kw m 2 irradiation for 120 s the surface temperatures of the bilayer membrane could reach around 46 and 245 c respectively this excellent photothermal property could be ascribed to the broadband light absorption of pda and interconnected porous architecture of nanowire structure which reflect light within the surface layer and ensure high light absorption although the vacuum filtration method possesses its unique merits such as easy operation the photothermal membranes prepared by vacuum filtration are difficult to scale up due to the limited size of the vacuum system additionally the thermal and chemical stabilities of the coating layers should be concerned as there are rare bonding forces between the surface layers and membrane substrates 4 2 2 spray coating the spray coating method is popular in coating various functional materials on membrane surfaces liao et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 a cb nps was spray coated on the surface of pvdf nanofibrous membrane to obtain a multilevel rough membrane with localized heating capacity gong et al 2019b the multilevel roughness and interconnected micro nano channels endowed the membrane with good light absorption improved vapor permeability and omniphobicity it could efficiently capture solar energy via multiple internal reflection the cb nps mediate localized heating layer could heat the membrane surface from 18 6 to 32 3 c within 150 s and stabilize the surface temperature to 41 6 c at 5 min under illumination with an intensity of 1 0 kw m 2 besides other carbon based nanotube and nanosheets nss were sprayed on hydrophobic microporous membrane surface to obtain efficient pmd membranes huang et al 2020a as shown in fig 5b to fabricate a polydimethylsiloxane pdms cnts pvdf membrane the cnts were spray coated on the electrospun pvdf membrane surface followed by post treatment hot pressing huang et al 2020a the produced membrane thus exhibited a cnts stacked morphology due to its broad light absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency the membrane displayed a stable temperature above 70 c under 1 0 kw m 2 illumination after a few minutes moreover the graphene nss were deposited onto ptfe membrane surface with pda and trichloro 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyl silane ftcs by spray coating as shown in fig 5c ghim et al 2021 the aggregated graphenes were accumulated on the ptfe membrane surface the resultant membrane can rapidly reach 52 c after 60 s of 0 75 kw m 2 illumination although the spray coating method is effective in coating functional materials on membrane surface the uniformity of coating layer is a concern besides the long term stability of spray coating layer should be considered 4 2 3 chemical modifications using polydopamine as a glue the mussel inspired polymer pda can be easily coated on various surfaces regardless of their surface energy and morphologies via self polymerization liao et al 2013 additionally pda has broad light absorption and excellent photothermal conversion properties moreover the low toxicity and biocompatibility of pda endow it with an environmentally friendly property for water treatment thus some works have utilized pda as a chemical modified layer or an intermediate glue for fabricating pmd membranes as shown in fig 6 a a pda layer was self polymerized on a commercial pvdf mf membrane wu et al 2018 the pda activated membrane was subsequently modified to be hydrophobic using ftcs as shown in fig 6b and c the ftcs modified membrane ftcs pda pvdf clearly displayed a uniform microporous surface the ir images demonstrated fig 6d that the surface temperature of dry ftcs pda pvdf membrane would promptly increase from 20 to 35 ⁰c under irradiation with an intensity of 0 75 kw m 2 and 97 c at 7 0 kw m 2 which were the best among pda pvdf ftcs pvdf and ftcs pda pvdf membranes in addition to serving as a photothermal surface layer itself the pda layer can be used as an intermediate layer grafted on other photothermal materials qilin li and her group have attached sio2 au nss and cb nps on the commercial pvdf membrane surface using pda as the glue chen et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the hierarchical structure of cb nps on membrane surface not only absorbed light and provided localized heating for pmd but also endowed the membrane with an omniphobic property after the 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane fas17 coating the enhanced thermal efficiency and excellent anti wetting property make the membrane highly competitive for pmd applications more efficient photothermal materials can be grafted on the surface of membrane substrates with the assistance of pda in the future 4 2 4 dip coating dip coating is a simple method to deposit photothermal materials on membrane surface by immersing membrane substrates into photothermal materials dispersed solutions an azobenzene dye disperse red 1 dr1 and non azobenzene dye disperse blue 14 db14 were dip coated onto commercial ptfe membranes to obtain pmd membranes fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 both red dyed and blue dyed membranes were active to convert irradiated visible light to heat which warmed the water on membrane surface and drove water vapor pass through the membrane pores han et al developed composite membranes from eggshells for pmd process han et al 2019 as shown in fig 7 the eggshell membranes esms were obtained by mold assisted vacuum drying eggshells which were then annealed to carbonized eggshell membrane cesm in order to obtain rgo wrapped eggshell membranes the esm was soaked in graphene oxide go dispersion followed by carbonization and go reduction the carbonized esm cnts membrane was fabricated by dipping the esms in a precursor solution followed by cnts growth solution the cesm and rgo wrapped esm presented similar porous morphologies while the cnts functionalized membrane exhibited a fluffy structure covered by cnts due to the excellent light absorption feature of both cesm and cnts the cesm cnts showed a rapid temperature rising to 330 k which laid the foundation for its pmd application although dip coating can easily endow the membranes with photothermal properties the uniform distribution of the photothermal materials on substrates the thickness and stability of coating layers in long term use need further investigations especially under harsh conditions 5 evaluation of pmd performance in different configurations during the pmd process the light energy radiates on the pmd membrane surface in feed side triggers the light to heat conversion and helps to produce water vapor which transports through membrane pores and condenses on the permeate side the system efficiency not only depends on the pmd membrane but is also highly dependent on the system configuration such as the design of permeate collector based on different permeate sides characteristics pmd can be divided into dcmd based vmd based and agmd based configurations besides the multi level pmd configuration has been proposed to recover the latent heat and further enhance the photothermal efficiency of pmd system small pilot pmd systems were constructed to assess their potential for producing freshwater in remote communities without electrical grids the performance of the photothermal membranes in various pmd processes their operational and irradiation conditions are summarized in table 2 5 1 dcmd based pmd process similar to the conventional dcmd configuration the most studied pmd configuration involves direct application of solar illumination on membrane surface at the feed side while the permeate side is cold distilled water the cb pva coated pvdf dual layer membrane developed by li s group was tested in a dcmd based pmd process dongare et al 2017 in the pmd test conducted at room temperature 20 c the membrane obtained a permeate flux of 5 38 kg m 2 h 1 under the simulated illumination of 17 5 kw m 2 it was found that the pmd and conventional dcmd processes had obviously different temperature profiles as shown in fig 8 a and b in the dcmd process the temperature was the highest at feed inlet which provided the largest temperature gradient across the membrane during the pmd process as the feed temperature increased along with the feed flow channel the largest temperature difference was generated close to the feed outlet instead of inlet therefore in contrast to the conventional dcmd process the scale up of pmd membrane module could increase its permeate flux another advantage of pmd configuration is its modest flow velocity pmd is more efficient at a lower feed flow rate which allows sufficient time for water heating by illuminated membrane surface and thus a larger temperature gradient in contrast the conventional md configurations require a higher feed velocity to alleviate the negative effects from temperature polarization and concentration polarization liao et al 2013 2014 however the solar energy conversion efficiency of this system was only around 20 this unsatisfactory efficiency should be due to a dense photothermal surface layer with a thickness of 25 7 μm as the pvdf substrate layer was around 100 μm the additional cb pva layer increased the membrane thickness by 25 a photothermal layer with an appropriate higher thickness and a desirable structure could enhance the internal reflection and improve the photo thermal conversion efficiency especially in ssg systems the structural engineering of photothermal layer with rough surfaces or straight pores can enhance light absorption by multi scattering effects distinctive from the ssg where water evaporate on the surface of the photothermal layer the water vapor generated in the pmd process need to pass through the photothermal layer and membrane substrate and finally condense at the permeate side thus a thick photothermal layer could result in higher mass transfer resistance of the pmd membranes an environmentally benign material ha nanowires was vacuum filtered on the chitosan membrane with pda to obtain a dual layer photothermal membrane cao et al 2020 the resultant membrane exhibited an excellent photothermal efficiency of 62 and a water flux of 0 89 kg m 2 h 1 under 1 0 kw m 2 irradiation the pda wrapped ha nanowires formed an intertwined network with numerous channels for vapor transportation meanwhile as shown in fig 8c it was demonstrated that a thermal insulation layer is also critical to maintain a high temperature difference across the membrane the heat transferring through the membrane could raise the temperature on the permeate side which would reduce the temperature gradient across the membrane the loss of driving force could be minimized by a thermal insulator layer additionally other functional properties such as superhydrophobic omniphobic anti scaling bactericidal properties have been bestowed to pmd membranes gong et al 2019b huang et al 2020b li et al 2020 tan et al 2018 wu et al 2021 the superhydrophobic pdms mwcnt pvdf pmd membrane could achieve a water flux of 0 65 kg m 2 h 1 for a 3 5 wt nacl solution under 1 0 sun illumination huang et al 2020b an omniphobic pmd membrane developed by immobilizing nps on nanofibrous membranes could yield a water flux of 9 01 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar intensity of 10 0 kw m 2 gong et al 2019b the membrane also displayed excellent anti fouling and anti wetting properties when treating oil contaminated and highly saline solutions which should be attributed to having the lowest contact area between membrane surface and feed solutions besides the mxene coated pvdf membrane exhibited better antibacterial and anti biofouling properties during the pmd operation tan et al 2018 this is due to the weaker hydrophobic interaction and greater electrostatic repulsion between mxene and foulants moreover the bacterial nanocellulose coated pmd membrane showed interfacial photothermal disinfection property for killing bacteria which is able to prolong the membrane lifespan wu et al 2021 in spite of these advances in the dcmd based pmd process as both membrane surfaces keep contact with hot feed and cold permeate solutions in this configuration the effective temperature difference across the membrane is reduced due to the membrane thermal conductivity the vmd or agmd based pmd configurations can potentially minimize the heat loss by modifying the permeate side 5 2 vmd based pmd process in the vmd based pmd configuration the simulated light is illuminated on the membrane surface at the feed side while a vacuum pressure is applied on the permeate side to extract vapor outside of the system as shown in fig 9 a politano et al 2017 the vacuum system can promote transportation and collection of generated vapor as the condensation of water conducts outside the membrane module the insulation layer of membrane is not that crucial thus the photothermal materials incorporated mixed matrix membranes have been utilized in this system the agnps pvdf mixed matrix membrane prepared by nips showed notably increasing temperature on the membrane surface in a vmd based pmd system under ultraviolet light politano et al 2017 a permeate flux of 25 7 kg m 2 h 1 was obtained under the light intensity of 23 0 kw m 2 the agnps loaded pvdf membrane exhibited an eleven fold higher flux than the unloaded pvdf membrane for a 0 5 m nacl feed solution compared to a standard ro filtration system the vmd based pmd prototype achieved an energy reduction of 25 in addition huang et al prepared the ato loaded nanofibrous membrane for the vmd based pmd process huang et al 2019 before and after the infrared lamp was turned on the membrane permeation flux increased from 8 0 to 27 0 kg m 2 h 1 it was demonstrated that the photo energy effectively raised the temperature on membrane surface mitigated the influence from temperature polarization and enhanced membrane permeate flux the vmd based pmd can alleviate the reduction of temperature difference caused by membrane thermal conduction and can result in higher permeation flux however due to the vacuum pressure on the permeate side this process has much stricter requirements for anti wetting properties of membranes 5 3 agmd based pmd process as shown in fig 9b during an agmd based pmd test the vapor generated on the membrane surface need to pass through hydrophobic membrane pores transport through an air gap and finally condense as produced water a dye modified ptfe membrane has been utilized in an agmd based pmd configuration fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 the membrane could achieve a permeable flux of 0 78 kg m 2 h 1 under simulated sunlight at 1 0 kw m 2 zhang et al developed a high performance tin pva pvdf membrane for agmd based pmd process zhang et al 2020 a final permeation flux was 0 94 kg m 2 h 1 and a solar energy conversion efficiency of 64 1 were obtained under 1 0 kw m 2 solar irradiation the permeate water exhibited a potable quality proving that pmd technology is promising for providing fresh water in remote off grid and less developed regions although the agmd based pmd configuration reduces heat loss and alleviates membrane wetting tendency due to its air gap layer the permeate flux of this configuration is usually low due to the additional mass transfer resistance from the air gap 5 4 multi level pmd processes in order to further enhance thermal efficiency novel pmd configurations with latent heat recovery systems have been developed as shown in fig 9c huang et al designed a dual layer pmd device huang et al 2020a in the first layer the upper part has a water channel with a height of 2 mm while the bottom is a condensate pool composed of several aluminum pieces for steam condensation the first layer was separated by a pdms cnt pvdf membrane and a stainless steel support net the second layer was insulated by a pva foam for delivering seawater by capillary action the condensed heat is recycled in the second layer to heat seawater absorbed by pva sponge which drove an additional md process the dual layer pmd system could achieve a water permeation flux of 1 42 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar illumination of 1 0 kw m 2 which was 0 9 kg m 2 h 1 for the single level pmd structure additionally the pmd systems with multiple latent heat recovery systems have been constructed to further raise thermal efficiency as shown in fig 9d ghim et al synthesized a graphenenanosheets pda ftcs deposited ptfe membrane for a multi layer stacked pmd system ghim et al 2021 owing to its photothermal property the membrane surface had a higher temperature than the water in contact with its surface which impelled water vapor to pass through the membrane and condense on the cold plate beneath the surface the latent heat from vapor condensation transferred to the cold feed water under an aluminum foil and thus created another temperature gradient across the hydrophobic ptfe membrane on the lower layer which drove another md process the water vapor generated due to the recovered latent heat was subsequently condensed at the bottom layer by optimizing the air gap thickness and stacking multiple heat recovery layers a water flux of 1 17 kg m 2 h 1could be achieved under the simulated solar illumination of 0 75 kw m 2 which is equivalent to the solar intensity under cloudy sky although the multi layer stacked pmd system can obtain outstanding thermal efficiency by recovering latent heat the photothermal layers are still under feed water in the above systems the water layer as a physical barrier can significantly reduce the intensity of incident light arriving at the photothermal layer due to refraction and reflection meanwhile in these underwater configurations the photothermal materials deposited on the membrane surface need sufficient adhesion with membrane surface and robust mechanical stability to avoid material release into produced water as shown in fig 9e a new multi level pmd system was designed to separate photothermal membranes from feed water xue et al 2018 in this system the saline water was adsorbed by pva sponge to the bottom surface of a photothermal membrane where it generated vapor under solar irradiation the vapor then passed through a hydrophobic membrane and condensed on the collector the first collector acted as a thermal source to heat the next stage pva sponge which helped generate the vapor passing through the next hydrophobic membrane the vapor was then condensed in the second collector due to the latent heat cycle this system achieved water productivity of 1 02 kg m 2 h 1 with a solar efficiency of 72 under 1 0 kw m 2 illumination the previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of enhancing thermal efficiency through latent heat recovery in these multi level pmd systems as the feed water is circulated by automatically absorbing via hydrophilic materials in the multi level pmd systems these systems are highly competitive as point of use apparatus for emergency situations and offshore seawater desalination therefore among various pmd configurations the multi level pmd systems are more suitable for small scaled practical applications due to high thermal efficiency and simple facility 5 5 pilot scaled pmd applications besides the lab scaled trial experiments a few studies have been conducted to estimate the potential practical applications of pmd technology by small pilot scaled systems as shown in fig 10 a and b a pmd reactor with a two flow chamber was constructed to demonstrate its desalination capacity under different solar intensities said et al 2019 the pilot system is composed of a 1 5 mm top channel between a transparent window and pmd membrane and a 1 0 mm bottom channel to vacuum draw the water vapor outside of the membrane module the feed water evaporated at the interface of feed solution and membrane transported through membrane pores and collected in the permeate reservoir this pilot system was equipped with a solar panel to provide electricity for pumping feed water it could achieve a water flux around 0 12 kg m 2 h 1 under cloudy condition and 0 77 kg m 2 h 1 under sunny condition with a salt rejection rate of 99 8 when treating a 40 g l nacl solution additionally a pilot plant shown in fig 10c was constructed to verify the feasibility of pmd practical application li et al 2020 in this pilot system the permeate flux of fe3o4 pvdf hfp pmd membrane was increased by 11 from 19 73 to 21 99 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar irradiation intensity of 3 0 kw m 2 in contrast to the lab scaled model the performance enhancement of pilot scaled model was less significant due to shorter retention time under solar irritation shorter in situ heating time and more heat loss the performance of pilot pmd systems could be enhanced by using vmd or agmd based configurations to minimize the heating loss due to the heat exchange between feed and cold permeate sides chiavazzo et al constructed and tested a passive modular and low cost pmd system on the roof chiavazzo et al 2018 under the solar radiation of 0 6 kw m 2 the permeate flux of a ten stage distiller was 1 32 kg m 2 h 1 which exceeded the thermodynamic limit of the single stage solar distiller in order to further improve the thermal efficiency under natural sunlight the focusing optics were used to enhance the light intensity on the surface of the photothermal membrane as shown in fig 10d halas et al used a fresnel lens to concentrate sunlight by 25 times which achieved a higher flux of 5 20 kg m 2 h 1 compared to the unfocused case 0 22 kg m 2 h 1 dongare et al 2017 these low cost passive potable and easy to implement pmd systems are particularly suitable to provide freshwater in emergency situations or in offshore and remote off grid areas the thermal efficiencies of these pmd systems could be further enhanced by improving the system designs recovering latent heats optimizing photothermal efficiencies of pmd membranes mitigating membrane fouling and scaling in long term operation 6 effects of operational parameters and module designs besides the photothermal membrane characteristics the operational conditions and designs of membrane modules could affect the performance of pmd process the key operational conditions in the pmd process mainly include the feed velocity temperature and composition the effects of the operational conditions in permeate side are similar as conventional md processes while the effects of feed velocity on membrane performance are opposite for pmd and md dongare et al 2017 wu et al 2018 the thermal efficiency of pmd process is higher at a lower feed velocity while the permeate flux in conventional md processes could be improved at a higher feed velocity due to alleviation of temperature polarization a lower feed velocity allows sufficient time to heat feed solutions by the pmd membrane and thus generate a larger temperature gradient across membrane resulting in a higher distillate flux meanwhile the heat loss from the feed solution layer on membrane surface to the bulk solution would be faster at a higher feed velocity the operation of pmd system at a modest feed velocity would be a significant superiority over conventional md systems additionally the effects of auxiliary feed heating on permeate flux were investigated by huang et al 2020b the feed solution was pre heated to 30 50 c prior to entering into pmd membrane module the permeate flux increased with the increasing feed temperature which was similar as the conventional md processes when the membrane module was irradiated under the light with an intensity of 1 kw m 2 the membrane flux could be enhanced this increment suggests that the pmd process can be combined with auxiliary heating systems to further improve performance for example the wind energy and industrial waste heat can be used to further reduce energy consumption and cost of pmd systems moreover the complex compositions of real feed solutions may foul and wet the pmd membranes at a lower operational temperature of pmd process the calcite and gypsum scalants tend to remain dissolved in the feed solution than deposition on membrane surface rice et al 2020 meanwhile the precipitation kinetics of these scalants are slower at a lower temperature which delay the scaling on membrane surface thus membrane scaling is lower in pmd process than conventional md processes besides the wetting resistance of pmd membrane towards surfactant solutions was investigated by chen et al 2020 the better anti wetting property of the pmd membrane was due to the spherical re entrant structures of the photothermal coating layer the re entrant structure could effectively support the liquid vapor interface and prevent the adsorption of surfactants in membrane pores which subsequently restrained membrane wetting the designs of membrane modules also have influences on the permeate flux of the pmd systems as the feed solution is heated by the light to heat conversion on the pmd membrane surface the feed temperature increases along the feed flow channel due to longer heating time thus the temperature difference on the feed outflow side is the largest increasing the size of the membrane module should be beneficial to the permeate flux dongare et al 2017 besides the membrane module design decides the depth of the water layer on pmd membrane surface at the feed side a thicker water layer at the feed channel could reduce the amount of solar energy absorbed by the photothermal layer because of refraction and scattering thereby reducing the photothermal efficiency li et al 2020 furthermore the thickness of the photothermal layer and concentration of the photothermal materials on the pmd membrane surface affect its photothermal efficiency as illustrated in section 5 1 the light to heat conversion efficiency could be enhanced by a thicker photothermal layer with a desirable structure due to multiple reflections wang 2018 however a thicker photothermal layer might have negative effects on the permeate fluxes as it could block the membrane pores and increase water vapor mass transfer resistance chen et al 2020 meanwhile an increasing concentration of photothermal materials could absorb more light leading to higher light absorption coefficients dongare et al 2017 it was found that the quasi steady state surface temperature of pmd membrane could increase from 42 4 to 48 0 c when the coated cb concentration was increased from 0 2 to 1 0 wt chen et al 2020 a higher cb loaded membrane showed a membrane flux enhancement by 54 9 while the membrane with a lower cb concentration showed a lower flux increasing by 9 5 7 challenges and perspectives the potential applications of pmd technology have been well demonstrated in previous research works in spite of these remarkable achievements there are still some critical challenges hindering its large scaled applications as follows it is unreliable to compare the photothermal efficiency of different pmd membranes and systems based on their reported values because they were obtained under different experimental conditions some pmd systems were operated under simulated sunlight having much higher intensity e g 10 kw m 2 than natural irradiance making it impossible to operate efficiently under either sunny condition 1 0 kw m 2 or cloudy weather 0 75 kw m 2 therefore a uniform and scientific evaluation methodology is necessary to make reasonable and fair comparison of the performances from different systems although the pmd systems have achieved higher thermal efficiencies around 60 than conventional md processes below 10 they are still lower than the those of ssg systems up to 90 the previous works reported that most pmd membranes exhibited a water flux below 1 0 kg m 2 h 1 under the sunny condition 1 0 kw m 2 and just few cases using multi level pmd systems can reach or exceed 1 0 kg m 2 h 1 therefore more works should be carried out to develop photothermal materials with effective light adsorption and efficient light to heat conversion in addition the photothermal layer surface can be endowed with micro nano rough structures or straight pores to maximize the light multi scattering within the surface layer minimize light transmittance and reflection enhance light absorption and photothermal efficiencies moreover the fundamental understanding of the underlying membrane structure property relationships is still absent the behaviors and kinetics of light adsorption vapor generation and transportation and thermal diffusion of pmd membranes are essential to guide future pmd membrane designs simulation and real time monitoring could be effective approaches to obtain insights into the fundamental principles the stability of pmd membranes needs demonstration prior to commercialization ahmed et al 2019 as light to heat conversion is directly conducted on the membrane surface the membrane surface will be heated to a much higher temperature than conventional md membranes since most membrane materials are polymers they may be degraded and fail when exposed to sunlight for a long time thus the stability and life cycles of pmd membranes should be examined more endeavors should be conducted to study and improve the long term photothermal stability of pmd membranes by structure designs and surface coating the robust attachment of photothermal nanoparticles on membrane surface is another critical issue for practical applications the detachment of nanoparticles during the long term pmd operation not only impair membrane photothermal efficiency but also threaten the environmental safety as secondary pollutions therefore the strong adhesive force between the functional nanoparticles and membrane substrate under outdoor conditions in long term operations should be fully evaluated more research works should be conducted to systematically investigate the membrane wetting fouling and scaling in the pmd process especially in the treatment of brine water and hazardous wastewater with complex compositions in particular the fouling and scaling layers on the pmd membrane surface are able to significantly reduce its light to heat efficiency the anti fouling properties of pmd membranes can be enhanced by endowing membrane surfaces with super liquid repellent properties such as superhydrophobicity and underwater superoleophobicity pmd membranes can be endowed with other functions such as antimicrobial and catalysis in the future the applications of multi functional pmd membranes can be expanded in more fields disinfection catalysis and etc linking water energy and environment in a mutually beneficial way apart from pmd membrane optimization there are still gaps among lab scaled and pilot scaled pmd applications although high photothermal efficiencies can be obtained from lab scaled set ups the thermal efficiencies of pilot scaled pmd systems using natural light still need improvement zheng et al 2018 in addition the pilot scaled membrane module design especially the design of feed channel is critical for pmd applications the spiral wound or hollow fiber membrane modules are not able to have sufficient membrane surface area to receive adequate light thus it is suggested to use plate and frame membrane modules for pmd membranes moreover in order to efficiently operate at cloudy day and night the solar photovoltaic panels could be installed into pmd systems to store solar energy as electricity which can be used for driving the process by heating the feed solutions or joule heated md membranes zuo et al 2020 besides the scalability low costs of pmd membranes and systems are critical to evaluate the competitiveness of this technology the recent studies of pmd did not provide the costs of as developed membranes and systems which make it difficult in estimating their competitiveness compared to conventional desalination technologies in the field of desalination and water treatment in remote communities design and development of novel membranes and systems would further lower their costs and warrant their applications especially in off grid areas 8 conclusions in this article recent studies about the emerging pmd technology including its mechanisms photothermal materials and light to heat conversion mechanisms fabrication of pmd membranes and their evaluation in different pmd configurations as well as the challenges and future perspectives are comprehensively summarized and discussed the pmd technology integrates the photothermal process with existing md technology it uses abundant and sustainable solar energy to localize heating on pmd membrane surface via the photothermal effect and create the temperature gradient across the membrane thereby driving the process and obtaining distillate water the localized heating solves some key issues of conventional md processes such as low thermal efficiencies and temperature polarization the pmd technology is not desired to replace conventional desalination technologies such as conventional md reverse osmosis ro or electrodialysis ed instead pmd is a promising technology that targets as a potable water treatment instrument in rural and off grid communities where electricity or waste heat are not accessible although the last few years have witnessed rapid progress in research activities regarding the pmd process for seawater desalination and wastewater treatment it is still in the initial stage of both academic studies and industrial applications it is envisioned that the comprehensive review presented here can inspire more researchers to further explore this novel technology address its current issues and advance its rapid development for practical applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
