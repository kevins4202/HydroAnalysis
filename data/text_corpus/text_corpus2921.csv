14605,hand drawn batik wastewater has the specific characteristics of intense color alkaline ph low cod and bod contents 800 and 500mg l respectively and may pose environmental and human health risks chemicals used in dyeing and dewaxing processes i e dye wax alum sulfate and starch will influence chemical characteristics of wastewater generated the integration of bioequalization and electrocatalytic was attempted in the present study as a feasible technology to treat these pollutants bioequalization tank of 18m3 was inoculated with 10 v v seed sludge equipped with four uniformly distributed feeding pipes and subsequently connected to an electrocatalytic reactor of 1 2m3 capacity ti ruiro2 anode and stainless steel cathode were used in the system with an electrode gap of 30mm the effluent was able to meet the discharge standard of local regulation at hrt of 48h in bioequalization and electrolysis operating conditions 5v potential ph 5 4000mgl 1 salt concentration and electrolysis time of 90min the electrode materials were potentially deactivated due to surface enclosure and metal decomposition particularly ruthenium keywords wastewater hand drawn batik dyes bioequalization electrocatalytic 1 introduction hand drawn batik is an artistic commodity and one of the oldest cultural products of indonesia batik industries are scattered across 38 regions in java island and are concentrated in several specific areas i e solo pekalongan tegal lasem and banyumas most of them are home based and small scale industries with no wastewater treatment plant batik has been recognized by unesco united nations educational scientific and cultural organization as one cultural heritage of indonesia 1 this resulted in an increasing number of batik industries in other regions with their own signature patterns aside from its contribution to the rapid economic development batik industries also have various negative environmental impacts due to wastewater generated batik wastewater is generally originated from soaking boiling and rinsing processes most of which discharged into rivers or nearby streams without proper treatment resulting in environmental and health problems 2 kant et al 3 stressed the large volumes of wastewater and high content of pollutants contained such as dyes starch alum sulfate and wax resulting in characteristics of high ph cod tss and intense color the presence of dyes in wastewater may cause severe damage to the aquatic environment 4 5 this is because of their synthetic origin and complex molecular structure which make them more stable and difficult to be degraded 6 the large amounts of wastewater with a high concentration of pollutants requires extensive treatment before being discharged into the environment physicochemical methods such as chemical precipitation ultrafiltration carbon adsorption coagulation flocculation and ozone oxidation have been applied for batik wastewater treatment however those methods either are costly to be applied in a full scale reactor or produce a considerable amount of sludge 7 rashidi et al 8 utilized a baffle separation tank as an innovative pre treatment method for batik wastewater treatment and succeeded in removing wax sodium silicate and dyes for 92 32 and 2 respectively advanced oxidation processes photocatalytic have been studied for textile wastewater treatment containing highly colored organic compounds 9 11 resulting in organic dyes removal another study also reported a complete decolorization of batik dye wastewater within three h and 80 cod reduction 12 subramaniam and halim 13 employed electrochemical oxidation method and was able to remove cod up to 89 71 according to mukimin et al 14 electrooxidation advanced process eoap was driven by oxidators generated at the anode i e hclo oho and s2o8 2 the reaction of this process is described as follows 1 dyes hclo co2 h2o cl2 2 dyes ooh co2 h2o 3 dyes s2o82 co2 h2o 2so4 2 this pathway mechanism is known as indirect oxidation degradation of dyes by short lived species e g oho may be restricted only to anode surface and long lived oxidants such as free chlorine hclo can diffuse away from the electrode surface to promote the bulk 15 they also explained that oxidation mechanism was significantly affected by electrode material active and non active when using an active anode a strong interaction between the electrode m and the adsorbed ohoo occur and the equation of electrodegradation is as follows 4 m h2o m oho h e 5 m oho mo h e 6 mo r m ro 7 mo m ½ o2 side reaction meanwhile non active electrode participates in the electrooxidation as an inert material in which the process is mediated by oho it is also in competition with the reaction of oxygen evolution 8 m oho r m mco2 nh2o h e 9 m oho m ½ o2 h e the combined process of biology and advanced oxidation is a promising treatment system for specific wastewater such as batik therefore this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of integrated technology of bioequalization and electrocatalytic for hand drawn batik wastewater treatment equalization tank inoculated with microorganism as an innovative pre treatment with numerous advantages i e ability to achieve uniformity degrade starch and separate wax and alum sulfate electrocatalytic reactor will be subsequently employed to degrade dye pollutant through an oxidation process this integration system may become a reliable and attractive option to be applied in small industries with limited space ph and retention time were determined as process variables investigated in the electrolysis process the data of electrode morphology were thoroughly analyzed to inquire the stability of electrocatalytic reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials batik wastewater was collected from soaking boiling dan rinsing processes of a batik industry located in sragen central java indonesia it was then fed to bioequalization tank of 18m3 capacity dimension 4 2x 2 25m four pipes 3 in were installed at the bottom of the tank to evenly distribute wastewater bioequalization tank was started up at an hrt of 48h and inoculated with immobilized anaerobic sludge up to 10 of tank volume the characteristics of seed sludge are summarized in table 1 electrocatalytic reactor 1 2m3 consisted of six vertical tubes capacity of 200l each was equipped with a mixer and a pair of electrodes 30mm of electrode gap was applied as a secondary treatment unit the integration system was depicted in fig 1 ti ruiro2 cylinder anodes ø 100mm ℓ 850mm were obtained from baoji changli special metal co ltd the electrodes were of the same material as those used in our previous application 14 in which the metal oxide layers were of rectangular shapes with a fairly similar size of 10μm and amorphous ph value was adjusted using technical grade sulphuric acid domestic grade salt was supplemented to supply chloride in the electrolysis process 2 2 experimental procedure wastewater was fed to inoculated bioequalization tank to ensure its uniformity and reached desired retention time pollutant reduction efficiency was determined based on the comparison of wastewater quality before and after treatment concentrations of cod bod tss ammonia sulfide phenol and oil were used as indicators of process efficiency pre treated wastewater was then pumped to feeding tank by means of a water pump shimidzu ps 230 bit to achieve hydraulic retention time of 60 90 120 150 and 180min and then subsequently supplemented with salt 4000mg l and sulphuric acid to achieve desired initial ph 3 5 7 9 effluents were collected and measured continuously 2 3 analysis for tss bod nh3 h2s phenol and oil determination standard method was used apha awwa 2540d 5210b 5220 b 4500 nh3f 4500 s2 d 5530c 5520c chemical oxygen demand cod was determined using a modified method for samples with high salinity according to vyrides and stuckey 16 decolorisation process was studied using spectrophotometer uv vis shimadzu u 1800 at a wavelength of 617 5nm physical and chemical properties were monitored regarding composing element and surface morphology by sem edx jeol jsm 6360la dan carl zeiss evo 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 waste removal in bioequalization tank characteristics of wastewater processed in this research are shown in table 2 high biodegradability index bod cod ratio of 0 63 was due to the presence of starch and dissolved wax in wastewater based on the biodegradability index of wastewater processed it is clear that pre treatment employed in this research is more favorable as supported by literature reporting that complete biodegradation may be reached when the effluent shows a biodegradability index of at least 0 4 17 higher concentration of cod to bod is attributed to non biodegradable components such as dyes and other components used in batik making process whereas total suspended solids were dominated by either alum sulfate or sodium silicate and undissolved wax as it is observed in table 1 all pollutants contained in batik wastewater decreased significantly after biological treatment the result indicates the occurrence of biodegradation process in bioequalization tank significant bod and cod removal efficiencies of 76 and 67 respectively were observed at an average organic loading rate olr of 0 9kg codm 3 d 1 it implied an effective degradation by active microorganisms at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 48h it was possibly due to the presence of starch contained in wastewater which was previously reported as readily degradable carbohydrate and easily converted into co2 and h2o 18 it is also in accordance with the finding of another study reporting that starch was easier to be used as carbon source in anaerobic microbial cell metabolism and biomass growth 19 araujo et al 20 also mentioned that starch is a biodegradable hydrocarbon compound composed of two major components i e amylose a mostly linear α d 1 4 glucan and amylopectin a α d 1 4 glucan a drastic reduction of total suspended solids 72 was also observed it was possibly due to the separation of settleable components such as alum sulfate sodium silicate and floatable wax based on these findings it is evident that bioequalization tank was able to function as biodegradation and equalization tank simultaneously it was presumed that at hrt of 48h anaerobic degradation and settling processes occurred in parallel meanwhile starch contributed to tss level in wastewater was already decreased due to biodegradation process 3 2 performance of electrocatalytic reactor 3 2 1 effect of electrolysis time it can be ascertained that pollutant contained in bioequalization effluent derived from the remaining undegraded compounds and it is likely to be in the form of inorganic compounds dyes or intermediate products of anaerobic degradation dye is one of the pollutants that is difficult to treat and highly toxic 21 22 it was visually evident from the color of bioequalization effluent whereas the opposite behavior was observed for electrocatalytic reactor effluent which achieved an outstanding performance in decolorization color removal was faster in electrolysis process 65 in 30min and complete solution decolorization 94 was achieved in 180min however our previous studies were able to achieve higher performance of decolorization 99 23 it is possibly due to substantial differences of wastewater treated in our previous experiments wastewater treated were comprised of reactive dyes only meanwhile actual batik wastewater processed in this research comprised of more complicated and varied dyes i e remazol naphthol indigosol and several natural dyes pollutant elimination performance of electrocatalytic reactor was also evaluated based on cod removal efficiency it was gradually increased from 32 at 30min to 62 at 180min this finding indicates the occurrence of degradation by advanced oxidation process aop either on dyes or other remaining pollutants such as intermediates of hydrocarbon compounds starch dissolved wax and alginic acid yang et al 24 mentioned that hydrolysis and acidification were two initial stages of anaerobic process in which solubilization of complex macromolecules and organic compounds took place initially producing micromolecules and simple soluble compounds such as acetic acid which then easily oxidized by hclo generated in the electrolysis process to co2 and h2o based on fig 2 it is clear that color removal was relatively faster than cod removal reduction of color intensity showed a cleavage of chromophore group λ 617 5nm this wavelength 617 5nm represents the existence of remazol remazol is classified as anthraquinone group or commonly known as anthra 9 10 quinone with three linear aromatic structures and a carbonyl group on its mid ring peak detected at 617 5nm is possibly due to the substitution of anthraquinone structure by phenylsulfon remazol was generally used by batik industries due to the high polarity of alkene which will subsequently form a bond with a hydroxyl group of cellulose from batik fabric chromophore is weaker than other bonds resulting in a faster and earlier breakdown therefore leading to a higher color removal efficiency 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph value of wastewater appears to have a considerable effect on color and cod removals as presented in fig 3 in acidic condition a significant increase in color removal efficiency was achieved 94 at ph 3 and 66 at ph 9 this result may be caused by several factors 1 ratio of cloh clo oxidators generated at anodes from electrolyte solution cl 2 the abundance of h ion and 3 bulk phase conductivity when ph was within the range of 3 0 8 0 chlorine is mostly present as hclo which is then subsequently converted to clo when ph is higher than 8 the oxidation performance of hclo is higher than clo clo cl2 hclo eo 0 89 1 36 1 49v vs she 25 the abundance of h ion at ph 3 will cause an impairment to electron donor on dye structure and also trigger an inter electrode charge transfer of cation anion while hydrogen and chloride transfer process to cathode and anode will take place ion transfer will significantly increase oxidator generation hclo and subsequently enhance dye degradation ph value also strongly influenced cod removal efficiency 37 at ph 9 and 53 at ph 5 low cod removal at ph 9 was possibly due to factors described above high cod removal achieved at acidic condition was possibly caused by the presence of another oxidant i e h2s2o8 sulfate so4 employed for ph adjustment would be oxidized into peroxodisulfate at the anode surface a non linear function of cod removal was observed at ph 3 the possible reason is the relatively higher amount of hclo than chloride while the oxidation potential of hclo is greater than chloride 3 2 3 pollutant removal efficiency pollutant degradation efficiency was not only evaluated based on color and cod but also on other main parameters such as tss bod nh3 h2s phenol and oil and grease as arranged in local regulation tss removal efficiency reached up to 81 in the electrocatalytic reactor due to physical process the electrode was effective in producing and releasing oxygen and hydrogen at anode and cathode respectively as a side reaction the equation of this process is as follows 10 2h2o l o2 g 4h aq 4 e 11 2h2o l 2e h2 g 2 oh aq the remaining insoluble substances in wastewater were effectively floated up by hydrogen and oxygen bubbles generated in the electrodes ammonia was significantly removed due to the reaction of ammonia and hypochlorite during the electrolysis process the reaction occurring in the anode solution can be expressed as follows 26 12 2nh4 3hclo n2 3h2o 5h 3cl where nitrogen liberated is a stable compound as shown in table 2 h2s removal was up to 96 for electrolysis time of 180min this significant result might be attributed to the oxidation of s 2 as suggested by wang et al 27 it was further confirmed by the decreasing current response during electrolysis and structural change of metal oxide surface as depicted in fig 4 it can be noted that high removal of phenol and oil was possibly attributed to the oxidation process occurred in the electrocatalytic reactor cl2 hclo clo or oho oxidators generated were highly efficient in organic degradation even in the form of aromatic compounds mukimin et al 23 demonstrated the termination mechanism of aromatic rings by oxidators generated from electrolysis process aside from this pathway oil was also possibly removed physically as hydrogen and oxygen bubbles generated would entrap and float oil to water surface which promote oil separation from wastewater effect of ph value in electrolysis process is another interesting aspect to be studied initial ph was adjusted in feeding tank at ph 5 which then slightly rose to 6 7 at the effluent point this increase was possibly caused by the oxidation of hydrogen ion into hydrogen gas at the anode the decreasing concentration of h would subsequently raise ph value this phenomenon gave an advantageous effect to the research as the effluent ph was able to meet the range of local regulation table 3 3 3 physical stability of electrode stability of electrode is an essential factor influencing the performance of electrocatalytic reactor a stable electrode will have a longer service lifespan and thus can be highly commercially profitable surface morphology and composing elements of an electrode are commonly employed as accurate and simple indicators to evaluate the stability of electrode fig 4 shows the images of metal oxide electrode before and after the electrocatalytic process it is clear that the electrode surface was thickened and enclosed fig 4a 1000x and fig 4b 30000x magnifications after three months of usage the possible reason is the existence of remaining solids that might be adsorbed on the surface of the electrode sulphur deposition and oxidation on anode are possibly two main factors promoting the enclosure of electrode oxygen evolution is a dominant mechanic factor inducing changes on oxide surface as ascribed by kasian et al 28 comninellis and chen 29 reported iro2 and ruo2 as active electrodes due to their high interaction with electro generated oho this mechanism may promote the decomposition of metal oxide material it is indicated by declining response current recorded in this research implying a drop in the efficiency of anodic process the decomposition of metal oxide is confirmed by the edx result as depicted in fig 5 ruthenium content was reduced significantly from 11 62 to 8 31 this finding could be ascribed to the relatively unstable characteristic of ru similar result was also reported by kasian et al in contrast iridium content was increased from 1 68 to 3 2 it is possibly caused by the relativity effect of content percentage towards oxygen and iridium based on this result it can be presumed that iridium has a high stability 4 conclusion dyes wax alum sulfate and starch used in dyeing and dewaxing processes are main pollutants contained in hand drawn batik wastewater integration of bioequalization and electrocatalytic is a proper technology to treat these pollutants at an average organic loading rate olr of 0 9kg codm 3 d 1 bioequalization can be used to degrade and remove starch and dissolved wax contained and significantly reduced tss 72 nh3 78 oil 39 in hrt 48h color was removed faster in electrocatalytic process 65 in 30min and complete solution decolorization 94 was achieved in 180min at operating conditions of potential 5v ph 5 and salt 4000mg l cod removal efficiency was gradually increased from 32 at 30min to 62 at 180min ti ruiro2 anode as the primary material of electrocatalytic reactor showed a gradually decreasing performance due to solids adsorption oxygen evolution and metal decomposition particularly ruthenium the effluent of this integrated

contrast iridium content was increased from 1 68 to 3 2 it is possibly caused by the relativity effect of content percentage towards oxygen and iridium based on this result it can be presumed that

14606,nitrate is a water pollutant whose removal from water is necessary to lessen pollution and prevent damage to life several conventional techniques such as adsorption ion exchange process reverse osmosis electrochemical chemical and biological methods have been developed for removal of nitrate however they have several limitations such as requirement of post treatment less efficiency and high installation costs the field of nanotechnology has observed tremendous growth in the past and has many environmental applications such as the use of nanomaterials for soil and water remediation filtration of pollutants water purification biosensors and in desalination recently nanotechnology has emerged as an excellent alternative for nitrate removal over conventional techniques nanomaterials due to their small size have large surface area and thus have high reactivity which enables them to be used as reducing agents and adsorbents this review focuses on the use of different nanomaterials especially nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers nanoshells nanoclusters and nanocomposites for removal of nitrate from an aqueous system the limitations of using such nanomaterials for removal of nitrate and possible techniques to overcome these limitations have been discussed as well keywords nitrate removal nanotechnology nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers 1 introduction water pollution is a major issue with several consequences on life on earth it is mainly caused by the industrial pollution and anthropogenic activities 1 in the past 200 years there have been significant changes in the global nitrogen cycle there is now increasing mobility and availability of nitrogen over large areas of earth apart from this inorganic nitrogen such as nitrates no3 enter the environment especially in aquatic systems through different anthropogenic activities such as agricultural and urban runoff usage of pesticides organic or inorganic compounds improper treatment of industrial wastes leaching of waste in groundwater and sewage effluents 2 7 nitrate concentrations above acceptable limit as given in international standards in various water sources is a major environmental concern all over the world this ion is found naturally and is the most stable form of combined nitrogen for oxygenated systems it also serves as an essential source of nitrogen for plants it is a widespread contaminant as it is highly water soluble 8 it also affects several drinking supplies and is known to cause eutrophication 9 10 at elevated levels it is known to cause many health complications such as methemoglobinemia 11 diabetes 12 and is also known to cause outbreak of infectious diseases they also adversely affect freshwater and marine animals with freshwater fishes being more susceptible to elevated nitrate levels in water 13 it also significantly affects cattle through nitrate poisoning 14 nitrate removal from environmental sources such as surface water bodies and ground water is thus essential for preventing such issues several techniques have been established for removal of nitrate from waste water adsorption 15 19 ion exchange process 20 electrochemical methods 21 23 reverse osmosis 24 biological methods 25 29 and chemical methods 30 are some of the conventional techniques implemented however these techniques have several limitations conventional adsorption techniques require proper selection of the adsorbent such that it is robust and can work under variable environmental conditions estimation of the adsorption efficiency reusability and disposal of the adsorbents with nitrate are also some of the major issues 16 ion exchange techniques require post treatment and are sensitive to various contaminants present in the water 31 reverse osmosis is also sensitive to contaminants other than nitrate it requires a specific amount of pressure and is also prone to biofouling biological and chemical methods cause toxicity in the water also installation of such techniques can be expensive nanotechnology can serve as an alternative for these conventional techniques nanotechnology is a field which deals with modification design and application of nanoscale objects 10 9 m it has various applications in food safety medicine cosmetic industries and electronics nanomaterials are synthesized through top down or bottom up approach out of which bottom up approach is a widely preferred technique as it offers greater size control and prevents the contamination of nanomaterials 32 33 they have excellent thermal mechanical optical structural and morphological properties which enable them to be used in different environmental applications in environment nanotechnology has been used in groundwater remediation and filtration of waste water to lessen its negative impacts on the ecosystem 34 35 it has also been used in energy production 36 37 pollution treatment and dye removal 38 40 in this review nitrate removal using nanotechnology has been discussed it is a comprehensive compilation of papers from past 12 years that have used nanotechnology for nitrate removal they have been accessed through scifinder google scholar and sciencedirect the criteria for the selection of the papers was such that they reported the use of different nanomaterials either with or without modification for the removal of nitrate from aqueous environment the nanomaterials used for nitrate removal possessed different reducing and adsorbing capabilities for nitrate this review is novel and such kind of work which solely focuses on the use of nanotechnology for nitrate removal has not been reported previously 2 mechanisms of nitrate removal nitrate in nature is usually formed as a denitrification product of nitrogen it is highly soluble in water and is unreactive fertilizers and other waste products that consist of nitrogen are decomposed to give ammonia followed by further oxidation to nitrate and nitrite nitrate is usually present in air water and food and is taken up by plants to synthesize organic nitrogenous compounds 41 despite being unreactive it can be microbially reduced to form nitrogen gas n2 and nitrogen monoxide n2o commonly used reducing agents include active metals ammonia borohydride formate hydrazine hydroxylamine hydrogen and iron active metals reduce nitrate to ammonia or nitrite in a basic solution while ammonia in an acidic solution reduces nitrate to nitrogen or nitrous oxide at high pressure and temperatures sodium borohydride forms nitrite and ammonia in the presence of metal alloys nitrate reduction can take place through energy methods such as electrochemical thermal or photocatalytic methods however simple chemical reduction reactions in aqueous solutions cannot efficiently remove nitrate 42 effective reduction takes place in the presence of powerful catalysts nanomaterials due to their small surface area have high catalytic properties and thus have excellent reducing potential nitrate on reduction releases ammonia nh3 nitrogen gas n2 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 the products formed differ based on the type of the nanomaterial used another common mechanism in nitrate removal is adsorption in adsorption method nitrate molecule is attached on the surface either through physisorption or chemisorption nanomaterials that have excellent adsorption properties possess two main properties their innate surface area and external functionalization 43 high surface area adsorption activity location of atoms on surface lack of internal diffusion resistance and high surface binding energy are also some of the factors that determine the adsorption capability of the nanomaterial 44 45 the adsorption capability of a nanomaterial is found through different isotherm and kinetic models table 1 shows the different nanomaterials used for nitrate removal along with the isotherm and kinetic models used the nanomaterials that have been used for nitrate removal are nanoparticles nanotubes nanoclusters nanoshells nanofibers and nanocomposites fig 1 the reducing capacity and adsorption efficiency may vary with each nanomaterial fig 2 shows the removal mechanisms of nitrate through different nanomaterials 3 nanomaterials for nitrate removal nanomaterials used till date for removal of nitrate are nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers nanoclusters and nanocomposites fig 3 gives a classification of the nanomaterials used for nitrate removal table 2 shows the different nanomaterials used for nitrate removal along with parameters such as initial nitrate concentration ph adsorbent dose and temperature it also compares the nitrate removal efficiencies of different nanomaterials table 3 shows the removal mechanisms of nitrate by the nanomaterials and the nitrate determination method 3 1 nanoparticles nanoparticles are in the range of 1 100nm and can be metallic semiconductor or polymeric they have various environmental applications such as microbial detection and monitoring source recovery and chemical degradation or environmental remediation they can effectively remove a wide variety of contaminants as well 46 they can be used as reducing agents or as adsorbents for various contaminants in soil or water due to their small size large surface area and excellent catalytic activity nanoparticles are emerging as an alternative to conventional treatments for removal of nitrate from wastewater they had been used either as a standalone system in the aqueous solution with or without coating or were immobilized on different supports fig 4 shows the different supports used for immobilization of nanoparticles 3 1 1 nanoscale zero valent particles nzvi iron nanoparticles nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has gained attraction worldwide due to their excellent catalytic activities and large surface area 47 48 these properties enable them to be used as a reducing agent some studies reported here have used nzvi as adsorbents as well bare nzvi i e nzvi which have been directly synthesized from its source without any modification are widely used for nitrate removal in a study nzvi had been synthesized through a natural reduction process of hydrothermal and natural goethite normally nzvi synthesis is an expensive process however when synthesized with natural sources such as natural and hydrothermal goethite the process becomes significantly cheaper on comparison of nzvi synthesized with natural and hydrothermal goethite with ordinary zerovalent iron it was found that ordinary nzvi showed a 90 removal rate at ph 1 but the removal rate drastically decreased to 10 at ph 6 while nzvi obtained from natural and hydrothermal goethite showed a removal rate of 95 1 and 91 3 respectively at ph 1 and this rate decreased to 72 4 and 83 5 at ph 8 increasing the initial nitrate concentration also affected the nitrate removal rates nzvi synthesized from natural goethite showed an increase in formation of ammonia with increase in time while very low concentration of nitrite was formed some of the nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas as well nzvi synthesized using natural and hydrothermal goethite was a cheap alternative and it showed much better nitrate removal rates than ordinary zerovalent iron 49 freshly synthesized nzvi dried nzvi and dried and sonicated nzvi have also been used for removing high concentrations of nitrate nitrate reduction using these nzvis were done at various conditions such as ph initial concentrations of nitrate and adsorbent dose there was barely any influence of ph on the reduction of nitrate as the reduction had occurred at an unspecific ph the nzvis reduced nitrate to ammonium and nitrite however the amount of nitrite produced was less and had reduced with time in case of fresh nzvi rapid nitrate reduction had occurred with 1mg ml of nitrate reduced within a minute in this case nitrite production increased to 5 in 20min in case of dried and sonicated nzvi the nitrite produced was nearly 7 50 in another study bare nzvis had been doped with gold copper and silver nanoparticles and were used for simultaneous removal of nitrate and cadmium cd contamination here the reactivity of nzvi to the co contaminants and by product formation was evaluated and it was found that nitrate reduction causes the ph of solution to increase and does not release ionic iron it also causes formation of negatively charged surface of nzvi and iron oxide also in absence of cd ii around 30 nitrate had been reduced however in the presence of 40mg l concentration of cd ii nitrate had been removed completely this could be due to the development of cadmium islands on nzvi in the presence of cd ii concentration of 40mg l 20 of the initial concentration of nitrate had been reduced significantly to ammonium while maintaining high cd ii removal rate a 3 reduction of the initial nitrate to nitrite had occurred by using nzvi doped with 1 wt of gold 51 nzvi has also been used in conjunction with other nanoparticles in order to increase nitrate removal ability in one such case nzvi had been used with magnetite nanoparticles for nitrate removal from groundwater a drastic reduction in the nitrate content was found which was proportional to the amount of magnetite nanoparticles added to the batch containing nzvi due to the magnetic nature of the magnetite nanoparticles they had evenly dispersed on the surface of nzvi these nanoparticles enhanced the corrosion rate of nzvi and facilitated electron transport for reduction of nitrate through nzvi ground water showed a faster nitrate reduction rate as compared to deionized water which could be due to adsorption of cationic compounds in water in the nzvi water interface another possible reason could be the development of a surface complex by the cations in the same interface the magnetite nanoparticles also enhanced the endurance of nzvi thus allowing it to complete four cycles of nitrate reduction 52 while bare nzvi or nzvi in conjunction with other nanoparticles showed good results in nitrate reduction and removal of co contaminants they still tended to aggregate aggregation causes reduction in the reducing ability of nzvi however this can be overcome by immobilizing them on supports by making bimetallic nanoparticles or by using an appropriate capping material to increase their stability and enhance their properties nzvi nanoparticles have been immobilized on various supports with increased nitrate reduction rates in one such case nzvi nanoparticles were immobilized on a macroporous alginate substrate mas in a two part procedure in which nzvis 26 06wt were synthesized through reduction and were dispersed on the fabricated mas this newly developed substrate with nzvi removed 96 5 of nitrate within 30min this was significantly better when compared to free nzvi which removed only 44 7 of nitrate the reaction products formed on nitrate reduction were ammonium and nitrite however no nitrogen gas was generated in case of unsupported nzvi in case of supported nzvi the nitrite produced disappeared after 30min while the ammonium concentration increased continuously in this case nearly 5 of nitrogen gas was generated under high ph nitrite and ammonium were produced while ammonia was stripped the mas prevented the agglomeration of nzvi which favoured its redox activity it was also hypothesized that the support prevented the agglomeration of the nanoparticles which exposed the highly reactive surfaces of these nanoparticles for reduction of nitrate 53 exfoliated graphite has been used as another support to immobilize nzvi for nitrate removal and used for nitrate removal through chemical reduction the nzvi nanoparticles were created using kbh4 as a reducing agent in a water ethanol environment batch experiments were conducted to study the effect of these particles on nitrate reduction at neutral ph condition 80mg l nitrate was removed within a span of 30min by the supported nzvi the high surface area of the support facilitated the dispersion of nanoparticles and prevented their agglomeration the main products of nitrate reduction in this case were ammonium and nitrite nitrite was formed in low quantity which slowly decreased before getting completely disappeared the reduction process was highly dependent on the ph with increased reduction occurring in acidic conditions 54 another carbon based support used to immobilize nzvi was nanographene which formed nzvi nanographene nanocomposite nzvis had homogenously distributed on the transparent nanographene surface the xrd x ray diffraction measurements showed that the nzvi alone had low stability but had greatly stabilized upon their support on the nanographene surface it also prevented nzvi from getting oxidized by providing electrons most of the nitrate ions were removed from solution using this nanocomposite in a mass ratio of 5 25 nzvi nanographene nzvi supported on nanographene surface enhanced the removal process by 125 1 when compared with nzvi alone the results showed that the removal process via catalytic reduction was driven by acid because optimum removal was obtained at lower ph values most of the nitrate ions could be removed within 16h at ambient conditions this time was shortened to 3h by ultrasonication the possible mechanism of nitrate reduction was that nitrate ions could be reduced to nitrite and or ammonium which then was reduced to nitrogen gas nitrate removal here involved 3 main steps adsorption reduction and desorption here also acidic conditions favoured nitrate reduction to form ammonia supporting nzvi on nanographene significantly heightened the nitrate removal because of enhanced surface area and stability and thus prevented their agglomeration and aggregation 55 another strategy to use nzvi for nitrate removal was through preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles bimetallic nanoparticles enhance the removal of nitrate along with other co contaminants the presence of co contaminants also affects the removal of nitrate for instance novel bimetallic fe ni iron nickel nanoparticles have been synthesized and supported on a kaolin base for removal of nitrates in the presence of copper ions a specific ratio of kaolin iron nickel k ni fe was fixed with kaolin serving as a support there was an increase in nitrate removal efficiency from 26 9 to 40 4 with increase in the concentration of copper ions 0 200mg l possible mechanisms for removal of these ions included adsorption on kaolin or iron oxides and the enhancement of denitrification due to a novel trimetallic catalyst fe ni cu formed 56 bimetallic nzvi nanoparticles also have the ability to degrade nitrate faster than monometallic nzvi in a study iron palladium fe pd nanoparticles were used for nitrate removal while nzvi here had the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite and ammonia pd nanoparticles enhanced nitrite reduction to non toxic nitrogen gas to further enhance the nitrate reduction by the bimetallic nanoparticles they were supported on a chelating resin dow 3n fe pd nanoparticles were supported on the resin through two ways by loading nzvi on the resin followed by pd loading and by loading pd first followed by nzvi loading bimetallic nanoparticles converted nitrate to nitrite and ammonium and nitrite was further converted to nitrogen gas or ammonium however the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen gas requires adsorption of hydrogen gas on the surface of the pd nanoparticles so that the oxygen gets removed thus forming nitrogen gas therefore the amount of pd loaded was directly related to the amount of nitrogen gas generated it was also found that increasing the ph of the solution increased nitrogen gas production the optimal ph was found to be 8 63 where the highest n2 selectivity was observed it was found that palladium content and the solution of ph can improve the selectivity to n2 the high selectivity to n2 was shown at 71 when the weight of the catalyst consisted of 8 nzvi and 8 palladium nanoparticles and ph was 8 67 57 in order to favour the production of non toxic nitrogen gas a combination of three metals was used copper cu nzvi pd nzvi cu palladium nzvi and pd cu nzvi were synthesized through chemical reduction and tested for nitrate removal the nanoparticles synthesized were in the range of 20 150nm and batch experiments were performed for nitrate removal the trimetal catalyst pd cu nzvi showed excellent ammonia suppression when the pd cu ratio was 2 1 a nitrate reduction of 63 was observed with this catalyst which is comparatively higher than the nitrate reduction observed with nzvi 56 pd cu 2 1 showed the highest selectivity to n2 nh4 formation nzvi served as an electron donor to the metals cu and pd and reacted with each molecule to produce hydrogen gas the cu surface had a high affinity towards nitrate and this nitrate molecule reacted with the hydrogen gas produced on its surface to produce nitrite the nitrite produced was further reduced to ammonium and nitrogen gas by the hydrogen adsorbed on the pd surface 58 bimetallic and trimetallic combinations with nzvi can also be immobilized on support to enhance nitrate removal rate in one such study nzvi cu manganese mn cu fe and mn fe were prepared and immobilized on a nay zeolite support natural or synthesized zeolite affect the incorporation and the catalytic activity of metals and catalysts into it these structures also have the ability to selectively ion exchange ammonia and improve nitrate removal while prohibiting release of ammonium into solution zeolite composites with immobilized nanoparticles showed 100 nitrate removal after 6h this may be due to the loading of the nanoparticles on both the surface and the inner layers during composite preparation the nitrate removal increased with increase in dosage of the composites i e the metal loaded zeolite supports the highest nitrate removal at 100 occurred at 4g l dose of the composites they also showed a much higher nitrate removal rate than the metals alone nitrate removal did not depend on acidic or alkaline conditions it showed high nitrate removal rates in both the states the kinetic data obtained fitted the best with the pseudo first order model 59 coating of nzvi with a capping agent or with a carbon based oxide layer is another method for nitrate reduction coating prevents agglomeration and increases the stability of the nanoparticles therefore enhancing their reducing ability fe ni and cobalt co nanoparticles have been coated with graphene oxide to form a composite for nitrate removal from water graphene oxide has properties like high stability large surface area high oxidizing potential and excellent magnetic property and this which enables them to be used in water remediation both sides of the sheets were utilizable and there were several functional groups on its surface this along with a surface negative charge ensured excellent dispersion of the nanoparticles on the graphene oxide surface a good dispersion is required for enhanced reduction of nitrate the nitrate removal rates after 8h for the immobilized nanoparticles were 90 fe 83 ni and 81 co respectively due to the magnetic nature of graphene oxide the nanoparticles after nitrate removal can be easily separated from the solution through magnetic separation 60 in another study fe nanoparticles were synthesized using eucalyptus and green tea extracts were used for nitrate removal and were capped with polyphenols fe nanoparticles synthesized by green tea showed a nitrate removal rate of 59 7 while nanoparticles synthesized by eucalyptus extract showed a nitrate removal rate of 41 4 nzvi despite showing the highest removal rate decreased in reactivity while the fe nanoparticles synthesized from the extracts showed no decrease even after 2 months kinetic studies of the nitrate removal showed a better fit to the pseudo second order adsorption model with the qe adsorption capacity at equilibrium values for 13 06mg g and 9 698mg g for the fe nanoparticles synthesized by green tea and eucalyptus respectively the mechanism proposed indicated adsorption and co precipitation dominated by the polyphenol capped fe nanoparticles 61 in a study mentioned previously 62 the researchers had also coated the freshly synthesized dried and sonicated nzvis with 0 2 of nickel and compared them with their uncoated counterparts freshly synthesized nzvi and nickel coated freshly synthesized nzvi were showed fast reduction reaction by reducing 10 10 000ppm in 1min dried nzvi and nickel coated dried nzvi showed a reduction rate lesser than their sonicated counterparts this was hypothesized to be due to aggregate size and the catalyst used the rapid reaction is also theorized to be due to branched chain like structures of nzvi 62 in another novel study a nzvi cell system was developed in which a system of iron nanoparticles and alcaligenes eutrophus a kind of hydrogenotrophic bacteria was developed for nitrate removal two sequential first order expressions were used to integrate this system s nitrate removal rate at 422nm the od optical density of the bacteria was less than 0 0009 and the amount of iron nanoparticles was higher than 0 56g l under different initial concentrations of nitrate with the bacteria and nzvi a decrease was observed from 80mg l to 20mg l in the nitrate concentration at higher nitrate concentration nzvi tended to corrode rapidly thus causing a decrease in the removal rate of nitrate 63 3 1 2 metal and metal alloy nanoparticles metal and metal alloy nanoparticles have excellent surface area and good conducting properties many catalysts are composed of noble metals and a promoter that reduce nitrate to nitrite by a redox process followed by further reduction of nitrite to nitrogen gas 64 the properties of these nanoparticles are also dependent on the size and morphology of the nanoparticles for instance platinum pt nanoparticles have excellent reduction property and this depends on the form and size of the platinum nanoparticle platinum nanoparticle of desired morphology pt 100 and pt 110 were synthesized through electrodeposition and effect of this morphology on nitrate removal was studied cyclic voltammetry was used on a solution with the nitrate concentration kept at 50mm and a scan rate at 50mv s nitrate reduction occurred through the formation of an intermediate followed by ammonia formation at a higher scan rate pt 100 nanoparticles showed a higher nitrate removal efficiency as compared to pt 110 which showed no participation at all 65 aluminum oxide al2o3 nanoparticles such as nanoalumina which is in nanopowder form can also be used to remove nitrate from water it showed better adsorption of nitrate when its concentration was increased from 10mg l to 20mg l maximum nitrate removal had occurred when the ph of the aqueous solution was 4 4 the nitrate adsorption capacity at 25 c was 4 0mg g also anions such as so2 cl and co3 2 negatively affected nitrate removal when these anions were present the removal efficiency was 40 45 due to possible interference of these ions on nitrate adsorption 66 metal alloys such as palladium silver pdag have been immobilized on amine nh2 functionalized sio2 supports here pdag sio2 nh2 alloy used formic acid as a reducing agent the amine functionalized sio2 aided formic acid decomposition thus enhancing the rate of reduction on this support pdag alloy nanoparticles were loaded first by loading palladium through conventional impregnation and reduction method followed by loading of silver through a surface reaction under controlled conditions formic acid was added as well with a specific molar ratio it was found that amine functionalized support prevented the clustering of palladium nanoparticles and showed enhanced decomposition rate of formic acid as compared to non amine functionalized support which in turn increased the catalytic reduction rate of nitrate the catalytic performance of pd cu and pd ag alloys were compared which showed that the pd ag alloy had much higher reduction rate as compared to pd cu the ratio of pd ag also played a crucial role in nitrate removal 67 nitrate removal can also occur through photocatalytic reduction semiconductors can serve as excellent catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of nitrate a metal oxide that can serve as a photocatalytic reducing agent is tio2 it is cheap and non toxic and has high photo stability tio2 nzvi and a composite containing tio2 and nzvi were used for nitrate removal under uv light out of the three components the composite and nzvi showed effective nitrate removal but the composite showed better results and performance in converting nitrate to nitrogen maximum nitrate removal rate occurred when the molar ratio of the tio2 nzvi was 1 10 this ratio significantly influences the conversion of nitrate to nitrogen due to high level of ferrous ions in the solution thus enhancing the reduction activity 68 in another study carbon modified titanium electrodes were used as a photo catalyst to remove nitrate from sea water c tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized using titanium isopropoxide as a precursor in a sol gel method tio2p25 was synthesized using titanium trichloride as a precursor through the same method to ensure absence of carbon in these nanoparticles in this study prevention of the electron hole recombination was done by using formic acid as a sacrificial electron donor tio2p25 and unmodified tio2 were compared as well in the tio2 p25 a significant decrease had been observed in its optical band gap which had led to removal of nitrate by photocatalysis under uv light in the absence of c tio2 nanoparticles nitrate reduction had not occurred but reduction performance had increased with increase in concentration of the catalyst the ph of the solution also played a crucial role in nitrate reduction under low ph a drastic increase in nitrate reduction was found while under high ph nitrate reduction had been comparatively lesser due to lack of adsorption caused by electrostatic repulsion the concentration of formic acid played a critical role as well by showing an increase in reduction rate of nitrate with its increasing concentration however this increase in reduction occurred only up to a certain level nitrate reduction had decreased when the concentration of formic acid was 0 05m overall the maximum nitrate removal rate had occurred when the amount of catalyst was 0 5g l in a solution having ph 3 and the concentration of formic acid at 0 04m 69 nanoparticles especially when used as a reducing agent for nitrate removal form ammonia as a main product ammonia can be toxic and thus its production is not favourable therefore it is necessary to develop nanoparticles such that it forms non toxic nitrite ammonium and nitrogen gas nanoparticles can also be designed such that they can be used for simultaneous removal of co contaminants along with nitrate the presence or absence of these co contaminants also influence the nitrate removal rates 3 2 nanotubes nanotubes are one dimensional nanostructures with a hollow tubular structure carbon nanotubes cnt have been widely used in waste water treatment due to their variable chemical physical electrical and structural properties they can be used as adsorbents catalysts and co catalysts for removal of pollutants 70 cnts due to their high adsorption rates and efficiency have been commonly used as adsorbents for removal of dyes heavy metals and other types of organic and inorganic pollutants 71 however the surface of carbon nanotubes is highly hydrophobic and requires surface modification with surface modification cnt can be very efficiently used for nitrate removal in one such case cnts had been synthesized through chemical vapor deposition method and functionalized with ammonia and nitric acid at room temperature for nitrate removal the nitrate removal efficiency of cnt functionalized with nitrogen groups and oxidized cnt were then compared an increase in the nitrate removal rate with the functionalized cnt sheets was observed the langmuir isotherm model showed adsorption capacity for functionalized cnt to be 142 8750mg g and 90 9090mg g for oxidized cnt functionalized cnt showed 90 removal of nitrate and when the adsorbent dosage was 300mg 20ml these functionalized cnts when compared with activated carbon showed higher nitrate removal efficiency lesser equilibrium time and better regeneration 72 magnetic adsorption techniques are widely employed for removal of nitrate from industrial wastewaters 73 magnetic multi walled cnt thus can be easily used as a cleaner alternative for nitrate removal the magnetic nature of the nanotubes enables them to be easily separated magnetically thus preventing further pollution magnetic cnts have been synthesized through chemical deposition of fe3o4 on the cnt surface here a d c ratio was calculated which implied the ratio between the adsorbent dosage per initial concentration of the pollutant the nitrate removed was 97 15 at a d c ratio of 40mg mg l and a ph of 4 langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to the kinetics data and it was observed that the data showed better fitting to the freundlich isotherm model the adsorption capacity found through the freundlich isotherm model was 183 11mg g at lower ph nitrate adsorption increased due to less electrostatic repulsion between the nitrate ion and the magnetic cnt 74 carbon nanotubes also have high mechanical strength large surface area high aspect ratios and excellent electrical properties 75 76 due to this they can be used as electrodes or as reducing agents for example ti cnts cu pd electrodes were fabricated through electrochemical method and the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ti cnts cu5 pd5 with ti cu5 pd5 towards nitrate reduction was compared ti cnts cu5 pd5 electrodes were fabricated in a 5mm copper chloride and 5mm palladium chloride deposition bath ti cnts cu5 pd5 showed much better performance than the composite without cnts cnt as such did not show any nitrate reduction property but it eased the dispersion of ti cu pd thus causing enhanced electrocatalytic property and stability of the electrode these electrodes showed a nitrate conversion yield of 32 52 on supplying 1 3v for 4h the electrode showed selectivity to the by products formed nitrogen 42 55 and ammonia 54 01 77 practically cnts are the most widely used nanotube for nitrate removal however further insights on nitrate removal using other nanotubes can been gained through molecular dynamic simulations a study had run molecular dynamic simulations technique using boron nitride and silicon carbide sic nanotubes to study the effect of these nanotubes on nitrate removal in the case of armchair boron nitride nanotubes the entry or non entry of water and nitrate was studied for 6 types of boron nitride nanotubes the 4 4 boron nitride nanotubes didn t allow any water or nitrate to pass through due to its small diameter water passed through 5 5 and 6 6 but nitrate ions could not pass through in larger nanotubes 7 7 8 8 9 9 both nitrate and water molecules easily passed through this simulation study showed the optimal size of nanotubes that could be used for nitrate removal from water 78 in a separate study 7 7 and 8 8 silicon carbide nanotubes were immobilized in a silicon nitride membrane and immersed in a sodium nitrate solution along the z axis electric field was applied and ion current retention time of ions radial distribution function of water nanotube and nitrate containing water and autocorrelation function of hydrogen bond was calculated as well it was found that nitrate ions passed most successfully through the 8 8 silicon carbide nanotube 79 3 3 nanofibers nanofibers have diameter lesser than 100nm and have been used in various environmental applications they are safe due to their extremely long length and can easily be incorporated onto any support or media they also have high surface to volume ratio adjustable functionality and large porosity due to these properties they have been used in filtration of particulates airborne nanoscale particles polluted liquids 80 chitosan nanofibers have been widely used for nitrate removal in one study chitosan nanofibers had been utilized to prepare electrospun mats and these mats were used as a support material for the immobilization of algal cells algal cells are widely used in wastewater treatment as they not only treat water but also generate algal biomass that can be used for production of biofuel and other applications such an immobilization required lesser volume and space by the cells for their growth had easy handling and repeated usage for the generation of the product post immobilization these algal cells were utilized in the treatment of water for the removal of nitrate the study showed 87 removal of nitrate from the effluent initial concentration of nitrate was 30mg l initial nitrate removal from the effluent was because of the presence of mats of nanofibers however in later stages the residual nitrate was consumed by the continuously growing algal cells at a reduced rate overall the nanofiber mats having immobilized algal cells showed an increase nitrate removal efficiency 87 when compared to the nitrate removal efficiency of mats without the algal cells 32 81 chitosan al2o3 fe3o4 have been synthesized and used to prepare a nanocomposite nano fibrous adsorbent through electrospinning for nitrate removal the nitrate adsorption experiments were carried out in a single system and a binary system for the single system the optimal concentration of al2fe2o3 was found to be 2 concentrations higher than 2 showed a decrease in the nitrate adsorption efficiency due to possible agglomeration of al2fe2o3 highest nitrate adsorption was found at lower ph at lower ph the functional groups amine and hydroxyl underwent protonation which led to increased adsorption of nitrate however at higher ph 6 there was negligible electrostatic interaction between the nanofiber and nitrate ions which led to comparatively less adsorption the nitrate adsorption capacity also increased with increase in the initial concentration of nitrate and decrease in temperature the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic which was determined from the negative values of δs δg δh these nanofibers showed a nitrate adsorption capacity of 160 70mg g in the binary system a relationship between the adsorbent dosage and the initial concentration of nitrate was estimated through anova analysis of variance the r2 values obtained were higher than 0 98 which indicated towards excellent reliability of the model to predict the efficiency of the nanofibers in removing nitrate increasing concentrations of anions such as sulphate fluoride chloride negatively affected the removal of nitrate due to possible competition for the active sites on the adsorbents 82 3 4 nanoshells nanoshells are made of a dielectric core and are covered by a thin metallic film sio2 feooh fe core nanoshell have been used for nitrate removal sio2 feooh cores were used to immobilize the nzvi through reduction in the presence or absence of the nitrogen gas upon doubling the amount of nzvi the nitrate removal efficiency of the nanoshell increased from 69 to 86 the removal efficiency showed an increase at lower ph the highest percentage of nitrate removal 99 84 was noticed at 64mg l concentration of nitrate at ph 3 this sample had a contact time of 2h between the nitrate and the nanoshell the amount of nanoshell was increased to two folds in a sonication time of 3min 83 3 5 nanoclusters nanoclusters consist of many atoms of the same kind clumped together nanoscale iron cluster with a high surface area had been utilized in a recent research work for the removal of nitrate these nanoclusters were developed through a nzvi having high surface area during the synthesis of these iron nanoclusters when ethanol and water were utilized as co solvents the nanoclusters produced were spherical in shape having a specific surface area of 54 25m2g l and a specific diameter of 80nm the final product obtained showed the presence of whiskers along with the clusters these clusters and whiskers were synthesized in the voids present between the molecules of solvents water and ethanol these voids acted as miniaturized reaction centers for the synthesis of such nanostructures this highlights the significance of solvent systems during the synthesis of nzvi on utilizing nzvi for the removal of nitrate a widespread and fast denitrification of the nitrate was noticed at ambient temperature ammonia was the major primary product obtained during this reaction constituting to around 90 of the total final products obtained while nitrate was getting transformed some of nitrogen containing products were produced such as n2 no and n2o however the nitrite was found to be in highest concentration in the reaction system the amount of iron nanoclusters used played an important role in reducing the nitrate upon increasing the amount of nanoclusters the reaction rate as well as the nitrate removal efficiency increased an increase in the reaction rate was also noticed when the initial concentration of nitrate was amplified however in an open system the reduction of nitrate got reduced due to the consumption of electrons released from iron by the dissolved oxygen the efficient removal of nitrate from nanoclusters took place at higher ph of 9 10 the production of oh at higher ph caused the iron to precipitate and helped in removing secondary pollution from water additionally the reaction of oh with other ions present in the water helped to reduce the content of other pollutants from water during the treatment 84 3 6 nanocomposites nanocomposites such as polymer 85 graphene based 86 and magnetic polymer 87 have been widely used in environmental applications such as in for the treatment or removal of pollutants nanocomposites consist of a combination of nanomaterials which enhance its overall nitrate adsorbing capability in one such case nano sized and bulk carbon silicon composites that were prepared from bamboo the leaves of bamboo contained silica thus had been selected as the source the adsorption of nitrate in nano sized composites were more profound 44 89 as compared to the bulk sized nanocomposites 21 98 11 3425mg g of nitrate was adsorbed on the nano sized composites the preparation method was comparatively simple and this technique was also environmental friendly 88 several chitosan based nanocomposites have been developed for nitrate removal composites of chitosan with polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyethylene glycol peg were prepared and used for nitrate removal from water 0 1g of the composites were added to a solution with initial nitrate concentration of 10mg l the ph and contact time was 3 and 40min respectively the amount of nitrate adsorbed for peg chitosan was 50 68mg g while for pva chitosan it was 35mg g the adsorption data was also well fitted to the freundlich model which showed δh as positive which indicated towards endothermic process δg was negative at different temperatures which indicated towards the spontaneous nature of nitrate adsorption 89 another chitosan based nanocomposite was chitosan zeolitey nano zirconium oxide cts zy nano zro2 nanocomposites which were made to remove nitrate from solution by varying the molar ratios of chitosan cts to zeolite nano zirconium nitrate adsorption was highly dependent on the molar ratios of cts zeolite nan zirconium ph and temperature out of the three components the composite showed the highest nitrate removal efficiency the composite adsorbed 23 58m g of nitrate highest nitrate removal occurred when the molar ratios of cts zeolite nanozirconium were 5 1 ph was 3 temperature was 35 c and contact time was 60min 90 chitosan polystyrene zn nanocomposite through precipitation procedure for nitrate removal have been synthesized using aqueous solutions this nanocomposite removed 90 of nitrate ions from a 25ml solution even at low quantities the initial nitrate concentration and ph was kept at 10mg l and 3 respectively fixed bed column experiments were carried out under the same parameters these experiments removed 82 5 of nitrate parallelly when hcl activated zinc oxide nanoparticles were used in the polluted solution for nitrate removal at the same condition as that of chitosan polystyrene zn nanocomposite they showed complete nitrate removal 91 iron zirconium chitosan fe3o4 zro2 cs i e composite was successfully synthesized which showed great ability to adsorb nitrate in aqueous solutions respectively the maximal adsorption capacities are 89 3mg g for nitrate a probable reason could be the simultaneous adsorption and intra particle diffusion of nitrate ions the adsorbent can also be easily enriched by a magnetic field practically this nanocomposite also showed promising results for treating water that is contaminated with nutrients 92 apart from chitosan based nanocomposites for nitrate removal nano sized lanthanum hydrous doped magnetic graphene had also been prepared to adsorb nitrate ions from sewage and river samples doping of positively charged lanthanum hydrous oxide ions on a negatively charged graphene sheet overcame the electrostatic repulsion between the nitrate ions and the composite the kinetic data of the batch adsorption study was fitted into the langmuir linear model which provided the adsorption capacity of nitrate to be 138 8mg g at a ph 6 8 the presence of co existing ions such as na k ca2 zn2 showed no effect on the nitrate adsorption capacity in river samples the nanocomposite showed a nitrate removal rate of 83 and a removal rate of 74 in the sewage sample 93 4 future perspectives most of the studies have been performed at a laboratory scale therefore newer methods need to be developed for facilitating large scale implementation of this technology and ensure efficient nitrate removal in future the nanomaterials can be merged with conventional techniques for enhanced nitrate removal and enable large scale implementation of the same for nitrate removal green synthetic routes for the preparation of the nanomaterials may be further developed and encouraged naturally occurring nanomaterials such as halloysite nanotubes which are clay based nanomaterials can be used for nitrate removal from aqueous environment they are highly suitable for environmental applications as they are eco friendly inexpensive and possess great adsorption capacity along with excellent tunable surface chemistry 94 100 such properties also enable them to be excellent adsorbents for nitrate they can also be used as supports for different catalysts and thus can enhance nitrate removal rates through reduction processes 5 conclusion nitrate pollution occurs all over the world and is known to have several implications on human health and environment nitrate removal does not occur through common processes for water treatment such as filtration conventional techniques used for its removal include adsorption reverse osmosis ion exchange process and other biological and chemical techniques however these techniques have several limitations nanotechnology is a suitable alternative to remove nitrate over the conventional techniques as it is a cleaner and energy efficient method nanomaterials such as nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers nanoshells nanoclusters and nanocomposites have been used for nitrate removal major advantages associated with these materials are high surface area easy synthetic routes high catalytic activity and good electrical conductivity the nanomaterials have either been used as adsorbents or as reducing agents due to their large surface areas and high catalytic activity the nanoparticles used were either bare i e used without any modification or were immobilized on a support they were also coated with a stabilizing capping agent or with a carbon based oxide layer to enhance their ability to remove nitrate efficient nitrate removal rates have been achieved using these nanomaterials at differing ph nanomaterial dosage temperature contact time and initial nitrate concentration amount of nitrate removed have been determined through uv spectrophotometry ion chromatography and colorimetric techniques nitrate removal rates as high as 100 have been achieved using different nanomaterials however these nanomaterials have several limitations such as particle agglomeration and toxicity the nanomaterials may also become unstable at varying environmental conditions retrieval separation and recycling of nanomaterials that have been dispersed in a water source for nitrate removal may also be difficult use of novel and greener routes such as employing halloysite nanotubes and its composites for nitrate removal may lead to an improvement in nitrate removal efficiency immobilization of such nanotubes on a membrane may overcome the limitation of separation and recycling from water with development of further techniques that overcome the limitations of nanomaterials nanotechnology may become the silver bullet needed for efficient nitrate removal from aquatic environment 
14606,nitrate is a water pollutant whose removal from water is necessary to lessen pollution and prevent damage to life several conventional techniques such as adsorption ion exchange process reverse osmosis electrochemical chemical and biological methods have been developed for removal of nitrate however they have several limitations such as requirement of post treatment less efficiency and high installation costs the field of nanotechnology has observed tremendous growth in the past and has many environmental applications such as the use of nanomaterials for soil and water remediation filtration of pollutants water purification biosensors and in desalination recently nanotechnology has emerged as an excellent alternative for nitrate removal over conventional techniques nanomaterials due to their small size have large surface area and thus have high reactivity which enables them to be used as reducing agents and adsorbents this review focuses on the use of different nanomaterials especially nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers nanoshells nanoclusters and nanocomposites for removal of nitrate from an aqueous system the limitations of using such nanomaterials for removal of nitrate and possible techniques to overcome these limitations have been discussed as well keywords nitrate removal nanotechnology nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers 1 introduction water pollution is a major issue with several consequences on life on earth it is mainly caused by the industrial pollution and anthropogenic activities 1 in the past 200 years there have been significant changes in the global nitrogen cycle there is now increasing mobility and availability of nitrogen over large areas of earth apart from this inorganic nitrogen such as nitrates no3 enter the environment especially in aquatic systems through different anthropogenic activities such as agricultural and urban runoff usage of pesticides organic or inorganic compounds improper treatment of industrial wastes leaching of waste in groundwater and sewage effluents 2 7 nitrate concentrations above acceptable limit as given in international standards in various water sources is a major environmental concern all over the world this ion is found naturally and is the most stable form of combined nitrogen for oxygenated systems it also serves as an essential source of nitrogen for plants it is a widespread contaminant as it is highly water soluble 8 it also affects several drinking supplies and is known to cause eutrophication 9 10 at elevated levels it is known to cause many health complications such as methemoglobinemia 11 diabetes 12 and is also known to cause outbreak of infectious diseases they also adversely affect freshwater and marine animals with freshwater fishes being more susceptible to elevated nitrate levels in water 13 it also significantly affects cattle through nitrate poisoning 14 nitrate removal from environmental sources such as surface water bodies and ground water is thus essential for preventing such issues several techniques have been established for removal of nitrate from waste water adsorption 15 19 ion exchange process 20 electrochemical methods 21 23 reverse osmosis 24 biological methods 25 29 and chemical methods 30 are some of the conventional techniques implemented however these techniques have several limitations conventional adsorption techniques require proper selection of the adsorbent such that it is robust and can work under variable environmental conditions estimation of the adsorption efficiency reusability and disposal of the adsorbents with nitrate are also some of the major issues 16 ion exchange techniques require post treatment and are sensitive to various contaminants present in the water 31 reverse osmosis is also sensitive to contaminants other than nitrate it requires a specific amount of pressure and is also prone to biofouling biological and chemical methods cause toxicity in the water also installation of such techniques can be expensive nanotechnology can serve as an alternative for these conventional techniques nanotechnology is a field which deals with modification design and application of nanoscale objects 10 9 m it has various applications in food safety medicine cosmetic industries and electronics nanomaterials are synthesized through top down or bottom up approach out of which bottom up approach is a widely preferred technique as it offers greater size control and prevents the contamination of nanomaterials 32 33 they have excellent thermal mechanical optical structural and morphological properties which enable them to be used in different environmental applications in environment nanotechnology has been used in groundwater remediation and filtration of waste water to lessen its negative impacts on the ecosystem 34 35 it has also been used in energy production 36 37 pollution treatment and dye removal 38 40 in this review nitrate removal using nanotechnology has been discussed it is a comprehensive compilation of papers from past 12 years that have used nanotechnology for nitrate removal they have been accessed through scifinder google scholar and sciencedirect the criteria for the selection of the papers was such that they reported the use of different nanomaterials either with or without modification for the removal of nitrate from aqueous environment the nanomaterials used for nitrate removal possessed different reducing and adsorbing capabilities for nitrate this review is novel and such kind of work which solely focuses on the use of nanotechnology for nitrate removal has not been reported previously 2 mechanisms of nitrate removal nitrate in nature is usually formed as a denitrification product of nitrogen it is highly soluble in water and is unreactive fertilizers and other waste products that consist of nitrogen are decomposed to give ammonia followed by further oxidation to nitrate and nitrite nitrate is usually present in air water and food and is taken up by plants to synthesize organic nitrogenous compounds 41 despite being unreactive it can be microbially reduced to form nitrogen gas n2 and nitrogen monoxide n2o commonly used reducing agents include active metals ammonia borohydride formate hydrazine hydroxylamine hydrogen and iron active metals reduce nitrate to ammonia or nitrite in a basic solution while ammonia in an acidic solution reduces nitrate to nitrogen or nitrous oxide at high pressure and temperatures sodium borohydride forms nitrite and ammonia in the presence of metal alloys nitrate reduction can take place through energy methods such as electrochemical thermal or photocatalytic methods however simple chemical reduction reactions in aqueous solutions cannot efficiently remove nitrate 42 effective reduction takes place in the presence of powerful catalysts nanomaterials due to their small surface area have high catalytic properties and thus have excellent reducing potential nitrate on reduction releases ammonia nh3 nitrogen gas n2 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 the products formed differ based on the type of the nanomaterial used another common mechanism in nitrate removal is adsorption in adsorption method nitrate molecule is attached on the surface either through physisorption or chemisorption nanomaterials that have excellent adsorption properties possess two main properties their innate surface area and external functionalization 43 high surface area adsorption activity location of atoms on surface lack of internal diffusion resistance and high surface binding energy are also some of the factors that determine the adsorption capability of the nanomaterial 44 45 the adsorption capability of a nanomaterial is found through different isotherm and kinetic models table 1 shows the different nanomaterials used for nitrate removal along with the isotherm and kinetic models used the nanomaterials that have been used for nitrate removal are nanoparticles nanotubes nanoclusters nanoshells nanofibers and nanocomposites fig 1 the reducing capacity and adsorption efficiency may vary with each nanomaterial fig 2 shows the removal mechanisms of nitrate through different nanomaterials 3 nanomaterials for nitrate removal nanomaterials used till date for removal of nitrate are nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers nanoclusters and nanocomposites fig 3 gives a classification of the nanomaterials used for nitrate removal table 2 shows the different nanomaterials used for nitrate removal along with parameters such as initial nitrate concentration ph adsorbent dose and temperature it also compares the nitrate removal efficiencies of different nanomaterials table 3 shows the removal mechanisms of nitrate by the nanomaterials and the nitrate determination method 3 1 nanoparticles nanoparticles are in the range of 1 100nm and can be metallic semiconductor or polymeric they have various environmental applications such as microbial detection and monitoring source recovery and chemical degradation or environmental remediation they can effectively remove a wide variety of contaminants as well 46 they can be used as reducing agents or as adsorbents for various contaminants in soil or water due to their small size large surface area and excellent catalytic activity nanoparticles are emerging as an alternative to conventional treatments for removal of nitrate from wastewater they had been used either as a standalone system in the aqueous solution with or without coating or were immobilized on different supports fig 4 shows the different supports used for immobilization of nanoparticles 3 1 1 nanoscale zero valent particles nzvi iron nanoparticles nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has gained attraction worldwide due to their excellent catalytic activities and large surface area 47 48 these properties enable them to be used as a reducing agent some studies reported here have used nzvi as adsorbents as well bare nzvi i e nzvi which have been directly synthesized from its source without any modification are widely used for nitrate removal in a study nzvi had been synthesized through a natural reduction process of hydrothermal and natural goethite normally nzvi synthesis is an expensive process however when synthesized with natural sources such as natural and hydrothermal goethite the process becomes significantly cheaper on comparison of nzvi synthesized with natural and hydrothermal goethite with ordinary zerovalent iron it was found that ordinary nzvi showed a 90 removal rate at ph 1 but the removal rate drastically decreased to 10 at ph 6 while nzvi obtained from natural and hydrothermal goethite showed a removal rate of 95 1 and 91 3 respectively at ph 1 and this rate decreased to 72 4 and 83 5 at ph 8 increasing the initial nitrate concentration also affected the nitrate removal rates nzvi synthesized from natural goethite showed an increase in formation of ammonia with increase in time while very low concentration of nitrite was formed some of the nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas as well nzvi synthesized using natural and hydrothermal goethite was a cheap alternative and it showed much better nitrate removal rates than ordinary zerovalent iron 49 freshly synthesized nzvi dried nzvi and dried and sonicated nzvi have also been used for removing high concentrations of nitrate nitrate reduction using these nzvis were done at various conditions such as ph initial concentrations of nitrate and adsorbent dose there was barely any influence of ph on the reduction of nitrate as the reduction had occurred at an unspecific ph the nzvis reduced nitrate to ammonium and nitrite however the amount of nitrite produced was less and had reduced with time in case of fresh nzvi rapid nitrate reduction had occurred with 1mg ml of nitrate reduced within a minute in this case nitrite production increased to 5 in 20min in case of dried and sonicated nzvi the nitrite produced was nearly 7 50 in another study bare nzvis had been doped with gold copper and silver nanoparticles and were used for simultaneous removal of nitrate and cadmium cd contamination here the reactivity of nzvi to the co contaminants and by product formation was evaluated and it was found that nitrate reduction causes the ph of solution to increase and does not release ionic iron it also causes formation of negatively charged surface of nzvi and iron oxide also in absence of cd ii around 30 nitrate had been reduced however in the presence of 40mg l concentration of cd ii nitrate had been removed completely this could be due to the development of cadmium islands on nzvi in the presence of cd ii concentration of 40mg l 20 of the initial concentration of nitrate had been reduced significantly to ammonium while maintaining high cd ii removal rate a 3 reduction of the initial nitrate to nitrite had occurred by using nzvi doped with 1 wt of gold 51 nzvi has also been used in conjunction with other nanoparticles in order to increase nitrate removal ability in one such case nzvi had been used with magnetite nanoparticles for nitrate removal from groundwater a drastic reduction in the nitrate content was found which was proportional to the amount of magnetite nanoparticles added to the batch containing nzvi due to the magnetic nature of the magnetite nanoparticles they had evenly dispersed on the surface of nzvi these nanoparticles enhanced the corrosion rate of nzvi and facilitated electron transport for reduction of nitrate through nzvi ground water showed a faster nitrate reduction rate as compared to deionized water which could be due to adsorption of cationic compounds in water in the nzvi water interface another possible reason could be the development of a surface complex by the cations in the same interface the magnetite nanoparticles also enhanced the endurance of nzvi thus allowing it to complete four cycles of nitrate reduction 52 while bare nzvi or nzvi in conjunction with other nanoparticles showed good results in nitrate reduction and removal of co contaminants they still tended to aggregate aggregation causes reduction in the reducing ability of nzvi however this can be overcome by immobilizing them on supports by making bimetallic nanoparticles or by using an appropriate capping material to increase their stability and enhance their properties nzvi nanoparticles have been immobilized on various supports with increased nitrate reduction rates in one such case nzvi nanoparticles were immobilized on a macroporous alginate substrate mas in a two part procedure in which nzvis 26 06wt were synthesized through reduction and were dispersed on the fabricated mas this newly developed substrate with nzvi removed 96 5 of nitrate within 30min this was significantly better when compared to free nzvi which removed only 44 7 of nitrate the reaction products formed on nitrate reduction were ammonium and nitrite however no nitrogen gas was generated in case of unsupported nzvi in case of supported nzvi the nitrite produced disappeared after 30min while the ammonium concentration increased continuously in this case nearly 5 of nitrogen gas was generated under high ph nitrite and ammonium were produced while ammonia was stripped the mas prevented the agglomeration of nzvi which favoured its redox activity it was also hypothesized that the support prevented the agglomeration of the nanoparticles which exposed the highly reactive surfaces of these nanoparticles for reduction of nitrate 53 exfoliated graphite has been used as another support to immobilize nzvi for nitrate removal and used for nitrate removal through chemical reduction the nzvi nanoparticles were created using kbh4 as a reducing agent in a water ethanol environment batch experiments were conducted to study the effect of these particles on nitrate reduction at neutral ph condition 80mg l nitrate was removed within a span of 30min by the supported nzvi the high surface area of the support facilitated the dispersion of nanoparticles and prevented their agglomeration the main products of nitrate reduction in this case were ammonium and nitrite nitrite was formed in low quantity which slowly decreased before getting completely disappeared the reduction process was highly dependent on the ph with increased reduction occurring in acidic conditions 54 another carbon based support used to immobilize nzvi was nanographene which formed nzvi nanographene nanocomposite nzvis had homogenously distributed on the transparent nanographene surface the xrd x ray diffraction measurements showed that the nzvi alone had low stability but had greatly stabilized upon their support on the nanographene surface it also prevented nzvi from getting oxidized by providing electrons most of the nitrate ions were removed from solution using this nanocomposite in a mass ratio of 5 25 nzvi nanographene nzvi supported on nanographene surface enhanced the removal process by 125 1 when compared with nzvi alone the results showed that the removal process via catalytic reduction was driven by acid because optimum removal was obtained at lower ph values most of the nitrate ions could be removed within 16h at ambient conditions this time was shortened to 3h by ultrasonication the possible mechanism of nitrate reduction was that nitrate ions could be reduced to nitrite and or ammonium which then was reduced to nitrogen gas nitrate removal here involved 3 main steps adsorption reduction and desorption here also acidic conditions favoured nitrate reduction to form ammonia supporting nzvi on nanographene significantly heightened the nitrate removal because of enhanced surface area and stability and thus prevented their agglomeration and aggregation 55 another strategy to use nzvi for nitrate removal was through preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles bimetallic nanoparticles enhance the removal of nitrate along with other co contaminants the presence of co contaminants also affects the removal of nitrate for instance novel bimetallic fe ni iron nickel nanoparticles have been synthesized and supported on a kaolin base for removal of nitrates in the presence of copper ions a specific ratio of kaolin iron nickel k ni fe was fixed with kaolin serving as a support there was an increase in nitrate removal efficiency from 26 9 to 40 4 with increase in the concentration of copper ions 0 200mg l possible mechanisms for removal of these ions included adsorption on kaolin or iron oxides and the enhancement of denitrification due to a novel trimetallic catalyst fe ni cu formed 56 bimetallic nzvi nanoparticles also have the ability to degrade nitrate faster than monometallic nzvi in a study iron palladium fe pd nanoparticles were used for nitrate removal while nzvi here had the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite and ammonia pd nanoparticles enhanced nitrite reduction to non toxic nitrogen gas to further enhance the nitrate reduction by the bimetallic nanoparticles they were supported on a chelating resin dow 3n fe pd nanoparticles were supported on the resin through two ways by loading nzvi on the resin followed by pd loading and by loading pd first followed by nzvi loading bimetallic nanoparticles converted nitrate to nitrite and ammonium and nitrite was further converted to nitrogen gas or ammonium however the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen gas requires adsorption of hydrogen gas on the surface of the pd nanoparticles so that the oxygen gets removed thus forming nitrogen gas therefore the amount of pd loaded was directly related to the amount of nitrogen gas generated it was also found that increasing the ph of the solution increased nitrogen gas production the optimal ph was found to be 8 63 where the highest n2 selectivity was observed it was found that palladium content and the solution of ph can improve the selectivity to n2 the high selectivity to n2 was shown at 71 when the weight of the catalyst consisted of 8 nzvi and 8 palladium nanoparticles and ph was 8 67 57 in order to favour the production of non toxic nitrogen gas a combination of three metals was used copper cu nzvi pd nzvi cu palladium nzvi and pd cu nzvi were synthesized through chemical reduction and tested for nitrate removal the nanoparticles synthesized were in the range of 20 150nm and batch experiments were performed for nitrate removal the trimetal catalyst pd cu nzvi showed excellent ammonia suppression when the pd cu ratio was 2 1 a nitrate reduction of 63 was observed with this catalyst which is comparatively higher than the nitrate reduction observed with nzvi 56 pd cu 2 1 showed the highest selectivity to n2 nh4 formation nzvi served as an electron donor to the metals cu and pd and reacted with each molecule to produce hydrogen gas the cu surface had a high affinity towards nitrate and this nitrate molecule reacted with the hydrogen gas produced on its surface to produce nitrite the nitrite produced was further reduced to ammonium and nitrogen gas by the hydrogen adsorbed on the pd surface 58 bimetallic and trimetallic combinations with nzvi can also be immobilized on support to enhance nitrate removal rate in one such study nzvi cu manganese mn cu fe and mn fe were prepared and immobilized on a nay zeolite support natural or synthesized zeolite affect the incorporation and the catalytic activity of metals and catalysts into it these structures also have the ability to selectively ion exchange ammonia and improve nitrate removal while prohibiting release of ammonium into solution zeolite composites with immobilized nanoparticles showed 100 nitrate removal after 6h this may be due to the loading of the nanoparticles on both the surface and the inner layers during composite preparation the nitrate removal increased with increase in dosage of the composites i e the metal loaded zeolite supports the highest nitrate removal at 100 occurred at 4g l dose of the composites they also showed a much higher nitrate removal rate than the metals alone nitrate removal did not depend on acidic or alkaline conditions it showed high nitrate removal rates in both the states the kinetic data obtained fitted the best with the pseudo first order model 59 coating of nzvi with a capping agent or with a carbon based oxide layer is another method for nitrate reduction coating prevents agglomeration and increases the stability of the nanoparticles therefore enhancing their reducing ability fe ni and cobalt co nanoparticles have been coated with graphene oxide to form a composite for nitrate removal from water graphene oxide has properties like high stability large surface area high oxidizing potential and excellent magnetic property and this which enables them to be used in water remediation both sides of the sheets were utilizable and there were several functional groups on its surface this along with a surface negative charge ensured excellent dispersion of the nanoparticles on the graphene oxide surface a good dispersion is required for enhanced reduction of nitrate the nitrate removal rates after 8h for the immobilized nanoparticles were 90 fe 83 ni and 81 co respectively due to the magnetic nature of graphene oxide the nanoparticles after nitrate removal can be easily separated from the solution through magnetic separation 60 in another study fe nanoparticles were synthesized using eucalyptus and green tea extracts were used for nitrate removal and were capped with polyphenols fe nanoparticles synthesized by green tea showed a nitrate removal rate of 59 7 while nanoparticles synthesized by eucalyptus extract showed a nitrate removal rate of 41 4 nzvi despite showing the highest removal rate decreased in reactivity while the fe nanoparticles synthesized from the extracts showed no decrease even after 2 months kinetic studies of the nitrate removal showed a better fit to the pseudo second order adsorption model with the qe adsorption capacity at equilibrium values for 13 06mg g and 9 698mg g for the fe nanoparticles synthesized by green tea and eucalyptus respectively the mechanism proposed indicated adsorption and co precipitation dominated by the polyphenol capped fe nanoparticles 61 in a study mentioned previously 62 the researchers had also coated the freshly synthesized dried and sonicated nzvis with 0 2 of nickel and compared them with their uncoated counterparts freshly synthesized nzvi and nickel coated freshly synthesized nzvi were showed fast reduction reaction by reducing 10 10 000ppm in 1min dried nzvi and nickel coated dried nzvi showed a reduction rate lesser than their sonicated counterparts this was hypothesized to be due to aggregate size and the catalyst used the rapid reaction is also theorized to be due to branched chain like structures of nzvi 62 in another novel study a nzvi cell system was developed in which a system of iron nanoparticles and alcaligenes eutrophus a kind of hydrogenotrophic bacteria was developed for nitrate removal two sequential first order expressions were used to integrate this system s nitrate removal rate at 422nm the od optical density of the bacteria was less than 0 0009 and the amount of iron nanoparticles was higher than 0 56g l under different initial concentrations of nitrate with the bacteria and nzvi a decrease was observed from 80mg l to 20mg l in the nitrate concentration at higher nitrate concentration nzvi tended to corrode rapidly thus causing a decrease in the removal rate of nitrate 63 3 1 2 metal and metal alloy nanoparticles metal and metal alloy nanoparticles have excellent surface area and good conducting properties many catalysts are composed of noble metals and a promoter that reduce nitrate to nitrite by a redox process followed by further reduction of nitrite to nitrogen gas 64 the properties of these nanoparticles are also dependent on the size and morphology of the nanoparticles for instance platinum pt nanoparticles have excellent reduction property and this depends on the form and size of the platinum nanoparticle platinum nanoparticle of desired morphology pt 100 and pt 110 were synthesized through electrodeposition and effect of this morphology on nitrate removal was studied cyclic voltammetry was used on a solution with the nitrate concentration kept at 50mm and a scan rate at 50mv s nitrate reduction occurred through the formation of an intermediate followed by ammonia formation at a higher scan rate pt 100 nanoparticles showed a higher nitrate removal efficiency as compared to pt 110 which showed no participation at all 65 aluminum oxide al2o3 nanoparticles such as nanoalumina which is in nanopowder form can also be used to remove nitrate from water it showed better adsorption of nitrate when its concentration was increased from 10mg l to 20mg l maximum nitrate removal had occurred when the ph of the aqueous solution was 4 4 the nitrate adsorption capacity at 25 c was 4 0mg g also anions such as so2 cl and co3 2 negatively affected nitrate removal when these anions were present the removal efficiency was 40 45 due to possible interference of these ions on nitrate adsorption 66 metal alloys such as palladium silver pdag have been immobilized on amine nh2 functionalized sio2 supports here pdag sio2 nh2 alloy used formic acid as a reducing agent the amine functionalized sio2 aided formic acid decomposition thus enhancing the rate of reduction on this support pdag alloy nanoparticles were loaded first by loading palladium through conventional impregnation and reduction method followed by loading of silver through a surface reaction under controlled conditions formic acid was added as well with a specific molar ratio it was found that amine functionalized support prevented the clustering of palladium nanoparticles and showed enhanced decomposition rate of formic acid as compared to non amine functionalized support which in turn increased the catalytic reduction rate of nitrate the catalytic performance of pd cu and pd ag alloys were compared which showed that the pd ag alloy had much higher reduction rate as compared to pd cu the ratio of pd ag also played a crucial role in nitrate removal 67 nitrate removal can also occur through photocatalytic reduction semiconductors can serve as excellent catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of nitrate a metal oxide that can serve as a photocatalytic reducing agent is tio2 it is cheap and non toxic and has high photo stability tio2 nzvi and a composite containing tio2 and nzvi were used for nitrate removal under uv light out of the three components the composite and nzvi showed effective nitrate removal but the composite showed better results and performance in converting nitrate to nitrogen maximum nitrate removal rate occurred when the molar ratio of the tio2 nzvi was 1 10 this ratio significantly influences the conversion of nitrate to nitrogen due to high level of ferrous ions in the solution thus enhancing the reduction activity 68 in another study carbon modified titanium electrodes were used as a photo catalyst to remove nitrate from sea water c tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized using titanium isopropoxide as a precursor in a sol gel method tio2p25 was synthesized using titanium trichloride as a precursor through the same method to ensure absence of carbon in these nanoparticles in this study prevention of the electron hole recombination was done by using formic acid as a sacrificial electron donor tio2p25 and unmodified tio2 were compared as well in the tio2 p25 a significant decrease had been observed in its optical band gap which had led to removal of nitrate by photocatalysis under uv light in the absence of c tio2 nanoparticles nitrate reduction had not occurred but reduction performance had increased with increase in concentration of the catalyst the ph of the solution also played a crucial role in nitrate reduction under low ph a drastic increase in nitrate reduction was found while under high ph nitrate reduction had been comparatively lesser due to lack of adsorption caused by electrostatic repulsion the concentration of formic acid played a critical role as well by showing an increase in reduction rate of nitrate with its increasing concentration however this increase in reduction occurred only up to a certain level nitrate reduction had decreased when the concentration of formic acid was 0 05m overall the maximum nitrate removal rate had occurred when the amount of catalyst was 0 5g l in a solution having ph 3 and the concentration of formic acid at 0 04m 69 nanoparticles especially when used as a reducing agent for nitrate removal form ammonia as a main product ammonia can be toxic and thus its production is not favourable therefore it is necessary to develop nanoparticles such that it forms non toxic nitrite ammonium and nitrogen gas nanoparticles can also be designed such that they can be used for simultaneous removal of co contaminants along with nitrate the presence or absence of these co contaminants also influence the nitrate removal rates 3 2 nanotubes nanotubes are one dimensional nanostructures with a hollow tubular structure carbon nanotubes cnt have been widely used in waste water treatment due to their variable chemical physical electrical and structural properties they can be used as adsorbents catalysts and co catalysts for removal of pollutants 70 cnts due to their high adsorption rates and efficiency have been commonly used as adsorbents for removal of dyes heavy metals and other types of organic and inorganic pollutants 71 however the surface of carbon nanotubes is highly hydrophobic and requires surface modification with surface modification cnt can be very efficiently used for nitrate removal in one such case cnts had been synthesized through chemical vapor deposition method and functionalized with ammonia and nitric acid at room temperature for nitrate removal the nitrate removal efficiency of cnt functionalized with nitrogen groups and oxidized cnt were then compared an increase in the nitrate removal rate with the functionalized cnt sheets was observed the langmuir isotherm model showed adsorption capacity for functionalized cnt to be 142 8750mg g and 90 9090mg g for oxidized cnt functionalized cnt showed 90 removal of nitrate and when the adsorbent dosage was 300mg 20ml these functionalized cnts when compared with activated carbon showed higher nitrate removal efficiency lesser equilibrium time and better regeneration 72 magnetic adsorption techniques are widely employed for removal of nitrate from industrial wastewaters 73 magnetic multi walled cnt thus can be easily used as a cleaner alternative for nitrate removal the magnetic nature of the nanotubes enables them to be easily separated magnetically thus preventing further pollution magnetic cnts have been synthesized through chemical deposition of fe3o4 on the cnt surface here a d c ratio was calculated which implied the ratio between the adsorbent dosage per initial concentration of the pollutant the nitrate removed was 97 15 at a d c ratio of 40mg mg l and a ph of 4 langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to the kinetics data and it was observed that the data showed better fitting to the freundlich isotherm model the adsorption capacity found through the freundlich isotherm model was 183 11mg g at lower ph nitrate adsorption increased due to less electrostatic repulsion between the nitrate ion and the magnetic cnt 74 carbon nanotubes also have high mechanical strength large surface area high aspect ratios and excellent electrical properties 75 76 due to this they can be used as electrodes or as reducing agents for example ti cnts cu pd electrodes were fabricated through electrochemical method and the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ti cnts cu5 pd5 with ti cu5 pd5 towards nitrate reduction was compared ti cnts cu5 pd5 electrodes were fabricated in a 5mm copper chloride and 5mm palladium chloride deposition bath ti cnts cu5 pd5 showed much better performance than the composite without cnts cnt as such did not show any nitrate reduction property but it eased the dispersion of ti cu pd thus causing enhanced electrocatalytic property and stability of the electrode these electrodes showed a nitrate conversion yield of 32 52 on supplying 1 3v for 4h the electrode showed selectivity to the by products formed nitrogen 42 55 and ammonia 54 01 77 practically cnts are the most widely used nanotube for nitrate removal however further insights on nitrate removal using other nanotubes can been gained through molecular dynamic simulations a study had run molecular dynamic simulations technique using boron nitride and silicon carbide sic nanotubes to study the effect of these nanotubes on nitrate removal in the case of armchair boron nitride nanotubes the entry or non entry of water and nitrate was studied for 6 types of boron nitride nanotubes the 4 4 boron nitride nanotubes didn t allow any water or nitrate to pass through due to its small diameter water passed through 5 5 and 6 6 but nitrate ions could not pass through in larger nanotubes 7 7 8 8 9 9 both nitrate and water molecules easily passed through this simulation study showed the optimal size of nanotubes that could be used for nitrate removal from water 78 in a separate study 7 7 and 8 8 silicon carbide nanotubes were immobilized in a silicon nitride membrane and immersed in a sodium nitrate solution along the z axis electric field was applied and ion current retention time of ions radial distribution function of water nanotube and nitrate containing water and autocorrelation function of hydrogen bond was calculated as well it was found that nitrate ions passed most successfully through the 8 8 silicon carbide nanotube 79 3 3 nanofibers nanofibers have diameter lesser than 100nm and have been used in various environmental applications they are safe due to their extremely long length and can easily be incorporated onto any support or media they also have high surface to volume ratio adjustable functionality and large porosity due to these properties they have been used in filtration of particulates airborne nanoscale particles polluted liquids 80 chitosan nanofibers have been widely used for nitrate removal in one study chitosan nanofibers had been utilized to prepare electrospun mats and these mats were used as a support material for the immobilization of algal cells algal cells are widely used in wastewater treatment as they not only treat water but also generate algal biomass that can be used for production of biofuel and other applications such an immobilization required lesser volume and space by the cells for their growth had easy handling and repeated usage for the generation of the product post immobilization these algal cells were utilized in the treatment of water for the removal of nitrate the study showed 87 removal of nitrate from the effluent initial concentration of nitrate was 30mg l initial nitrate removal from the effluent was because of the presence of mats of nanofibers however in later stages the residual nitrate was consumed by the continuously growing algal cells at a reduced rate overall the nanofiber mats having immobilized algal cells showed an increase nitrate removal efficiency 87 when compared to the nitrate removal efficiency of mats without the algal cells 32 81 chitosan al2o3 fe3o4 have been synthesized and used to prepare a nanocomposite nano fibrous adsorbent through electrospinning for nitrate removal the nitrate adsorption experiments were carried out in a single system and a binary system for the single system the optimal concentration of al2fe2o3 was found to be 2 concentrations higher than 2 showed a decrease in the nitrate adsorption efficiency due to possible agglomeration of al2fe2o3 highest nitrate adsorption was found at lower ph at lower ph the functional groups amine and hydroxyl underwent protonation which led to increased adsorption of nitrate however at higher ph 6 there was negligible electrostatic interaction between the nanofiber and nitrate ions which led to comparatively less adsorption the nitrate adsorption capacity also increased with increase in the initial concentration of nitrate and decrease in temperature the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic which was determined from the negative values of δs δg δh these nanofibers showed a nitrate adsorption capacity of 160 70mg g in the binary system a relationship between the adsorbent dosage and the initial concentration of nitrate was estimated through anova analysis of variance the r2 values obtained were higher than 0 98 which indicated towards excellent reliability of the model to predict the efficiency of the nanofibers in removing nitrate increasing concentrations of anions such as sulphate fluoride chloride negatively affected the removal of nitrate due to possible competition for the active sites on the adsorbents 82 3 4 nanoshells nanoshells are made of a dielectric core and are covered by a thin metallic film sio2 feooh fe core nanoshell have been used for nitrate removal sio2 feooh cores were used to immobilize the nzvi through reduction in the presence or absence of the nitrogen gas upon doubling the amount of nzvi the nitrate removal efficiency of the nanoshell increased from 69 to 86 the removal efficiency showed an increase at lower ph the highest percentage of nitrate removal 99 84 was noticed at 64mg l concentration of nitrate at ph 3 this sample had a contact time of 2h between the nitrate and the nanoshell the amount of nanoshell was increased to two folds in a sonication time of 3min 83 3 5 nanoclusters nanoclusters consist of many atoms of the same kind clumped together nanoscale iron cluster with a high surface area had been utilized in a recent research work for the removal of nitrate these nanoclusters were developed through a nzvi having high surface area during the synthesis of these iron nanoclusters when ethanol and water were utilized as co solvents the nanoclusters produced were spherical in shape having a specific surface area of 54 25m2g l and a specific diameter of 80nm the final product obtained showed the presence of whiskers along with the clusters these clusters and whiskers were synthesized in the voids present between the molecules of solvents water and ethanol these voids acted as miniaturized reaction centers for the synthesis of such nanostructures this highlights the significance of solvent systems during the synthesis of nzvi on utilizing nzvi for the removal of nitrate a widespread and fast denitrification of the nitrate was noticed at ambient temperature ammonia was the major primary product obtained during this reaction constituting to around 90 of the total final products obtained while nitrate was getting transformed some of nitrogen containing products were produced such as n2 no and n2o however the nitrite was found to be in highest concentration in the reaction system the amount of iron nanoclusters used played an important role in reducing the nitrate upon increasing the amount of nanoclusters the reaction rate as well as the nitrate removal efficiency increased an increase in the reaction rate was also noticed when the initial concentration of nitrate was amplified however in an open system the reduction of nitrate got reduced due to the consumption of electrons released from iron by the dissolved oxygen the efficient removal of nitrate from nanoclusters took place at higher ph of 9 10 the production of oh at higher ph caused the iron to precipitate and helped in removing secondary pollution from water additionally the reaction of oh with other ions present in the water helped to reduce the content of other pollutants from water during the treatment 84 3 6 nanocomposites nanocomposites such as polymer 85 graphene based 86 and magnetic polymer 87 have been widely used in environmental applications such as in for the treatment or removal of pollutants nanocomposites consist of a combination of nanomaterials which enhance its overall nitrate adsorbing capability in one such case nano sized and bulk carbon silicon composites that were prepared from bamboo the leaves of bamboo contained silica thus had been selected as the source the adsorption of nitrate in nano sized composites were more profound 44 89 as compared to the bulk sized nanocomposites 21 98 11 3425mg g of nitrate was adsorbed on the nano sized composites the preparation method was comparatively simple and this technique was also environmental friendly 88 several chitosan based nanocomposites have been developed for nitrate removal composites of chitosan with polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyethylene glycol peg were prepared and used for nitrate removal from water 0 1g of the composites were added to a solution with initial nitrate concentration of 10mg l the ph and contact time was 3 and 40min respectively the amount of nitrate adsorbed for peg chitosan was 50 68mg g while for pva chitosan it was 35mg g the adsorption data was also well fitted to the freundlich model which showed δh as positive which indicated towards endothermic process δg was negative at different temperatures which indicated towards the spontaneous nature of nitrate adsorption 89 another chitosan based nanocomposite was chitosan zeolitey nano zirconium oxide cts zy nano zro2 nanocomposites which were made to remove nitrate from solution by varying the molar ratios of chitosan cts to zeolite nano zirconium nitrate adsorption was highly dependent on the molar ratios of cts zeolite nan zirconium ph and temperature out of the three components the composite showed the highest nitrate removal efficiency the composite adsorbed 23 58m g of nitrate highest nitrate removal occurred when the molar ratios of cts zeolite nanozirconium were 5 1 ph was 3 temperature was 35 c and contact time was 60min 90 chitosan polystyrene zn nanocomposite through precipitation procedure for nitrate removal have been synthesized using aqueous solutions this nanocomposite removed 90 of nitrate ions from a 25ml solution even at low quantities the initial nitrate concentration and ph was kept at 10mg l and 3 respectively fixed bed column experiments were carried out under the same parameters these experiments removed 82 5 of nitrate parallelly when hcl activated zinc oxide nanoparticles were used in the polluted solution for nitrate removal at the same condition as that of chitosan polystyrene zn nanocomposite they showed complete nitrate removal 91 iron zirconium chitosan fe3o4 zro2 cs i e composite was successfully synthesized which showed great ability to adsorb nitrate in aqueous solutions respectively the maximal adsorption capacities are 89 3mg g for nitrate a probable reason could be the simultaneous adsorption and intra particle diffusion of nitrate ions the adsorbent can also be easily enriched by a magnetic field practically this nanocomposite also showed promising results for treating water that is contaminated with nutrients 92 apart from chitosan based nanocomposites for nitrate removal nano sized lanthanum hydrous doped magnetic graphene had also been prepared to adsorb nitrate ions from sewage and river samples doping of positively charged lanthanum hydrous oxide ions on a negatively charged graphene sheet overcame the electrostatic repulsion between the nitrate ions and the composite the kinetic data of the batch adsorption study was fitted into the langmuir linear model which provided the adsorption capacity of nitrate to be 138 8mg g at a ph 6 8 the presence of co existing ions such as na k ca2 zn2 showed no effect on the nitrate adsorption capacity in river samples the nanocomposite showed a nitrate removal rate of 83 and a removal rate of 74 in the sewage sample 93 4 future perspectives most of the studies have been performed at a laboratory scale therefore newer methods need to be developed for facilitating large scale implementation of this technology and ensure efficient nitrate removal in future the nanomaterials can be merged with conventional techniques for enhanced nitrate removal and enable large scale implementation of the same for nitrate removal green synthetic routes for the preparation of the nanomaterials may be further developed and encouraged naturally occurring nanomaterials such as halloysite nanotubes which are clay based nanomaterials can be used for nitrate removal from aqueous environment they are highly suitable for environmental applications as they are eco friendly inexpensive and possess great adsorption capacity along with excellent tunable surface chemistry 94 100 such properties also enable them to be excellent adsorbents for nitrate they can also be used as supports for different catalysts and thus can enhance nitrate removal rates through reduction processes 5 conclusion nitrate pollution occurs all over the world and is known to have several implications on human health and environment nitrate removal does not occur through common processes for water treatment such as filtration conventional techniques used for its removal include adsorption reverse osmosis ion exchange process and other biological and chemical techniques however these techniques have several limitations nanotechnology is a suitable alternative to remove nitrate over the conventional techniques as it is a cleaner and energy efficient method nanomaterials such as nanoparticles nanotubes nanofibers nanoshells nanoclusters and nanocomposites have been used for nitrate removal major advantages associated with these materials are high surface area easy synthetic routes high catalytic activity and good electrical conductivity the nanomaterials have either been used as adsorbents or as reducing agents due to their large surface areas and high catalytic activity the nanoparticles used were either bare i e used without any modification or were immobilized on a support they were also coated with a stabilizing capping agent or with a carbon based oxide layer to enhance their ability to remove nitrate efficient nitrate removal rates have been achieved using these nanomaterials at differing ph nanomaterial dosage temperature contact time and initial nitrate concentration amount of nitrate removed have been determined through uv spectrophotometry ion chromatography and colorimetric techniques nitrate removal rates as high as 100 have been achieved using different nanomaterials however these nanomaterials have several limitations such as particle agglomeration and toxicity the nanomaterials may also become unstable at varying environmental conditions retrieval separation and recycling of nanomaterials that have been dispersed in a water source for nitrate removal may also be difficult use of novel and greener routes such as employing halloysite nanotubes and its composites for nitrate removal may lead to an improvement in nitrate removal efficiency immobilization of such nanotubes on a membrane may overcome the limitation of separation and recycling from water with development of further techniques that overcome the limitations of nanomaterials nanotechnology may become the silver bullet needed for efficient nitrate removal from aquatic environment 
14607,the objective of this study was to investigate whether arsenic oxidising bacteria asob will grow and survive in rapid sand filters additionally the interdependence of other groundwater constituents fe ii mn ii nh4 with biological as iii oxidation was investigated for this purpose as iii oxidation was monitored in pilot scale filter sand columns fed with raw groundwater as well as treated groundwater drinking water with spikes of either as iii mn ii or nh4 it was concluded that biological as iii oxidation rapidly developed in the rapid sand filter columns with a typical lag and log phase decreasing as iii and increasing as v concentrations in the effluent of the sand columns were observed in a timeframe of weeks the growth of biomass in the sand columns was confirmed with atp analysis atp concentrations on the sand grains increased from 0 7 ng g to 16 8 and 2 ng g filter sand stratified from the top of the sand filter to the bottom respectively additionally a microbial community analysis 16s rrna showed a high relative abundance of α and β proteobacteria the same classes where most asob are phylogenetically placed this study establishes that asob are able to grow and maintain their population on low as iii concentrations either in presence or absence of other common groundwater bacteria and mineral precipitates directly leading to an increased as removal in the filter bed keywords groundwater treatment rapid sand filtration arsenic removal biological as iii oxidation 1 introduction conventional groundwater treatment plants for drinking water production consisting of aeration and rapid sand filtration are primarily designed for removal of dissolved iron fe manganese mn and ammonium nh4 however when present arsenic as is often only partially removed by this technology potentially affecting drinking water safety therefore drinking water companies in the netherlands are currently considering a new target of 1 μg l to prevent costly modifications to an otherwise simple treatment set up better understanding of as removal mechanisms in rapid sand filters needs to be gained prior to rapid sand filtration anaerobic groundwater is aerated with spray or cascade aeration equilibrating the water with oxygen o2 and removing part of the carbon dioxide co2 hydrogen sulphite h2s and methane ch4 o2 facilitates the oxidative removal of fe mn and nh4 in the subsequent filter bed the aerated water is supplied to the supernatant water of a rapid sand filter that typically consists of a sand bed with a height of 1 5 2 5 m and is operated with a downward filtration velocity of 3 8 m h pressure drop or effluent water quality trigger a periodical backwash procedure to remove the retained solids 1 in the filter bed fe ii can be removed via homogeneous heterogeneous and biological oxidation depending on operational parameters such as supernatant water level filtration velocity ph and o2 concentration 2 the backwashed solids mainly consist of hydrous ferric oxides hfo and its adsorbed substances 3 homogeneous mn ii oxidation is slow 4 and therefore removal of mn mainly occurs in the filter bed via a biological oxidation pathway to mn oxides mno2 5 7 nh4 is also biologically oxidised in the filter bed 8 in a two step process executed by bacteria and archaea via nitrite no2 to nitrate no3 9 as when dissolved in anaerobic groundwater is at neutral ph and slightly acidic water typically present as h3aso3 the reduced uncharged trivalent form 10 11 while after filtration the remaining as is present as h2aso4 3 this is the oxidised charged pentavalent form at neutral ph as v is in contrast to as iii negatively charged and is therefore more efficiently removed via adsorption to hfo 12 13 measurements over the height of the filter bed pointed out that as iii oxidises rapidly in the top layer of a rapid sand filter 3 since homogeneous as iii oxidation occurs on a time scale of days 12 14 the observed rapid oxidation was hypothesised to be either biological by mno2 present on the filter grains or a combination of the two however although mno2 is capable of oxidising as iii 15 it can be inhibited in presence of fe ii and mn ii 13 16 17 the alternative explanation for the accelerated as iii oxidation during rapid sand filtration is the presence of as iii oxidising bacteria asob at least 50 phylogenetically diverse as iii oxidizing strains distributed over 25 genera have been isolated from various environments 18 and aerobic asob have been found in groundwater aquifers 19 20 and groundwater treatment filters 21 asob can be subdivided into heterotrophic bacteria 22 24 and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria 25 26 24 heterotrophic bacteria oxidize as iii as a detoxification mechanism 27 29 and require organic matter for growth and as iii oxidation chemolithoautotrophic bacteria on the other hand can use as iii as the principal electron donor in catabolism and use inorganic carbon as their carbon source 30 phylogenetic studies classified most asob in the proteobacteria phylum within this phylum they can be subdivided as follows most asob in the α proteobacteria class are chemolithoautotrophic most in the β proteobacteria class are heterotrophic and all asob in the ɣ proteobacteria class are heterotrophic 31 32 so far as iii oxidation in rapid sand filters has only been studied in the relation to other biological processes whereby as iii oxidation was regarded to rely on co occurring bio chemical processes including oxidation with fe 33 mn 34 35 nh4 36 or in combination with biogenic mno2 37 other studies have focussed on using various inoculates to invoke biological as iii oxidation 38 37 although asob are found in rapid sand filters 21 it is however far less researched whether these bacteria are responsible for as iii oxidation independent of co occurring chemical and biological processes as a result of fe mn and nh4 removal the oxidation of as iii by asob is of great interest for as iii removal because the resulting as v formation is imperative for subsequent adsorption onto hfo in filters 12 13 therefore the objective of this study was firstly to investigate whether asob will grow on as iii substrate in rapid sand filters in absence of other biological ammonium manganese and ferrous oxidising bacteria and chemical hfo mno2 processes and secondly it was the aim to assess whether a mature asob population can survive in rapid sand filters with low as iii concentrations 10 μg l amidst the other major groundwater constituents fe ii mn ii nh4 for this purpose as iii oxidation was investigated in pilot scale sand filter columns fed with raw groundwater as well as treated groundwater drinking water with spikes of either as iii mn ii or nh4 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedure for the purpose of accumulating different biomasses that were tested on their ability to oxidise as iii multiple experiments were executed by preloading sand columns with different feed water qualities i e preloading consisted of gently flowing a specific water quality through the columns to establish a biomass in the column as iii oxidation was tested with five different water quality settings of which the first two can be considered as control settings 1 virgin sand no preloading 2 blank sand preloaded with drinking water 3 as iii sand preloaded with drinking water and added as iii 4 nh4 sand preloaded with drinking water and added nh4 and 5 mn sand preloaded with drinking water and added mn ii additionally an experiment with naturally as iii containing groundwater was done to find the influence of the natural groundwater matrix on the asob here the filtrate of sand filters was compared for 50 days by using virgin sand no preloading and sand with an as iii oxidising biomass preloaded by drinking water spiked with as iii all experiments were executed as triplicates 2 2 experimental column set up the experimental set up consisted of 12 identical columns therefore 4 settings could run simultaneously in triplicates fig 1 each column has a diameter of 90 mm and a height of 1m the columns were filled with 0 5 m 2 quartz sand 0 4 0 8 mm obtained from aqua techniek which is typically used for rapid sand filtration before starting the experiment the columns were extensively backwashed with drinking water until the supernatant was visually clear the flowrate used for all experiments was set to 105 ml min per column resulting in a filtration velocity of 1 m h 10 supernatant water level in the columns was kept at 10 cm during the drinking water experiments for the purpose of sufficient chemical mixing chemicals when used were directly dosed in the supernatant water using peristatic dosing pumps cole parmer masterflex l s at a continuous flow of 1 ml min for the aerated groundwater experiments the supernatant water level was lowered to an initial height of 2 cm which as a result of filter clogging rose to 15 cm just before backwashing backwashing procedure was executed with drinking water and consisted of expanding the filter bed by 20 until the supernatant water was visually clear the anaerobic groundwater was aerated by cascading the groundwater directly into the supernatant water no chemicals were dosed in the natural groundwater throughout the experiment the sand columns were continuously fed with spiked drinking water or groundwater and covered to prevent direct sun light influencing the results 2 3 water quality the column experiments were performed at water treatment plant dorst brabant water natural groundwater was used to perform the experiments in the presence of fe mn and nh4 preloading was executed with drinking water produced at this production location spiked with the prior mentioned desired components both the quality of the groundwater and the drinking water are shown in table 1 the groundwater is anaerobic and abstracted from 140 m depth drinking water is produced by aeration and rapid sand filtration including the dosage of 2 mg l namno4 and 2 mg l fecl3 to stimulate as removal 2 4 chemicals addition and concentrations the as iii mn ii and nh4 dosing solutions were prepared from the following reagent grade chemicals as iii cl3 aldrich chemistry 99 99 trace metals basis mn ii cl2 aldrich chemistry 98 beads and nh4cl emsure 99 8 the chemicals were diluted in drinking water to 10 6 212 and 106 mg l respectively to prevent oxidation in the dosing vessels 25l the vessels containing as iii and mn ii were acidified to ph 3 4 by adding 8 12 ml 5 m hno3 the chemicals were continuously pumped into the supernatant water with a flow rate of 1 ml min targeting an influent concentration of approximately 100 μg l as iii 1 mg l nh4 and 2 mg l mn ii 2 5 sampling and analytical methods samples from supernatant water were collected with a syringe from the lowest part of the supernatant water filtrate was obtained from the discharge tube after the overflow to prevent changing the filtration rate ph electrical conductivity ec and o2 were measured with wtw electrodes sentix 940 terracon 925 and fdo925 as fe and mn were analysed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo x2 series nh4 no2 no3 and po4 were analysed by a discrete analyser spectophotometry aquakem 250 thermo scientific as speciation was done according the clifford 47 method here 150 ml sample is passed through an anionic resin 80 ml amberlite ira 400 chlorite form resin in a 100 ml syringe that retains only the charged as v species the filtrate from the resin is considered to be as iii only as v is then calculated by subtracting as iii from the measured total as concentration the first 50 ml was always discarded the remaining 100 ml was collected and analysed using icp ms the clifford method is a robust method however it was found that unavoidably the resin retained 14 of as iii min 7 max 23 n 24 2 6 biomass characterization and profiling the biomass accumulation stages were finalised by removing the filter sand from the columns and analysed on adenine triphosphate atp which serves as an indicator of active biomass 39 40 for the purpose of quantifying the biomass after the different experiments from a completely filled sampling bottle 100 ml 1 g of sand was weighted and 9 ml of atp free water was added this sample was shaken shortly where after it was ultrasonically vibrated for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath bransson subsequently the sample was rested for 5 min before atp measurement samples were processed by the atp meter centro xs3 lb960 berthold using a chemical kit from biothema in addition to the atp analysis a microbial community analysis was performed for all columns experiments 100 ml filter sand was harvested and stored at 80 c of these samples around 0 5 g was used for dna extraction with the dneasy ultraclean microbial kit qiagen the dna was subjected to quality checks that consisted of agarose gel electrophoresis aiming to verify dna integrity and a qubit fluorometer and the ds dna hs assay life technologies analysis to determine the concentration of dna that was obtained from the sand samples the bioanalyzer agilent was used to perform an additional integrity and concentration check after which bacterial v3 v4 16s rrna genes were amplified and subjected to high throughput sequencing using the miseq platform from illumina and at baseclear leiden the netherlands reads were generated using the illumina casava pipeline version 1 8 3 checked using illumina chastity filtering plus an in house protocol baseclear and final assessment was made using the fastqc quality control tool version 0 10 0 qiime workflows were used to generate taxonomic summaries 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 as iii oxidation in various preloaded sand columns sand columns were preloaded with drinking water blank drinking water with added nh4 nh4 drinking water with added mn ii mn and drinking water with added as iii as during preloading the water quality was monitored to determine if bacteria had grown to convert nh4 mn and as in the columns the moment of conversion determined the minimum duration of pre loading table 2 summarises the in and effluent water quality at the end of preloading as well as the duration of preloading per column the water quality parameters in table 2 primarily shows an effect from preloading in the nh4 columns preloading did not affect the water quality over time in the other columns initially part of the as was adsorbed to the filter sand however over the course of the experiment as adsorption decreased resulting in an average removal of 4 5 during preloading the preloading with nh4 resulted in measureable changes in o2 and ph caused by its oxidation after the preloading period the effluent of the columns no longer contained nh4 nor no2 so nitrification to no3 was found to be complete surprisingly mn oxidising bacteria did not seem to have grown in the mn ii preloaded columns because mn ii removal as mno2 was not observed additionally mn ii oxidation would have resulted in changing o2 and ph values during the experiment and this was not observed the column preloaded with drinking water did not show apparent water quality changes however the post experiment analyses of atp on the filter sand showed that indeed drinking water native bacteria had grown in the column fig 2 note that the atp value on the virgin filter sand was only 0 71 ng g prior to preloading the drinking water used for these experiments contained 3 7 ng l atp the atp values in the columns preloaded with drinking water containing mn or as showed similar values and although modest showed more bacterial activity in the top layer than the blank columns with 73 and 45 higher atp concentrations respectively the largest atp concentrations on sand were achieved by preloading with drinking water and nh4 in the top of the sand bed this led to more than 15 times higher atp concentrations than the preloaded columns with drinking water only additionally it was observed that the biomass was stratified over the filter from the highest concentration of biomass in the top of the sand filter to the lowest biomass concentration at the bottom this is in line with findings of lee et al 8 where nh4 oxidising bacteria in a sand filter showed a similar vertical distribution after the preloading stage all columns were loaded with 20 μg l as iii for 24 h to investigate whether the bacteria in the various columns were capable of oxidising as iii to as v about 10 of the dosed as was retained in the sand columns therefore the percentage of oxidised as in the filtrate is depicted in fig 3 during the first 6 h no as iii was oxidised in the columns preloaded with nh4 mn ii or drinking water alone thereby establishing that no significant abiotic as iii oxidation occurred in the sand columns and the biomasses that had not in advance been exposed to as iii could not instantly oxidise the dosed as iii this was in contrast to the columns preloaded with 100 μg l as iii the filtrate of these columns contained solely oxidised as apparently within 38 days asob had grown in these columns during preloading after 24 h it seems that oxidation of as iii started to occur in all columns particularly in the nh4 preloaded column where 40 of the as in the filtrate was as v apparently an adaptation phase of the well developed biofilm started and resulted in the oxidation of 9 μg l as iii 3 2 bacterial growth profile of as iii oxidation on virgin filter sand as iii and as v in the filtrate during this 38 days of pre loading with as iii spiked drinking water are depicted in fig 4 during the entire experiment the average as iii concentration in the supernatant water was 116 μg l min 98 max 135 μg l but due to slow homogeneous oxidation in the dosing vessel the as iii concentration at the end of the experiment decreased to 95 μg l the results in fig 4 show that initially the sand columns did not oxidise as iii but with a daily influx of 150 l as iii containing drinking water the columns gradually started oxidising as iii after 38 days 98 of as iii was oxidized to as v in the sand columns the process started after approximately one week however the oxidation rate accelerated after 14 days this is typical for a bacterial process where after a lag phase of limited bacterial growth a log phase follows of rapid bacterial growth 42 additionally the atp concentration of the filter sand increased from 0 71 ng g to 16 ng g in the top of the sand filter indicating an increased bacterial activity within the 38 days experiment 39 therefore it may be concluded that the gradual as iii oxidation observed in the columns was caused by asob given that the experiment with drinking water without as iii or mn ii and nh4 initially showed no as iii oxidation fig 3 it is suggested that a specific asob population was grown by preloading filter sand with as iii substrate additionally microbial community profiling of the biomass on the filter sand after preloading with as iii showed a biomass with a high relative abundance of α and β proteobacteria fig 5 within these two classes of proteobacteria most asob are phylogenetically placed 31 32 3 3 as iii oxidising biomass growth in existing biomass to investigate whether asob would grow in an already accumulated biomass 100 μg l as iii was dosed to preloaded columns for 22 days prior to as iii dosage the columns were loaded with drinking water and drinking water with additional nh4 for 50 days the experiment started when the latter biomass was capable of completely converting 1 mg l nh4 to no3 the resulting as iii and as v concentrations in the filtrate are depicted in fig 6 results show that independent of the type of preloading both columns successfully oxidised the added as iii within three weeks and in addition compared to the as iii oxidation experiment on virgin sand fig 4 both columns already containing a biomass reached complete oxidation in a shorter time in the nh4 preloaded sand columns as iii was completely oxidised within 21 days without retarding or inhibiting nitrification the experiment without nh4 addition using the same drinking water showed a similar as iii oxidation pattern only initially deviating from the oxidation pattern in the nh4 preloaded columns starting with a more gentle slope than the nh4 preloaded columns in the first week after 7 days and onwards these columns followed the same as iii concentration gradient the above suggests that established biological processes prior to as iii exposure do not retard or prevent biological as iii oxidation but accelerate them a comparable study performed by lami et al 43 showed that when as iii was dosed to a mixed biomass soil culture analogue to fig 6 alteration and adaptation of the biomass was observed within weeks whereby some as iii oxidizing bacterial groups had increased up to 20 fold compared to a control experiment the overall conclusion here is that nh4 oxidising biomass nitrification had no detrimental effect on the development of biological as iii oxidation in groundwater filters but the additional nh4 or no3 nutrients rather stimulated the asob accumulation 3 4 biological as iii oxidation in natural aerated groundwater in natural groundwater apart from nh4 and mn ii also other constituents such as fe ii po4 ch4 and h2s may enter the filter bed together with as iii therefore the sand column experiments were repeated with natural aerated groundwater with virgin sand columns and as iii preloaded 35 days sand columns capable of oxidising 100 μg l as iii in contrast to prior experiments oxidising fe ii caused the filter bed to clog with hfo and a 2 3 day backwash cycle had to be applied the run time of this experiment was 50 days and during this period the supernatant water level ph and o2 were 2 15 cm 7 47 7 78 and 3 56 4 58 mg l respectively fig 7 depicts removal percentages for fe nh4 and po4 over the run time of the virgin sand columns left and the columns preloaded with as iii right fe was instantly and completely removed in all columns it is expected that initially the removal process was due to abiotic homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation 2 it is possible that during the experimental period this shifted to a partially biological fe oxidation process 44 the 150 μg l po4 was consistently removed between 80 and 90 in both columns presumably by co precipitation with oxidised fe ii and adsorption to hfo 45 the increased po4 removal 10 μg l after the lag and log phase of the ammonium removal process could indicate the utilisation of po4 for the growth of biomass responsible for nitrification 46 the difference in ripening time between the column types was about 2 days which is consistent with the previous findings where it was observed that preloading had a generic accelerating effect on biological processes fig 6 however both column types consistently converted the major part of the nh4 within 30 days mn removal did not start within this 50 day experiment both in the virgin sand columns and in the preloaded columns at the end of the experiment the various oxidation processes in both the virgin sand and as iii preloaded columns consumed about 1 6 mg l o2 from the results depicted in fig 7 it can thus be concluded that preloading sand columns with as iii containing drinking water did not influence fe mn and po4 removal and only mildly accelerated start up of nh4 removal this suggests that the as iii oxidising

differentiated for both the virgin sand columns and the as iii preloaded sand columns the first five days of filtration as iii oxidation in the virgin sand columns was low and the removal efficiency of as was steady at around 30 although complete oxidation in the as iii preloaded sand columns was achieved throughout the experiment initially slightly less as was removed compared to the virgin sand columns potentially caused by as iii saturation of the sand grain surface during preloading and desorbing the first days of feeding aerated groundwater from day 5 until 28 biological as iii oxidation was developed in the virgin sand columns and subsequently increased the as removal efficiency from 30 to 60 because the produced as v has a higher affinity to hfo than as iii 12 13 after 28 days the as removal became stable at 60 for both columns until the end of the experiment the similarity of both the as iii preloaded sand columns and the virgin sand after this period suggests that the biological oxidation potential was fully utilised and a higher as removal due to adsorption on hfo could not be expected in the current column design and operation it is concluded that preloading of as iii to establish an as iii oxidising biomass provided only a beneficial effect in the initial weeks of operation as this positive effect got neutralised by the growth of asob on the sand grains in

14607,the objective of this study was to investigate whether arsenic oxidising bacteria asob will grow and survive in rapid sand filters additionally the interdependence of other groundwater constituents fe ii mn ii nh4 with biological as iii oxidation was investigated for this purpose as iii oxidation was monitored in pilot scale filter sand columns fed with raw groundwater as well as treated groundwater drinking water with spikes of either as iii mn ii or nh4 it was concluded that biological as iii oxidation rapidly developed in the rapid sand filter columns with a typical lag and log phase decreasing as iii and increasing as v concentrations in the effluent of the sand columns were observed in a timeframe of weeks the growth of biomass in the sand columns was confirmed with atp analysis atp concentrations on the sand grains increased from 0 7 ng g to 16 8 and 2 ng g filter sand stratified from the top of the sand filter to the bottom respectively additionally a microbial community analysis 16s rrna showed a high relative abundance of α and β proteobacteria the same classes where most asob are phylogenetically placed this study establishes that asob are able to grow and maintain their population on low as iii concentrations either in presence or absence of other common groundwater bacteria and mineral precipitates directly leading to an increased as removal in the filter bed keywords groundwater treatment rapid sand filtration arsenic removal biological as iii oxidation 1 introduction conventional groundwater treatment plants for drinking water production consisting of aeration and rapid sand filtration are primarily designed for removal of dissolved iron fe manganese mn and ammonium nh4 however when present arsenic as is often only partially removed by this technology potentially affecting drinking water safety therefore drinking water companies in the netherlands are currently considering a new target of 1 μg l to prevent costly modifications to an otherwise simple treatment set up better understanding of as removal mechanisms in rapid sand filters needs to be gained prior to rapid sand filtration anaerobic groundwater is aerated with spray or cascade aeration equilibrating the water with oxygen o2 and removing part of the carbon dioxide co2 hydrogen sulphite h2s and methane ch4 o2 facilitates the oxidative removal of fe mn and nh4 in the subsequent filter bed the aerated water is supplied to the supernatant water of a rapid sand filter that typically consists of a sand bed with a height of 1 5 2 5 m and is operated with a downward filtration velocity of 3 8 m h pressure drop or effluent water quality trigger a periodical backwash procedure to remove the retained solids 1 in the filter bed fe ii can be removed via homogeneous heterogeneous and biological oxidation depending on operational parameters such as supernatant water level filtration velocity ph and o2 concentration 2 the backwashed solids mainly consist of hydrous ferric oxides hfo and its adsorbed substances 3 homogeneous mn ii oxidation is slow 4 and therefore removal of mn mainly occurs in the filter bed via a biological oxidation pathway to mn oxides mno2 5 7 nh4 is also biologically oxidised in the filter bed 8 in a two step process executed by bacteria and archaea via nitrite no2 to nitrate no3 9 as when dissolved in anaerobic groundwater is at neutral ph and slightly acidic water typically present as h3aso3 the reduced uncharged trivalent form 10 11 while after filtration the remaining as is present as h2aso4 3 this is the oxidised charged pentavalent form at neutral ph as v is in contrast to as iii negatively charged and is therefore more efficiently removed via adsorption to hfo 12 13 measurements over the height of the filter bed pointed out that as iii oxidises rapidly in the top layer of a rapid sand filter 3 since homogeneous as iii oxidation occurs on a time scale of days 12 14 the observed rapid oxidation was hypothesised to be either biological by mno2 present on the filter grains or a combination of the two however although mno2 is capable of oxidising as iii 15 it can be inhibited in presence of fe ii and mn ii 13 16 17 the alternative explanation for the accelerated as iii oxidation during rapid sand filtration is the presence of as iii oxidising bacteria asob at least 50 phylogenetically diverse as iii oxidizing strains distributed over 25 genera have been isolated from various environments 18 and aerobic asob have been found in groundwater aquifers 19 20 and groundwater treatment filters 21 asob can be subdivided into heterotrophic bacteria 22 24 and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria 25 26 24 heterotrophic bacteria oxidize as iii as a detoxification mechanism 27 29 and require organic matter for growth and as iii oxidation chemolithoautotrophic bacteria on the other hand can use as iii as the principal electron donor in catabolism and use inorganic carbon as their carbon source 30 phylogenetic studies classified most asob in the proteobacteria phylum within this phylum they can be subdivided as follows most asob in the α proteobacteria class are chemolithoautotrophic most in the β proteobacteria class are heterotrophic and all asob in the ɣ proteobacteria class are heterotrophic 31 32 so far as iii oxidation in rapid sand filters has only been studied in the relation to other biological processes whereby as iii oxidation was regarded to rely on co occurring bio chemical processes including oxidation with fe 33 mn 34 35 nh4 36 or in combination with biogenic mno2 37 other studies have focussed on using various inoculates to invoke biological as iii oxidation 38 37 although asob are found in rapid sand filters 21 it is however far less researched whether these bacteria are responsible for as iii oxidation independent of co occurring chemical and biological processes as a result of fe mn and nh4 removal the oxidation of as iii by asob is of great interest for as iii removal because the resulting as v formation is imperative for subsequent adsorption onto hfo in filters 12 13 therefore the objective of this study was firstly to investigate whether asob will grow on as iii substrate in rapid sand filters in absence of other biological ammonium manganese and ferrous oxidising bacteria and chemical hfo mno2 processes and secondly it was the aim to assess whether a mature asob population can survive in rapid sand filters with low as iii concentrations 10 μg l amidst the other major groundwater constituents fe ii mn ii nh4 for this purpose as iii oxidation was investigated in pilot scale sand filter columns fed with raw groundwater as well as treated groundwater drinking water with spikes of either as iii mn ii or nh4 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedure for the purpose of accumulating different biomasses that were tested on their ability to oxidise as iii multiple experiments were executed by preloading sand columns with different feed water qualities i e preloading consisted of gently flowing a specific water quality through the columns to establish a biomass in the column as iii oxidation was tested with five different water quality settings of which the first two can be considered as control settings 1 virgin sand no preloading 2 blank sand preloaded with drinking water 3 as iii sand preloaded with drinking water and added as iii 4 nh4 sand preloaded with drinking water and added nh4 and 5 mn sand preloaded with drinking water and added mn ii additionally an experiment with naturally as iii containing groundwater was done to find the influence of the natural groundwater matrix on the asob here the filtrate of sand filters was compared for 50 days by using virgin sand no preloading and sand with an as iii oxidising biomass preloaded by drinking water spiked with as iii all experiments were executed as triplicates 2 2 experimental column set up the experimental set up consisted of 12 identical columns therefore 4 settings could run simultaneously in triplicates fig 1 each column has a diameter of 90 mm and a height of 1m the columns were filled with 0 5 m 2 quartz sand 0 4 0 8 mm obtained from aqua techniek which is typically used for rapid sand filtration before starting the experiment the columns were extensively backwashed with drinking water until the supernatant was visually clear the flowrate used for all experiments was set to 105 ml min per column resulting in a filtration velocity of 1 m h 10 supernatant water level in the columns was kept at 10 cm during the drinking water experiments for the purpose of sufficient chemical mixing chemicals when used were directly dosed in the supernatant water using peristatic dosing pumps cole parmer masterflex l s at a continuous flow of 1 ml min for the aerated groundwater experiments the supernatant water level was lowered to an initial height of 2 cm which as a result of filter clogging rose to 15 cm just before backwashing backwashing procedure was executed with drinking water and consisted of expanding the filter bed by 20 until the supernatant water was visually clear the anaerobic groundwater was aerated by cascading the groundwater directly into the supernatant water no chemicals were dosed in the natural groundwater throughout the experiment the sand columns were continuously fed with spiked drinking water or groundwater and covered to prevent direct sun light influencing the results 2 3 water quality the column experiments were performed at water treatment plant dorst brabant water natural groundwater was used to perform the experiments in the presence of fe mn and nh4 preloading was executed with drinking water produced at this production location spiked with the prior mentioned desired components both the quality of the groundwater and the drinking water are shown in table 1 the groundwater is anaerobic and abstracted from 140 m depth drinking water is produced by aeration and rapid sand filtration including the dosage of 2 mg l namno4 and 2 mg l fecl3 to stimulate as removal 2 4 chemicals addition and concentrations the as iii mn ii and nh4 dosing solutions were prepared from the following reagent grade chemicals as iii cl3 aldrich chemistry 99 99 trace metals basis mn ii cl2 aldrich chemistry 98 beads and nh4cl emsure 99 8 the chemicals were diluted in drinking water to 10 6 212 and 106 mg l respectively to prevent oxidation in the dosing vessels 25l the vessels containing as iii and mn ii were acidified to ph 3 4 by adding 8 12 ml 5 m hno3 the chemicals were continuously pumped into the supernatant water with a flow rate of 1 ml min targeting an influent concentration of approximately 100 μg l as iii 1 mg l nh4 and 2 mg l mn ii 2 5 sampling and analytical methods samples from supernatant water were collected with a syringe from the lowest part of the supernatant water filtrate was obtained from the discharge tube after the overflow to prevent changing the filtration rate ph electrical conductivity ec and o2 were measured with wtw electrodes sentix 940 terracon 925 and fdo925 as fe and mn were analysed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo x2 series nh4 no2 no3 and po4 were analysed by a discrete analyser spectophotometry aquakem 250 thermo scientific as speciation was done according the clifford 47 method here 150 ml sample is passed through an anionic resin 80 ml amberlite ira 400 chlorite form resin in a 100 ml syringe that retains only the charged as v species the filtrate from the resin is considered to be as iii only as v is then calculated by subtracting as iii from the measured total as concentration the first 50 ml was always discarded the remaining 100 ml was collected and analysed using icp ms the clifford method is a robust method however it was found that unavoidably the resin retained 14 of as iii min 7 max 23 n 24 2 6 biomass characterization and profiling the biomass accumulation stages were finalised by removing the filter sand from the columns and analysed on adenine triphosphate atp which serves as an indicator of active biomass 39 40 for the purpose of quantifying the biomass after the different experiments from a completely filled sampling bottle 100 ml 1 g of sand was weighted and 9 ml of atp free water was added this sample was shaken shortly where after it was ultrasonically vibrated for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath bransson subsequently the sample was rested for 5 min before atp measurement samples were processed by the atp meter centro xs3 lb960 berthold using a chemical kit from biothema in addition to the atp analysis a microbial community analysis was performed for all columns experiments 100 ml filter sand was harvested and stored at 80 c of these samples around 0 5 g was used for dna extraction with the dneasy ultraclean microbial kit qiagen the dna was subjected to quality checks that consisted of agarose gel electrophoresis aiming to verify dna integrity and a qubit fluorometer and the ds dna hs assay life technologies analysis to determine the concentration of dna that was obtained from the sand samples the bioanalyzer agilent was used to perform an additional integrity and concentration check after which bacterial v3 v4 16s rrna genes were amplified and subjected to high throughput sequencing using the miseq platform from illumina and at baseclear leiden the netherlands reads were generated using the illumina casava pipeline version 1 8 3 checked using illumina chastity filtering plus an in house protocol baseclear and final assessment was made using the fastqc quality control tool version 0 10 0 qiime workflows were used to generate taxonomic summaries 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 as iii oxidation in various preloaded sand columns sand columns were preloaded with drinking water blank drinking water with added nh4 nh4 drinking water with added mn ii mn and drinking water with added as iii as during preloading the water quality was monitored to determine if bacteria had grown to convert nh4 mn and as in the columns the moment of conversion determined the minimum duration of pre loading table 2 summarises the in and effluent water quality at the end of preloading as well as the duration of preloading per column the water quality parameters in table 2 primarily shows an effect from preloading in the nh4 columns preloading did not affect the water quality over time in the other columns initially part of the as was adsorbed to the filter sand however over the course of the experiment as adsorption decreased resulting in an average removal of 4 5 during preloading the preloading with nh4 resulted in measureable changes in o2 and ph caused by its oxidation after the preloading period the effluent of the columns no longer contained nh4 nor no2 so nitrification to no3 was found to be complete surprisingly mn oxidising bacteria did not seem to have grown in the mn ii preloaded columns because mn ii removal as mno2 was not observed additionally mn ii oxidation would have resulted in changing o2 and ph values during the experiment and this was not observed the column preloaded with drinking water did not show apparent water quality changes however the post experiment analyses of atp on the filter sand showed that indeed drinking water native bacteria had grown in the column fig 2 note that the atp value on the virgin filter sand was only 0 71 ng g prior to preloading the drinking water used for these experiments contained 3 7 ng l atp the atp values in the columns preloaded with drinking water containing mn or as showed similar values and although modest showed more bacterial activity in the top layer than the blank columns with 73 and 45 higher atp concentrations respectively the largest atp concentrations on sand were achieved by preloading with drinking water and nh4 in the top of the sand bed this led to more than 15 times higher atp concentrations than the preloaded columns with drinking water only additionally it was observed that the biomass was stratified over the filter from the highest concentration of biomass in the top of the sand filter to the lowest biomass concentration at the bottom this is in line with findings of lee et al 8 where nh4 oxidising bacteria in a sand filter showed a similar vertical distribution after the preloading stage all columns were loaded with 20 μg l as iii for 24 h to investigate whether the bacteria in the various columns were capable of oxidising as iii to as v about 10 of the dosed as was retained in the sand columns therefore the percentage of oxidised as in the filtrate is depicted in fig 3 during the first 6 h no as iii was oxidised in the columns preloaded with nh4 mn ii or drinking water alone thereby establishing that no significant abiotic as iii oxidation occurred in the sand columns and the biomasses that had not in advance been exposed to as iii could not instantly oxidise the dosed as iii this was in contrast to the columns preloaded with 100 μg l as iii the filtrate of these columns contained solely oxidised as apparently within 38 days asob had grown in these columns during preloading after 24 h it seems that oxidation of as iii started to occur in all columns particularly in the nh4 preloaded column where 40 of the as in the filtrate was as v apparently an adaptation phase of the well developed biofilm started and resulted in the oxidation of 9 μg l as iii 3 2 bacterial growth profile of as iii oxidation on virgin filter sand as iii and as v in the filtrate during this 38 days of pre loading with as iii spiked drinking water are depicted in fig 4 during the entire experiment the average as iii concentration in the supernatant water was 116 μg l min 98 max 135 μg l but due to slow homogeneous oxidation in the dosing vessel the as iii concentration at the end of the experiment decreased to 95 μg l the results in fig 4 show that initially the sand columns did not oxidise as iii but with a daily influx of 150 l as iii containing drinking water the columns gradually started oxidising as iii after 38 days 98 of as iii was oxidized to as v in the sand columns the process started after approximately one week however the oxidation rate accelerated after 14 days this is typical for a bacterial process where after a lag phase of limited bacterial growth a log phase follows of rapid bacterial growth 42 additionally the atp concentration of the filter sand increased from 0 71 ng g to 16 ng g in the top of the sand filter indicating an increased bacterial activity within the 38 days experiment 39 therefore it may be concluded that the gradual as iii oxidation observed in the columns was caused by asob given that the experiment with drinking water without as iii or mn ii and nh4 initially showed no as iii oxidation fig 3 it is suggested that a specific asob population was grown by preloading filter sand with as iii substrate additionally microbial community profiling of the biomass on the filter sand after preloading with as iii showed a biomass with a high relative abundance of α and β proteobacteria fig 5 within these two classes of proteobacteria most asob are phylogenetically placed 31 32 3 3 as iii oxidising biomass growth in existing biomass to investigate whether asob would grow in an already accumulated biomass 100 μg l as iii was dosed to preloaded columns for 22 days prior to as iii dosage the columns were loaded with drinking water and drinking water with additional nh4 for 50 days the experiment started when the latter biomass was capable of completely converting 1 mg l nh4 to no3 the resulting as iii and as v concentrations in the filtrate are depicted in fig 6 results show that independent of the type of preloading both columns successfully oxidised the added as iii within three weeks and in addition compared to the as iii oxidation experiment on virgin sand fig 4 both columns already containing a biomass reached complete oxidation in a shorter time in the nh4 preloaded sand columns as iii was completely oxidised within 21 days without retarding or inhibiting nitrification the experiment without nh4 addition using the same drinking water showed a similar as iii oxidation pattern only initially deviating from the oxidation pattern in the nh4 preloaded columns starting with a more gentle slope than the nh4 preloaded columns in the first week after 7 days and onwards these columns followed the same as iii concentration gradient the above suggests that established biological processes prior to as iii exposure do not retard or prevent biological as iii oxidation but accelerate them a comparable study performed by lami et al 43 showed that when as iii was dosed to a mixed biomass soil culture analogue to fig 6 alteration and adaptation of the biomass was observed within weeks whereby some as iii oxidizing bacterial groups had increased up to 20 fold compared to a control experiment the overall conclusion here is that nh4 oxidising biomass nitrification had no detrimental effect on the development of biological as iii oxidation in groundwater filters but the additional nh4 or no3 nutrients rather stimulated the asob accumulation 3 4 biological as iii oxidation in natural aerated groundwater in natural groundwater apart from nh4 and mn ii also other constituents such as fe ii po4 ch4 and h2s may enter the filter bed together with as iii therefore the sand column experiments were repeated with natural aerated groundwater with virgin sand columns and as iii preloaded 35 days sand columns capable of oxidising 100 μg l as iii in contrast to prior experiments oxidising fe ii caused the filter bed to clog with hfo and a 2 3 day backwash cycle had to be applied the run time of this experiment was 50 days and during this period the supernatant water level ph and o2 were 2 15 cm 7 47 7 78 and 3 56 4 58 mg l respectively fig 7 depicts removal percentages for fe nh4 and po4 over the run time of the virgin sand columns left and the columns preloaded with as iii right fe was instantly and completely removed in all columns it is expected that initially the removal process was due to abiotic homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation 2 it is possible that during the experimental period this shifted to a partially biological fe oxidation process 44 the 150 μg l po4 was consistently removed between 80 and 90 in both columns presumably by co precipitation with oxidised fe ii and adsorption to hfo 45 the increased po4 removal 10 μg l after the lag and log phase of the ammonium removal process could indicate the utilisation of po4 for the growth of biomass responsible for nitrification 46 the difference in ripening time between the column types was about 2 days which is consistent with the previous findings where it was observed that preloading had a generic accelerating effect on biological processes fig 6 however both column types consistently converted the major part of the nh4 within 30 days mn removal did not start within this 50 day experiment both in the virgin sand columns and in the preloaded columns at the end of the experiment the various oxidation processes in both the virgin sand and as iii preloaded columns consumed about 1 6 mg l o2 from the results depicted in fig 7 it can thus be concluded that preloading sand columns with as iii containing drinking water did not influence fe mn and po4 removal and only mildly accelerated start up of nh4 removal this suggests that the as iii oxidising biomass did not accelerate nh4 and mn ii removal fig 8 depicts the as concentration in the raw groundwater more than 90 present as as iii and in the filtrate for both the as iii preloaded sand columns

iii in the groundwater immediately and consistently during the 50 days experiment the increased biological activity caused by conversion of other groundwater compounds during the course of the experiment did not hinder the as iii oxidation in the 0 5 m sand bed fig 8 the virgin sand columns which did not contain an as iii oxidising biomass at the start of the experiment initially did not show as iii oxidation however complete oxidation of the 13 μg l as iii developed within 23 days fig 8 suggesting that even though as iii concentrations were low compared to the other groundwater

14608,membrane fouling mitigation has been variously reported in aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor agmbr agmbr has also achieved to varying degrees the removal of organics and nitrogen based compounds from wastewater however scanty information is available in the literature on phosphorus removal in agmbr thus the present study focused on simultaneous removal of organics and both nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus in agmbr at semi pilot scale aerobic granules were cultivated in a cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 19 l diameter of 15 cm and height to diameter h d ratio of 8 the effluent from the granular reactor was discharged into a side stream membrane module at steady state the granule mean size 5 min sludge volume index svi5 svi30 and mlss were 576 μm 40 ml g 37 ml g and 9200 mg l respectively results show that the system achieved 98 chemical oxygen demand cod degradation 96 99 total nitrogen tn removal and 95 removal of po4 p the outstanding removal of both organics and nutrients in the agmbr is attributed to the coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic layers within the granule as well as the anaerobic feeding adopted these findings demonstrate the potential of agmbr to simultaneously remove organics and nutrients nitrogen and phosphate keywords aerobic granulation agmbr membrane bioreactor mbr membrane fouling nutrients removal organics removal 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is becoming widely used for wastewater treatment and reclamation due to its compact nature production of high quality effluent capability of withstanding high organic loading low sludge generation and production of largely disinfected effluent 1 2 however membrane fouling is its major drawback 3 6 bacteria and their by products extracellular polymeric substances eps have been identified as major contributors to membrane fouling 3 7 8 the development of aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor agmbr has been proposed to mitigate membrane fouling 9 13 in agmbr the activated sludge is modified into aerobic granules which are essentially bacteria bound together by eps hence less membrane fouling the large size and rigid structure of aerobic granules expectedly reduces pore blocking and cake layer formation in agmbr 14 hence enhanced membrane filtration in addition aerobic granules exhibit a layered structure with an oxic zone near the granule surface an anoxic zone in the middle layer and an anaerobic zone at the granule centre 15 16 this stratified structure provides suitable conditions for the removal of organics and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus even when the system is operated entirely aerobically previous studies have reported increased membrane permeability 17 9 enhanced membrane filtration 18 10 extension of filtration period by 78 days without physical cleaning 19 and eight fold lower membrane fouling in agmbr compared to mbr during long term 220 days municipal wastewater treatment 20 in terms of organics degradation while some studies found similar treatment efficiency for both agmbr and conventional mbr 9 others reported higher removal efficiency in agmbr 18 10 21 the capability of agmbr to remove nitrogen based compounds has also been explored some of these studies reported removal efficiencies at steady state as follows 90 nh4 n influent concentration 40 mg l 22 85 4 99 7 nh3

agmbr set up is shown in fig 1 the system was seeded with settled activated sludge obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in calgary the settled sludge had an initial mean particle size of 115 μm sludge volume index svi30 of 119 5 ml g svi5 after 5 min of settling of 122 ml g and a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 8 2 g l the return activated sludge ras was acclimated for five days in a batch mode prior to starting the system at the beginning of the experiment the svi30 and svi5 of the reactor mixed liquor were 161 ml g and 187 ml g respectively the experiment was conducted at room temperature 21 2 c 2 2 media synthetic wastewater was prepared from the following compounds sodium acetate carbon source nh4cl kh2po4 k2hpo4 cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o and feso4 7h2o micronutrients were prepared from h3bo3 zncl2 cucl2 mnso4 h2o nh4 6 mo7o24 4h2o alcl3 cocl2 6h2o and nicl2 the influent chemical oxygen demand cod was 2902 129 5 mg l the organic loading rate olr was 8 71 0 39 kg cod m3 day the influent tn and po4 concentrations were 74 53 4 12 mg l and 34 5 4 39 mg l respectively 2 3 analytical methods biomass characteristics mlss svi30 were determined according to standard methods 24 svi5 was measured in a similar way to svi30 but with the settling time modified from 30 min to 5 min cod was determined using hach kits the total nitrogen tn was analyzed using shimadzu total nitrogen measuring unit tnm l po4 p was analyzed using metrohm compact ic flex the average particle size was determined by a laser particle size analysis system malvern mastersizer series 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 granule development granules appeared in the reactor on day 3 of operation attaining steady state within three weeks at steady state the mean size of the granules was 576 μm from the initial value of 115 μm mature granules were obtained in the system by day 25 of operation with stable and mature granules dominating the system biomass settleability greatly improved as indicated by the svi svi30 gradually decreased from 161 ml g down to 37 ml g svi5 followed a similar trend reducing from 187 ml g to 40 ml g the transition from flocculent sludge to granular sludge i e progress of granules formation is presented in fig 2 at steady state the average mlss concentration was 9200 mg l activated sludge is considered to have good settling if the svi30 is below 100 ml g 25 the svi30 value of less than 40 ml g achieved in this system indicate significant improvement in settleablility of the granular biomass over well settling activated sludge as shown by parker et al 25 svi30 values of more than 150 ml g point to the presence of filamentous bacteria which is the case of the seed sludge however it appears that the operation of the aerobic granulation reactor has eliminated the filamentous growth indicative of stable granules in the system 26 29 fig 3 presents the sem scanning electron microscope images of mature granules the flocculent seed sludge had a loose form and with time and particle selection it changed into the granules the change in the sludge structure is demonstrated by the progressive improvement of svi till steady state was achieved the svi5 is a great indicator of the quality of granulation as a full granular sludge system is attained when svi5 is comparable to svi30 or when svi30 svi5 ratio approaches 0 9 30 3 2 organics removal the profile of soluble cod removal is presented in fig 4 the system exhibited consistent degradation of cod throughout the duration of the experiment the removal efficiency was in excess of 96 influent concentration of 3000 mg l the high removal efficiency attained in the present study agree with previous findings where organics removal 96 for both municipal and industrial wastewaters was achieved 9 18 19 generally aerobic granulation has been proven to efficiently remove organics 31 the dense nature of the granular biomass enhances the performance of the biological reactor making it more efficient than the activated sludge mainly due to the higher mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration and the better settling properties 3 3 nitrogen removal similar to cod removal agmbr showed outstanding tn removal as can be seen in fig 5 with average influent concentration of 74 5 mg l the removal efficiency was 96 and above throughout the experimental period this is the first study on agmbr to attain this remarkably high tn removal level as previously 41 7 78 4 15 59 19 and 61 21 were achieved this high removal efficiency of tn in agmbr is attributable to both biological assimilation and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd nitrite was not detected in the effluent throughout the experiment indicating total nitrification the produced nitrate during nitrification was used as electron acceptor in the inner anoxic zones of the granule particle thus nitrate was minimally detected in the effluent mean concentration 0 24 mg l as shown in fig 6 below this shows successful denitrification in the system hence high levels of nitrogen removal the high biomass concentration in granular sludge results in increased microbial consumption assimilation of nutrients for growth and cell maintenance the layered structure of the granules made possible by oxygen diffusion limitation allows for the presence of a broad spectrum of microbial cultures which are aerobic anoxic and anaerobic this makes the snd possible despite operating the reactor in entirely aerobic conditions from fig 6 there is a peak of effluent nitrate concentration 1 5 mg l on day 55 of operation the corresponding effluent tn concentration on this same day is 1 5 mg l on other days when the effluent tn was 1 4 mg l e g day 15 to day 31 the nitrate in the effluent was below 0 2 mg l thus since there was no change in the system the peak in effluent nitrate value on this day is attributable to experimental error 3 4 phosphate removal the removal profile of po4 p in fig 7 shows high agmbr performance achieving 95 po4 p removal efficiency the removal of po4 p is attributable to the layered granular structure as explained by 16 as well as the sbr mode of operation adopted in this study wherein a long 60 min anaerobic feeding phase was included the large size of the granule results in oxygen diffusion limitation across the radius of the granule allowing for a stratified structure with oxic anoxic and anaerobic conditions from the outer surface to the inner core a previous study found that the anaerobic slow feeding with acetate as carbon source subsequent aerobic phase and phosphate availability in the influent allows for the selection for phosphate accumulating organisms pao 32 the acetate gets converted to internal storage polyhydroxybutyrate phb and phosphate is released to the water during the anaerobic feeding during aeration the internally stored phb is utilised for growth and the phosphate in the water gets converted to cell internal poly phosphates this throws light into the mechanism of phosphates uptake in the system 4 conclusion simultaneous removal of organics and nutrients tn and po4 p in a side stream agmbr was studied the system achieved 98 cod degradation 96 99 tn removal and 95 removal of po4 p the remarkable removal of nutrients in the side stream agmbr is attributed to the layered structure of aerobic granules made possible by oxygen diffusion limitation as well as the long anaerobic feeding adopted in the sbr cycle this study demonstrated the potential of agmbr to simultaneously remove organics and nutrients these findings have further pushed the development of the agmbr technology closer to design information for successful operation acknowledgement this work

14608,membrane fouling mitigation has been variously reported in aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor agmbr agmbr has also achieved to varying degrees the removal of organics and nitrogen based compounds from wastewater however scanty information is available in the literature on phosphorus removal in agmbr thus the present study focused on simultaneous removal of organics and both nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus in agmbr at semi pilot scale aerobic granules were cultivated in a cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 19 l diameter of 15 cm and height to diameter h d ratio of 8 the effluent from the granular reactor was discharged into a side stream membrane module at steady state the granule mean size 5 min sludge volume index svi5 svi30 and mlss were 576 μm 40 ml g 37 ml g and 9200 mg l respectively results show that the system achieved 98 chemical oxygen demand cod degradation 96 99 total nitrogen tn removal and 95 removal of po4 p the outstanding removal of both organics and nutrients in the agmbr is attributed to the coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic layers within the granule as well as the anaerobic feeding adopted these findings demonstrate the potential of agmbr to simultaneously remove organics and nutrients nitrogen and phosphate keywords aerobic granulation agmbr membrane bioreactor mbr membrane fouling nutrients removal organics removal 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is becoming widely used for wastewater treatment and reclamation due to its compact nature production of high quality effluent capability of withstanding high organic loading low sludge generation and production of largely disinfected effluent 1 2 however membrane fouling is its major drawback 3 6 bacteria and their by products extracellular polymeric substances eps have been identified as major contributors to membrane fouling 3 7 8 the development of aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor agmbr has been proposed to mitigate membrane fouling 9 13 in agmbr the activated sludge is modified into aerobic granules which are essentially bacteria bound together by eps hence less membrane fouling the large size and rigid structure of aerobic granules expectedly reduces pore blocking and cake layer formation in agmbr 14 hence enhanced membrane filtration in addition aerobic granules exhibit a layered structure with an oxic zone near the granule surface an anoxic zone in the middle layer and an anaerobic zone at the granule centre 15 16 this stratified structure provides suitable conditions for the removal of organics and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus even when the system is operated entirely aerobically previous studies have reported increased membrane permeability 17 9 enhanced membrane filtration 18 10 extension of filtration period by 78 days without physical cleaning 19 and eight fold lower membrane fouling in agmbr compared to mbr during long term 220 days municipal wastewater treatment 20 in terms of organics degradation while some studies found similar treatment efficiency for both agmbr and conventional mbr 9 others reported higher removal efficiency in agmbr 18 10 21 the capability of agmbr to remove nitrogen based compounds has also been explored some of these studies reported removal efficiencies at steady state as follows 90 nh4 n influent concentration 40 mg l 22 85 4 99 7 nh3 n influent 28 1 38 4 mg l and 41 7 78 4 total nitrogen tn removal 15 95 7 nh4 n removal at influent nh4 n concentration of 14 4 1 7 mg l 23 and 61 tn removal at nitrogen loading rate of 0 4 kg nh4 n

14609,ultrafiltration uf has been proposed as a promising technology in recirculating aquaculture systems ras to remove both organic contaminants and other fine contaminants including viruses and pathogenic bacteria however fouling is still a severe problem during this application this paper investigated the fouling behavior of three different uf membranes examined using five different aquaculture contaminants the experiments were performed using uf membranes with molecular weight cut off 10 50 and 100 kda humic acid shrimp feed spirulina sp vibrio harveyi and ihhnv were used as contaminant models scanning electron microscope was used to visualize the presence of foulant on the membrane surface the results showed that fouling behavior was affected by both membrane cut off pore size and foulant type two fouling behaviors were observed i rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux until experiments finished and ii rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux due to its reliable flux value and high rejection 100 kda uf membrane should be considered as the most suitable uf membrane for ras application keywords recirculating aquaculture system ultrafiltration fouling molecular weight cut off 1 introduction aquaculture the farming of aquatic organisms and plants in both coastal and inland areas is very important sector in achieving world food security therefore much attention has been paid for a sustainable aquaculture on the one hand recirculating aquaculture system ras which recirculates or reuses water after undergoing treatment is one of the developments towards sustainable aquaculture on the other hand a severe problem found in aquaculture system is diminishing or decreasing of animals as a result of disease or lack of oxygen this problem is found in conventional aquaculture systems recirculating aquaculture system ras and hatchery systems more attention should be paid for the ras where water is continuously reused via recycling process 1 5 the presence of excess organic compounds in an aquaculture system lowers the dissolved oxygen do content both chemical and biological that has an impact on the lack of oxygen supply to the animals respiratory organic compounds in aquaculture system can be derived from the water used itself the residual of feed and the metabolism of animals it was reported that eighty percent dry weight of feed used in the aquaculture system is released as an animal excretion 6 as an example production of 100 kg catfish produced 1190 kg of dry solids 60 kg of nitrogen compounds and 12 kg of phosphorus compounds 7 in the more recent study 8 it was reported that 25 of the feed applied to the aquaculture system will end up as suspended solid therefore the organic compounds should be reduced to the safe level for culture growth of aquatic animals such as fish and shrimp in addition viruses microalgae and pathogenic bacteria are also frequently found in aquaculture systems in which the presence of these contaminants can cause the destruction of animals to avoid the destruction of aquatic organisms removal of organic compounds and other contaminants from aquaculture systems has to be conducted this removal is usually performed by the centrifugation clarification gravity filtration or precipitation process screening with different pore sizes 60 200 microns biofilter and biological processes 9 13 the fundamental weakness of these techniques is the leakage of fine particles or contaminants including pathogenic bacteria and viruses 14 in addition biological processes have other problems such as their complexity especially for denitrification 15 high hydraulic retention time hrt 16 and high backwash intensity of the biofilter 17 foam fractionation has been proposed to remove those fine particles and can be combined with other processes such ozone to enhance the separation efficiency 18 19 nevertheless this technology is not suitable for large and primary particles removal phytoremediation has also been proposed for treating aquaculture wastewater 20 however the use of plants in aquaculture system will block photosynthesis and consequently the oxygen content in water will decrease to solve these problems application of membrane technologies in aquaculture systems has been proposed by many researchers 3 21 25 in a recent study it was shown that the integration of membrane filtration into ras increased the quality of water effluent 2 further several membrane technologies have been applied in small aquaculture industries 3 26 a coupling catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system for the recirculating aquaculture wastewater treatment using membranes coated by ti mn tio2 oxide was reported in a recent study by chen et al 27 they claimed that their coupling system results in good permeate quality short start up period and the stable operating conditions however special attention should be paid for the residual ozone which is harmful to the aquatic organisms it was reported that algae paste decaying rotifers and dry feed seemed to contribute to the most of membrane fouling 28 in general the results of both laboratory and field experiments indicated that membrane technologies deliver a promising potential for removing fine contaminants including organic compounds viruses and pathogenic bacteria however as in other applications fouling the decline of flux over time due to the deposition of suspended or dissolved substances on external surface at the pore openings or within its pore 29 30 reduces significantly the performance of the process and consequently prevents a more widespread commercial applicability in aquaculture system numerous studies on the application of uf membrane in ras have been reported however different results were observed among different reports it is certainly due to different process condition membrane property contaminant and feed water characteristic are involved as a result of this situation it is hard to determine the best molecular weight cut off mwco of uf membrane that should be used in an aquaculture system it is important to mention that mwco is a parameter usually used to express the retention and membrane pore size of ultrafiltration membrane to the best of our knowledge no systematic study has been performed to determine the most suitable uf membrane pore size that should be applied in ras it should be kept in our mind that the performance of a process using membrane is strongly influenced by membrane pore size or mwco 31 33 systematic fouling study using seawater as the feed has been performed 34 nevertheless their study was dedicated to the pretreatment of ro membrane for desalination as consequences of various contaminants with different characteristics exist in aquaculture systems and various commercial uf membranes with different mwcos are available selection of uf membrane based on their mwco is a very important step in practical application of uf membrane in ras the main aim of this study is to determine the suitable mwco of uf membrane in ras application considering the fouling mechanism study it is important to point out that for the practical application the use of different mwco membrane for the removal of different contaminants is not possible furthermore the membranes used in ras cannot be chosen only based on the manufacturer specification the best mwco determination is based on the efficiency and fouling behavior which corresponds to the resulting flux various model contaminants of aquaculture systems i e humic acid residual shrimp feed microalgae spirulina sp pathogenic bacteria vibrio harveyi and virus ihhnv infection hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus were used in this study these five contaminants were expected to be able to represent natural organic matters noms feed residuals microalgae bacteria and viruses respectively which usually exist in aquaculture system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials since the consistency of membrane properties manufactured industrially is typically better than lab made membrane the commercial uf membranes supplied by alfa laval denmark were used in this study the membranes included gr81pp 10 kda polyethersulfone gr51pp 50 kda polysulfone and gr40pp 100 kda polysulfone the contaminant models used were shrimp feed sf with the composition was wt protein 36 crude fiber 4 fat 5 water 12 and ash 12 obtained from p t gold coin indonesia humic acid ha purchased from sigma aldrich spirulina platensis ma obtained from center for bioprocess and renewable energy diponegoro university marine bacterium vibrio harveyi vh obtained from bbpbap jepara indonesia and ihhnv obtained from bbpbap jepara indonesia the experiment was also performed using mixture of these contaminant models smh the usage of these contaminants was based on the results of preliminary analysis of water quality from the real aquaculture system as well as previous literatures 1 5 real aquaculture water raw with total dissolved solids 4 1 g l was obtained from the aquaculture pond in jepara indonesia sodium chloride and hcl were purchased from merck purified water produced from home made ro ion exchange system was used for all experiments in order to apply the uf membranes in ras all foulant solutions were prepared by dissolving the contaminant models in 10 g l of sodium chloride solution 2 2 methods 2 2 1 investigation of fouling behavior study on fouling behavior was performed by investigation of membrane solute interactions adsorptive fouling and membrane solute solute interactions ultrafiltration fouling the investigation of adsorptive fouling was carried out by using a dead end stirred cell filtration system amicon cell model 8010 from millipore and followed our earlier reported work 35 briefly pure water flux j0 was measured for each membrane sample the pure water flux was measured at a pressure of 300 kpa for 10 kda uf membrane and 100 kpa for both 50 and 100 kda uf membranes a model of contaminant solution with certain concentration sf 1 g l ma 1 od in water with 10 g l tds ha 1 g l vh 108 cfu ihhnh 10 500 ml ml was added to the cell smh composed of 0 25 g l sf 0 5 od ma and 0 25 g l ha was also used thereafter the outer membrane surface was exposed for 3 h without any flux at a stirring rate of 300 rpm and atmospheric condition the preliminary experiments showed that 3 h of adsorption was sufficient to achieve saturation of the surface adsorption capacity for all foulant models this experiment condition was also supported by our previous studies 30 36 afterward the solution was removed and the membrane surface was rinsed twice by filling the cell with pure water 5 ml and shaking it for 30 s pure water flux ja was again measured the extent of adsorptive fouling was expressed in term of relative water flux reduction rfr cf eq 1 which was calculated from the water fluxes at the same pressure before and after adsorptive fouling the effect of contaminant concentration on rfr was also investigated using sf ha and ma as contaminant models the concentration of sf and ha was varied from 0 to 5 g l whereas the concentration of ma was varied from 0 to 1 od 1 rfr j 0 j a j 0 a home made laboratory scale for cross flow filtration test was used in all ultrafiltration experiments 30 the set up consisted of a feed tank 3 l volume a flow indicator a pump a pressure indicator connected to feed side of the membrane to determine the trans membrane pressure and a flat sheet membrane cell a simplified diagram of the set up is given in fig 1 in each experiment a new circular membrane disk with the effective area of 0 00125 m2 was used as conducted in adsorption experiments the membrane was firstly compacted by filtering the water for at least 0 5 h at a pressure of 400 kpa a contaminant feed model with certain concentration sf 0 5 g l ma 0 1 od in water with 10 g l tds ha 0 025 g l vh 106 cfu ihhnh 0 5 500 ml ml was added to the feed tank and pumped into membrane cell shm comprising of ha 0 025 g l sf 0 5 g l ma 0 1 od marine bacterium vh 106 cfu and ihhnv 0 5 500 ml ml was also used as the contaminant feed model the concentration of contaminant models was based on the characterization of actual aquaculture water in order to maintain constant feed concentration the retentate and permeate were returned to the feed tank all experiments were conducted at room temperature 28 2 c with constant trans membrane pressure tmp mode 100 kpa for both 50 and 100 kda uf membranes and 300 kpa for 10 kda uf membrane the difference in pressure was due to the difference in tmp required to result in reasonable flux permeate during uf experiments the flux profile as a function of time was gravimetrically monitored to investigate the effect of concentration polarization after uf experiment the pressure was lowered to 0 kpa for 5 min in this way no permeate flux was produced then permeate flux was again measured at similar pressure with uf 30 35 2 2 2 visualization of membrane surface morphology the top surface morphology of the membranes was visualized to observe the presence of foulant the experiment was performed by using a scanning electron microscopy fei inspect 550 the outer surface of the sample was coated with gold palladium and sputtered for 0 5 min before analysis 2 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of humic acid and residual shrimp feed was analyzed using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv mini 1240 uv vis spectrophotometer ha and sf concentrations were determined by measuring uv absorbance at 255 nm and 280 nm respectively ma was analyzed based on their optical density whereas pathogenic bacteria vh were analyzed based on the determination total aerobic plate count tpc the presence of ihhnv was analyzed using chapter 2 2 oie 2009 polymerase chain reaction pcr 37 3 results 3 1 adsorptive fouling membrane solute interactions 3 1 1 effect of membrane cut off adsorptive fouling was investigated by exposing the outer membrane surface to a definite contaminant feed solution the relative water flux reduction rfr was used to identify the extent of membrane solute interactions the results are presented in fig 2 fig 2 clearly shows that the rfr was influenced by both membrane pore size and contaminant type for most of the contaminants cf sf ma ha vh and ihhnh gr51pp 50 kda showed the highest rfr followed by gr81pp 10 kda and gr40pp 100 kda respectively different results were observed for raw and smh where the highest rfr was shown by 10 kda uf membrane followed by 50 kda uf and 100 kda uf respectively for all contaminants used the 100 kda uf showed the lowest rfr overall the highest rfr was shown by smh 45 followed by raw and sf which demonstrated comparable rfrs 32 45 comparable rfrs within the range 10 20 were exhibited by ha vh and ihhnh 3 1 2 effect of contaminant concentration in order to obtain a more comprehensive information about adsorptive fouling phenomena the effect of contaminant concentration on rfr was investigated for most of the contaminants used 50 kda uf membrane showed the highest adsorptive fouling at the first adsorptive fouling examination section 3 1 1 as a consequent this membrane was not involved in the study of contaminant concentration effect on rfr section 3 1 2 the results are presented in fig 3 it is clearly seen that the extent of adsorptive was influenced by contaminant concentration and membrane pore size the rapid increase in rfr by increasing contaminant concentration at low concentration less than 1 g l for sf less than 0 8 g l for ha and less than 0 2 od for ma followed by a plateau condition beyond these concentrations were observed for both uf membranes the rfr of 100 kda uf membrane was lower than the rfr of 10 kda uf membrane for all contaminants furthermore 10 kda uf membrane required lower concentration than 100 kda uf membrane to achieve a plateau condition 3 2 ultrafiltration fouling with single contaminant uf fouling behavior of aquaculture contaminant was initially investigated by ultrafiltration of humic acid ha solution 25 ppm ha was used since its presence is abundant in soil and water systems 38 the exploration of fouling mechanism of ha as the contaminant also carried out for the application of ultrafiltration in seawater 34 39 the results are expressed in term of flux normalized flux as a function of filtration time as shown in fig 4 the fouling behavior using shrimp feed as a representative model for the aquaculture contaminant was also investigated shrimp feed was used because feed residual has been recognized as one of the most aquaculture contaminants fig 5 shows the permeate flux behavior expressed as normalized flux for the filtration of sf solutions at a constant pressure ultrafiltration of aquaculture contaminant was also examined using ma spirulina sp spirulina sp was selected because it can be found in many aquaculture systems and it has similar size and shape geometry with harmful algal bloom the results are presented in fig 6 the performance of three uf membranes was also examined using marine bacterium vh and ihhnv solution the results are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively ultrafiltration fouling presented in figs 4 8 showed that in general two different fouling behaviors were observed the first one was rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration and followed by relatively constant permeate flux until the filtration was stopped this behavior was found for the filtration of sf and vh solution the second one was rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux approaching constant flux after a certain time of filtration this behavior was found for the filtration of ha ma and ihhnv solution the normalized fluxes j jo at the end of ha ultrafiltration were 62 45 and 69 for 10 50 and 100 kda uf membranes respectively ultrafiltration of sf solution demonstrated normalized fluxes at the end of ultrafiltration 45 for 10 kda 40 for 50 kda and 37 100 kda stable fluxes 55 for 10 kda 52 for 50 kda and 53 100 kda were obtained at ultrafiltration of ma ultrafiltration of vh solution exhibited stable flux at 81 when 10 kda membrane was used 75 when 50 kda membrane was used and 73 when 100 kda membrane was used further when ihhnv solution was used as feed the resulted stable fluxes are 77 81 and 85 for 10 kda 50 kda and 100 kda membranes respectively table 1 shows rejection data of different uf membranes for different contaminants it is shown that all uf membranes had 100 rejection for ma vh and ihhnv the slightly lower rejection was observed for ha i e 98 5 98 6 and 99 8 for 100 50 and 10 kda membranes respectively 3 3 ultrafiltration of mixed contaminants solution the results of adsorption and ultrafiltration experiments using single contaminant suggest that the 100 and 10 kda membranes showed comparable performance with respect to fouling behavior and contaminant rejection in this part the performances of both membranes were further evaluated mixed contaminants comprising of ha 0 025 g l sf 0 5 g l ma 0 1 od marine bacterium vh 106 cfu and ihhnv 0 5 500 ml l were used as feed the results are presented in fig 9 fig 9 shows that the flux behavior observed in ultrafiltration of mixed contaminants solution was similar to the single contaminant of sf and vh while both membranes demonstrated rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration and followed by relatively constant permeate flux until the filtration was stopped the stable fluxes were 20 and 37 of initial membrane flux for 10 kda and 100 kda membranes respectively the flux decline of both uf membranes was higher compared to all experiments using single contaminant the 100 kda membrane showed a higher normalized flux than 10 kda membrane indicating lower flux decline nevertheless both membranes showed similar rejection for all contaminants i e within the range 97 100 in further experiments 100 kda uf was selected because it showed comparable normalized flux and rejection with 10 kda membrane but it used lower pressure indicating lower energy in addition the permeate flux of 10 kda membrane is relatively small for the practical application further examination was performed by ultrafiltration of real aquaculture water from the aquaculture system the results are presented in fig 9 and table 2 fig 9 shows that rapid flux decline followed by a gradual flux decrease was observed although the filtration has already been performed 2 h a gradual flux decline was still observed the normalized flux was 56 of initial membrane flux after two hours ultrafiltration compared to uf of mixed contaminants solution ultrafiltration of real aquaculture water resulted in lower flux decline table 2 shows the rejection of some important parameters for aquaculture system it is seen that the membrane had 100 rejection for ihhnv vh and suspended solid in addition the rejection of turbidity ammonia and cod were 99 5 97 6 and 86 4 respectively the lowest rejection was observed for total phosphate i e 11 1 3 4 membrane characterization visualization of membrane surface was performed to support previous explanations it is clearly seen that all foulants were significantly deposited on membrane surface fig 10 in addition foulant segregation on the membrane surface was also observed for all foulants 4 discussion rfr was used as an indicator to evaluate adsorptive fouling caused by the contaminant models as can be seen from fig 2 the static adsorption of all contaminants used in this study caused membrane fouling as indicated by their rfr the higher rfr means the higher adsorptive fouling all contaminant models except raw and smh showed a systematic trend of adsorptive fouling where the 100 kda uf membrane had the lowest rfr followed by the 10 kda and 50 kda uf membranes respectively different behavior was exhibited by a more complex feed raw and smh where the increase in pore size decreased the rfr indicating lower adsorptive fouling the highest rfr was observed at the experiments using raw as feed for all membranes these results suggest that smh was the strongest foulant in term of adsorptive fouling furthermore for the single contaminant sf was identified as the strongest foulant the results obtained from adsorptive fouling are in agreement with the result obtained from ultrafiltration experiment where smh and sf are the two foulant models that generated highest flux decline it is clearly seen that the extent of adsorptive fouling was influenced by foulant concentration and membrane pore size increasing foulant concentration would rise rfr which shows more severe adsorptive fouling has occurred at higher concentration this phenomenon was well explained in our previous publication 36 the influence of pore size expressed as mwco on adsorptive fouling can be explained by blocking model theory if the size of foulant is smaller than the membrane pore size the foulant can access the membrane pores causing adsorption in the membrane pores followed by a pore size constriction when the foulant size is increased the possible pore blocking will be higher complete blocking will occur when the membrane pore size is equal to the foulant size nevertheless if the foulant size is further increased the possibility of pore blocking becomes lower and a cake layer formation will be larger it is understood that the pore blocking mechanism will result in a larger flux reduction than pore narrowing difference in adsorptive fouling behavior was shown by the 10 and 50 kda membranes where the 50 kda membrane showed higher adsorptive fouling than the 10 kda membrane for all individual foulants the 10 kda membrane showed higher adsorptive fouling than 50 kda membrane for mixed foulants smh and raw the possible reason for this phenomenon is foulant foulant interactions the interaction between or among foulants in the feed can alter the fouling behavior caused by the individual foulant ultrafiltration data suggest that fouling behavior and steady permeate fluxes were influenced by both membrane cut off membrane pore size and contaminant type this means the ratio of contaminant size to membrane pore size is more relevant to be used for explaining fouling phenomena rather than pore or foulant size itself all filtration experiments showed a rapid flux decline at the beginning of filtration followed by either gradual decrease for longer filtration time and finally tended to level off after relatively long time filtration or by relatively constant permeate flux until the filtration has been finished this difference in fouling behavior is certainly due to the difference fouling phenomenon the rapid flux decline at the beginning of filtration was caused by concentration polarization in addition fouling could also contribute to this rapid decline concentration polarization is the filtration phenomenon that cannot be avoided and occurs due to the build up of foulant concentration on the membrane surface as consequence of filtration process in order to prove the contribution of fouling we stopped the filtration just after 5 min filtration for 10 s the filtration was then started again and the flux could not be restored to the initial value the flux was higher than the flux at 5th min filtration but lower than initial flux the increase in flux after stopping the filtration suggests that concentration polarization contributed to the flux decline nevertheless because their flux increases were only within the range 5 20 fouling was the dominant reason for the flux decline for the case where rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux fouling by pore blocking tends to complete blocking should be another reason for the sharp flux decline beside concentration polarization it is important to point out that the adsorption should not be the reason for this rapid decline at the early stage because adsorption fouling requires a certain time to occur and relatively high concentration fig 3 our experiments showed that it takes at least 30 min for adsorption data not shown thereafter both adsorption and foulant deposition on the membrane surface leading to cake layer formation took place this cake layer formation is evidenced by the results of membrane surface visualization using sem fig 10 nevertheless it is believed that this cake layer did not influence the resulted permeate flux as indicated by constant flux after rapid flux decline in this case porous cake layers should be formed for the case where rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux fouling by pore narrowing should be the reason for this rapid declining beside concentration polarization then adsorption fouling and cake layer formation occurred in this case adsorption fouling and cake layer influenced the resulted permeate flux as indicated by a gradual flux decrease furthermore it is reasonable to explain that a stable external membrane fouling seems to be the most dominant fouling deposit of multilayers foulant on the membrane was also clearly observed by sem fig 10 a similar phenomenon was explained earlier by saidi et al 40 experiments using single foulant solution demonstrated that 50 kda membrane showed the highest fouling as indicated by its smallest normalized flux j jo beside the pore morphology the higher initial flux of 50 kda membrane could cause higher cp that will promote a higher possibility of irreversible fouling formation furthermore for the same uf membrane used sf and ma were identified as two strongest contaminants leading to highest flux decline by contrast vh and ihhnv were identified as the two weakest contaminants leading to lowest flux decline for the same contaminant 50 kda uf membrane generally showed the highest flux reduction among other types of used membranes the 100 and 10 kda membranes showed comparable flux decline in addition psh 100 kda was effective in removing contaminants in aquaculture systems to meet the standard in aquaculture systems for the same contaminant the membrane with larger pores pes 50 kda is prone to internal fouling than the membrane with smaller pores 10 kda definitely this explanation is not proper for the membrane with very large pore size compared to contaminant size this phenomenon is in agreement with the study by rickman et al 41 considering the permeate flux and rejection data obtained from the experiments using single contaminant 100 kda and 10 kda membranes were further examined for ultrafiltration of mixed contaminants both 100 and 10 kda membranes demonstrated fouling behavior where rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux the reason used to explain fouling behavior for single foulant solution is still valid to be used here the results also indicated that 100 kda membrane was less prone to fouling than 10 kda membrane as indicated by its higher j jo 37 vs 28 further examination using real aquaculture water was conducted using 100 kda membrane rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux was observed the 100 kda uf membrane exhibited very high rejection for all components in real aquaculture water except total phosphate only 11 1 however the concentration of total phosphate in permeate is still lower compared to aquaculture standard 5 conclusions study of the effects of membrane pore size expressed as mwco and foulant type on fouling behavior and foulant rejection has been performed using three different commercial uf membranes and five different foulant models the experimental results showed that fouling behavior was influenced by both membrane cut off pore size and foulant type two fouling behaviors were observed i e i rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux until the experiment finished and ii rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux concentration polarization and fouling by pore blocking are believed to be the reason for the sharp flux decline for fouling behavior i furthermore both adsorption and foulant deposition on the membrane surface leading to cake layer formation occurred nevertheless it is supposed this cake layer did not influence the resulted permeate flux concentration polarization and fouling by pore narrowing were the reason for the sharp flux decline of fouling behavior ii further adsorption fouling and foulant deposition on the both membrane surface and the membrane pore surface leading to cake layer formation occurred then finally decreases permeate flux thus it is reasonable to state that a stable external membrane fouling seems to be the most dominant fouling mechanism for fouling behavior ii in general 100 kda membrane showed the lowest fouling among all membranes examined it is worth noting that all membranes had similar rejections for all contaminant models therefore based on the basis of permeate flux behavior and rejection data the 100 kda uf membrane appeared to be the most promising ones among other membranes examined for ras application acknowledgments the support for this project was provided by the diponegoro university the ministry of research technology and higher education the republic of indonesia the authors would like to thank alfa laval denmark for providing the membranes 
14609,ultrafiltration uf has been proposed as a promising technology in recirculating aquaculture systems ras to remove both organic contaminants and other fine contaminants including viruses and pathogenic bacteria however fouling is still a severe problem during this application this paper investigated the fouling behavior of three different uf membranes examined using five different aquaculture contaminants the experiments were performed using uf membranes with molecular weight cut off 10 50 and 100 kda humic acid shrimp feed spirulina sp vibrio harveyi and ihhnv were used as contaminant models scanning electron microscope was used to visualize the presence of foulant on the membrane surface the results showed that fouling behavior was affected by both membrane cut off pore size and foulant type two fouling behaviors were observed i rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux until experiments finished and ii rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux due to its reliable flux value and high rejection 100 kda uf membrane should be considered as the most suitable uf membrane for ras application keywords recirculating aquaculture system ultrafiltration fouling molecular weight cut off 1 introduction aquaculture the farming of aquatic organisms and plants in both coastal and inland areas is very important sector in achieving world food security therefore much attention has been paid for a sustainable aquaculture on the one hand recirculating aquaculture system ras which recirculates or reuses water after undergoing treatment is one of the developments towards sustainable aquaculture on the other hand a severe problem found in aquaculture system is diminishing or decreasing of animals as a result of disease or lack of oxygen this problem is found in conventional aquaculture systems recirculating aquaculture system ras and hatchery systems more attention should be paid for the ras where water is continuously reused via recycling process 1 5 the presence of excess organic compounds in an aquaculture system lowers the dissolved oxygen do content both chemical and biological that has an impact on the lack of oxygen supply to the animals respiratory organic compounds in aquaculture system can be derived from the water used itself the residual of feed and the metabolism of animals it was reported that eighty percent dry weight of feed used in the aquaculture system is released as an animal excretion 6 as an example production of 100 kg catfish produced 1190 kg of dry solids 60 kg of nitrogen compounds and 12 kg of phosphorus compounds 7 in the more recent study 8 it was reported that 25 of the feed applied to the aquaculture system will end up as suspended solid therefore the organic compounds should be reduced to the safe level for culture growth of aquatic animals such as fish and shrimp in addition viruses microalgae and pathogenic bacteria are also frequently found in aquaculture systems in which the presence of these contaminants can cause the destruction of animals to avoid the destruction of aquatic organisms removal of organic compounds and other contaminants from aquaculture systems has to be conducted this removal is usually performed by the centrifugation clarification gravity filtration or precipitation process screening with different pore sizes 60 200 microns biofilter and biological processes 9 13 the fundamental weakness of these techniques is the leakage of fine particles or contaminants including pathogenic bacteria and viruses 14 in addition biological processes have other problems such as their complexity especially for denitrification 15 high hydraulic retention time hrt 16 and high backwash intensity of the biofilter 17 foam fractionation has been proposed to remove those fine particles and can be combined with other processes such ozone to enhance the separation efficiency 18 19 nevertheless this technology is not suitable for large and primary particles removal phytoremediation has also been proposed for treating aquaculture wastewater 20 however the use of plants in aquaculture system will block photosynthesis and consequently the oxygen content in water will decrease to solve these problems application of membrane technologies in aquaculture systems has been proposed by many researchers 3 21 25 in a recent study it was shown that the integration of membrane filtration into ras increased the quality of water effluent 2 further several membrane technologies have been applied in small aquaculture industries 3 26 a coupling catalytic ozonation membrane filtration system for the recirculating aquaculture wastewater treatment using membranes coated by ti mn tio2 oxide was reported in a recent study by chen et al 27 they claimed that their coupling system results in good permeate quality short start up period and the stable operating conditions however special attention should be paid for the residual ozone which is harmful to the aquatic organisms it was reported that algae paste decaying rotifers and dry feed seemed to contribute to the most of membrane fouling 28 in general the results of both laboratory and field experiments indicated that membrane technologies deliver a promising potential for removing fine contaminants including organic compounds viruses and pathogenic bacteria however as in other applications fouling the decline of flux over time due to the deposition of suspended or dissolved substances on external surface at the pore openings or within its pore 29 30 reduces significantly the performance of the process and consequently prevents a more widespread commercial applicability in aquaculture system numerous studies on the application of uf membrane in ras have been reported however different results were observed among different reports it is certainly due to different process condition membrane property contaminant and feed water characteristic are involved as a result of this situation it is hard to determine the best molecular weight cut off mwco of uf membrane that should be used in an aquaculture system it is important to mention that mwco is a parameter usually used to express the retention and membrane pore size of ultrafiltration membrane to the best of our knowledge no systematic study has been performed to determine the most suitable uf membrane pore size that should be applied in ras it should be kept in our mind that the performance of a process using membrane is strongly influenced by membrane pore size or mwco 31 33 systematic fouling study using seawater as the feed has been performed 34 nevertheless their study was dedicated to the pretreatment of ro membrane for desalination as consequences of various contaminants with different characteristics exist in aquaculture systems and various commercial uf membranes with different mwcos are available selection of uf membrane based on their mwco is a very important step in practical application of uf membrane in ras the main aim of this study is to determine the suitable mwco of uf membrane in ras application considering the fouling mechanism study it is important to point out that for the practical application the use of different mwco membrane for the removal of different contaminants is not possible furthermore the membranes used in ras cannot be chosen only based on the manufacturer specification the best mwco determination is based on the efficiency and fouling behavior which corresponds to the resulting flux various model contaminants of aquaculture systems i e humic acid residual shrimp feed microalgae spirulina sp pathogenic bacteria vibrio harveyi and virus ihhnv infection hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus were used in this study these five contaminants were expected to be able to represent natural organic matters noms feed residuals microalgae bacteria and viruses respectively which usually exist in aquaculture system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials since the consistency of membrane properties manufactured industrially is typically better than lab made membrane the commercial uf membranes supplied by alfa laval denmark were used in this study the membranes included gr81pp 10 kda polyethersulfone gr51pp 50 kda polysulfone and gr40pp 100 kda polysulfone the contaminant models used were shrimp feed sf with the composition was wt protein 36 crude fiber 4 fat 5 water 12 and ash 12 obtained from p t gold coin indonesia humic acid ha purchased from sigma aldrich spirulina platensis ma obtained from center for bioprocess and renewable energy diponegoro university marine bacterium vibrio harveyi vh obtained from bbpbap jepara indonesia and ihhnv obtained from bbpbap jepara indonesia the experiment was also performed using mixture of these contaminant models smh the usage of these contaminants was based on the results of preliminary analysis of water quality from the real aquaculture system as well as previous literatures 1 5 real aquaculture water raw with total dissolved solids 4 1 g l was obtained from the aquaculture pond in jepara indonesia sodium chloride and hcl were purchased from merck purified water produced from home made ro ion exchange system was used for all experiments in order to apply the uf membranes in ras all foulant solutions were prepared by dissolving the contaminant models in 10 g l of sodium chloride solution 2 2 methods 2 2 1 investigation of fouling behavior study on fouling behavior was performed by investigation of membrane solute interactions adsorptive fouling and membrane solute solute interactions ultrafiltration fouling the investigation of adsorptive fouling was carried out by using a dead end stirred cell filtration system amicon cell model 8010 from millipore and followed our earlier reported work 35 briefly pure water flux j0 was measured for each membrane sample the pure water flux was measured at a pressure of 300 kpa for 10 kda uf membrane and 100 kpa for both 50 and 100 kda uf membranes a model of contaminant solution with certain concentration sf 1 g l ma 1 od in water with 10 g l tds ha 1 g l vh 108 cfu ihhnh 10 500 ml ml was added to the cell smh composed of 0 25 g l sf 0 5 od ma and 0 25 g l ha was also used thereafter the outer membrane surface was exposed for 3 h without any flux at a stirring rate of 300 rpm and atmospheric condition the preliminary experiments showed that 3 h of adsorption was sufficient to achieve saturation of the surface adsorption capacity for all foulant models this experiment condition was also supported by our previous studies 30 36 afterward the solution was removed and the membrane surface was rinsed twice by filling the cell with pure water 5 ml and shaking it for 30 s pure water flux ja was again measured the extent of adsorptive fouling was expressed in term of relative water flux reduction rfr cf eq 1 which was calculated from the water fluxes at the same pressure before and after adsorptive fouling the effect of contaminant concentration on rfr was also investigated using sf ha and ma as contaminant models the concentration of sf and ha was varied from 0 to 5 g l whereas the concentration of ma was varied from 0 to 1 od 1 rfr j 0 j a j 0 a home made laboratory scale for cross flow filtration test was used in all ultrafiltration experiments 30 the set up consisted of a feed tank 3 l volume a flow indicator a pump a pressure indicator connected to feed side of the membrane to determine the trans membrane pressure and a flat sheet membrane cell a simplified diagram of the set up is given in fig 1 in each experiment a new circular membrane disk with the effective area of 0 00125 m2 was used as conducted in adsorption experiments the membrane was firstly compacted by filtering the water for at least 0 5 h at a pressure of 400 kpa a contaminant feed model with certain concentration sf 0 5 g l ma 0 1 od in water with 10 g l tds ha 0 025 g l vh 106 cfu ihhnh 0 5 500 ml ml was added to the feed tank and pumped into membrane cell shm comprising of ha 0 025 g l sf 0 5 g l ma 0 1 od marine bacterium vh 106 cfu and ihhnv 0 5 500 ml ml was also used as the contaminant feed model the concentration of contaminant models was based on the characterization of actual aquaculture water in order to maintain constant feed concentration the retentate and permeate were returned to the feed tank all experiments were conducted at room temperature 28 2 c with constant trans membrane pressure tmp mode 100 kpa for both 50 and 100 kda uf membranes and 300 kpa for 10 kda uf membrane the difference in pressure was due to the difference in tmp required to result in reasonable flux permeate during uf experiments the flux profile as a function of time was gravimetrically monitored to investigate the effect of concentration polarization after uf experiment the pressure was lowered to 0 kpa for 5 min in this way no permeate flux was produced then permeate flux was again measured at similar pressure with uf 30 35 2 2 2 visualization of membrane surface morphology the top surface morphology of the membranes was visualized to observe the presence of foulant the experiment was performed by using a scanning electron microscopy fei inspect 550 the outer surface of the sample was coated with gold palladium and sputtered for 0 5 min before analysis 2 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of humic acid and residual shrimp feed was analyzed using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv mini 1240 uv vis spectrophotometer ha and sf concentrations were determined by measuring uv absorbance at 255 nm and 280 nm respectively ma was analyzed based on their optical density whereas pathogenic bacteria vh were analyzed based on the determination total aerobic plate count tpc the presence of ihhnv was analyzed using chapter 2 2 oie 2009 polymerase chain reaction pcr 37 3 results 3 1 adsorptive fouling membrane solute interactions 3 1 1 effect of membrane cut off adsorptive fouling was investigated by exposing the outer membrane surface to a definite contaminant feed solution the relative water flux reduction rfr was used to identify the extent of membrane solute interactions the results are presented in fig 2 fig 2 clearly shows that the rfr was influenced by both membrane pore size and contaminant type for most of the contaminants cf sf ma ha vh and ihhnh gr51pp 50 kda showed the highest rfr followed by gr81pp 10 kda and gr40pp 100 kda respectively different results were observed for raw and smh where the highest rfr was shown by 10 kda uf membrane followed by 50 kda uf and 100 kda uf respectively for all contaminants used the 100 kda uf showed the lowest rfr overall the highest rfr was shown by smh 45 followed by raw and sf which demonstrated comparable rfrs 32 45 comparable rfrs within the range 10 20 were exhibited by ha vh and ihhnh 3 1 2 effect of contaminant concentration in order to obtain a more comprehensive information about adsorptive fouling phenomena the effect of contaminant concentration on rfr was investigated for most of the contaminants used 50 kda uf membrane showed the highest adsorptive fouling at the first adsorptive fouling examination section 3 1 1 as a consequent this membrane was not involved in the study of contaminant concentration effect on rfr section 3 1 2 the results are presented in fig 3 it is clearly seen that the extent of adsorptive was influenced by contaminant concentration and membrane pore size the rapid increase in rfr by increasing contaminant concentration at low concentration less than 1 g l for sf less than 0 8 g l for ha and less than 0 2 od for ma followed by a plateau condition beyond these concentrations were observed for both uf membranes the rfr of 100 kda uf membrane was lower than the rfr of 10 kda uf membrane for all contaminants furthermore 10 kda uf membrane required lower concentration than 100 kda uf membrane to achieve a plateau condition 3 2 ultrafiltration fouling with single contaminant uf fouling behavior of aquaculture contaminant was initially investigated by ultrafiltration of humic acid ha solution 25 ppm ha was used since its presence is abundant in soil and water systems 38 the exploration of fouling mechanism of ha as the contaminant also carried out for the application of ultrafiltration in seawater 34 39 the results are expressed in term of flux normalized flux as a function of filtration time as shown in fig 4 the fouling behavior using shrimp feed as a representative model for the aquaculture contaminant was also investigated shrimp feed was used because feed residual has been recognized as one of the most aquaculture contaminants fig 5 shows the permeate flux behavior expressed as normalized flux for the filtration of sf solutions at a constant pressure ultrafiltration of aquaculture contaminant was also examined using ma spirulina sp spirulina sp was selected because it can be found in many aquaculture systems and it has similar size and shape geometry with harmful algal bloom the results are presented in fig 6 the performance of three uf membranes was also examined using marine bacterium vh and ihhnv solution the results are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively ultrafiltration fouling presented in figs 4 8 showed that in general two different fouling behaviors were observed the first one was rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration and followed by relatively constant permeate flux until the filtration was stopped this behavior was found for the filtration of sf and vh solution the second one was rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux approaching constant flux after a certain time of filtration this behavior was found for the filtration of ha ma and ihhnv solution the normalized fluxes j jo at the end of ha ultrafiltration were 62 45 and 69 for 10 50 and 100 kda uf membranes respectively ultrafiltration of sf solution demonstrated normalized fluxes at the end of ultrafiltration 45 for 10 kda 40 for 50 kda and 37 100 kda stable fluxes 55 for 10 kda 52 for 50 kda and 53 100 kda were obtained at ultrafiltration of ma ultrafiltration of vh solution exhibited stable flux at 81 when 10 kda membrane was used 75 when 50 kda membrane was used and 73 when 100 kda membrane was used further when ihhnv solution was used as feed the resulted stable fluxes are 77 81 and 85 for 10 kda 50 kda and 100 kda membranes respectively table 1 shows rejection data of different uf membranes for different contaminants it is shown that all uf membranes had 100 rejection for ma vh and ihhnv the slightly lower rejection was observed for ha i e 98 5 98 6 and 99 8 for 100 50 and 10 kda membranes respectively 3 3 ultrafiltration of mixed contaminants solution the results of adsorption and ultrafiltration experiments using single contaminant suggest that the 100 and 10 kda membranes showed comparable performance with respect to fouling behavior and contaminant rejection in this part the performances of both membranes were further evaluated mixed contaminants comprising of ha 0 025 g l sf 0 5 g l ma 0 1 od marine bacterium vh 106 cfu and ihhnv 0 5 500 ml l were used as feed the results are presented in fig 9 fig 9 shows that the flux behavior observed in ultrafiltration of mixed contaminants solution was similar to the single contaminant of sf and vh while both membranes demonstrated rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration and followed by relatively constant permeate flux until the filtration was stopped the stable fluxes were 20 and 37 of initial membrane flux for 10 kda and 100 kda membranes respectively the flux decline of both uf membranes was higher compared to all experiments using single contaminant the 100 kda membrane showed a higher normalized flux than 10 kda membrane indicating lower flux decline nevertheless both membranes showed similar rejection for all contaminants i e within the range 97 100 in further experiments 100 kda uf was selected because it showed comparable normalized flux and rejection with 10 kda membrane but it used lower pressure indicating lower energy in addition the permeate flux of 10 kda membrane is relatively small for the practical application further examination was performed by ultrafiltration of real aquaculture water from the aquaculture system the results are presented in fig 9 and table 2 fig 9 shows that rapid flux decline followed by a gradual flux decrease was observed although the filtration has already been performed 2 h a gradual flux decline was still observed the normalized flux was 56 of initial membrane flux after two hours ultrafiltration compared to uf of mixed contaminants solution ultrafiltration of real aquaculture water resulted in lower flux decline table 2 shows the rejection of some important parameters for aquaculture system it is seen that the membrane had 100 rejection for ihhnv vh and suspended solid in addition the rejection of turbidity ammonia and cod were 99 5 97 6 and 86 4 respectively the lowest rejection was observed for total phosphate i e 11 1 3 4 membrane characterization visualization of membrane surface was performed to support previous explanations it is clearly seen that all foulants were significantly deposited on membrane surface fig 10 in addition foulant segregation on the membrane surface was also observed for all foulants 4 discussion rfr was used as an indicator to evaluate adsorptive fouling caused by the contaminant models as can be seen from fig 2 the static adsorption of all contaminants used in this study caused membrane fouling as indicated by their rfr the higher rfr means the higher adsorptive fouling all contaminant models except raw and smh showed a systematic trend of adsorptive fouling where the 100 kda uf membrane had the lowest rfr followed by the 10 kda and 50 kda uf membranes respectively different behavior was exhibited by a more complex feed raw and smh where the increase in pore size decreased the rfr indicating lower adsorptive fouling the highest rfr was observed at the experiments using raw as feed for all membranes these results suggest that smh was the strongest foulant in term of adsorptive fouling furthermore for the single contaminant sf was identified as the strongest foulant the results obtained from adsorptive fouling are in agreement with the result obtained from ultrafiltration experiment where smh and sf are the two foulant models that generated highest flux decline it is clearly seen that the extent of adsorptive fouling was influenced by foulant concentration and membrane pore size increasing foulant concentration would rise rfr which shows more severe adsorptive fouling has occurred at higher concentration this phenomenon was well explained in our previous publication 36 the influence of pore size expressed as mwco on adsorptive fouling can be explained by blocking model theory if the size of foulant is smaller than the membrane pore size the foulant can access the membrane pores causing adsorption in the membrane pores followed by a pore size constriction when the foulant size is increased the possible pore blocking will be higher complete blocking will occur when the membrane pore size is equal to the foulant size nevertheless if the foulant size is further increased the possibility of pore blocking becomes lower and a cake layer formation will be larger it is understood that the pore blocking mechanism will result in a larger flux reduction than pore narrowing difference in adsorptive fouling behavior was shown by the 10 and 50 kda membranes where the 50 kda membrane showed higher adsorptive fouling than the 10 kda membrane for all individual foulants the 10 kda membrane showed higher adsorptive fouling than 50 kda membrane for mixed foulants smh and raw the possible reason for this phenomenon is foulant foulant interactions the interaction between or among foulants in the feed can alter the fouling behavior caused by the individual foulant ultrafiltration data suggest that fouling behavior and steady permeate fluxes were influenced by both membrane cut off membrane pore size and contaminant type this means the ratio of contaminant size to membrane pore size is more relevant to be used for explaining fouling phenomena rather than pore or foulant size itself all filtration experiments showed a rapid flux decline at the beginning of filtration followed by either gradual decrease for longer filtration time and finally tended to level off after relatively long time filtration or by relatively constant permeate flux until the filtration has been finished this difference in fouling behavior is certainly due to the difference fouling phenomenon the rapid flux decline at the beginning of filtration was caused by concentration polarization in addition fouling could also contribute to this rapid decline concentration polarization is the filtration phenomenon that cannot be avoided and occurs due to the build up of foulant concentration on the membrane surface as consequence of filtration process in order to prove the contribution of fouling we stopped the filtration just after 5 min filtration for 10 s the filtration was then started again and the flux could not be restored to the initial value the flux was higher than the flux at 5th min filtration but lower than initial flux the increase in flux after stopping the filtration suggests that concentration polarization contributed to the flux decline nevertheless because their flux increases were only within the range 5 20 fouling was the dominant reason for the flux decline for the case where rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux fouling by pore blocking tends to complete blocking should be another reason for the sharp flux decline beside concentration polarization it is important to point out that the adsorption should not be the reason for this rapid decline at the early stage because adsorption fouling requires a certain time to occur and relatively high concentration fig 3 our experiments showed that it takes at least 30 min for adsorption data not shown thereafter both adsorption and foulant deposition on the membrane surface leading to cake layer formation took place this cake layer formation is evidenced by the results of membrane surface visualization using sem fig 10 nevertheless it is believed that this cake layer did not influence the resulted permeate flux as indicated by constant flux after rapid flux decline in this case porous cake layers should be formed for the case where rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux fouling by pore narrowing should be the reason for this rapid declining beside concentration polarization then adsorption fouling and cake layer formation occurred in this case adsorption fouling and cake layer influenced the resulted permeate flux as indicated by a gradual flux decrease furthermore it is reasonable to explain that a stable external membrane fouling seems to be the most dominant fouling deposit of multilayers foulant on the membrane was also clearly observed by sem fig 10 a similar phenomenon was explained earlier by saidi et al 40 experiments using single foulant solution demonstrated that 50 kda membrane showed the highest fouling as indicated by its smallest normalized flux j jo beside the pore morphology the higher initial flux of 50 kda membrane could cause higher cp that will promote a higher possibility of irreversible fouling formation furthermore for the same uf membrane used sf and ma were identified as two strongest contaminants leading to highest flux decline by contrast vh and ihhnv were identified as the two weakest contaminants leading to lowest flux decline for the same contaminant 50 kda uf membrane generally showed the highest flux reduction among other types of used membranes the 100 and 10 kda membranes showed comparable flux decline in addition psh 100 kda was effective in removing contaminants in aquaculture systems to meet the standard in aquaculture systems for the same contaminant the membrane with larger pores pes 50 kda is prone to internal fouling than the membrane with smaller pores 10 kda definitely this explanation is not proper for the membrane with very large pore size compared to contaminant size this phenomenon is in agreement with the study by rickman et al 41 considering the permeate flux and rejection data obtained from the experiments using single contaminant 100 kda and 10 kda membranes were further examined for ultrafiltration of mixed contaminants both 100 and 10 kda membranes demonstrated fouling behavior where rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux the reason used to explain fouling behavior for single foulant solution is still valid to be used here the results also indicated that 100 kda membrane was less prone to fouling than 10 kda membrane as indicated by its higher j jo 37 vs 28 further examination using real aquaculture water was conducted using 100 kda membrane rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux was observed the 100 kda uf membrane exhibited very high rejection for all components in real aquaculture water except total phosphate only 11 1 however the concentration of total phosphate in permeate is still lower compared to aquaculture standard 5 conclusions study of the effects of membrane pore size expressed as mwco and foulant type on fouling behavior and foulant rejection has been performed using three different commercial uf membranes and five different foulant models the experimental results showed that fouling behavior was influenced by both membrane cut off pore size and foulant type two fouling behaviors were observed i e i rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux until the experiment finished and ii rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux concentration polarization and fouling by pore blocking are believed to be the reason for the sharp flux decline for fouling behavior i furthermore both adsorption and foulant deposition on the membrane surface leading to cake layer formation occurred nevertheless it is supposed this cake layer did not influence the resulted permeate flux concentration polarization and fouling by pore narrowing were the reason for the sharp flux decline of fouling behavior ii further adsorption fouling and foulant deposition on the both membrane surface and the membrane pore surface leading to cake layer formation occurred then finally decreases permeate flux thus it is reasonable to state that a stable external membrane fouling seems to be the most dominant fouling mechanism for fouling behavior ii in general 100 kda membrane showed the lowest fouling among all membranes examined it is worth noting that all membranes had similar rejections for all contaminant models therefore based on the basis of permeate flux behavior and rejection data the 100 kda uf membrane appeared to be the most promising ones among other
