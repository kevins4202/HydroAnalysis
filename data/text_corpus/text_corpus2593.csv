12965,this study aimed to develop a wastewater treatment method that employs an advanced oxidation process aop physico chemical pretreatment ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 followed by biological treatment using an acinetobacter sp biofilm to treat toxic concentrations of phenol this study shows that when the initial phenol concentration was 700 ppm the biological treatment alone could not remove any of the phenol due to its toxicity to microorganisms in contrast using the combined treatment aop uv h2o2 with 300 ppm h2o2 for 3 h as a pre treatment followed by biological treatment complete removal of phenol within only 18 h was achieved as well as a 75 decrease in organic matter concentration in the water treatment with uv h2o2 alone reduced the phenol concentration by 20 but there was no reduction in the amount of organic matter measured as total organic carbon toc indicating that the phenol transformed to aromatic by products but without mineralization monitored using hplc toxicity tests performed on artemia brine shrimp were conducted for all treatments they demonstrated a 93 reduction in toxicity following the combined treatment whereas the separate treatments alone did not reduce toxicity this study shows that the combination of treatments has great potential for removing contaminants that are not readily biodegradable by reducing their concentrations and their decomposition products and preventing the accumulation of toxic by products graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment physico chemical pre treatments biodegradation aromatic compounds artemia 1 introduction phenol c6h5oh is an organic molecule comprising an aromatic ring and was one of the first substances included on the list of toxic substances with high priority for treatment u s e p a due to health problems arising in response to increased exposure to such substances high concentrations of phenol c6h5oh and phenolic compounds may be found in wastewater from industries such as textile plastic paper medicines oil refining coal processing and more 1 2 furthermore phenolic compounds have been listed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european union eu as pollutants of priority concern 3 4 most of the studies dealing with treatment of high concentrations of toxic phenols deal with methods of removal using membranes advanced oxidation processes aop or adsorptive processes 5 advanced oxidation processes are currently in the developmental phase and their implementation in wastewater treatment at an industrial scale is not common such processes have been found suitable for total or partial degradation of toxic compounds of various organic and inorganic substances which are not degraded by the conventional treatments used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps either because they are either not readily biodegradable or they are toxic to microorganisms 6 processes defined as aops use a free radical oh a non specific strong oxidizer that facilitates the degradation of organic molecules including molecules that are not readily biodegradable this technology also uses ozone hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv radiation titanium oxide tio2 and other substances that are able to produce free radicals advanced oxidative processes for phenol oxidation have been reported previously 7 10 however the main disadvantage of this method is the high cost of the process when aiming to achieve total mineralization of the substances 11 furthermore aop produces by products that may be more toxic than the original substances as reported elsewhere 12 substances that are not readily biodegradable can often be degraded by designated biological treatment such as biomass adapted to degradation of the specific contaminant or technology that improves the natural abilities of the microorganisms in these processes the wastewater treatment systems are based on a continuous system that allows continuous entry and exit of the wastewater where fixation of the specific bacterial population prevents the bacteria from being washed out of the bioreactor 13 14 thus improving the efficiency of degradation of the contaminant in the water nevertheless toxic substances such as phenols pose a frequent challenge for biological treatment the process in the wwtp may be inhibited and much time may be required for full recovery of the bacterial population studies that investigated the combination of aop with biological processes have demonstrated the advantage of this combination the aim of combining these two processes is to reduce the use of chemicals or energy required for implementation of aop while maintaining the ability to deal with substances that are either difficult to degrade biologically or toxic and maximizing the biological treatment which consumes and mineralizes the intermediate by products and is significantly cheaper than the physico chemical treatment 15 for example a study by goel et al 16 reported degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cl c6h4oh using aop with tio2 as the catalyst where aop was used as a pre treatment before biological treatment their results showed that photolysis was able to degrade less than 10 after 4 h while photocatalysis degraded 75 in the same time period 16 biological treatment alone required 264 h to achieve full mineralization of the chlorophenol however when photocatalysis was combined with the biological treatment full mineralization was achieved after 96 h a study by nishijima and okada 17 examined the rate of degradation of dissolved organic matter dom in secondary treated wastewater using different methods where the combination of aop and biological treatment was more efficient than the combination of ozonation and biological treatment aop led to 62 removal of the dom while only 40 removal was achieved with ozonation in recent years small bioreactor platform sbp technology has been developed to protect the bacterial culture and allow biological activity under uv radiation this technology also enables operation of the biological process in parallel to aop without negatively impacting the bacteria in the enveloped environment by means of a three dimensional microfiltration membrane this technology allows relatively rapid degradation kinetics of recalcitrant contaminants such as phenol which match the retention times of wwtps 18 a study by bar oz et al 19 examined the effect of ozonation and its combination with biological treatment using bacteria fixed in sbp capsules on tannic acid as a sole molecule and on olive mill wastewater omww that contains phenols and polyphenols with known antibacterial impacts 20 the combination of ozonation and biological treatment enabled 90 reduction of the initial concentration of tannic acid c76h52o46 examination of the contributions of the different treatments on the omww found that ozonation alone removed 62 of the organic matter in the wastewater while biological treatment alone using the bacteria in the sbp capsules led to a 17 cod chemical oxygen demand reduction when ozonation was performed as a pre treatment to the capsule treatment 80 cod removal was achieved after 24 h fradkin et al 21 examined the degradation of a recalcitrant target molecule a steroidal sex hormone 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 c20h24o2 using a targeted biological process including sbp technology in combination with aop the two processes were performed simultaneously in a designated oxidative bioreactor the study results indicated enhanced degradation of the contaminant using a combined biological physical treatment approach with short retention times of 4 h notwithstanding the demonstrated efficiency of the combined treatment approach there was still a requirement for improving the process or increasing the understanding of how to combine the different technologies to increase the rate of contaminant degradation however the abovementioned studies did not indicate that any toxicity tests had been performed for the effluents or for the secondary metabolites despite the possibility that the decomposition products are no less toxic or even more toxic than the original molecule 22 the abovementioned studies indicate that there are advantages for combining the physico chemical method with biological treatment to degrade recalcitrant organic substances combining the two processes allows us to overcome the disadvantages of each separate process aop is very efficient and enables either reduction of contaminant toxicity or increased biological degradation of the contaminant thus it is suitable as a pre treatment phase the biological treatment allows reduction of the time required for oxidation and thus offers energy savings and reduced use of chemicals such as h2o2 and ozone o3 as well as increasing the safety profile of the water with respect to the presence of excess chemicals in the water as well as remnants of secondary metabolites produced by oxidation the current study examined the degradation of a high toxic concentration of phenol using a combined approach physico chemical pre treatment followed by biological treatment each process was also examined separately to determine the potential of each treatment alone and in combination the physico chemical treatment aop combining uv radiation and h2o2 was performed as a pretreatment assuming that this process would make the contaminant easier to degrade biologically the second step was biological treatment with the bacterium acinetobacter emy which had been previously isolated in our laboratory and found to have the ability to degrade phenolic compounds the study monitored the decomposition products produced by the system using high performance liquid chromatography hplc and the concentration of organic matter total organic carbon toc toxicity tests on artemia brine shrimp were performed to determine the toxicity of the various treatment products 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of microbial culture and media this study used the bacterium acinetobacter emy which had been identified and isolated in our laboratory from biomass that grew in a bioreactor for phenol treatment this bacterium has the ability for rapid production of a resistant biofilm and demonstrated long term activity on various surfaces the bacterium was identified by 16s ribosomal rna its serial number is mt410617 23 the synthetic wastewater used throughout the study contained the following components as nutrients and carbon sources 6 15 g l disodium hydrogen phosphate monohydrate na2hpo4 h2o 1 53 g l potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 0 2 g l magnesium sulfate heptahydrate mgso4 7h2o 0 038 g l calcium chloride cacl2 and 10 ml of a metal medium

003 g l sodium molybdate dihydrate namoo4 2h2o the bacterium was grown in this medium to which phenol was added as a single carbon source at 30 c and agitation at 100 rpm before setting up the experimental system acinetobacter emy was acclimatized to phenol for 16 days where the phenol concentration in the medium was raised daily to a final concentration of 250 ppm acclimatization was performed in a 200 ml erlenmeyer flask that was set up in an orbital shaker mrc israel at a temperature of 30 c and agitation at 100 rpm sterile bio carriers biomérieux bioballs were added to the medium as substrates for biofilm growth these bio carriers comprised a plastic layer protecting an inner layer of sponge on which the biofilm can grow in an optimal environment protected from shear and friction forces fig 1 after exposure and acclimatization to high phenol concentrations the biocarriers containing the acinetobacter emy culture fixed inside them as a biofilm were used in the experiments 2 2 water quality tests 2 2 1 testing the concentration of phenol and decomposition products using hplc toc and hydrogen peroxide residues high performance liquid chromatography hplc was performed by reversed phase hplc using a thermo scientific finnigan surveyor system equipped with a photodiode array pda plus detector 220 340 nm the chromatographic separation was achieved on a sonoma c18 2 5 μ 100 å 250 4 60 mm es industries chromega column its temperature was maintained at 30 c the mobile phase for gradient elution comprised two solvents solvent a 0 1 acetic acid acoh in h2o and solvent b 0 1 acoh in methanol meoh ch3oh the linear gradient profile was as follows 80 a 5 min 80 30 a 10 min 30 30 a 20 min 30 20 a 21 min 20 20 a 30 min 20 80 a 32 min and 80 a 40 min the flow rate was 1 0 ml min and the injection volume was 15 μl total phenols in the samples were measured using the standard curve of the tested phenol measurement of toc was performed using an analitikjena multi n c 2100s device as described by bisutti et al 24 measurement of h2o2 concentration throughout the experiment was performed using a commercial test kit macherey nagel 2 2 2 toxicity tests with artemia brine shrimps a test of the treatment mediums was performed at the end of the experiment using artemia brine shrimp according to arulvasu et al 25 in brief artemia eggs were purchased in a local shop for exotic fish and kept under refrigeration at 4 c until use for nauplius hatching the eggs were placed in a separating funnel containing the synthetic wastewater experimental medium with 2 5 added sodium chloride salt nacl sterile air was provided by an air pump and the funnel was incubated at 26 c for 24 h in the dark at the end of the aop and biological experiment the toxicity test was done for all treatments by transferring the treatment solutions into 24 microwell plates a total of 3 ml from each treatment combined treatment and each stage separately was transferred to each well and supplemented with 10 artemia brine shrimps five replicates for each treatment after 24 h the percent survival of the artemia brine shrimp was calculated as follows survival number of live artemia initial number of artemia 100 2 3 quantification of bacterial biomass on the biofilm the amount of biomass measured by protein concentration was determined using the bradford method 26 briefly to assess the amount of protein on the bio carriers the biomass was separated from each bio carrier and transferred to a saline solution nacl 0 85 containing two drops of tween 20 in a 50 ml centrifuge test tube the liquid was heated and precipitated using a centrifuge coomassie brilliant blue g 250 a reagent that reacts with the protein in the solution was added to each sample enabling quantification of the protein by spectrophotometry optical absorption was read on a uv visible spectrophotometer ultrospec 2100 at 595 nm and compared to a standard prepared from bovine serum albumin bsa 2 4 testing biofilm viability biofilm viability in the different treatments was tested using the method described by xiao et al 27 briefly the bio carriers were placed in test tubes with the experimental medium and centrifuged following centrifugation phosphate buffered saline pbs buffer and 5 μl fluorescein diacetate fda were added to the pellet in each sample the samples were transferred to an incubator for 30 min in the dark 25 c 130 rpm the test was performed at 488 nm and 535 nm using a plate reader biotek synergy h1 a dissecting microscope with a uv source was used to visualize the fluorescent signals on the bio carriers 2 5 experimental setup the experiment aimed at determining the ability of the combined system and each stage separately to degrade phenol and its decomposition products to determine the degradation efficiency of the physico chemical phase and the biological phase separately and in combination the following treatments were performed on the original medium containing 700 ppm phenol 1 biological treatment alone 2 aop treatment alone 3 serial combination of aop and biological treatment and 4 a control system including the experimental medium with phenol but without any treatment to determine whether spontaneous degradation of phenolic compounds occurs in the experimental system fig 2 the physico chemical phase included aop uv h2o2 in a batch circulation reactor the experimental medium included 2 l synthetic wastewater containing 700 ppm phenol as a single carbon source and 300 ppm h2o2 a commercial uv device with 16 w uv lamp operated continuously at a wavelength of 254 nm a peristaltic pump recirculated the solution through the uv device in 90 ml min for 3 h while performing aop hourly samples were taken the enzyme catalase was added to each sample to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 residue in the medium and the concentrations of phenol and its decomposition products were determined using hplc after 3 h of aop 100 ml samples of the medium were transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks for biological treatment at 30 c and 100 rpm mrc israel orbital shaker containing five bioball bio carriers on which acinetobacter emy was grown as described above the following parameters were measured during the experiment ph initial and final h2o2 concentrations concentrations of phenol and its decomposition products and toc each treatment was tested for its toxicity to artemia brine shrimp 3 results wastewater containing phenols is a common complex problem in industrial wastewater purification which has yet to be solved commercially the combination of uv h2o2 and biological treatment may provide an economical commercial solution for the industrial sector the results of phenol concentration in the different treatments fig 3 show that the separate treatments biological or aop did not lead to significant decomposition results biological treatment did not affect the phenol concentration over time due to its toxicity oxidation reduced the phenol concentration by 29 in the first 3 h this value remained until the end of the experiment 20 h the phenol was fully degraded only when biological treatment and aop were combined after 3 h of aop 29 of the phenol was removed another 13 h of biological treatment were required to remove the remaining 71 phenol however it is noted that no further phenol could be removed after aop without the biological treatment in our preliminary experiments data not shown hydrogen peroxide was found to have no effect on phenol concentration under dark conditions in the aop unit neither oxidation nor adsorption was observed in the aop unit under dark conditions the uv h2o2 treatment produced three by products metabolites that were coded a b and c fig 4 by product a was produced only in the aop treatment after aop ceased 3 18 h the concentration of this substance did not change however when the biological treatment was initiated by product a was consumed by the bacteria as a carbon source blue line fig 4a by product b was produced in the aop process as well but was probably not stable as its concentration declined rapidly later in the experiment in the aop alone treatment by product c was produced only when the solution of the aop treated phenol was supplemented with the acinetobacter emy biofilm therefore it is assumed that c is a decomposition product of a and or b produced by the biological digestion process in summary 29 of the phenol was converted to by products a and b during the pre treatment aop treatment fig 3 showing that the aop process did not lead to full mineralization to co2 of the phenolic compounds but to two by products fig 4a b as was also observed in the toc results fig 5 the combined treatment showed that following depletion of the phenol after 16 h fig 3 the biodegradation by the bio carrier of metabolites b and c is observed fig 4 these data are reflected in toc reduction as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows the toc remaining in the different treatments at the end of the experiment 18 h following the combined treatment process the decrease in toc was much more significant 75 than under either treatment alone this is explained by the consumption of the carbon source by the bacteria and mineralization processes interestingly the uv h2o2 treatment alone did not change the toc concentration over time showing that during the uv h2o2 treatment the 29 reduction in phenol concentration fig 3 was conversion of phenol to by products the uv vis absorption spectrum shows that when the uv h2o2 treatment and the biological treatment are performed separately they have no effect on the decomposition of the total organic matter amount wavelengths 200 278 nm fig s1 in contrast under the combined treatment a significant change in organic matter can be observed at the end of the experiment after 16 h absorbance drops from 2 1 to 1 3 at 200 nm and from 0 95 to 0 6 at 278 nm these results align with the results obtained from hplc analysis and toc measurements the viability tests performed on the bacteria using the fda method at the end of the experiment showed that the bacteria in the combined treatment were 40 more active viable than the bacteria in the biological treatment alone fig s2 in the latter the bacteria were active still they were limited by the high phenol concentration and we estimate that this was primarily due to the absence of an available non toxic source of carbon required for their activity similarly the amount of biomass in each treatment was evaluated according to the amount of protein it was found that each bio carrier supported 19 2 μg ml protein in other words despite the equal amount of biomass on the bio carriers the bacteria were more active in the combined treatment due to the reduced toxicity resulting from the degradation of the phenol and its conversion to a more readily available carbon source for the bacteria fig s3 toxicity tests on the experimental medium using artemia brine shrimp fig 6 show that after 24 h the artemia died in all treatments except the combined treatment 93 survival similar to the control thus we can conclude that the combined treatment significantly reduced the toxicity of the phenol in the growth medium and the potential toxicity of the by products produced during both the uv h2o2 treatment and the biological treatment by products a b c for example by product a which was produced as a result of uv h2o2 treatment and degraded only during the biological treatment fig 4a seems to be toxic to artemia only after the biological treatment degraded this by product was a decline in the toxicity for artemia observed 4 discussion phenolic compounds are recalcitrant organic compounds present in industrial wastewater from a broad range of sources they pose a treatment challenge and have a negative impact on both wwtps and the environment 22 advanced oxidation processes and biological treatment as separate treatments for the removal of high concentrations of phenol have many limitations 28 29 therefore the current study aimed to determine whether the combination of aop and biological treatment allows the degradation of high concentrations of phenolic compounds to full mineralization assuming that aop produces decomposition products that are more conducible to biological degradation and less toxic for bacteria than the original phenolic compounds this was done by uv h2o2 treatment of a synthetic wastewater solution containing 700 ppm phenol followed by biological treatment the results showed that the phenol was fully degraded only under the combined treatment while the biological treatment alone could not degrade the high phenol concentration due to its toxicity for microorganisms and its lack of availability as a source of carbon for the bacteria interestingly uv h2o2 as a single treatment could not deal with the high phenol concentrations and the observed degradation of phenol peaked at only 29 of the original concentration a study by suryaman et al 30 examined phenol degradation in a combined batch process with treatment by fixed biomass and a second phase of aop using titanium dioxide tio2 particles that activated the production of free radicals biological treatment as a single treatment achieved complete degradation of 50 mg l phenol after 12 h of incubation for the combined treatment the authors incubated 300 mg l phenol in the biological treatment which lasted 10 5 h and then exposed the product water from the biological process to 0 5 h of oxidation treatment their results demonstrated 98 reduction of the initial phenol concentration by mineralization in the combined treatment process another study conducted by abdullah et al 31 combined aop using the photocatalyst n doped titanium dioxide zinc oxide tio2 zno n composite with biological treatment using suspended biomass to degrade 50 ppm phenol the biological treatment as a single treatment achieved 89 phenol degradation within 8 h in addition abdullah et al 31 also examined the effect of the treatment order in the combined treatment which lasted 6 h they presented an aop followed by biological treatment that achieved 68 phenol degradation in contrast combined biological treatment followed by aop achieved significantly higher efficiency reaching 81 phenol degradation this indicates that the order of the treatments is essential their results showed that biological treatment before aop increased the efficiency of the overall degradation process nevertheless this is true only when phenol concentrations are relatively low and do not have a limiting effect on microbial biomass activity since the present study examined treatment of high toxic phenol concentrations we chose to begin with aop and subsequently introduce the biological treatment the studies mentioned above were all conducted as batch experiments and used low phenol concentrations 50 300 mg l using a two phase treatment process the present study demonstrated degradation of 700 mg l phenol to complete mineralization within 18 h the biological treatment was performed using fixed biomass that contained acinetobacter emy and to the best of our knowledge showed a better ability to reduce the amount of organic matter than did the previous studies we hypothesize that the type of bacterium plays a pivotal role in the degradation of phenolic compounds the lowest toc values obtained from the experiments conducted in the current study were measured in the combined treatment experiment where 75 organic matter removal was achieved indicating higher efficiency of the combined treatment compared to either treatment alone this is explained by the consumption of the carbon sources by the bacteria biosorption and mineralization biodegradation of the biodegradable aop by products the aop treatment alone did not change the toc concentration over time showing that the 29 reduction in phenol concentration was conversion of phenol to by products that were monitored by hplc and the uv vis absorption spectrum bar oz et al 19 conducted a study on omww involving aop ozonization as a pre treatment followed by biological treatment using the bacterium delftia erosy isolated and fixed in sbp capsules ozonation as a single treatment achieved 62 cod removal biological treatment alone achieved only 17 removal and the combination of the two technologies achieved 80 cod removal in other words the combined treatment achieved a reduction in organic matter concentration equal to the arithmetic sum of the reduction achieved by each treatment alone following uv h2o2 treatment phenol is usually converted into various aromatic rings namely hydroquinone which may be converted to quinone and other intermediates continued oxidation of these rings produces carboxylic acids and carbon atoms 32 33 some studies have even shown that these by products may be less biodegradable and more toxic than the phenol itself 34 the main problem with contaminants such as phenols is their high toxicity to the environment in the case of only partial degradation measurement of the decomposition products using analytical methods is insufficient and there is a need to perform biological toxicity tests to confirm an absence of toxicity before introducing the treated wastewater to the environment most of the existing literature does not consider the option of performing toxicity tests or estimating the toxicity of secondary metabolites following aop despite the possibility that the decomposition products are no less toxic or even more toxic than the original molecule 22 a study by shaukat et al 35 performed a 24 h toxicity test on artemia brine shrimp for five different types of phenols at low concentrations 0 005 0 12 ppm which showed that when phenol concentration was increased toxicity also increased another study that examined toxicity of phenol by products produced after aop with h2o2 performed biological toxicity test iso 11348 3 using the bacterium elivibri fischeri which contained a bacterial light system for reporting the physiological state of the bacterium this test found that 15 min of aop are sufficient to reduce the toxicity of phenol compounds nevertheless in the case of a continuous oxidation reaction the by products formed belonging to the carboxylic acid group are more toxic than the original molecule 22 studies that examined the effect of aop as a pre treatment demonstrated the importance of the pre treatment in the conversion and transfer of biologically recalcitrant substances to biologically digestible substances 22 36 degradation of the intermediate products by bacteria was also proved in the current study via the hplc results fig 4 the toc values fig 5 and the biological toxicity test using artemia brine shrimps fig 6 the toxicity test results showed that only the combined treatment could remove the toxicity that was present following the detection of phenol compounds and their derivatives resulting from aop as the artemia survived only in the solution treated by the combined processes 93 survival the toxicity tests performed for the other treatments sterile control aop and biological treatment alone demonstrated zero survival of artemia after 24 h incubation this study shows that the by products produced following aop are toxic for artemia brine shrimp as also reported by hincapié et al 37 the secondary metabolites from the biological treatment also appear to have a toxic effect a complementary perspective to the toxicity tests was obtained from the fda test of bio carriers that contained the bacteria the results of the fda test showed that the carriers in the combined treatment demonstrated 40 higher microbial activity than that observed in the biological treatment alone in other words it appears that 700 ppm phenol caused the death of the bacteria due to toxicity and or oxidative stress thus there was no phenol degradation at all in this treatment fig s1 which presents a uv vis scan over the range of 190 400 nm shows two main peaks at wavelengths of 220 and 270 nm attributed to aromatic compounds the decrease in absorption at both 220 nm and 270 nm results from the decreased concentrations of aromatic compounds phenol and its decomposition products following aop and biological treatment the degradation of the organic compounds was significant only when the two treatments were combined while the biological treatment alone had only a negligible effect on absorption at 270 nm this slight reduction may be attributed to limited adsorption of phenol to the bacterial biomass these results are in line with the results obtained from the hplc analysis in the hplc analysis of the combined treatment medium full degradation of phenol was observed followed by almost full degradation of the by products metabolites in summary based on our experimental results the combination of aop and biological treatment can indeed cause a significant reduction in phenol within a shorter time frame and can be a more economical solution since it saves the energy and chemicals required for full activation aop conducting biological treatment after aop significantly reduces the toxicity of the medium due to degradation of the secondary metabolites produced during aop thus raising the safety profile of the water for reuse or return to the environment combining different treatment methods for recalcitrant contaminants such as phenol produced by the pharmaceutical hormone and pesticide industries requires an in depth understanding of the interactions between the various treatment methods emphasizing the production and conversion of secondary metabolites from one process to another rapid degradation kinetics within a hydraulic retention period of a few hours are necessary to integrate the treatment solution into the existing or designated treatment infrastructure operating at accepted hydraulic retention times of a few hours the more efficient we make the process with respect to speed and treatment efficiency the smaller the expected area of the treatment infrastructure recent reviews 38 39 presented the different possible uses of microorganisms that have undergone granulation encapsulation adsorption to particles such as using bio carriers in this study and more they showed that fixed microorganisms in continuous treatment processes present a sustainable solution for industrial wastewater containing different concentrations of phenols and other micropollutants the current approach of combining different treatment procedures for removal of contaminants such as phenol and other recalcitrant compounds requires an in depth understanding of the interactions between the various treatment methods applied the combination of different methods should be evaluated depending on the structure of the compounds and the availability of microbial communities with a high potential to mineralize the contaminants this study demonstrates the potential of combining aop and biological treatment in small to medium water bodies contaminated with highly recalcitrant compounds such as pharmaceuticals and hormones the efficacy of the biological process alone could be reduced in downstream wastewater by the presence of antibiotics i e from sanitary wastewater treatment which contribute to the development of microbial cultures that generate antibiotic resistance and occasionally even multitype antibiotic resistance combined treatment at the wastewater source can reduce these processes and contribute to the elimination of other micropollutants in the effluents moreover the combination of aop and biological treatment may be more economically feasible than the operational activity and costs of aop treatment in full configuration since the combined treatment approach may require less energy and chemicals to operate on one hand and less time on the other the proposed combined treatment demonstrates high potential to achieve full configuration applicability for treatment of recalcitrant pollutants at the contamination source such as effluent from hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry 5 conclusions contamination by phenols is a complex issue in wastewater treatment which has yet to find an economical commercial solution treatment with aop alone is expensive because it consumes large quantities of energy and degradable chemicals in contrast biological treatment alone cannot always degrade the desired contaminant due to contaminant toxicity thus the combination of aop and biological treatment has great potential this study examined the degradation of a high toxic concentration of phenol using a combined approach physico chemical pre treatment followed by biological treatment the combined treatment achieved full degradation of phenol compared to 29 degradation with aop alone and no degradation with biological treatment alone additionally the combination of treatments appears to provide a more economical and eco friendly solution for recalcitrant contaminants since it saves both energy and chemicals required by aop for full mineralization of phenols moreover toxicity tests performed on artemia demonstrated a 93 decrease in toxicity following the combined treatment whereas the separate treatments alone did not reduce toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships

12965,this study aimed to develop a wastewater treatment method that employs an advanced oxidation process aop physico chemical pretreatment ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 followed by biological treatment using an acinetobacter sp biofilm to treat toxic concentrations of phenol this study shows that when the initial phenol concentration was 700 ppm the biological treatment alone could not remove any of the phenol due to its toxicity to microorganisms in contrast using the combined treatment aop uv h2o2 with 300 ppm h2o2 for 3 h as a pre treatment followed by biological treatment complete removal of phenol within only 18 h was achieved as well as a 75 decrease in organic matter concentration in the water treatment with uv h2o2 alone reduced the phenol concentration by 20 but there was no reduction in the amount of organic matter measured as total organic carbon toc indicating that the phenol transformed to aromatic by products but without mineralization monitored using hplc toxicity tests performed on artemia brine shrimp were conducted for all treatments they demonstrated a 93 reduction in toxicity following the combined treatment whereas the separate treatments alone did not reduce toxicity this study shows that the combination of treatments has great potential for removing contaminants that are not readily biodegradable by reducing their concentrations and their decomposition products and preventing the accumulation of toxic by products graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment physico chemical pre treatments biodegradation aromatic compounds artemia 1 introduction phenol c6h5oh is an organic molecule comprising an aromatic ring and was one of the first substances included on the list of toxic substances with high priority for treatment u s e p a due to health problems arising in response to increased exposure to such substances high concentrations of phenol c6h5oh and phenolic compounds may be found in wastewater from industries such as textile plastic paper medicines oil refining coal processing and more 1 2 furthermore phenolic compounds have been listed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european union eu as pollutants of priority concern 3 4 most of the studies dealing with treatment of high concentrations of toxic phenols deal with methods of removal using membranes advanced oxidation processes aop or adsorptive processes 5 advanced oxidation processes are currently in the developmental phase and their implementation in wastewater treatment at an industrial scale is not common such processes have been found suitable for total or partial degradation of toxic compounds of various organic and inorganic substances which are not degraded by the conventional treatments used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps either because they are either not readily biodegradable or they are toxic to microorganisms 6 processes defined as aops use a free radical oh a non specific strong oxidizer that facilitates the degradation of organic molecules including molecules that are not readily biodegradable this technology also uses ozone hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv radiation titanium oxide tio2 and other substances that are able to produce free radicals advanced oxidative processes for phenol oxidation have been reported previously 7 10 however the main disadvantage of this method is the high cost of the process when aiming to achieve total mineralization of the substances 11 furthermore aop produces by products that may be more toxic than the original substances as reported elsewhere 12 substances that are not readily biodegradable can often be degraded by designated biological treatment such as biomass adapted to degradation of the specific contaminant or technology that improves the natural abilities of the microorganisms in these processes the wastewater treatment systems are based on a continuous system that allows continuous entry and exit of the wastewater where fixation of the specific bacterial population prevents the bacteria from being washed out of the bioreactor 13 14 thus improving the efficiency of degradation of the contaminant in the water nevertheless toxic substances such as phenols pose a frequent challenge for biological treatment the process in the wwtp may be inhibited and much time may be required for full recovery of the bacterial population studies that investigated the combination of aop with biological processes have demonstrated the advantage of this combination the aim of combining these two processes is to reduce the use of chemicals or energy required for implementation of aop while maintaining the ability to deal with substances that are either difficult to degrade biologically or toxic and maximizing the biological treatment which consumes and mineralizes the intermediate by products and is significantly cheaper than the physico chemical treatment 15 for example a study by goel et al 16 reported degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cl c6h4oh using aop with tio2 as the catalyst where aop was used as a pre treatment before biological treatment their results showed that photolysis was able to degrade less than 10 after 4 h while photocatalysis degraded 75 in the same time period 16 biological treatment alone required 264 h to achieve full mineralization of the chlorophenol however when photocatalysis was combined with the biological treatment full mineralization was achieved after 96 h a study by nishijima and okada 17 examined the rate of degradation of dissolved organic matter dom in secondary treated wastewater using different methods where the combination of aop and biological treatment was more efficient than the combination of ozonation and biological treatment aop led to 62 removal of the dom while only 40 removal was achieved with ozonation in recent years small bioreactor platform sbp technology has been developed to protect the bacterial culture and allow biological activity under uv radiation this technology also enables operation of the biological process in parallel to aop without negatively impacting the bacteria in the enveloped environment by means of a three dimensional microfiltration membrane this technology allows relatively rapid degradation kinetics of recalcitrant contaminants such as phenol which match the retention times of wwtps 18 a study by bar oz et al 19 examined the effect of ozonation and its combination with biological treatment using bacteria fixed in sbp capsules on tannic acid as a sole molecule and on olive mill wastewater omww that contains phenols and polyphenols with known antibacterial impacts 20 the combination of ozonation and biological treatment enabled 90 reduction of the initial concentration of tannic acid c76h52o46 examination of the contributions of the different treatments on the omww found that ozonation alone removed 62 of the organic matter in the wastewater while biological treatment alone using the bacteria in the sbp capsules led to a 17 cod chemical oxygen demand reduction when ozonation was performed as a pre treatment to the capsule treatment 80 cod removal was achieved after 24 h fradkin et al 21 examined the degradation of a recalcitrant target molecule a steroidal sex hormone 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 c20h24o2 using a targeted biological process including sbp technology in combination with aop the two processes were performed simultaneously in a designated oxidative bioreactor the study results indicated enhanced degradation of the contaminant using a combined biological physical treatment approach with short retention times of 4 h notwithstanding the demonstrated efficiency of the combined treatment approach there was still a requirement for improving the process or increasing the understanding of how to combine the different technologies to increase the rate of contaminant degradation however the abovementioned studies did not indicate that any toxicity tests had been performed for the effluents or for the secondary metabolites despite the possibility that the decomposition products are no less toxic or even more toxic than the original molecule 22 the abovementioned studies indicate that there are advantages for combining the physico chemical method with biological treatment to degrade recalcitrant organic substances combining the two processes allows us to overcome the disadvantages of each separate process aop is very efficient and enables either reduction of contaminant toxicity or increased biological degradation of the contaminant thus it is suitable as a pre treatment phase the biological treatment allows reduction of the time required for oxidation and thus offers energy savings and reduced use of chemicals such as h2o2 and ozone o3 as well as increasing the safety profile of the water with respect to the presence of excess chemicals in the water as well as remnants of secondary metabolites produced by oxidation the current study examined the degradation of a high toxic concentration of phenol using a combined approach physico chemical pre treatment followed by biological treatment each process was also examined separately to determine the potential of each treatment alone and in combination the physico chemical treatment aop combining uv radiation and h2o2 was performed as a pretreatment assuming that this process would make the contaminant easier to degrade biologically the second step was biological treatment with the bacterium acinetobacter emy which had been previously isolated in our laboratory and found to have the ability to degrade phenolic compounds the study monitored the decomposition products produced by the system using high performance liquid chromatography hplc and the concentration of organic matter total organic carbon toc toxicity tests on artemia brine shrimp were performed to determine the toxicity of the various treatment products 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of microbial culture and media this study used the bacterium acinetobacter emy which had been identified and isolated in our laboratory from biomass that grew in a bioreactor for phenol treatment this bacterium has the ability for rapid production of a resistant biofilm and demonstrated long term activity on various surfaces the bacterium was identified by 16s ribosomal rna its serial number is mt410617 23 the synthetic wastewater used throughout the study contained the following components as nutrients and carbon sources 6 15 g l disodium

003 g l sodium molybdate dihydrate namoo4 2h2o the bacterium was grown in this medium to which phenol was added as a single carbon source at 30 c and agitation at 100 rpm before setting up the experimental system acinetobacter emy was acclimatized to phenol for 16 days where the phenol concentration in the medium was raised daily to a final concentration of 250 ppm acclimatization was performed in a 200 ml erlenmeyer flask that was set up in an orbital shaker mrc israel at a temperature of 30 c and agitation at 100 rpm sterile bio carriers biomérieux bioballs were added to the medium as substrates for biofilm growth these bio carriers comprised a plastic layer protecting an inner layer of sponge on which the biofilm can grow in an optimal environment protected from shear and friction forces fig 1 after exposure and acclimatization to high phenol concentrations the biocarriers containing the acinetobacter emy culture fixed inside them as a biofilm were used in the experiments 2 2 water quality tests 2 2 1 testing the concentration of phenol and decomposition products using hplc toc and hydrogen peroxide residues high performance liquid chromatography hplc was performed by reversed phase hplc using a thermo scientific finnigan surveyor system equipped with a photodiode array pda plus detector 220 340 nm the chromatographic separation was achieved on a sonoma c18 2 5 μ 100 å 250 4 60 mm es industries chromega column its temperature was maintained at 30 c the mobile phase for gradient elution comprised two solvents solvent a 0 1 acetic acid acoh in

flow rate was 1 0 ml min and the injection volume was 15 μl total phenols in the samples were measured using the standard curve of the tested phenol measurement of toc was performed using an analitikjena multi n c 2100s device as described by bisutti et al 24 measurement of h2o2 concentration throughout the experiment was performed using a commercial test kit macherey nagel 2 2 2 toxicity tests with artemia brine shrimps a test of the treatment mediums was performed at the end of the experiment using artemia brine shrimp according to arulvasu et al 25 in brief artemia eggs were purchased in a local shop for exotic fish and kept under refrigeration at 4 c until use for nauplius hatching the eggs were placed in a separating funnel containing the synthetic wastewater experimental medium with 2 5 added sodium chloride salt nacl sterile air was provided by an air pump and the funnel was incubated at 26 c for 24 h in the dark at the end of the aop and biological experiment the toxicity test was done for all treatments by transferring the treatment solutions into 24 microwell plates a total of 3 ml from each treatment combined treatment and each stage separately was transferred to each well and supplemented with 10 artemia brine shrimps five replicates for each treatment after 24 h the percent survival of the artemia brine shrimp was calculated as follows survival number of live artemia initial number of artemia 100 2 3 quantification of bacterial biomass on the biofilm the amount of biomass measured by protein concentration was determined using the bradford method 26 briefly to assess the amount of protein on the bio carriers the biomass was separated from each bio carrier and transferred to a saline solution nacl 0 85 containing two drops of tween 20 in a 50 ml centrifuge test tube the liquid was heated and precipitated using a centrifuge coomassie brilliant blue g 250 a reagent that reacts with the protein in the solution was added to each sample enabling quantification of the protein by spectrophotometry optical absorption was read on a uv visible spectrophotometer ultrospec 2100 at 595 nm and compared to a standard prepared from bovine serum albumin bsa 2 4 testing biofilm viability biofilm viability in the different treatments was tested using the method described by xiao et al 27 briefly the bio carriers were placed in test tubes with the experimental medium and centrifuged following centrifugation phosphate buffered saline pbs buffer and 5 μl fluorescein diacetate fda were added to the pellet in each sample the samples were transferred to an incubator for 30 min in the dark 25 c 130 rpm the test was performed at 488 nm and 535 nm using a plate reader biotek synergy h1 a dissecting microscope with a uv source was used to visualize the fluorescent signals on the bio carriers 2 5 experimental setup the experiment aimed at determining the ability of the combined system and each stage separately to degrade phenol and its decomposition products to determine the degradation efficiency of the physico chemical phase and the biological phase separately and in combination the following treatments were performed on the original medium containing 700 ppm phenol 1 biological treatment alone 2 aop treatment alone 3 serial combination of aop and biological treatment and 4 a control system including the experimental medium with phenol but without any treatment to determine whether spontaneous degradation of phenolic compounds occurs in the experimental system fig 2 the physico chemical phase included aop uv h2o2 in a batch circulation reactor the experimental medium included 2 l synthetic wastewater containing 700 ppm phenol as a single carbon source and 300 ppm h2o2 a commercial uv device with 16 w uv lamp operated continuously at a wavelength of 254 nm a peristaltic pump recirculated the solution through the uv device in 90 ml min for 3 h while performing aop hourly samples were taken the enzyme catalase was added to each sample to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 residue in the medium and the concentrations of phenol and its decomposition products were determined using hplc after 3 h of aop 100 ml samples of the medium were transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks for biological treatment at 30 c and 100 rpm mrc israel orbital shaker containing five bioball bio carriers on which acinetobacter emy was grown as described above the following parameters were measured during the experiment ph initial and final h2o2 concentrations concentrations of phenol and its decomposition products and toc each treatment was tested for its toxicity to artemia brine shrimp 3 results wastewater containing phenols is a common complex problem in industrial wastewater purification which has yet to be solved commercially the combination of uv h2o2 and biological treatment may provide an economical commercial solution for the industrial sector the results of phenol concentration in the different treatments fig 3 show that the separate treatments biological or aop did not lead to significant decomposition results biological treatment did not affect the phenol concentration over time due to its toxicity oxidation reduced the phenol concentration by 29 in the first 3 h this value remained until the end of the experiment 20 h the phenol was fully degraded only when biological treatment and aop were combined after 3 h of aop 29 of the phenol was removed another 13 h of biological treatment were required to remove the remaining 71 phenol however it is noted that no further phenol could be removed after aop without the biological treatment in our preliminary experiments data not shown hydrogen peroxide was found to have no effect on phenol concentration under dark conditions in the aop unit neither oxidation nor adsorption was observed in the aop unit under dark conditions the uv h2o2 treatment produced three by products metabolites that were coded a b and c fig 4 by product a was produced only in the aop treatment after aop ceased 3 18 h the concentration of this substance did not change however when the biological treatment was initiated by product a was consumed by the bacteria as a carbon source blue line fig 4a by product b was produced in the aop process as well but was probably not stable as its concentration declined rapidly later in the experiment in the aop alone treatment by product c was produced only when the solution of the aop treated phenol was supplemented with the acinetobacter emy biofilm therefore it is assumed that c is a decomposition product of a and or b produced by the biological digestion process in summary 29 of the phenol was converted to by products a and b during the pre treatment aop treatment fig 3 showing that the aop process did not lead to full mineralization to co2 of the phenolic compounds but to two by products fig 4a b as was also observed in the toc results fig 5 the combined treatment showed that following depletion of the phenol after 16 h fig 3 the biodegradation by the bio carrier of metabolites b and c is observed fig 4 these data are reflected in toc reduction as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows the toc remaining in the different treatments at the end of the experiment 18 h following the combined treatment process the decrease in toc was much more significant 75 than under either treatment alone this is explained by the consumption of the carbon source by the bacteria and mineralization processes interestingly the uv h2o2 treatment alone did not change the toc concentration over time showing that during the uv h2o2 treatment the 29 reduction in phenol concentration fig 3 was conversion of phenol to by products the uv vis absorption spectrum shows that when the uv h2o2 treatment and the biological treatment are performed separately they have no effect on the decomposition of the total organic matter amount wavelengths 200 278 nm fig s1 in contrast under the combined treatment a significant change in organic matter can be observed at the end of the experiment after 16 h absorbance drops from 2 1 to 1 3 at 200 nm and from 0 95 to 0 6 at 278 nm these results align with the results obtained from hplc analysis and toc measurements the viability tests performed on the bacteria using the fda method at the end of the experiment showed that the bacteria in the combined treatment were 40 more active viable than the bacteria in the biological treatment alone fig s2 in the latter the bacteria were active still they were limited by the high phenol concentration and we estimate that this was primarily due to the absence of an available non toxic source of carbon required for their activity similarly the amount of biomass in each treatment was evaluated according to the amount of protein it was found that each bio carrier supported 19 2 μg ml protein in other words despite the equal amount of biomass on the bio carriers the bacteria were more active in the combined treatment due to the reduced toxicity resulting from the degradation of the phenol and its conversion to a more readily available carbon source for the bacteria fig s3 toxicity tests on the experimental medium using artemia brine shrimp fig 6 show that after 24 h the artemia died in all treatments except the combined treatment 93 survival similar to the control thus we can conclude that the combined treatment significantly reduced the toxicity of the phenol in the growth medium and the potential toxicity of the by products produced during both the uv h2o2 treatment and the biological treatment by products a b c for example by product a which was produced as a result of uv h2o2 treatment and degraded only during the biological treatment fig 4a seems to be toxic to artemia only after the biological treatment degraded this by product was a decline in the toxicity for artemia observed 4 discussion phenolic compounds are recalcitrant organic compounds present in industrial wastewater from a broad range of sources they pose a treatment challenge and have a negative impact on both wwtps and the environment 22 advanced oxidation processes and biological treatment as separate treatments for the removal of high concentrations of phenol have many limitations 28 29 therefore the current study aimed to determine whether the combination of aop and biological treatment allows the degradation of high concentrations of phenolic compounds to full mineralization assuming that aop produces decomposition products that are more conducible to biological degradation and less toxic for bacteria than the original phenolic compounds this was done by uv h2o2 treatment of a synthetic wastewater solution containing 700 ppm phenol followed by biological treatment the results showed that the phenol was fully degraded only under the combined treatment while the biological treatment alone could not degrade the high phenol concentration due to its toxicity for microorganisms and its lack of availability as a source of carbon for the bacteria interestingly uv h2o2 as a single treatment could not deal with the high phenol concentrations and the observed degradation of phenol peaked at only 29 of the original concentration a study by suryaman et al 30 examined phenol degradation in a combined batch process with treatment by fixed biomass and a second phase of aop using titanium dioxide tio2 particles that activated the production of free radicals biological treatment as a single treatment achieved complete degradation of 50 mg l phenol after 12 h of incubation for the combined treatment the authors incubated 300 mg l phenol in the biological treatment which lasted 10 5 h and then exposed the product water from the biological process to 0 5 h of oxidation treatment their results demonstrated 98 reduction of the initial phenol concentration by mineralization in the combined treatment process another study conducted by abdullah et al 31 combined aop using the photocatalyst n doped titanium dioxide zinc oxide tio2 zno n composite with biological treatment using suspended biomass to degrade 50 ppm phenol the biological treatment as a single treatment achieved 89 phenol degradation within 8 h in addition abdullah et al 31 also examined the effect of the treatment order in the combined treatment which lasted 6 h they presented an aop followed by biological treatment that achieved 68 phenol degradation in contrast combined biological treatment followed by aop achieved significantly higher efficiency reaching 81 phenol degradation this indicates that the order of the treatments is essential their results showed that biological treatment before aop increased the efficiency of the overall degradation process nevertheless this is true only when phenol concentrations are relatively low and do not have a limiting effect on microbial biomass activity since the present study examined treatment of high toxic phenol concentrations we chose to begin with aop and subsequently introduce the biological treatment the studies mentioned above were all conducted as batch experiments and used low phenol concentrations 50 300 mg l using a two phase treatment process the present study demonstrated degradation of 700 mg l phenol to complete mineralization within 18 h the biological treatment was performed using fixed biomass that contained acinetobacter emy and to the best of our knowledge showed a better ability to reduce the amount of organic matter than did the previous studies we hypothesize that the type of bacterium plays a pivotal role in the degradation of phenolic compounds the lowest toc values obtained from the experiments conducted in the current study were measured in the combined treatment experiment where 75 organic matter removal was achieved indicating higher efficiency of the combined treatment compared to either treatment alone this is explained by the consumption of the carbon sources by the bacteria biosorption and mineralization biodegradation of the biodegradable aop by products the aop treatment alone did not change the toc concentration over time showing that the 29 reduction in phenol concentration was conversion of phenol to by products that were monitored by hplc and the uv vis absorption spectrum bar oz et al 19 conducted a study on omww involving aop ozonization as a pre treatment followed by biological treatment using the bacterium delftia erosy isolated and fixed in sbp capsules ozonation as a single treatment achieved 62 cod removal biological treatment alone achieved only 17 removal and the combination of the two technologies achieved 80 cod removal in other words the combined treatment achieved a reduction in organic matter concentration equal to the arithmetic sum of the reduction achieved by each treatment alone following uv h2o2 treatment phenol is usually converted into various aromatic rings namely hydroquinone which may be converted to quinone and other intermediates continued oxidation of these rings produces carboxylic acids and carbon atoms 32 33 some studies have even shown that these by products may be less biodegradable and more toxic than the phenol itself 34 the main problem with contaminants such as phenols is their high toxicity to the environment in the case of only partial degradation measurement of the decomposition products using analytical methods is insufficient and there is a need to perform biological toxicity tests to confirm an absence of toxicity before introducing the treated wastewater to the environment most of the existing literature does not consider the option of performing toxicity tests or estimating the toxicity of secondary metabolites following aop despite the possibility that the decomposition products are no less toxic or even more toxic than the original molecule 22 a study by shaukat et al 35 performed a 24 h toxicity test on artemia brine shrimp for five different types of phenols at low concentrations 0 005 0 12 ppm which showed that when phenol concentration was increased toxicity also increased another study that examined toxicity of phenol by products produced after aop with h2o2 performed biological toxicity test iso 11348 3 using the bacterium elivibri fischeri which contained a bacterial light system for reporting the physiological state of the bacterium this test found that 15 min of aop are sufficient to reduce the toxicity of phenol compounds nevertheless in the case of a continuous oxidation reaction the by products formed belonging to the carboxylic acid group are more toxic than the original molecule 22 studies that examined the effect of aop as a pre treatment demonstrated the importance of the pre treatment in the conversion and transfer of biologically recalcitrant substances to biologically digestible substances 22 36 degradation of the intermediate products by bacteria was also proved in the current study via the hplc results fig 4 the toc values fig 5 and the biological toxicity test using artemia brine shrimps fig 6 the toxicity test results showed that only the combined treatment could remove the toxicity that was present following the detection of phenol compounds and their derivatives resulting from aop as the artemia survived only in the solution treated by the combined processes 93 survival the toxicity tests performed for the other treatments sterile control aop and biological treatment alone demonstrated zero survival of artemia after 24 h incubation this study shows that the by products produced following aop are toxic for artemia brine shrimp as also reported by hincapié et al 37 the secondary metabolites from the biological treatment also appear to have a toxic effect a complementary perspective to the toxicity tests was obtained from the fda test of bio carriers that contained the bacteria the results of the fda test showed that the carriers in the combined treatment demonstrated 40 higher microbial activity than that observed in the biological treatment alone in other words it appears that 700 ppm phenol caused the death of the bacteria due to toxicity and or oxidative stress thus there was no phenol degradation at all in this treatment fig s1 which presents a uv vis scan over the range of 190 400 nm shows two main peaks at wavelengths of 220 and 270 nm attributed to aromatic compounds the decrease in absorption at both 220 nm and 270 nm results from the decreased concentrations of aromatic compounds phenol and its decomposition products following aop and biological treatment the degradation of the organic compounds was significant only when the two treatments were combined while the biological treatment alone had only a negligible effect on absorption at 270 nm this slight reduction may be attributed to limited adsorption of phenol to the bacterial biomass these results are in line with the results obtained from the hplc analysis in the hplc analysis of the combined treatment medium full degradation of phenol was observed followed by almost full degradation of the by products metabolites in summary based on our experimental results the combination of aop and biological treatment can indeed cause a significant reduction in phenol within a shorter time frame and can be a more economical solution since it saves the energy and chemicals required for full activation aop conducting biological treatment after aop significantly reduces the toxicity of the medium due to degradation of the secondary metabolites produced during aop thus raising the safety profile of the water for reuse or return to the environment combining different treatment methods for recalcitrant contaminants such as phenol produced by the pharmaceutical hormone and pesticide industries requires an in depth understanding of the interactions between the various treatment methods emphasizing the production and conversion of secondary metabolites from one process to another rapid degradation kinetics within a hydraulic retention period of a few hours are necessary to integrate the treatment solution into the existing or designated treatment infrastructure operating at accepted hydraulic retention times of a few hours the more efficient we make the process with respect to speed and treatment efficiency the smaller the expected area of the treatment infrastructure recent reviews 38 39 presented the different possible uses of microorganisms that have undergone granulation encapsulation adsorption to particles such as using bio carriers in this study and more they showed that fixed microorganisms in continuous treatment processes present a sustainable solution for industrial wastewater containing different concentrations of phenols and other micropollutants the current approach of combining different treatment procedures for removal of contaminants such as phenol and other recalcitrant compounds requires an in depth understanding of the interactions between the various treatment methods applied the combination of different methods should be evaluated depending on the structure of the compounds and the availability of microbial communities with a high potential to mineralize the contaminants this study demonstrates the potential of combining aop and biological treatment in small to medium water bodies contaminated with highly recalcitrant compounds such as pharmaceuticals and hormones the efficacy of the biological process alone could be reduced in downstream wastewater by the presence of antibiotics i e from sanitary wastewater treatment which contribute to the development of microbial cultures that generate antibiotic resistance and occasionally even multitype antibiotic resistance combined treatment at the wastewater source can reduce these processes and contribute to the elimination of other micropollutants in the effluents moreover the combination of aop and biological treatment may be more economically feasible than the operational activity and costs of aop treatment in full configuration since the combined treatment approach may require less energy and chemicals to operate on one hand and less time on the other the proposed combined treatment demonstrates high potential to achieve full configuration applicability for treatment of recalcitrant pollutants at the contamination source such as effluent from hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry 5 conclusions contamination by phenols is a complex issue in wastewater treatment which has yet to find an economical commercial solution treatment with aop alone is expensive because it consumes large quantities of energy and degradable chemicals in contrast biological treatment alone cannot always degrade the desired contaminant due to contaminant toxicity thus the combination of aop and biological treatment has great potential this study examined the degradation of a high toxic concentration of phenol using a combined approach physico chemical pre treatment followed by biological treatment the combined treatment achieved full degradation of phenol compared to 29 degradation with aop alone and no degradation with biological treatment alone additionally the combination of treatments appears to provide a more economical and eco friendly solution for recalcitrant contaminants since it saves both energy and chemicals required by aop for full mineralization of phenols moreover toxicity tests performed on artemia demonstrated a 93 decrease in toxicity following the combined treatment whereas the separate treatments alone did not reduce toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships

12966,the non porous structure of the outer layer in the existing polyvinyl alcohol pva alginate carrier lowered the stability and efficiency of the partial nitritation anammox pn a process in this study these drawbacks could be improved with the addition of a foaming agent and the effect was evaluated in a two step pn a process on a pilot scale the penetration efficiency for dissolved oxygen was a parameter for determining the optimal content of the foaming agent and it could be determined as 0 3 w v in the pilot pn the do diffusion inside the pva alginate carrier was effective for selective nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob inhibition as a result ammonium oxidation efficiency of 49 3 2 7 was achieved within 20 d of operation resulting in a no2 n nh4 n ratio of 0 92 0 1 in the effluent in the pilot anammox the contribution of endogenous denitrification to nitrogen removal 95 6 2 9 was a major factor inhibiting the physiological activity of anammox the strategy of decreasing the hydraulic retention time worked effectively in alleviating the negative impact which improved the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal in addition this strategy was also worked effective in alleviating the effect of inhibitors on anammox activity under field conditions with stabilization of nitrogen removal by anammox exogenous denitrification even contributed to improving nitrogen removal efficiency and a nitrogen removal rate of 1 1 0 1 kg m3 d was achieved at an influent nitrogen load of 1 4 0 1 kg m3 d graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foaming agent pva alginate carrier partial nitritation anammox start up 1 introduction the removal of nitrogen contamination from wastewater containing high strength ammonium is important to improve water quality and prevent eutrophication of receiving water bodies 1 biological nitrogen removal has been considered as a solution to reduce contamination by nutrients previously a nitrification denitrification based process requiring excessive aeration energy and operating costs was applied 2 however the demand for energy saving processes has recently increased with the energy self sufficiency of sewage treatment plants 3 from this perspective the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox shown in eq 1 is considered a promising alternative 4 in the anammox process ammonium and nitrite are simultaneously converted into nitrogen gas 5 for successful nitrogen removal stable partial nitritation pn is required as a pretreatment process eq 2 6 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 26 no 3 2 03 h 2 o 0 66 ch 2 o

aquatic environments since the 2000s 7 10 the pn a process leads to considerable saving of about 33 of natural resources compared to the conventional process and it can save up to 50 of operating costs with saving of oxygen demand and external carbon source 11 more than 100 full scale processes are currently in operation worldwide 12 however the extremely slow growth rate of anammox microorganisms remains a limiting factor that weakens the potential applications of this process 13 14 anammox microorganisms have a slow doubling time 10 14 d and a yield of 0 11 gvss gnh4 n 15 which may reduce the cost of excess sludge treatment but destabilizes the start up of the anammox process 16 the technology for securing a large number of anammox microorganisms can greatly contribute to decreasing the start up period of the pn a process 17 18 various types of bioreactors have been designed for the selective culture of anammox microorganisms a batch type reactor that facilitates solid liquid separation was used at the beginning of the study to facilitate the anammox reaction 19 however because of the extremely slow growth rate of anammox microorganisms it did not have a significant effect on mass cultivation subsequently the continuous reaction system was considered more suitable for the selective cultivation of anammox microorganisms with improved insight into the physicochemical properties of anammox granules 20 therefore up flow sludge blanket reactors moving bed reactors and membrane bioreactors have been effectively applied to cultivate anammox microorganisms 21 23 conventional activated sludge was used as an inoculum in these studies and the type of activated sludge collected from return activated sludge line anaerobic digestion and landfill leachate treatment plants was the determining factor for the start up period 21 24 27 however the start up period reported in these studies was 60 to 204 days indicating that more studies are needed to selectively cultivation of anammox microorganism from activated sludge in order to shorten the start up period an active agent for the selective activation of anammox enzymes was also utilized the addition of fe3 in the influent was utilized for this purpose and the start up period could be shortened up to 30 d 28 however it will be difficult to consider these external variables in a large scale reactor among the different methods adopted for the selective cultivation of anammox microorganisms the whole cell entrapment technique is considered an excellent approach compared to other technologies this method can enhance the retention of microorganisms and has an operational advantage that facilitates solid liquid separation 29 for whole cell entrapment polyvinyl alcohol pva is cheaper than other synthetic polymers and has a higher tensile strength without causing toxicity to organisms 30 in particular pva alginate using bifunctional reagents such as boric acid and calcium chloride is considered a representative gel material 17 pva alginate carriers have been used in various nitrogen removal systems and found suitable for cultivation of anammox microorganisms 31 however the non porous structure formed on the surface of pva alginate carrier due to the closely crosslinked structure causes a burst like expansion of the carrier 32 the structural drawbacks of these pva alginate could be identified in previous laboratory scale studies which eventually led to the loss of anammox microbes 17 to compensate for this a study on improving the permeability of pva alginate carriers using a foaming agent nahco3 has been conducted 33 in the previous study the foaming agent was converted to co2 gas under acidic conditions ph 2 0 4 0 of boric acid which formed a gas channel inside the pva alginate and the permeability was improved these results were confirmed by the investigation of the physical and morphological properties of the pva alginate carriers however studies on pn using pva alginate carriers with improved gas permeability have not yet been conducted the dense structure in the outer layer of the existing pva alginate carrier was found to negatively affect the penetration of dissolved oxygen do into the pva alginate carrier the do penetration depth inside the pva alginate carrier was determined to be as low as 66 7 28 9 μm in addition to improve the penetration depth to 966 7 μm up to 8 0 mgo2 l do is required in bulk liquid 34 such a high do concentration range would not only consume excessive aeration energy but would also be a difficult operating factor that is difficult to consider in the field thus in order to operate the pn process more efficiently the low do penetration of the existing pva alginate carrier should be further improved in this study the start up period and stability of the two stage pn a process in which activated sludge was used as the sole inoculum were investigated a whole cell entrapment technique using pva alginate was applied to each reactor the effect of the improved porous structure of pva alginate on pn efficiency due to the addition of the foaming agent was investigated at the laboratory scale and the optimal foaming agent content was determined based on the parameters determined at the laboratory scale for pn and anammox a two stage pn a process was operated at the pilot scale strategies for decreasing the start up period were investigated based on the contributions of anammox and denitrification to nitrogen removal operational problems that were difficult to predict at the beginning of operation such as sudden exposure to high concentrations of heavy metals and failure of the influent supply system were encountered during reactor operation and corresponding strategies were suggested the nitrogen removal performance in the pilot scale reactor was evaluated for 285 d 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor description the two stage pn a system was designed using an acrylic cylinder reactor with an effective volume of 100 l each fig 1 each reactor was operated in continuous stirred tank reactor cstr mode with 200 rpm of mixing speed the temperature was maintained at 30 c by using a thermostat the influent was continuously pumped into the pn reactor through a peristaltic pump and the do concentration was adjusted to 2 3 mgo2 l using an air regulator dwyer rma 21 ssv flow meter the pn effluent was pumped out through a 400 l storage tank into the anammox reactor the prepared pva alginate carriers were inoculated into each reactor at a packing ratio of 30 v v to prevent the wash out of the pva alginate carriers a stainless steel mesh with a pore size of 2 mm was installed at the effluent ports of the reactor 2 2 characteristics of reject water and seed sludge reject water was collected from the dewatering facility of anaerobic digested sludge at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in gyeongsan si south korea the composition and characteristics of the reject water were as follows 389 8 857 7 mg l nh4 n 0 0 6 mg l no2 n 0 1 14 2 mg l no3 n 32 5 120 1 mg l suspended solids ss 1860 3245 mg l caco3 152 348 mg l chemical oxygen

to nitrogen c n ratio was 0 3 0 12 and the influent hco3 nh4 n ratio was 1 0 0 04 the seed sludge in each reactor was collected from the return line of the a2 o process at the wwtp the a2 o process was operated to treat low ammonium concentrations 32 5 mg l based on traditional nitrification and denitrification 2 3 operational conditions the pn reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h for 285 d the operation of the anammox reactor was classified into the following four periods according to the appearance of the anammox reaction and major operating variables period i 1 111 d anammox microorganisms were selectively cultivated from activated sludge the pn effluent was diluted with tap water to maintain an influent nitrite concentration below 50 mg l it was applied as a shortening strategy of hrt to accelerate the cultivation of anammox microorganisms the start up period was evaluated based on the stoichiometric substrate consumption ratio suggested by strous et al 35 subsequently the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated by a stepwise decrease in the dilution factor period ii 112 177 d malfunction of the dilution system of the pn effluent resulted in a sharp increase in the influent nitrite and anammox activity was rapidly inhibited to stabilize the activity the influent dilution system employed in period i was applied again to dilute the nitrite concentration after that the dilution factor gradually decreased with the recovery of anammox activity period iii 178 242 d with the stabilization of anammox activity pn effluent was supplied without dilution and the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated period iv 243 285 d ferric chloride was temporarily used to reduce the water content of the cake in the dewatering facility therefore high concentrations of heavy metals were detected in reject water which considerably deteriorated the pn efficiency to recover the performance the reactor operation was switched to fed batch mode for 15 d subsequently the nitrogen removal performance in the continuous mode with active stabilization was re evaluated in each period the activity rates of the anammox and denitrifiers and their respective contributions to the total nitrogen removal rate nrr were calculated using the following modified eqs 3 5 7 36 the specific growth rate μ was calculated based on anammox activity over time according

preparation of pva alginate carriers the preparation of pva alginate carriers with the addition of a foaming agent has been described in a previous study 33 briefly a solution of 15 w v pva and 2 0 w v sodium alginate was prepared in distilled water and autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min the pva alginate solution was slowly mixed with activated sludge to which nahco3 0 3 and 0 6 w v was added this mixture was then sequentially immersed in a saturated h3bo3 cacl2 solution and orthophosphate solution for 2 h and 1 h respectively using a peristaltic pump finally the resultant pva alginate carriers were washed with distilled water the size of the carriers was maintained at 4 3 0 4 mm the characteristics of the pva alginate carrier according to the content of nahco3 are described in table s1 2 4 2 preliminary test pn efficiency according to the foaming agent content the effect of the dense structure of the pva alginate carrier surface on pn efficiency was first investigated pva alginate with 0 0 15 and 0 3 w v nahco3 was prepared and each carrier was added to a 1 l reactor at a packing ratio of 30 the reject water was used as the influent the do concentration was set at 2 3 mg l and the ammonium conversion efficiency ace and nitritation efficiency were investigated in cstr mode for 52 d 2 5 physicochemical analysis liquor samples of 50 ml were periodically collected and filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size filter the nitrate concentration was determined by ion chromatography dionex dx 120 thermo scientific usa the concentrations of ammonium nitrite cod ss and caco3 for alkalinity were determined according to standard methods 37 the cross section and surface of the carriers were examined by scanning electron microscopy sem xl30 esem feg fei company eindhoven the netherlands specific anammox activity was determined using a batch assay 7 the detailed experimental procedures are described in supplementary information s1 heavy metals were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer instrument optima 8300 perkinelmer usa bulk do in the reactor was measured using an ldo probe hach usa the do that penetrated the pva alginate carrier was analyzed using an oxygen microsensor usox 50 unisense denmark before measurement bulk do was maintained at different concentrations of 2 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 mgo2 l by controlling the argon and air gas purging intensities the correlations between nitrogen removal performance and operating variables were analyzed by pearson s correlation analysis using spss 25 ibm usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the pn using pva alginate carrier 3 1 1 effect of the foaming agent content on the pn laboratory scale study table 1 shows the images of the cross section and surface of pva carriers with 0 0 15 and 0 3 w v foaming agents the outer layer between 30 and 60 μm of the pva alginate carrier prepared without the foaming agent was found to be composed of a non porous structure unlike the inner layer this structure adversely affects oxygen penetration into the interior of the carrier under various bulk do conditions the concentration of do that could penetrate from the outer layer to the interior of the carrier decreased sharply fig s1 at 2 mgo2 l bulk do the concentration of penetrated do to a depth of 50 μm was 0 97 0 1 mgo2 l this was considered a limiting factor that not only inhibited the growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob inside the carrier but also required excessive aeration energy during the pn process to improve pn efficiency using pva alginate a foaming agent was added to the existing pva alginate carrier the porosity of the carrier was found to improve with the addition of the foaming agent and this improvement was clearly confirmed in the image of the pva alginate carrier surface to investigate the effect of the porous structure in the outer layer of the pva alginate carrier on pn efficiency a laboratory scale reactor was operated and the results are presented in fig 2 the inhibition of aob activity observed during the preparation of the pva alginate carrier was rapidly restored after 3 d of operation as shown in fig s2 the no2 n nox n ratio in the effluent was 0 92 0 12 therefore successful nitritation could be achieved under all conditions however the ace exhibited a distinct on the 9th day of operation the aces achieved with 0 0 15 and 0 3 w v foaming agents were 26 1 37 9 and 49 1 respectively thereafter the ace remained stable for the operation the effect of adding the foaming agent to the pva alginate on pn efficiency was investigated for the first time in this study the strength of the carrier was determined when the pva alginate solution was immersed in a h3bo3 cacl2 solution 38 at this time the dissolved nahco3 was converted to co2 gas under acidic conditions discharged to the outside of the carrier and a gas channel was formed consequently a porous structure could be formed in the outer layer of the carrier eventually the oxygen permeability efficiency of the carrier was improved contributing to an increase in the pn efficiency this gas channel contributes to the diffusion of the substrate into the carrier 39 however excessive gas channel formation causes a loss of immobilized microorganisms in a previous study 0 6 w v foaming agent resulted in excessive loss of microorganisms immobilized in pva 33 therefore the optimal foaming agent content for the pn was determined which was verified as 0 3 w v in the pilot study 3 1 2 pn for pretreatment of the reject water pilot scale study the pilot scale pn reactor was operated for 285 d based on the operating parameters determined in the laboratory scale reactor fig 3 during the entire operating period the influent ammonium concentration fluctuated significantly from 389 8 to 857 7 mg l and the corresponding influent nitrogen loading rate nlr was 0 6 to 1 8 kg m3 d although the activity of aob was inhibited in the pva alginate preparation process the ace rapidly recovered from 12 8 at the beginning of the operation to 50 within 20 d of operation the ammonium to nitrite ratio nar in the effluent was improved to 1 02 with an increase in pn efficiency subsequently a stable ace of 49 3 2 7 and nar of 0 92 0 1 in the effluent were achieved even with a fluctuating influent nitrogen load moreover even though activated sludge dominated by nitrification was used as the inoculum nitrate production was effectively suppressed during the operation the nitrate concentration in the effluent was 5 1 4 5 mg l and the no2 nox ratio was 0 96 0 1 however the pn efficiency decreased sharply during 243 251 d of operation owing to a variable that was difficult to predict in situ this is discussed further in section 3 4 the nar in the effluent showed a high correlation with the influent and removed hco3 nh3 n ratios p 0 01 the aob requires 2 mol of hco3 to oxidize 1 mol of nh3 n therefore the characteristics of the reject water with approximately 50 alkalinity than that required for complete nitrification were suitable for the pn process for this reason the control of the bicarbonate concentration in the influent was also used as a means to improve the nar 40 in addition bicarbonate selectively inhibited the growth of nob species and contributed to further improving the stability of the pn process 41 when stable pn was achieved during the operation the influent and removed hco3 nh3 n ratios calculated in this study were 1 04 0 04 and 1 91 0 2 respectively fig s3 however the removed hco3 nh3 n ratio increased to 2 4 0 2 with the increase in effluent alkalinity from 336 7 24 6 to 1270 56 6 mgcaco3 l when the abovementioned pn efficiency deteriorated the ph of the effluent increased to 8 9 which can be explained by the effect of alkalinity stripping the low partial pressure of co2 in the aerated solution 0 035 of the atmospheric co2 concentration limits its dissolution according to henry s law in an aeration system rising air bubbles strip more inorganic carbon than the amount that can be transferred from the gas to the liquid phase 42 this phenomenon is accelerated with the increase in residual alkalinity concentration and induces an increase in ph 6 43 chemical equilibrium based on the ph in high stream wastewater governs the formation of free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna 21 the potential for selective inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob by fa and fna has been reported previously anthonisen et al 44 found that nob was selectively inhibited under 0 1 1 0 mgnh3 l fa and 0 011 0 07 mghno2 l fna also the growth of nob was more sensitive to fna distribution than that of aob thus selective growth of aob can be achieved 45 based on this potential a ph control strategy has been applied for the selective inhibition of nob 46 in the present study fa and fna concentrations could be maintained at 3 5 1 4 and 0 05 0 02 mg l respectively which are higher than the threshold concentrations for nob inhibition without a ph control system even a sharp increase in ph caused by operational problems temporarily resulted in high fa concentrations of 193 4 64 1 mg l which inhibited aob activity this indicated that high fa concentrations along with transient exposure to heavy metals reduced the ace the low do permeability of the pva alginate carrier resulted in a synergistic effect on the selective inhibition of nob when the threshold concentration of fa and fna for nob activity are maintained the oxygen affinity of aob is higher than that of nob 5 therefore low do concentrations 0 3 mg l promoted the selective inhibition of nob 47 thus the whole cell entrapment technique has the advantage of achieving effective pn in this study the appropriate permeability of do into the pva alginate carrier was controlled by adding a foaming agent which was then verified by laboratory and pilot scale reactor operation 3 2 nitrogen removal performance in anammox reactor pilot scale study fig 4 shows the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox pilot reactor for 285 d fig 4a and b show the profiles of the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the influent and effluent and fig 4c shows the contribution of anammox and denitrifiers to the nrr over the operation time 3 2 1 start up period i during period i the influent was diluted approximately five fold to maintain the nitrite concentration below the value that inhibits anammox activity which was 41 9 8 3 mg l the threshold concentration for anammox activity was determined in a previous study and the concentration was below 50 mg l 6 in addition the hrt was reduced to 6 h to improve the anammox cultivation rate at the beginning of the operation the ammonium concentration in the effluent was higher than that in the influent fig 4a but the removal efficiency of nitrite gradually increased over time and almost all of the nitrite was removed fig 4b thereafter the nitrite removal efficiency gradually decreased from the point at which ammonium was removed the stoichiometric ratio of consumed nh4 n consumed no3 n produced no3 n for anammox was 1 1 32 0 26 35 after 42 d of operation a no2 n nh4 n consumption ratio 1 25 0 1 similar to this stoichiometric ratio was achieved fig s4 nevertheless the accumulation of nitrate which is a reaction by product of anammox did not occur 0 35 0 2 mg l in the effluent until the 49th day of operation the ratio of nitrate produced to ammonium consumed was 0 15 0 02 after 49 d with the stabilization of anammox activity the dilution factor of the influent decreased stepwise the nlr increased to 0 67 kg m3 d and an nrr of 0 52 0 02 kg m3 d was achieved depending on the presence of available organic matter which acts as an electron donor the denitrification mechanism can be classified as exogenous and endogenous denitrification 48 endogenous denitrification requires microbial intracellular storage compounds such as polyhydroxyalkanoates polyphosphates and polysaccharides as carbon sources to reduce nox 49 in this mechanism denitrification causes cell lysis which results in the release of soluble microbial organics and ammonium 50 this characteristic was clearly revealed by the contribution of denitrification to the nrr at the beginning of the operation the influent nitrite was almost completely consumed by denitrification and its contribution to the nrr was approximately 100 this resulted in a higher concentration of ammonium in the effluent than in the influent due to cell lysis fig 4c denitrifiers and anammox bacteria compete with each other for nitrite consumption but when the substrate affinity of the anammox for the nitrite becomes higher than that of denitrifiers the nitrite is mainly removed by anammox microorganisms 51 therefore rapidly removing the by products of cell lysis may be a means to promote the dominance of anammox microorganisms in this study a strategy to decrease the hrt using a whole cell entrapment technique was applied to selectively reduce the substrate affinity of denitrifiers this accelerated the removal of the by products of cell lysis and the contribution of anammox to the nrr from the 28th day of operation could be rapidly improved this facilitated the growth of anammox microorganisms with an increase of the nlr the specific growth rate was 0 03 d which is equivalent to a doubling time td of 23 1 d the hrt reduction strategy for selective cultivation of anammox bacteria from activated sludge has been successfully applied previously 52 53 to decrease the hrt continuous feeding in the cstr mode has engineering advantages over the fed batch modes as used in sequencing batch reactors this is because this operation facilitates the rapid dilution of a cell lysis by product and the exponential growth of anammox bacteria however owing to the slow growth rate of anammox bacteria applying an hrt shorter than one day in suspended growth based anammox processes results in several difficulties 54 therefore the application of whole cell entrapment with high flexibility in hrt control is considered a useful technology in terms of reducing the start up period in the anammox process in addition the long term stability of the pva alginate carrier using a foaming agent was verified based on in situ operation a comparison of the start up period in this study with that in the literature is described in detail in section 3 3 3 2 2 long term operation including recovery of anammox microorganism activity periods ii iv during period ii the concentration of nitrite in the influent increased rapidly to 224 0 13 4 mg l due to a failure in the influent dilution system because of this the activity of the anammox microorganisms was reduced and nitrite in the reactor accumulated up to 82 mg l during this period total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre decreased from 81 6 0 8 to 10 0 4 9 to recover the anammox activity the influent nitrite concentration was adjusted to 50 mg l after two weeks the anammox activity improved further and the tnre increased to 80 4 1 2 with the stabilization of the anammox activity during period iii the pn effluent was introduced without diluting the influent and the nlr increased from 0 92 to 1 48 kg m3 d according to the fluctuation in the influent nitrogen load nevertheless an nrr of up to 1 2 kg m3 d was achieved with a tnre of 77 0 1 6 this improved the growth rate of anammox microorganisms to 0 11 d equivalent to a td value of 6 13 d this was higher than the value reported in the study in which the trial run period was evaluated using pva alginate carrier 55 compared to periods i and ii the slight decrease in tnre during period iii was attributed to the difference in the contribution of denitrification to tnre which is described in more detail in section 3 2 3 during period iv the continuous operation was temporarily switched to fed batch mode because a high concentration of heavy metals was detected in the reject water when the pn process became stable the reactor was operated in continuous mode again on the 257th day of operation and the nitrogen removal performance by anammox rapidly recovered after 5 d of operation in continuous mode the tnre recovered to 76 9 3 5 and nrr of 0 89 0 06 kg m3 d was stably achieved under an nlr of 1 2 0 04 kg m3 d two variables nitrite and heavy metal concentrations that were difficult to predict during the pilot scale operation were found to deteriorate the process performance the effects of these two variables in the two stage pn a process are comprehensively evaluated in section 3 3 3 2 3 statistical analysis of variables affecting nitrogen removal performance variables affecting the tnre during the two stage pn a process were statistically analyzed based on long term operation data table 2 the tnre was positively correlated with effluent no3 n concentrations r 0 660 and negatively correlated with the produced no3 n nh3 n r 0 734 these results indicate that the coexistence of anammox and denitrification can contribute to improving the tnre fig 5 shows the correlation between the produced no3 n nh3 n and tnre the decrease in the produced no3 n nh3 n improved the tnre which was inversely proportional to the no3 n concentration in the effluent in this study activated sludge was used as the seeding sludge for the anammox process therefore the contribution of denitrification to nitrogen removal was high at the beginning of the operation but it gradually decreased and almost all the nitrogen was removed by the anammox bacteria after 170 d of operation this could be explained by the fact that the tnre in periods iii and iv decreased slightly compared with that in periods i and ii the two stage pn a had a lower achievable tnre than that of the single stage pn a 56 this could be caused by further removal of nitrate which is a by product of anammox through denitrification to improve the tnre in the two stage pn a process a combination of the anammox and sulfur oxidation denitrification sod processes has been studied 57 in contrast compared to the single stage process two stage pn a is advantageous in terms of the nrr which may contribute to a compact reactor 58 therefore as the treated reject water is returned to the sewage treatment plant and treated below the discharged water quality standard the conversion to a single stage process or combination with additional processes such as the sod may be comprehensively considered according to the field requirements 3 3 unexpected inhibitors affecting the two stage pn a process in the field previously the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria from activated sludge was mainly performed at the laboratory scale where various operating parameters influent nitrogen concentration deoxygenation using n2 or ar co2 purging systems ph control and trace elements were strictly limited 24 59 60 however these limiting conditions are difficult to artificially control under field conditions anammox bacteria have a lower tolerance to nitrite inhibition nitrite in the reactor may accumulate owing to the fluctuation of influent nitrogen from 389 8 to 857 7 mg l or the failure of the treatment scheme pn or dilution system the threshold concentration of nitrite for anammox activity has a wide range from 50 to 600 mg l 7 61 in this study the tnre decreased with nitrite accumulation above 30 mg l and nitrite at 82 mg l decreased the tnre by 10 0 4 9 in contrast in the batch experiment anammox activity was inhibited when exposed to 60 mg l table s2 the effect of nitrite concentration on anammox activity in batch experiments and continuous systems was investigated as a function of exposure time lotti et al 62 investigated the effect of nitrite exposure time 1 and 24 h on anammox activity and reported that an increase in exposure time accelerated activity inhibition therefore if anammox inhibition of nitrite is confirmed a rapid follow up measure to reduce nitrite concentration is required in this study a dilution system using tap water was applied however in a larger bioreactor a mixture of rejected water and pn effluent could be a more suitable alternative all the heavy metals determined during period i were below the inhibitory level during period iv ferric chloride was temporarily used to control the water content of the anaerobically digested sludge in the dewatering system therefore as shown in table s3 in addition to ferric ion aluminum zinc and nickel were detected above the inhibition level in particular ferric ion fe3 and aluminum were detected at 61 4 3 5 and 213 0 10 3 mg l respectively the addition of 3 7 mg l ferric ions increased anammox activity five fold but concentrations exceeding 30 mg l caused severe inhibition 63 aluminum and ferric ion concentrations of 30 mg l and 12 4 mg l respectively also inhibited aob activity 64 the fluctuation in heavy metal concentration exacerbated the two stage pn a process as a rapid follow up measure the heavy metals accumulated in the pn reactor were rapidly washed with tap water and a fed batch mode was temporarily applied the pn performance was recovered after 10 d a similar strategy was applied in the anammox reactor and the two stage pn a system was stabilized after 14 d in the two stage pn a process when nitrogen removal performance deteriorates owing to inhibitors that are difficult to predict in the field a rapid follow up measure to alleviate the effect of inhibitors is required thus the practicality of whole cell entrapment technology that facilitates the rapid separation of inoculated microorganisms from inhibitors might contribute to improving the stability of the two stage pn a process 3 4 comparison of studies on the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria from activated sludge most previous studies on the cultivation of anammox microorganisms from activated sludge have been conducted under limited operating conditions in laboratory scale reactors as shown in table 3 the influent composition i e nitrogen and trace elements based on anammox stoichiometry was supplied from synthetic wastewater the start up period of the anammox process varied from 60 to 204 d based on the type of inoculum sludge however the addition of an active agent of enzymes such as fe3 that can promote the anammox metabolic activity reduced this period to 30 d 28 in addition many researchers have verified that a short hrt can decrease the start up period 55 65 however many studies have rarely been conducted on the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria under field conditions where controlling the abovementioned environmental factors is difficult in addition for the start up period of the anammox process using moving bed based biocarriers a long start up period of 79 days was required for the attachment of anammox microorganisms and an hrt of 1 5 d or more was required 66 this will indicate that the whole cell immobilization technique using pva alginate can be more beneficial in shortening the start up period of the pn a process in this study anammox bacteria was successfully cultivated for 42 d in a pilot reactor and raw reject water was used as the influent the findings of this study indicate the applicability of the whole cell entrapment technology for the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria in particular endogenous denitrification during the initial stage of operation was found to be the main cause of the prolonged start up period which indicates that the strategy of reducing the hrt was effective in addition the stability of the pva alginate carrier during long term operation for 400 days could be confirmed in a previous study on a laboratory scale 67 and its practicality could be verified as it was applied stably for 285 days even under field conditions where various variables had to be considered 4 conclusions the start up period of the two stage pn a process was evaluated using activated sludge as the sole inoculum source in a pilot scale reactor a foaming agent content of 0 3 w v improved the permeability of the pva alginate carrier which contributed to improving the pn efficiency from 26 1 2 1 to 49 1 1 5 the contribution of endogenous denitrification to nitrogen removal at the initial stage of operation was estimated to be 95 6 2 9 which was the main cause of the prolonged start up period of pn a and the strategy of reducing the hrt effectively reduced the start up period therefore nitrogen removal by pn a was successfully achieved within 42 d of operation and then an nrr of 1 1 0 1 kg m3 d was stably achieved under nlr conditions of 1 4 0 1 kg m3 d with a tnre of 80 4 1 2 the process performance through long term operation was verified by appropriately responding to process inhibitors that are difficult to predict in the field credit authorship contribution statement

12966,the non porous structure of the outer layer in the existing polyvinyl alcohol pva alginate carrier lowered the stability and efficiency of the partial nitritation anammox pn a process in this study these drawbacks could be improved with the addition of a foaming agent and the effect was evaluated in a two step pn a process on a pilot scale the penetration efficiency for dissolved oxygen was a parameter for determining the optimal content of the foaming agent and it could be determined as 0 3 w v in the pilot pn the do diffusion inside the pva alginate carrier was effective for selective nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob inhibition as a result ammonium oxidation efficiency of 49 3 2 7 was achieved within 20 d of operation resulting in a no2 n nh4 n ratio of 0 92 0 1 in the effluent in the pilot anammox the contribution of endogenous denitrification to nitrogen removal 95 6 2 9 was a major factor inhibiting the physiological activity of anammox the strategy of decreasing the hydraulic retention time worked effectively in alleviating the negative impact which improved the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal in addition this strategy was also worked effective in alleviating the effect of inhibitors on anammox activity under field conditions with stabilization of nitrogen removal by anammox exogenous denitrification even contributed to improving nitrogen removal efficiency and a nitrogen removal rate of 1 1 0 1 kg m3 d was achieved at an influent nitrogen load of 1 4 0 1 kg m3 d graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foaming agent pva alginate carrier partial nitritation anammox start up 1 introduction the removal of nitrogen contamination from wastewater containing high strength ammonium is important to improve water quality and prevent eutrophication of receiving water bodies 1 biological nitrogen removal has been considered as a solution to reduce contamination by nutrients previously a nitrification denitrification based process requiring excessive aeration energy and operating costs was applied 2 however the demand for energy saving processes has recently increased with the energy self sufficiency of sewage treatment plants 3 from this perspective the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox shown in eq 1 is considered a promising alternative 4 in the anammox process ammonium and nitrite are simultaneously converted into nitrogen gas 5 for successful nitrogen removal stable partial nitritation pn is required as a pretreatment process eq 2 6 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 26 no 3 2 03 h 2 o 0 66 ch 2 o

aquatic environments since the 2000s 7 10 the pn a process leads to considerable saving of about 33 of natural resources compared to the conventional process and it can save up to 50 of operating costs with saving of oxygen demand and external carbon source 11 more than 100 full scale processes are currently in operation worldwide 12 however the extremely slow growth rate of anammox microorganisms remains a limiting factor that weakens the potential applications of this process 13 14 anammox microorganisms have a slow doubling time 10 14 d and a yield of 0 11 gvss gnh4 n 15 which may reduce the cost of excess sludge treatment but destabilizes the start up of the anammox process 16 the technology for securing a large number of anammox microorganisms can greatly contribute to decreasing the start up period of the pn a process 17 18 various types of bioreactors have been designed for the selective culture of anammox microorganisms a batch type reactor that facilitates solid liquid separation was used at the beginning of the study to facilitate the anammox reaction 19 however because of the extremely slow growth rate of anammox microorganisms it did not have a significant effect on mass cultivation subsequently the continuous reaction system was considered more suitable for the selective cultivation of anammox microorganisms with improved insight into the physicochemical properties of anammox granules 20 therefore up flow sludge blanket reactors moving bed reactors and membrane bioreactors have been effectively applied to cultivate anammox microorganisms 21 23 conventional activated sludge was used as an inoculum in these studies and the type of activated sludge collected from return activated sludge line anaerobic digestion and landfill leachate treatment plants was the determining factor for the start up period 21 24 27 however the start up period reported in these studies was 60 to 204 days indicating that more studies are needed to selectively cultivation of anammox microorganism from activated sludge in order to shorten the start up period an active agent for the selective activation of anammox enzymes was also utilized the addition of fe3 in the influent was utilized for this purpose and the start up period could be shortened up to 30 d 28 however it will be difficult to consider these external variables in a large scale reactor among the different methods adopted for the selective cultivation of anammox microorganisms the whole cell entrapment technique is considered an excellent approach compared to other technologies this method can enhance the retention of microorganisms and has an operational advantage that facilitates solid liquid separation 29 for whole cell entrapment polyvinyl alcohol pva is cheaper than other synthetic polymers and has a higher tensile strength without causing toxicity to organisms 30 in particular pva alginate using bifunctional reagents such as boric acid and calcium chloride is considered a representative gel material 17 pva alginate carriers have been used in various nitrogen removal systems and found suitable for cultivation of anammox microorganisms 31 however the non porous structure formed on the surface of pva alginate carrier due to the closely crosslinked structure causes a burst like expansion of the carrier 32 the structural drawbacks of these pva alginate could be identified in previous laboratory scale studies which eventually led to the loss of anammox microbes 17 to compensate for this a study on improving the permeability of pva alginate carriers using a foaming agent nahco3 has been conducted 33 in the previous study the foaming agent was converted to co2 gas under acidic conditions ph 2 0 4 0 of boric acid which formed a gas channel inside the pva alginate and the permeability was improved these results were confirmed by the investigation of the physical and morphological properties of the pva alginate carriers however studies on pn using pva alginate carriers with improved gas permeability have not yet been conducted the dense structure in the outer layer of the existing pva alginate carrier was found to negatively affect the penetration of dissolved oxygen do into the pva alginate carrier the do penetration depth inside the pva alginate carrier was determined to be as low as 66 7 28 9 μm in addition to improve the penetration depth to 966 7 μm up to 8 0 mgo2 l do is required in bulk liquid 34 such a high do concentration range would not only consume excessive aeration energy but would also be a difficult operating factor that is difficult to consider in the field thus in order to operate the pn process more efficiently the low do penetration of the existing pva alginate carrier should be further improved in this study the start up period and stability of the two stage pn a process in which activated sludge was used as the sole inoculum were investigated a whole cell entrapment technique using pva alginate was applied to each reactor the effect of the improved porous structure of pva alginate on pn efficiency due to the addition of the foaming agent was investigated at the laboratory scale and the optimal foaming agent content was determined based on the parameters determined at the laboratory scale for pn and anammox a two stage pn a process was operated at the pilot scale strategies for decreasing the start up period were investigated based on the contributions of anammox and denitrification to nitrogen removal operational problems that were difficult to predict at the beginning of operation such as sudden exposure to high concentrations of heavy metals and failure of the influent supply system were encountered during reactor operation and corresponding strategies were suggested the nitrogen removal performance in the pilot scale reactor was evaluated for 285 d 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor description the two stage pn a system was designed using an acrylic cylinder reactor with an effective volume of 100 l each fig 1 each reactor was operated in continuous stirred tank reactor cstr mode with 200 rpm of mixing speed the temperature was maintained at 30 c by using a thermostat the influent was continuously pumped into the pn reactor through a peristaltic pump and the do concentration was adjusted to 2 3 mgo2 l using an air regulator dwyer rma 21 ssv flow meter the pn effluent was pumped out through a 400 l storage tank into the anammox reactor the prepared pva alginate carriers were inoculated into each reactor at a packing ratio of 30 v v to prevent the wash out of the pva alginate carriers a stainless steel mesh with a pore size of 2 mm was installed at the effluent ports of the reactor 2 2 characteristics of reject water and seed sludge reject water was collected from the dewatering facility of anaerobic digested sludge at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in gyeongsan si south korea the composition and characteristics of the reject water were as follows 389 8 857 7 mg l nh4 n 0 0 6 mg l no2 n 0 1 14 2 mg l no3 n 32 5 120 1 mg l suspended solids ss 1860 3245 mg l caco3 152 348 mg l chemical oxygen

to nitrogen c n ratio was 0 3 0 12 and the influent hco3 nh4 n ratio was 1 0 0 04 the seed sludge in each reactor was collected from the return line of the a2 o process at the wwtp the a2 o process was operated to treat low ammonium concentrations 32 5 mg l based on traditional nitrification and denitrification 2 3 operational conditions the pn reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h for 285 d the operation of the anammox reactor was classified into the following four periods according to the appearance of the anammox reaction and major operating variables period i 1 111 d anammox microorganisms were selectively cultivated from activated sludge the pn effluent was diluted with tap water to maintain an influent nitrite concentration below 50 mg l it was applied as a shortening strategy of hrt to accelerate the cultivation of anammox microorganisms the start up period was evaluated based on the stoichiometric substrate consumption ratio suggested by strous et al 35 subsequently the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated by a stepwise decrease in the dilution factor period ii 112 177 d malfunction of the dilution system of the pn effluent resulted in a sharp increase in the influent nitrite and anammox activity was rapidly inhibited to stabilize the activity the influent dilution system employed in period i was applied again to dilute the nitrite concentration after that the dilution factor gradually decreased with the recovery of anammox activity period iii 178 242 d with the stabilization of anammox activity pn effluent was supplied without dilution and the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated period iv 243 285 d ferric chloride was temporarily used to reduce the water content of the cake in the dewatering facility therefore high concentrations of heavy metals were detected in reject water which considerably deteriorated the pn efficiency to recover the performance the reactor operation was switched to fed batch mode for 15 d subsequently the nitrogen removal performance in the continuous mode with active stabilization was re evaluated in each period the activity rates of the anammox and denitrifiers and their respective contributions to the total nitrogen removal rate nrr were calculated using the following modified eqs 3 5 7 36 the specific growth rate μ was calculated based on anammox activity over time according

preparation of pva alginate carriers the preparation of pva alginate carriers with the addition of a foaming agent has been described in a previous study 33 briefly a solution of 15 w v pva and 2 0 w v sodium alginate was prepared in distilled water and autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min the pva alginate solution was slowly mixed with activated sludge to which nahco3 0 3 and 0 6 w v was added this mixture was then sequentially immersed in a saturated h3bo3 cacl2 solution and orthophosphate solution for 2 h and 1 h respectively using a peristaltic pump finally the resultant pva alginate carriers were washed with distilled water the size of the carriers was maintained at 4 3 0 4 mm the characteristics of the pva alginate carrier according to the content of nahco3 are described in table s1 2 4 2 preliminary test pn efficiency according to the foaming agent content the effect of the dense structure of the pva alginate carrier surface on pn efficiency was first investigated pva alginate with 0 0 15 and 0 3 w v nahco3 was prepared and each carrier was added to a 1 l reactor at a packing ratio of 30 the reject water was used as the influent the do concentration was set at 2 3 mg l and the ammonium conversion efficiency ace and nitritation efficiency were investigated in cstr mode for 52 d 2 5 physicochemical analysis liquor samples of 50 ml were periodically collected and filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size filter the nitrate concentration was determined by ion chromatography dionex dx 120 thermo scientific usa the concentrations of ammonium nitrite cod ss and caco3 for alkalinity were determined according to standard methods 37 the cross section and surface of the carriers were examined by scanning electron microscopy sem xl30 esem feg fei company eindhoven the netherlands specific anammox activity was determined using a batch assay 7 the detailed experimental procedures are described in supplementary information s1 heavy metals were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer instrument optima 8300 perkinelmer usa bulk do in the reactor was measured using an ldo probe hach usa the do that penetrated the pva alginate carrier was analyzed using an oxygen microsensor usox 50 unisense denmark before measurement bulk do was maintained at different concentrations of 2 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 mgo2 l by controlling the argon and air gas purging intensities the correlations between nitrogen removal performance and operating variables were analyzed by pearson s correlation analysis using spss 25 ibm usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the pn using pva alginate carrier 3 1 1 effect of the foaming agent content on the pn laboratory scale study table 1 shows the images of the cross section and surface of pva carriers with 0 0 15 and 0 3 w v foaming agents the outer layer between 30 and 60 μm of the pva alginate carrier prepared without the foaming agent was found to be composed of a non porous structure unlike the inner layer this structure adversely affects oxygen penetration into the interior of the carrier under various bulk do conditions the concentration of do that could penetrate from the outer layer to the interior of the carrier decreased sharply fig s1 at 2 mgo2 l bulk do the concentration of penetrated do to a depth of 50 μm was 0 97 0 1 mgo2 l this was considered a limiting factor that not only inhibited the growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob inside the carrier but also required excessive aeration energy during the pn process to improve pn efficiency using pva alginate a foaming agent was added to the existing pva alginate carrier the porosity of the carrier was found to improve with the addition of the foaming agent and this improvement was clearly confirmed in the image of the pva alginate carrier surface to investigate the effect of the porous structure in the outer layer of the pva alginate carrier on pn efficiency a laboratory scale reactor was operated and the results are presented in fig 2 the inhibition of aob activity observed during the preparation of the pva alginate carrier was rapidly restored after 3 d of operation as shown in fig s2 the no2 n nox n ratio in the effluent was 0 92 0 12 therefore successful nitritation could be achieved under all conditions however the ace exhibited a distinct on the 9th day of operation the aces achieved with 0 0 15 and 0 3 w v foaming agents were 26 1 37 9 and 49 1 respectively thereafter the ace remained stable for the operation the effect of adding the foaming agent to the pva alginate on pn efficiency was investigated for the first time in this study the strength of the carrier was determined when the pva alginate solution was immersed in a h3bo3 cacl2 solution 38 at this time the dissolved nahco3 was converted to co2 gas under acidic conditions discharged to the outside of the carrier and a gas channel was formed consequently a porous structure could be formed in the outer layer of the carrier eventually the oxygen permeability efficiency of the carrier was improved contributing to an increase in the pn efficiency this gas channel contributes to the diffusion of the substrate into the carrier 39 however excessive gas channel formation causes a loss of immobilized microorganisms in a previous study 0 6 w v foaming agent resulted in excessive loss of microorganisms immobilized in pva 33 therefore the optimal foaming agent content for the pn was determined which was verified as 0 3 w v in the pilot study 3 1 2 pn for pretreatment of the reject water pilot scale study the pilot scale pn reactor was operated for 285 d based on the operating parameters determined in the laboratory scale reactor fig 3 during the entire operating period the influent ammonium concentration fluctuated significantly from 389 8 to 857 7 mg l and the corresponding influent nitrogen loading rate nlr was 0 6 to 1 8 kg m3 d although the activity of aob was inhibited in the pva alginate preparation process the ace rapidly recovered from 12 8 at the beginning of the operation to 50 within 20 d of operation the ammonium to nitrite ratio nar in the effluent was improved to 1 02 with an increase in pn efficiency subsequently a stable ace of 49 3 2 7 and nar of 0 92 0 1 in the effluent were achieved even with a fluctuating influent nitrogen load moreover even though activated sludge dominated by nitrification was used as the inoculum nitrate production was effectively suppressed during the operation the nitrate concentration in the effluent was 5 1 4 5 mg l and the no2 nox ratio was 0 96 0 1 however the pn efficiency decreased sharply during 243 251 d of operation owing to a variable that was difficult to predict in situ this is discussed further in section 3 4 the nar in the effluent showed a high correlation with the influent and removed hco3 nh3 n ratios p 0 01 the aob requires 2 mol of hco3 to oxidize 1 mol of nh3 n therefore the characteristics of the reject water with approximately 50 alkalinity than that required for complete nitrification were suitable for the pn process for this reason the control of the bicarbonate concentration in the influent was also used as a means to improve the nar 40 in addition bicarbonate selectively inhibited the growth of nob species and contributed to further improving the stability of the pn process 41 when stable pn was achieved during the operation the influent and removed hco3 nh3 n ratios calculated in this study were 1 04 0 04 and 1 91 0 2 respectively fig s3 however the removed hco3 nh3 n ratio increased to 2 4 0 2 with the increase in effluent alkalinity from 336 7 24 6 to 1270 56 6 mgcaco3 l when the abovementioned pn efficiency deteriorated the ph of the effluent increased to 8 9 which can be explained by the effect of alkalinity stripping the low partial pressure of co2 in the aerated solution 0 035 of the atmospheric co2 concentration limits its dissolution according to henry s law in an aeration system rising air bubbles strip more inorganic carbon than the amount that can be transferred from the gas to the liquid phase 42 this phenomenon is accelerated with the increase in residual alkalinity concentration and induces an increase in ph 6 43 chemical equilibrium based on the ph in high stream wastewater governs the formation of free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna 21 the potential for selective inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob by fa and fna has been reported previously anthonisen et al 44 found that nob was selectively inhibited under 0 1 1 0 mgnh3 l fa and 0 011 0 07 mghno2 l fna also the growth of nob was more sensitive to fna distribution than that of aob thus selective growth of aob can be achieved 45 based on this potential a ph control strategy has been applied for the selective inhibition of nob 46 in the present study fa and fna concentrations could be maintained at 3 5 1 4 and 0 05 0 02 mg l respectively which are higher than the threshold concentrations for nob inhibition without a ph control system even a sharp increase in ph caused by operational problems temporarily resulted in high fa concentrations of 193 4 64 1 mg l which inhibited aob activity this indicated that high fa concentrations along with transient exposure to heavy metals reduced the ace the low do permeability of the pva alginate carrier resulted in a synergistic effect on the selective inhibition of nob when the threshold concentration of fa and fna for nob activity are maintained the oxygen affinity of aob is higher than that of nob 5 therefore low do concentrations 0 3 mg l promoted the selective inhibition of nob 47 thus the whole cell entrapment technique has the advantage of achieving effective pn in this study the appropriate permeability of do into the pva alginate carrier was controlled by adding a foaming agent which was then verified by laboratory and pilot scale reactor operation 3 2 nitrogen removal performance in anammox reactor pilot scale study fig 4 shows the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox pilot reactor for 285 d fig 4a and b show the profiles of the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the influent and effluent and fig 4c shows the contribution of anammox and denitrifiers to the nrr over the operation time 3 2 1 start up period i during period i the influent was diluted approximately five fold to maintain the nitrite concentration below the value that inhibits anammox activity which was 41 9 8 3 mg l the threshold concentration for anammox activity was determined in a previous study and the concentration was below 50 mg l 6 in addition the hrt was reduced to 6 h to improve the anammox cultivation rate at the beginning of the operation the ammonium concentration in the effluent was higher than that in the influent fig 4a but the removal efficiency of nitrite gradually increased over time and almost all of the nitrite was removed fig 4b thereafter the nitrite removal efficiency gradually decreased from the point at which ammonium was removed the stoichiometric ratio of consumed nh4 n consumed no3 n produced no3 n for anammox was 1 1 32 0 26 35 after 42 d of operation a no2 n nh4 n consumption ratio 1 25 0 1 similar to this stoichiometric ratio was achieved fig s4 nevertheless the accumulation of nitrate which is a reaction by product of anammox did not occur 0 35 0 2 mg l in the effluent until the 49th day of operation the ratio of nitrate produced to ammonium consumed was 0 15 0 02 after 49 d with the stabilization of anammox activity the dilution factor of the influent decreased stepwise the nlr increased to 0 67 kg m3 d and an nrr of 0 52 0 02 kg m3 d was achieved depending on the presence of available organic matter which acts as an electron donor the denitrification mechanism can be classified as exogenous and endogenous denitrification 48 endogenous denitrification requires microbial intracellular storage compounds such as polyhydroxyalkanoates polyphosphates and polysaccharides as carbon sources to reduce nox 49 in this mechanism denitrification causes cell lysis which results in the release of soluble microbial organics and ammonium 50 this characteristic was clearly revealed by the contribution of denitrification to the nrr at the beginning of the operation the influent nitrite was almost completely consumed by denitrification and its contribution to the nrr was approximately 100 this resulted in a higher concentration of ammonium in the effluent than in the influent due to cell lysis fig 4c denitrifiers and anammox bacteria compete with each other for nitrite consumption but when the substrate affinity of the anammox for the nitrite becomes higher than that of denitrifiers the nitrite is mainly removed by anammox microorganisms 51 therefore rapidly removing the by products of cell lysis may be a means to promote the dominance of anammox microorganisms in this study a strategy to decrease the hrt using a whole cell entrapment technique was applied to selectively reduce the substrate affinity of denitrifiers this accelerated the removal of the by products of cell lysis and the contribution of anammox to the nrr from the 28th day of operation could be rapidly improved this facilitated the growth of anammox microorganisms with an increase of the nlr the specific growth rate was 0 03 d which is equivalent to a doubling time td of 23 1 d the hrt reduction strategy for selective cultivation of anammox bacteria from activated sludge has been successfully applied previously 52 53 to decrease the hrt continuous feeding in the cstr mode has engineering advantages over the fed batch modes as used in sequencing batch reactors this is because this operation facilitates the rapid dilution of a cell lysis by product and the exponential growth of anammox bacteria however owing to the slow growth rate of anammox bacteria applying an hrt shorter than one day in suspended growth based anammox processes results in several difficulties 54 therefore the application of whole cell entrapment with high flexibility in hrt control is considered a useful technology in terms of reducing the start up period in the anammox process in addition the long term stability of the pva alginate carrier using a foaming agent was verified based on in situ operation a comparison of the start up period in this study with that in the literature is described in detail in section 3 3 3 2 2 long term operation including recovery of anammox microorganism activity periods ii iv during period ii the concentration of nitrite in the influent increased rapidly to 224 0 13 4 mg l due to a failure in the influent dilution system because of this the activity of the anammox microorganisms was reduced and nitrite in the reactor accumulated up to 82 mg l during this period total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre decreased from 81 6 0 8 to 10 0 4 9 to recover the anammox activity the influent nitrite concentration was adjusted to 50 mg l after two weeks the anammox activity improved further and the tnre increased to 80 4 1 2 with the stabilization of the anammox activity during period iii the pn effluent was introduced without diluting the influent and the nlr increased from 0 92 to 1 48 kg m3 d according to the fluctuation in the influent nitrogen load nevertheless an nrr of up to 1 2 kg m3 d was achieved with a tnre of 77 0 1 6 this improved the growth rate of anammox microorganisms to 0 11 d equivalent to a td value of 6 13 d this was higher than the value reported in the study in which the trial run period was evaluated using pva alginate carrier 55 compared to periods i and ii the slight decrease in tnre during period iii was attributed to the difference in the contribution of denitrification to tnre which is described in more detail in section 3 2 3 during period iv the continuous operation was temporarily switched to fed batch mode because a high concentration of heavy metals was detected in the reject water when the pn process became stable the reactor was operated in continuous mode again on the 257th day of operation and the nitrogen removal performance by anammox rapidly recovered after 5 d of operation in continuous mode the tnre recovered to 76 9 3 5 and nrr of 0 89 0 06 kg m3 d was stably achieved under an nlr of 1 2 0 04 kg m3 d two variables nitrite and heavy metal concentrations that were difficult to predict during the pilot scale operation were found to deteriorate the process performance the effects of these two variables in the two stage pn a process are comprehensively evaluated in section 3 3 3 2 3 statistical analysis of variables affecting nitrogen removal performance variables affecting the tnre during the two stage pn a process were statistically analyzed based on long term operation data table 2 the tnre was positively correlated with effluent no3 n concentrations r 0 660 and negatively correlated with the produced no3 n nh3 n r 0 734 these results indicate that the coexistence of anammox and denitrification can contribute to improving the tnre fig 5 shows the correlation between the produced no3 n nh3 n and tnre the decrease in the produced no3 n nh3 n improved the tnre which was inversely proportional to the no3 n concentration in the effluent in this study activated sludge was used as the seeding sludge for the anammox process therefore the contribution of denitrification to nitrogen removal was high at the beginning of the operation but it gradually decreased and almost all the nitrogen was removed by the anammox bacteria after 170 d of operation this could be explained by the fact that the tnre in periods iii and iv decreased slightly compared with that in periods i and ii the two stage pn a had a lower achievable tnre than that of the single stage pn a 56 this could be caused by further removal of nitrate which is a by product of anammox through denitrification to improve the tnre in the two stage pn a process a combination of the anammox and sulfur oxidation denitrification sod processes has been studied 57 in contrast compared to the single stage process two stage pn a is advantageous in terms of the nrr which may contribute to a compact reactor 58 therefore as the treated reject water is returned to the sewage treatment plant and treated below the discharged water quality standard the conversion to a single stage process or combination with additional processes such as the sod may be comprehensively considered according to the field requirements 3 3 unexpected inhibitors affecting the two stage pn a process in the field previously the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria from activated sludge was mainly performed at the laboratory scale where various operating parameters influent nitrogen concentration deoxygenation using n2 or ar co2 purging systems ph control and trace elements were strictly limited 24 59 60 however these limiting conditions are difficult to artificially control under field conditions anammox bacteria have a lower tolerance to nitrite inhibition nitrite in the reactor may accumulate owing to the fluctuation of influent nitrogen from 389 8 to 857 7 mg l or the failure of the treatment scheme pn or dilution system the threshold concentration of nitrite for anammox activity has a wide range from 50 to 600 mg l 7 61 in this study the tnre decreased with nitrite accumulation above 30 mg l and nitrite at 82 mg l decreased the tnre by 10 0 4 9 in contrast in the batch experiment anammox activity was inhibited when exposed to 60 mg l table s2 the effect of nitrite concentration on anammox activity in batch experiments and continuous systems was investigated as a function of exposure time lotti et al 62 investigated the effect of nitrite exposure time 1 and 24 h on anammox activity and reported that an increase in exposure time accelerated activity inhibition therefore if anammox inhibition of nitrite is confirmed a rapid follow up measure to reduce nitrite concentration is required in this study a dilution system using tap water was applied however in a larger bioreactor a mixture of rejected water and pn effluent could be a more suitable alternative all the heavy metals determined during period i were below the inhibitory level during period iv ferric chloride was temporarily used to control the water content of the anaerobically digested sludge in the dewatering system therefore as shown in table s3 in addition to ferric ion aluminum zinc and nickel were detected above the inhibition level in particular ferric ion fe3 and aluminum were detected at 61 4 3 5 and 213 0 10 3 mg l respectively the addition of 3 7 mg l ferric ions increased anammox activity five fold but concentrations exceeding 30 mg l caused severe inhibition 63 aluminum and ferric ion concentrations of 30 mg l and 12 4 mg l respectively also inhibited aob activity 64 the fluctuation in heavy metal concentration exacerbated the two stage pn a process as a rapid follow up measure the heavy metals accumulated in the pn reactor were rapidly washed with tap water and a fed batch mode was temporarily applied the pn performance was recovered after 10 d a similar strategy was applied in the anammox reactor and the two stage pn a system was stabilized after 14 d in the two stage pn a process when nitrogen removal performance deteriorates owing to inhibitors that are difficult to predict in the field a rapid follow up measure to alleviate the effect of inhibitors is required thus the practicality of whole cell entrapment technology that facilitates the rapid separation of inoculated microorganisms from inhibitors might contribute to improving the stability of the two stage pn a process 3 4 comparison of studies on the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria from activated sludge most previous studies on the cultivation of anammox microorganisms from activated sludge have been conducted under limited operating conditions in laboratory scale reactors as shown in table 3 the influent composition i e nitrogen and trace elements based on anammox stoichiometry was supplied from synthetic wastewater the start up period of the anammox process varied from 60 to 204 d based on the type of inoculum sludge however the addition of an active agent of enzymes such as fe3 that can promote the anammox metabolic activity reduced this period to 30 d 28 in addition many researchers have verified that a short hrt can decrease the start up period 55 65 however many studies have rarely been conducted on the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria under field conditions where controlling the abovementioned environmental factors is difficult in addition for the start up period of the anammox process using moving bed based biocarriers a long start up period of 79 days was required for the attachment of anammox microorganisms and an hrt of 1 5 d or more was required 66 this will indicate that the whole cell immobilization technique using pva alginate can be more beneficial in shortening the start up period of the pn a process in this study anammox bacteria was successfully cultivated for 42 d in a pilot reactor and raw reject water was used as the influent the findings of this study indicate the applicability of the whole cell entrapment technology for the selective cultivation of anammox bacteria in particular endogenous denitrification during the initial stage of operation was found to be the main cause of the prolonged start up period which indicates that the strategy of reducing the hrt was effective in addition the stability of the pva alginate carrier during long term operation for 400 days could be confirmed in a previous study on a laboratory scale 67 and its practicality could be verified as it was applied stably for 285 days even under field conditions where various variables had to be considered 4 conclusions the start up period of the two stage pn a process was evaluated using activated sludge as the sole inoculum source in a pilot scale reactor a foaming agent content of 0 3 w v improved the permeability of the pva alginate carrier which contributed to improving the pn efficiency from 26 1 2 1 to 49 1 1 5 the contribution of endogenous denitrification to nitrogen removal at the initial stage of operation was estimated to be 95 6 2 9 which was the main cause of the prolonged start up period of pn a and the strategy of reducing the hrt effectively reduced the start up period therefore nitrogen removal by pn a was successfully achieved within 42 d of operation and then an nrr of 1 1 0 1 kg m3 d was stably achieved under nlr conditions of 1 4 0 1 kg m3 d with a tnre of 80 4 1 2 the process performance through long term operation was verified by appropriately responding to process inhibitors that are difficult to predict in the field credit authorship contribution statement

12967,several wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide have documented the occurrence of filamentous bulking in full scale systems despite the efforts made for filamentous bulking control the activated sludge models asm can neither describe nor predict filamentous bulking at wwtps this research aims to expand the asm no 1 to be able to describe filamentous bulking sludge and to model the effects of incorporating an aerobic selector on filamentous bulking four theories hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable organics theory kinetic selection theory substrate diffusion limitation theory and filamentous backbone theory were combined to expand the asm1 the results showed that this combination was successful to distinguish between the substrate uptake by filamentous organisms and by floc forming organisms moreover the concentrations of filamentous and floc forming organisms inside the reactor were converted to a filamentous score that predicted the outcome of filamentous bulking filamentous bulking would occur if the filamentous score was higher than 3 in a range of 1 6 as a case study the fuhais wwtp in jordan was modelled using the expanded asm1 filamentous model and the filamentous score of 4 2 was in accordance to the visually observed bulking however when an aerobic selector with 3 compartments would be added before the aeration tank the filamentous score decreased to 1 5 the selector changed the hydraulic behaviour from a completely mixed mode to a plug flow mode which created a substrate gradient in the model making the floc forming organisms to outcompete the

occurrence of filamentous bulking in full scale systems a study done by deepnarain et al 1 showed that 5 out of 7 wwtps surveyed in south africa had a sludge volume index svi larger than 150 ml g 1 therefore having a poor settling efficiency in another study it was observed that 25 of the activated sludge wwtps in france are suffering from sludge bulking 2 besides 50 of wwtps in northern china are affected by sludge bulking 3 the persistence of this problem can partly be explained by the fact that filamentous bacteria may cause sludge bulking problems even when they do not represent the dominant metabolic bacterial group in the activated sludge even if filamentous bacteria have a volume fraction less than the floc forming bacteria they can cause sludge bulking 4 6 as the abundance of filamentous organisms increases the floc structure becomes open affecting sludge settleability however a minimum presence of filamentous bacteria is also essential in the formation of the floc forming bacteria because filamentous microorganisms form the backbone of the floc and keep the floc in a good structure and able to easily settle 7 9 wang et al 10 showed that as svi increases from 76 to 275 ml g 1 the filamentous abundance increased from few score 1 to abundant score 5 as the filamentous concentration increases the settling properties become worse leading to the washout of the activated sludge 10 11 overall the uncontrolled growth of filamentous bacteria disrupts the settling properties of the activated sludge systems affecting the performance of the wwtps filamentous bulking can be controlled by adding a selector tank which can be aerobic anaerobic or anoxic a selector is a small tank and its volume is usually not larger than 10 of the aeration tank volume placed before the aeration basin commonly a selector tank receives the return of activated sludge ras and the influent of the wwtp qinf therefore creating a strong substrate concentration gradient that mimics the hydraulic conditions observed in plug flow reactors this strong gradient encourages the floc forming organisms to grow faster than filamentous organisms while degrading the soluble substrate in the system as a result the filamentous microorganism growth is hindered and bulking is prevented 6 12 13 the kinetic selection theory kst substrate diffusion limitation theory sdl hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable organics theory hsbo and filamentous backbone theory fbt are essential for understanding the relation between filamentous and floc forming organisms according to the kst that uses the monod expression 14 floc forming and filamentous organisms have different maximum growth rates μmax and affinity constants ks consequently filamentous organisms have higher growth rates at low substrate concentrations and floc formers have higher growth rates at high substrate concentrations 6 in contrast the sdl assumes that floc formers and filamentous microorganisms have the same kinetics however at low substrate concentration the diffusion limitation causes a very low substrate concentration inside the flocs for the floc forming organisms therefore it becomes hard for floc forming organisms to access the substrate while the filamentous organisms can readily uptake substrate due to their morphology so in the sdl case bulking occurs due to differences in morphology rather than differences in kinetic rates as in the kst nevertheless the driving force is the same which is a low substrate gradient resulting in a low concentration 15 the hsbo theory proposed by kappeler gujer 4 and experimentally verified by martins et al 16 explains that slowly biodegradable substrate is taken up and incorporated inside the sludge floc and then hydrolyzed the hydrolyzed products are consumed by the floc forming organisms therefore giving an advantage for floc forming organisms over filamentous organisms another theory is the fbt that describes the formation of activated sludge flocs by two processes the first step which depends on the bioflocculation of floc forming organisms is called microstructure floc formation these flocs are spherical in shape and compact but are weak then the second step is the formation of macrostructure flocs where the filamentous bacteria form a backbone inside the flocs and with the help of extracellular polymeric substances the floc forming bacteria become firmly attached 8 kappleler gujer 4 developed a mathematical model for aerobic bulking however they did not include the fbt theory cenens et al and lou reyes 8 17 incorporated the fbt in their model by defining a parameter called α which is defined as the rate of incorporation of filamentous bacteria into flocs one of the limitations of this model is that it does not consider the difference in kinetics between free filaments and incorporated filaments these theories are important in understanding the kinetics of filamentous organisms and could be combined into one mathematical model to improve the description of filamentous bulking in this study asm1 is expanded to predict filamentous bulking occurrence asm1 was chosen as it is considered a reference model for wwtp modelling in the research and industrial communities and is considered to be state of the art for activated sludge modelling 18 the objective of this study is therefore to modify and expand the asm1 to describe the filamentous bulking occurrence by incorporating four important theories the kst and sdl theories were combined to differentiate between the substrate uptake rate by free filamentous organisms and by floc forming organisms the hsbo theory was used to differentiate between the different substrate uptake rates readily soluble organics and slowly biodegradable organics finally the fbt was used to describe the amount of filaments that are responsible for the backbone of the floc forming bacteria this paper shows that the combination of the four important theories is important in modelling wwtps that are prone to filamentous bulking as other asm models cannot predict the occurrence of filamentous bulking 2 materials and methods 2 1 expanding asm1 to include filamentous bulking the asm1 was adjusted to distinguish between free filamentous i e outside the flocs organisms and floc forming organisms the first step to adjust the model was to split the heterotrophs into two organisms floc forming organisms xfloc and free filamentous organisms xffil the second step was to differentiate between the growth rates and substrate uptake rates of both organisms by combining the hsbo and the kst and sdl theories this was done by assigning different values of ks for the free filamentous and floc forming organisms while μmax values were the same for both organisms changing ks and keeping μmax constant allows the model to only differentiate between free filamentous and floc forming bacteria based on the substrate concentration available it was also important to differentiate between how both organisms take up different substrates therefore another component was defined which is the soluble substrate produced by the hydrolysis of particulate substrates inside the floc ss h free filamentous organisms have high affinity to uptake the soluble substrate from the influent ss when the substrate concentration is low and floc forming organisms show higher uptake rates for ss when the substrate concentration is high this was translated into the model by giving higher ks values to floc forming organisms than free filamentous organisms for ss consumption on the other hand floc forming organisms are expected to consume ss h at a higher rate than free filamentous organisms since floc formers are the ones hydrolyzing xs into ss h however free filamentous bacteria can still consume some of the ss h but only after the hydrolyzed substrate has diffused out of the floc this was translated into the model by giving lower ks values for floc formers for consuming ss h than for free filamentous bacteria fig 1 finally according to the literature filamentous organisms can only perform denitrification till nitrite 6 26 and therefore it was considered that free filamentous organisms do not contribute to the denitrification process therefore anoxic growth in the filamentous model was only performed by floc forming organisms to incorporate the fbt into the model the fraction of filamentous bacteria that are incorporated inside the floc in relation to the total floc forming organisms was estimated using the microscopic picture from jenkins et al 19 fig 2 qgis software 20 was used to measure the area of filamentous bacteria inside the flocs of each picture and relate this area to the total area of floc forming organisms then the model was further developed to check if filamentous bulking occurs or not this was also done using the microscopic pictures from jenkins et al 19 and the qgis software to develop a relationship between the ratio of total filamentous organisms both inside and outside the flocs to total non filamentous organisms and the filamentous score table the distinguishing between free filaments filaments incorporated inside the flocs and the flocs are presented in detail in annex a all these modifications were implemented in the asm1 model resulting in the filamentous model expanded asm1 matrix table 1 and new stoichiometric and kinetic parameters table 2 the other stoichiometric and kinetic parameters and the fuhais influent data were kept the same as in asm1 2 2 asm1 for modelling the fuhais wwtp the software programs used were the computer program for the identification and simulation of aquatic systems aquasim 22 qgis 3 14 0 20 and microsoft excel worksheets aquasim software was used because it is designed to allow the users to easily build their models define the compartments and the components and define the links between compartments qgis was used to calculate surface area ratios from some microscopic pictures asm1 was used to model the fuhais wwtp in aquasim fig 3 the fuhais wwtp is a municipal plant located in fuhais town balqa governorate jordan which has an average inflow of 3100 m3 d 1 cod of 770 mg l 1 and tn of 80 mg l 1 more information about the operating conditions at the fuhais wwtp is presented in annex b steady state conditions are considered sufficient at this stage to integrate the model and assess the interactions among the microbial populations as such steady state simulations were conducted using empirical data and the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters that are recommended by henze et al 21 annex c to perform these simulations tcod and tn fractionation were done table 3 and the calculations are presented in annex d note that the do in the modelled reactor was maintained to be around 1 0 mg l 1 and the clarifier is assumed to be 99 99 efficient in removing solids with no biological reactions taking place 2 3 modelling an aerobic selector to control filamentous bulking sludge the fuhais wwtp has a 500 m3 equalization tank used for temporary storage during peak inflow rates this tank was converted to an aerobic selector in the aquasim fig 4 the matrix of the filamentous model table 1 was used while modelling the selector modelled with a variation in the number of compartments each compartment of the selector was added as a new tank in aquasim to simulate the plug flow effect of an aerobic selector the aerobic selector was simulated with 1 2 3 and 4 compartments for three different sets of input data the first set of input data was for the 14th of april 2020 when the plant reported the lowest cod concentration 170 mg l 1 in the influent for the year 2020 the second set of data was the average plant data the third set of data was for the 1st june 2020 when the plant reported the highest cod concentration 1550 mg l 1 in the influent for the year 2020 3 results 3 1 expanding asm1 to include filamentous bulking the filamentous model was further developed to include filamentous bulking the fraction of filamentous bacteria in between the floc forming organisms ff was calculated for each microscopic picture that is shown in fig 2 and documented in table 4 in microscopic picture 2 f it was not possible to distinguish between filaments that were inside the flocs as all the filamentous organisms spread out from the floc structure therefore ff was only calculated for microscopic pictures 2 a to 2 e also the ratio of total filamentous bacteria to total non filamentous bacteria fil nfil in each microscopic picture was calculated table 4 the relation between the fil nfil and the filamentous score was plotted and the exponential trendline with an r2 of 0 99 was obtained resulting in eq 1 filamentous score equation 1 filamentous score ln fil nfil ln 0 0068 1 0482 furthermore from the ff values in table 4 an average ff value was calculated which is 0 03 this value was used in the filamentous model to account for the filaments that are inside the flocs in accordance with the fbt two new equations were added to aquasim as formula variables to define the real concentrations of the total filamentous organisms and non filamentous organisms after considering the ff ratio eqs 2 and 3 xnfil is the total amount of the non filamentous organisms without the filaments that act as the backbone of the floc structure and the xtfil is the total amount of filamentous organisms in the modelled reactor including the filaments that serve as the backbone of the floc forming organisms then the fil nfil ratio is calculated based on eq 4 expression for total non filamentous organisms concentration in the modelled reactor 2 x nfil x floc ff x floc expression for total filamentous organisms concentration in the modelled reactor 3 x tfil x ffil ff x floc expression for fil nfil 4 fil nfil x tfil x nfil finally the output from the filamentous model is a ratio between filaments and non filaments to assess if filamentous bulking occurs or not the fil nfil is converted to a numerical value that corresponds to the filamentous score using eq 1 according to jenkins et al 19 if the filamentous score is less than 3 filamentous organisms present in the reactor are not sufficient to cause filamentous bulking therefore if the output of the filamentous model has a filamentous score that is higher than 3 it can be concluded that filamentous bulking is most likely to occur at the plant 3 2 the output of asm1 and filamentous model the aquasim simulation outputs mainly focus on the steady state results of the model table 5 in the asm1 the concentration of filamentous and non filamentous heterotrophs is represented as one organism however in the filamentous model it is represented as two organisms filaments and non filaments the sum of the filamentous organisms concentration and the non filamentous organisms concentration in the filamentous model is approximately equal to the concentration of the heterotrophs in asm1 because the total influent biodegradable substrate and the yield for both organisms are the same for both models the nitrate concentration in asm1 is slightly lower than in the filamentous model showing that the denitrification anoxic growth rate is marginally faster in asm1 than in the filamentous model from the filamentous model results the fil nfil ratio was 0 55 and the filamentous score was 4 2 which is in line with the observation that the fuhais wwtp is suffering from filamentous bulking 3 3 effect of an aerobic selector to control filamentous bulking sludge using the filamentous model a relationship exists between the number of selector compartments and the occurrence of filamentous bulking fig 5 the overall concentration of floc forming organisms increases and the overall concentration of filamentous organisms decreases as the number of compartments increases in the 500 m3 aerobic selector the sludge loading rates for each compartment is presented in annex e for the soluble substrate the trend observed was a steep decrease from the first compartment to the second compartment then ss slightly decreases from one compartment to the other until reaching a negligible value in the aeration tank table 6 the xs gradually decreases from one compartment to the other until reaching around 5 5 mg l 1 in the modelled reactor ss h produced inside the floc is consumed therefore leaving the concentration of ss h in all the selector compartments and the modelled reactor less than 0 5 mg l 1 the concentration of floc forming organisms and filamentous organisms follow a similar trend of slightly decreasing concentrations from one compartment to the other until reaching the aeration tank the decrease in biomass concentration is expected since the substrate concentration available for microorganisms also decreases 4 discussion 4 1 asm1 vs filamentous model an important limitation of asm1 is that it is not able to predict the occurrence of bulking 23 however with the filamentous model filamentous bulking can be predicted because the heterotrophs as well as the substrate were changed to account for different organisms floc formers and free filaments and different substrates ss and ss h the filamentous model can be the first step for modelling wwtps in the design and or operational stages to prevent or control problems associated with filamentous bulking also the filamentous model is considered a grey box model like the asm1 and requires the same amount of data needed as the asm1 generally the filamentous model focuses on differences of substrates to model the filamentous bulking sludge however the filamentous model can be further developed to take into account how dissolved oxygen aeration affects filamentous bulking sludge the filamentous model presented in this paper is a conceptual model that needs to be further calibrated and validated to be used in practical applications nitrates are present in the modelled reactor for both models asm1 and filamentous model meaning that the denitrification process is slow this is because the tank is an aerobic reactor with an average do concentration of 1 mg l 1 therefore with the presence of oxygen the denitrification process becomes very slow as mentioned by skiba 27 the average tn for january till november 2020 in the fuhais wwtp s effluent stream is 12 mg l 1 but it is noticed that the tn in the effluent stream of the fuhais wwtp is fluctuating between 2 8 mg l 1 and 55 mg l 1 likewise the nitrate concentration at the fuhais wwtp fluctuates this large range can be explained by the fact that the do in the fuhais wwtp is also fluctuating reaching minimum values of almost 0 1 mg l 1 and maximum values of 5 mg l 1 therefore the nitrification and denitrification processes are unstable in the reactors at the fuhais wwtp however when the do of the plant is having an average value of 1 mg l 1 it is expected to have high nitrate concentration as the denitrification process is slow and this is what the asm1 and filamentous model showed when the do in the model is 1 mg l 1 the denitrification oxygen inhibition factor is 0 20 and the nitrification oxygen inhibition factor is 0 71 showing that at this do value the denitrification process is slowed down the do in the reactors can be decreased to 0 5 mg l 1 to have an acceptable rate for nitrification and denitrification at the same time at do value of 0 5 mg l 1 the nitrification oxygen inhibition factor will be 0 56 and the denitrification oxygen inhibition factor will be 0 33 however maintaining a low oxygen concentration less than 1 1 mg l 1 is associated with increasing the growth of filamentous organisms and therefore it increases the chances that filamentous bulking occurs as described by nittami et al 28 therefore for the filamentous model to assess filamentous bulking under low dissolved oxygen concentration it should differentiate between the behaviour of floc forming organisms and filamentous organisms under different do values this can be further modified in the filamentous model by changing the values of kohf and kohfil another way to include denitrification is intermittently changing the do in the tanks to simultaneously have higher rates of nitrification and denitrification in a study done by zhao et al 29 it was shown that complete nitrification can be achieved at very low do concentrations 0 0 0 8 mg l 1 given that the organic loading rate is low and the srt is long however with intermittent aeration filamentous bulking was reported by henze et al 12 this can be tested when the filamentous model is modified to have different kohf and kohfil values as previously mentioned to ensure that filamentous bulking will not occur at the times when the do concentrations are very low in the reactor furthermore the nitrate concentration of the filamentous model is higher than the nitrate concentration of the asm1 this is because in the filamentous model the distinction between floc formers and free filaments resulted in a higher concentration of free filamentous organisms compared to floc forming organisms and the denitrification process is performed only by floc forming organisms the denitrification processes in the filamentous model are processes number 2 and 11 which are the anoxic growth of floc forming organisms by taking up the soluble substrate in the influent and the soluble substrate produced by hydrolysis the filamentous model is better to predict the nitrate concentrations than asm1 when filamentous bulking is occurring as according to literature when a plant is suffering from filamentous bulking the activated sludge can be washed out leading to the loss of denitrifiers and nitrifiers 10 11 to the authors knowledge there is not sufficient evidence in literature of modelling the denitrification process using asm1 while a plant is suffering from filamentous bulking therefore the filamentous model can be the starting point to develop a new approach that can solve the limitation for denitrification prediction while implementing the asm approach for filamentous bulking sludge 4 2 evaluation of the filamentous model theories the filamentous model uses four theories hsbo kst sdl fbt to expand the asm1 in order to describe filamentous bulking the hsbo kst and sdl theories were combined to favour the growth of floc forming organisms when the substrate concentration is high and to favour the growth of free filamentous organisms when the substrate concentration is low the combination of theories resulted in changing the ks values for floc forming organisms and free filamentous organisms however these ks values can also be interpreted as apparent mass transfer parameters that describe the diffusional resistance for example for the case of ss uptake the ss first needs to diffuse inside the floc to be consumed by floc forming organisms conversely free filamentous organisms will only consume ss directly therefore the apparent ksf is higher than the apparent ksfil to account for the diffusional resistance of ss going into the floc moreover for the case of ss h uptake the ss h first needs to diffuse outside the flocs to be consumed by free filamentous organisms conversely floc forming organisms will just consume ss h directly therefore the apparent khf is lower than the apparent khfil to account for the diffusional resistance of ss h going out of the floc on the contrary the μmax for free filamentous bacteria and floc forming bacteria was kept the same so none of them is favoured to grow faster and therefore the growth rate is only dependant on the substrate concentration the approach of changing the ks values and keeping μmax constant was the same approach used in the aerofil model developed by kappeler gujer 4 it can be concluded that the combination of the three theories was effective in distinguishing between floc forming organisms and free filamentous organisms based on the substrate uptake this is because bulking is assumed to occur due to differences in morphology according to the sdl and differences in kinetics according to the kst nevertheless the driving force is the same which is low substrate concentrations 6 15 the incorporation of fbt in the filamentous model was done by adding the ff factor that represents the fraction of filamentous bacteria that are needed inside the floc cenens et al and lou reyes 8 17 incorporated the fbt by defining a parameter called α which is defined as the rate of incorporation of filamentous bacteria into flocs one of the limitations of that model is that it does not take into account the differences in kinetics between free filaments and filaments incorporated into the flocs however the approach used in this paper takes into account the differences between the free filaments and the filaments incorporated in the flocs since the incorporated filaments are considered part of the floc forming organisms these incorporated filaments will have the same kinetics as the non filamentous bacteria nevertheless the incorporated filaments are added to the free filaments to calculate the fil nfil ratio and therefore assess the filamentous score the ff used was a constant average value that was obtained from the microscopic pictures shown in fig 2 however when the ff is plotted against each microscopic picture fig 6 the ff increases as the filamentous score increases therefore to improve the accuracy of the model ff can be defined as a function rather than a constant value 4 3 effect of an aerobic selector to control filamentous bulking sludge when an aerobic selector was added to the system the growth of non filaments over filaments was stimulated from fig 5 it is seen that the higher the number of compartments in a selector the lower the fil nfil and the filamentous score this is because the more the compartments the more the effect of plug flow so the higher the gradient of ss and xs in the selector therefore non filamentous bacteria concentration increases more than the filamentous bacteria concentration as their growth is favoured by a higher substrate concentration caused by a higher gradient while filamentous growth is favoured by low substrate concentration 6 besides the filamentous score is less than 3 for the selectors with 2 or more compartments according to jenkins et al 19 filamentous organisms are dominant and likely responsible for solid liquid separation problems when the filamentous score is 4 or higher however when the filamentous score is 3 or lower it means that filamentous organisms are present but not sufficient to account for separation problems therefore it is better to have a selector with 2 or more compartments to make sure that filamentous bulking will not occur at the fuhais wwtp furthermore according to henze et al 12 it is suggested that the number of compartments in an aerobic selector should not be less than 3 also the selector volume should not be more than 10 of the volume of the aeration tanks therefore from these analyses it is suggested to have an aerobic selector with 3 compartments to ensure that filamentous bulking will not occur at the fuhais wwtp the equalization tank at the fuhais wwtp has a volume of 500 m3 that is 7 8 of the total volume of the aeration tanks 6400 m3 the equalization tank has a length of 14 m a width of 6 m and a depth of 6 m the equalization tank at the fuhais wwtp can be changed to an aerobic selector with 3 compartments to avoid filamentous bulking as seen from table 6 there is a higher concentration gradient of ss in the selector than without it which favours the growth of floc forming bacteria over free filamentous bacteria this is due to the effect of the parameter ks in the model when ksf is high 8 gcod m 3 in the case of floc forming organisms the growth rate of flocs is favoured at high substrate concentrations plug flow reactor on the other hand when ksfil is low 1 gcod m 3 like is the case of free filamentous organisms the growth rate is favoured at low substrate concentration mixed flow reactor the selector simulates a plug flow regime therefore favouring the growth of floc forming bacteria 13 it can be concluded from fig 5 that a plant with an aerobic selector can withstand steep changes in influent better than a plant without a selector and this is consistent with the literature 24 this is because the filamentous score changed as the influent cod load changed simulations minimum cod and maximum cod when there was not a selector however when a selector was added the change in the filamentous score is negligible as the influent cod changes nevertheless going back to the fuhais wwtp plant case the filamentous score of a selector with 3 compartments did not change with very low or very high cod loads in the influent this analysis strongly supports the previously drawn conclusion to add a selector consisting of 3 compartments before the aeration tanks at the fuhais wwtp to help preventing filamentous bulking 5 conclusions 1 the asm1 model was modified by splitting the heterotrophic organisms into free filamentous organisms xffil and floc forming organisms xfloc and the soluble substrate to soluble substrate from the influent ss and soluble substrate produced from hydrolysis inside the flocs ss h this change facilitated the differentiation between free filamentous organisms and floc forming organisms in the filamentous model 2 the combination of the hsbo kst sdl and fbt theories was effective in distinguishing between the substrate uptake by free filamentous organisms and floc forming organisms 3 it was possible to predict the outcome of filamentous bulking using the filamentous model by converting the concentration of filamentous and non filamentous organisms inside the reactor to a filamentous score filamentous bulking would occur if the filamentous score is higher than 3 4 adding a selector changed the hydraulic behaviour from a completely mixed mode to a plug flow mode therefore creating a substrate gradient stimulated the floc forming organisms to outcompete the free filamentous organisms 5 the filamentous score predicted by the filamentous model was 4 2 which is in line with the observations at the fuhais wwtp showing that the plant is suffering from filamentous bulking 6 adding a selector with 3 compartments to the fuhais wwtp decreased the filamentous score to 1 5 which indicates that no sludge bulking is expected

12967,several wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide have documented the occurrence of filamentous bulking in full scale systems despite the efforts made for filamentous bulking control the activated sludge models asm can neither describe nor predict filamentous bulking at wwtps this research aims to expand the asm no 1 to be able to describe filamentous bulking sludge and to model the effects of incorporating an aerobic selector on filamentous bulking four theories hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable organics theory kinetic selection theory substrate diffusion limitation theory and filamentous backbone theory were combined to expand the asm1 the results showed that this combination was successful to distinguish between the substrate uptake by filamentous organisms and by floc forming organisms moreover the concentrations of filamentous and floc forming organisms inside the reactor were converted to a filamentous score that predicted the outcome of filamentous bulking filamentous bulking would occur if the filamentous score was higher than 3 in a range of 1 6 as a case study the fuhais wwtp in jordan was modelled using the expanded asm1 filamentous model and the filamentous score of 4 2 was in accordance to the visually observed bulking however when an aerobic selector with 3 compartments would be added before the aeration tank the filamentous score decreased to 1 5 the selector changed the hydraulic behaviour from a completely mixed mode to a plug flow mode which created a substrate gradient in the model making the floc forming organisms to outcompete the filamentous organisms additional experimental results are required to further calibrate and validate the filamentous model graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater modelling activated

occurrence of filamentous bulking in full scale systems a study done by deepnarain et al 1 showed that 5 out of 7 wwtps surveyed in south africa had a sludge volume index svi larger than 150 ml g 1 therefore having a poor settling efficiency in another study it was observed that 25 of the activated sludge wwtps in france are suffering from sludge bulking 2 besides 50 of wwtps in northern china are affected by sludge bulking 3 the persistence of this problem can partly be explained by the fact that filamentous bacteria may cause sludge bulking problems even when they do not represent the dominant metabolic bacterial group in the activated sludge even if filamentous bacteria have a volume fraction less than the floc forming bacteria they can cause sludge bulking 4 6 as the abundance of filamentous organisms increases the floc structure becomes open affecting sludge settleability however a minimum presence of filamentous bacteria is also essential in the formation of the floc forming bacteria because filamentous microorganisms form the backbone of the floc and keep the floc in a good structure and able to easily settle 7 9 wang et al 10 showed that as svi increases from 76 to 275 ml g 1 the filamentous abundance increased from few score 1 to abundant score 5 as the filamentous concentration increases the settling properties become worse leading to the washout of the activated sludge 10 11 overall the uncontrolled growth of filamentous bacteria disrupts the settling properties of the activated sludge systems affecting the performance of the wwtps filamentous bulking can be controlled by adding a selector tank which can be aerobic anaerobic or anoxic a selector is a small tank and its volume is usually not larger than 10 of the aeration tank volume placed before the aeration basin commonly a selector tank receives the return of activated sludge ras and the influent of the wwtp qinf therefore creating a strong substrate concentration gradient that mimics the hydraulic conditions observed in plug flow reactors this strong gradient encourages the floc forming organisms to grow faster than filamentous organisms while degrading the soluble substrate in the system as a result the filamentous microorganism growth is hindered and bulking is prevented 6 12 13 the kinetic selection theory kst substrate diffusion limitation theory sdl hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable organics theory hsbo and filamentous backbone theory fbt are essential for understanding the relation between filamentous and floc forming organisms according to the kst that uses the monod expression 14 floc forming and filamentous organisms have different maximum growth rates μmax and affinity constants ks consequently filamentous organisms have higher growth rates at low substrate concentrations and floc formers have higher growth rates at high substrate concentrations 6 in contrast the sdl assumes that floc formers and filamentous microorganisms have the same kinetics however at low substrate concentration the diffusion limitation causes a very low substrate concentration inside the flocs for the floc forming organisms therefore it becomes hard for floc forming organisms to access the substrate while the filamentous organisms can readily uptake substrate due to their morphology so in the sdl case bulking occurs due to differences in morphology rather than differences in kinetic rates as in the kst nevertheless the driving force is the same which is a low substrate gradient resulting in a low concentration 15 the hsbo theory proposed by kappeler gujer 4 and experimentally verified by martins et al 16 explains that slowly biodegradable substrate is taken up and incorporated inside the sludge floc and then hydrolyzed the hydrolyzed products are consumed by the floc forming organisms therefore giving an advantage for floc forming organisms over filamentous organisms another theory is the fbt that describes the formation of activated sludge flocs by two processes the first step which depends on the bioflocculation of floc forming organisms is called microstructure floc formation these flocs are spherical in shape and compact but are weak then the second step is the formation of macrostructure flocs where the filamentous bacteria form a backbone inside the flocs and with the help of extracellular polymeric substances the floc forming bacteria become firmly attached 8 kappleler gujer 4 developed a mathematical model for aerobic bulking however they did not include the fbt theory cenens et al and lou reyes 8 17 incorporated the fbt in their model by defining a parameter called α which is defined as the rate of incorporation of filamentous bacteria into flocs one of the limitations of this model is that it does not consider the difference in kinetics between free filaments and incorporated filaments these theories are important in understanding the kinetics of filamentous organisms and could be combined into one mathematical model to improve the description of filamentous bulking in this study asm1 is expanded to predict filamentous bulking occurrence asm1 was chosen as it is considered a reference model for wwtp modelling in the research and industrial communities and is considered to be state of the art for activated sludge modelling 18 the objective of this study is therefore to modify and expand the asm1 to describe the filamentous bulking occurrence by incorporating four important theories the kst and sdl theories were combined to differentiate between the substrate uptake rate by free filamentous organisms and by floc forming organisms the hsbo theory was used to differentiate between the different substrate uptake rates readily soluble organics and slowly biodegradable organics finally the fbt was used to describe the amount of filaments that are responsible for the backbone of the floc forming bacteria this paper shows that the combination of the four important theories is important in modelling wwtps that are prone to filamentous bulking as other asm models cannot predict the occurrence of filamentous bulking 2 materials and methods 2 1 expanding asm1 to include filamentous bulking the asm1 was adjusted to distinguish between free filamentous i e outside the flocs organisms and floc forming organisms the first step to adjust the model was to split the heterotrophs into two organisms floc forming organisms xfloc and free filamentous organisms xffil the second step was to differentiate between the growth rates and substrate uptake rates of both organisms by combining the hsbo and the kst and sdl theories this was done by assigning different values of ks for the free filamentous and floc forming organisms while μmax values were the same for both organisms changing ks and keeping μmax constant allows the model to only differentiate between free filamentous and floc forming bacteria based on the substrate concentration available it was also important to differentiate between how both organisms take up different substrates therefore another component was defined which is the soluble substrate produced by the hydrolysis of particulate substrates inside the floc ss h free filamentous organisms have high affinity to uptake the soluble substrate from the influent ss when the substrate concentration is low and floc forming organisms show higher uptake rates for ss when the substrate concentration is high this was translated into the model by giving higher ks values to floc forming organisms than free filamentous organisms for ss consumption on the other hand floc forming organisms are expected to consume ss h at a higher rate than free filamentous organisms since floc formers are the ones hydrolyzing xs into ss h however free filamentous bacteria can still consume some of the ss h but only after the hydrolyzed substrate has diffused out of the floc this was translated into the model by giving lower ks values for floc formers for consuming ss h than for free filamentous bacteria fig 1 finally according to the literature filamentous organisms can only perform denitrification till nitrite 6 26 and therefore it was considered that free filamentous organisms do not contribute to the denitrification process therefore anoxic growth in the filamentous model was only performed by floc forming organisms to incorporate the fbt into the model the fraction of filamentous bacteria that are incorporated inside the floc in relation to the total floc forming organisms was estimated using the microscopic picture from jenkins et al 19 fig 2 qgis software 20 was used to measure the area of filamentous bacteria inside the flocs of each picture and relate this area to the total area of floc forming organisms then the model was further developed to check if filamentous bulking occurs or not this was also done using the microscopic pictures from jenkins et al 19 and the qgis software to develop a relationship between the ratio of total filamentous organisms both inside and outside the flocs to total non filamentous organisms and the filamentous score table the distinguishing between free filaments filaments incorporated inside the flocs and the flocs are presented in detail in annex a all these modifications were implemented in the asm1 model resulting in the filamentous model expanded asm1 matrix table 1 and new stoichiometric and kinetic parameters table 2 the other stoichiometric and kinetic parameters and the fuhais influent data were kept the same as in asm1 2 2 asm1 for modelling the fuhais wwtp the software programs used were the computer program for the identification and simulation of aquatic systems aquasim 22 qgis 3 14 0 20 and microsoft excel worksheets aquasim software was used because it is designed to allow the users to easily build their models define the compartments and the components and define the links between compartments qgis was used to calculate surface area ratios from some microscopic pictures asm1 was used to model the fuhais wwtp in aquasim fig 3 the fuhais wwtp is a municipal plant located in fuhais town balqa governorate jordan which has an average inflow of 3100 m3 d 1 cod of 770 mg l 1 and tn of 80 mg l 1 more information about the operating conditions at the fuhais wwtp is presented in annex b steady state conditions are considered sufficient at this stage to integrate the model and assess the interactions among the microbial populations as such steady state simulations were conducted using empirical data and the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters that are recommended by henze et al 21 annex c to perform these simulations tcod and tn fractionation were done table 3 and the calculations are presented in annex d note that the do in the modelled reactor was maintained to be around 1 0 mg l 1 and the clarifier is assumed to be 99 99 efficient in removing solids with no biological reactions taking place 2 3 modelling an aerobic selector to control filamentous bulking sludge the fuhais wwtp has a 500 m3 equalization tank used for temporary storage during peak inflow rates this tank was converted to an aerobic selector in the aquasim fig 4 the matrix of the filamentous model table 1 was used while modelling the selector modelled with a variation in the number of compartments each compartment of the selector was added as a new tank in aquasim to simulate the plug flow effect of an aerobic selector the aerobic selector was simulated with 1 2 3 and 4 compartments for three different sets of input data the first set of input data was for the 14th of april 2020 when the plant reported the lowest cod concentration 170 mg l 1 in the influent for the year 2020 the second set of data was the average plant data the third set of data was for the 1st june 2020 when the plant reported the highest cod concentration 1550 mg l 1 in the influent for the year 2020 3 results 3 1 expanding asm1 to include filamentous bulking the filamentous model was further developed to include filamentous bulking the fraction of filamentous bacteria in between the floc forming organisms ff was calculated for each microscopic picture that is shown in fig 2 and documented in table 4 in microscopic picture 2 f it was not possible to distinguish between filaments that were inside the flocs as all the filamentous organisms spread out from the floc structure therefore ff was only calculated for microscopic pictures 2 a to 2 e also the ratio of total filamentous bacteria to total non filamentous bacteria fil nfil in each microscopic picture was calculated table 4 the relation between the fil nfil and the filamentous score was plotted and the exponential trendline with an r2 of 0 99 was obtained resulting in eq 1 filamentous score equation 1 filamentous score ln fil nfil ln 0 0068 1 0482 furthermore from the ff values in table 4 an average ff value was calculated which is 0 03 this value was used in the filamentous model to account for the filaments that are inside the flocs in accordance with the fbt two new equations were added to aquasim as formula variables to define the real concentrations of the total filamentous organisms and non filamentous organisms after considering the ff ratio eqs 2 and 3 xnfil is the total amount of the non filamentous organisms without the filaments that act as the backbone of the floc structure and the xtfil is the total amount of filamentous organisms in the modelled reactor including the filaments that serve as the backbone of the floc forming organisms then the fil nfil ratio is calculated based on eq 4 expression for total non filamentous organisms concentration in the modelled reactor 2 x nfil x floc ff x floc expression for total filamentous organisms concentration in the modelled reactor 3 x tfil x ffil ff x floc expression for fil nfil 4 fil nfil x tfil x nfil finally the output from the filamentous model is a ratio between filaments and non filaments to assess if filamentous bulking occurs or not the fil nfil is converted to a numerical value that corresponds to the filamentous score using eq 1 according to jenkins et al 19 if the filamentous score is less than 3 filamentous organisms present in the reactor are not sufficient to cause filamentous bulking therefore if the output of the filamentous model has a filamentous score that is higher than 3 it can be concluded that filamentous bulking is most likely to occur at the plant 3 2 the output of asm1 and filamentous model the aquasim simulation outputs mainly focus on the steady state results of the model table 5 in the asm1 the concentration of filamentous and non filamentous heterotrophs is represented as one organism however in the filamentous model it is represented as two organisms filaments and non filaments the sum of the filamentous organisms concentration and the non filamentous organisms concentration in the filamentous model is approximately equal to the concentration of the heterotrophs in asm1 because the total influent biodegradable substrate and the yield for both organisms are the same for both models the nitrate concentration in asm1 is slightly lower than in the filamentous model showing that the denitrification anoxic growth rate is marginally faster in asm1 than in the filamentous model from the filamentous model results the fil nfil ratio was 0 55 and the filamentous score was 4 2 which is in line with the observation that the fuhais wwtp is suffering from filamentous bulking 3 3 effect of an aerobic selector to control filamentous bulking sludge using the filamentous model a relationship exists between the number of selector compartments and the occurrence of filamentous bulking fig 5 the overall concentration of floc forming organisms increases and the overall concentration of filamentous organisms decreases as the number of compartments increases in the 500 m3 aerobic selector the sludge loading rates for each compartment is presented in annex e for the soluble substrate the trend observed was a steep decrease from the first compartment to the second compartment then ss slightly decreases from one compartment to the other until reaching a negligible value in the aeration tank table 6 the xs gradually decreases from one compartment to the other until reaching around 5 5 mg l 1 in the modelled reactor ss h produced inside the floc is consumed therefore leaving the concentration of ss h in all the selector compartments and the modelled reactor less than 0 5 mg l 1 the concentration of floc forming organisms and filamentous organisms follow a similar trend of slightly decreasing concentrations from one compartment to the other until reaching the aeration tank the decrease in biomass concentration is expected since the substrate concentration available for microorganisms also decreases 4 discussion 4 1 asm1 vs filamentous model an important limitation of asm1 is that it is not able to predict the occurrence of bulking 23 however with the filamentous model filamentous bulking can be predicted because the heterotrophs as well as the substrate were changed to account for different organisms floc formers and free filaments and different substrates ss and ss h the filamentous model can be the first step for modelling wwtps in the design and or operational stages to prevent or control problems associated with filamentous bulking also the filamentous model is considered a grey box model like the asm1 and requires the same amount of data needed as the asm1 generally the filamentous model focuses on differences of substrates to model the filamentous bulking sludge however the filamentous model can be further developed to take into account how dissolved oxygen aeration affects filamentous bulking sludge the filamentous model presented in this paper is a conceptual model that needs to be further calibrated and validated to be used in practical applications nitrates are present in the modelled reactor for both models asm1 and filamentous model meaning that the denitrification process is slow this is because the tank is an aerobic reactor with an average do concentration of 1 mg l 1 therefore with the presence of oxygen the denitrification process becomes very slow as mentioned by skiba 27 the average tn for january till november 2020 in the fuhais wwtp s effluent stream is 12 mg l 1 but it is noticed that the tn in the effluent stream of the fuhais wwtp is fluctuating between 2 8 mg l 1 and 55 mg l 1 likewise the nitrate concentration at the fuhais wwtp fluctuates this large range can be explained by the fact that the do in the fuhais wwtp is also fluctuating reaching minimum values of almost 0 1 mg l 1 and maximum values of 5 mg l 1 therefore the nitrification and denitrification processes are unstable in the reactors at the fuhais wwtp however when the do of the plant is having an average value of 1 mg l 1 it is expected to have high nitrate concentration as the denitrification process is slow and this is what the asm1 and filamentous model showed when the do in the model is 1 mg l 1 the denitrification oxygen inhibition factor is 0 20 and the nitrification oxygen inhibition factor is 0 71 showing that at this do value the denitrification process is slowed down the do in the reactors can be decreased to 0 5 mg l 1 to have an acceptable rate for nitrification and denitrification at the same time at do value of 0 5 mg l 1 the nitrification oxygen inhibition factor will be 0 56 and the denitrification oxygen inhibition factor will be 0 33 however maintaining a low oxygen concentration less than 1 1 mg l 1 is associated with increasing the growth of filamentous organisms and therefore it increases the chances that filamentous bulking occurs as described by nittami et al 28 therefore for the filamentous model to assess filamentous bulking under low dissolved oxygen concentration it should differentiate between the behaviour of floc forming organisms and filamentous organisms under different do values this can be further modified in the filamentous model by changing the values of kohf and kohfil another way to include denitrification is intermittently changing the do in the tanks to simultaneously have higher rates of nitrification and denitrification in a study done by zhao et al 29 it was shown that complete nitrification can be achieved at very low do concentrations 0 0 0 8 mg l 1 given that the organic loading rate is low and the srt is long however with intermittent aeration filamentous bulking was reported by henze et al 12 this can be tested when the filamentous model is modified to have different kohf and kohfil values as previously mentioned to ensure that filamentous bulking will not occur at the times when the do concentrations are very low in the reactor furthermore the nitrate concentration of the filamentous model is higher than the nitrate concentration of the asm1 this is because in the filamentous model the distinction between floc formers and free filaments resulted in a higher concentration of free filamentous organisms compared to floc forming organisms and the denitrification process is performed only by floc forming organisms the denitrification processes in the filamentous model are processes number 2 and 11 which are the anoxic growth of floc forming organisms by taking up the soluble substrate in the influent and the soluble substrate produced by hydrolysis the filamentous model is better to predict the nitrate concentrations than asm1 when filamentous bulking is occurring as according to literature when a plant is suffering from filamentous bulking the activated sludge can be washed out leading to the loss of denitrifiers and nitrifiers 10 11 to the authors knowledge there is not sufficient evidence in literature of modelling the denitrification process using asm1 while a plant is suffering from filamentous bulking therefore the filamentous model can be the starting point to develop a new approach that can solve the limitation for denitrification prediction while implementing the asm approach for filamentous bulking sludge 4 2 evaluation of the filamentous model theories the filamentous model uses four theories hsbo kst sdl fbt to expand the asm1 in order to describe filamentous bulking the hsbo kst and sdl theories were combined to favour the growth of floc forming organisms when the substrate concentration is high and to favour the growth of free filamentous organisms when the substrate concentration is low the combination of theories resulted in changing the ks values for floc forming organisms and free filamentous organisms however these ks values can also be interpreted as apparent mass transfer parameters that describe the diffusional resistance for example for the case of ss uptake the ss first needs to diffuse inside the floc to be consumed by floc forming organisms conversely free filamentous organisms will only consume ss directly therefore the apparent ksf is higher than the apparent ksfil to account for the diffusional resistance of ss going into the floc moreover for the case of ss h uptake the ss h first needs to diffuse outside the flocs to be consumed by free filamentous organisms conversely floc forming organisms will just consume ss h directly therefore the apparent khf is lower than the apparent khfil to account for the diffusional resistance of ss h going out of the floc on the contrary the μmax for free filamentous bacteria and floc forming bacteria was kept the same so none of them is favoured to grow faster and therefore the growth rate is only dependant on the substrate concentration the approach of changing the ks values and keeping μmax constant was the same approach used in the aerofil model developed by kappeler gujer 4 it can be concluded that the combination of the three theories was effective in distinguishing between floc forming organisms and free filamentous organisms based on the substrate uptake this is because bulking is assumed to occur due to differences in morphology according to the sdl and differences in kinetics according to the kst nevertheless the driving force is the same which is low substrate concentrations 6 15 the incorporation of fbt in the filamentous model was done by adding the ff factor that represents the fraction of filamentous bacteria that are needed inside the floc cenens et al and lou reyes 8 17 incorporated the fbt by defining a parameter called α which is defined as the rate of incorporation of filamentous bacteria into flocs one of the limitations of that model is that it does not take into account the differences in kinetics between free filaments and filaments incorporated into the flocs however the approach used in this paper takes into account the differences between the free filaments and the filaments incorporated in the flocs since the incorporated filaments are considered part of the floc forming organisms these incorporated filaments will have the same kinetics as the non filamentous bacteria nevertheless the incorporated filaments are added to the free filaments to calculate the fil nfil ratio and therefore assess the filamentous score the ff used was a constant average value that was obtained from the microscopic pictures shown in fig 2 however when the ff is plotted against each microscopic picture fig 6 the ff increases as the filamentous score increases therefore to improve the accuracy of the model ff can be defined as a function rather than a constant value 4 3 effect of an aerobic selector to control filamentous bulking sludge when an aerobic selector was added to the system the growth of non filaments over filaments was stimulated from fig 5 it is seen that the higher the number of compartments in a selector the lower the fil nfil and the filamentous score this is because the more the compartments the more the effect of plug flow so the higher the gradient of ss and xs in the selector therefore non filamentous bacteria concentration increases more than the filamentous bacteria concentration as their growth is favoured by a higher substrate concentration caused by a higher gradient while filamentous growth is favoured by low substrate concentration 6 besides the filamentous score is less than 3 for the selectors with 2 or more compartments according to jenkins et al 19 filamentous organisms are dominant and likely responsible for solid liquid separation problems when the filamentous score is 4 or higher however when the filamentous score is 3 or lower it means that filamentous organisms are present but not sufficient to account for separation problems therefore it is better to have a selector with 2 or more compartments to make sure that filamentous bulking will not occur at the fuhais wwtp furthermore according to henze et al 12 it is suggested that the number of compartments in an aerobic selector should not be less than 3 also the selector volume should not be more than 10 of the volume of the aeration tanks therefore from these analyses it is suggested to have an aerobic selector with 3 compartments to ensure that filamentous bulking will not occur at the fuhais wwtp the equalization tank at the fuhais wwtp has a volume of 500 m3 that is 7 8 of the total volume of the aeration tanks 6400 m3 the equalization tank has a length of 14 m a width of 6 m and a depth of 6 m the equalization tank at the fuhais wwtp can be changed to an aerobic selector with 3 compartments to avoid filamentous bulking as seen from table 6 there is a higher concentration gradient of ss in the selector than without it which favours the growth of floc forming bacteria over free filamentous bacteria this is due to the effect of the parameter ks in the model when ksf is high 8 gcod m 3 in the case of floc forming organisms the growth rate of flocs is favoured at high substrate concentrations plug flow reactor on the other hand when ksfil is low 1 gcod m 3 like is the case of free filamentous organisms the growth rate is favoured at low substrate concentration mixed flow reactor the selector simulates a plug flow regime therefore favouring the growth of floc forming bacteria 13 it can be concluded from fig 5 that a plant with an aerobic selector can withstand steep changes in influent better than a plant without a selector and this is consistent with the literature 24 this is because the filamentous score changed as the influent cod load changed simulations minimum cod and maximum cod when there was not a selector however when a selector was added the change in the filamentous score is negligible as the influent cod changes nevertheless going back to the fuhais wwtp plant case the filamentous score of a selector with 3 compartments did not change with very low or very high cod loads in the influent this analysis strongly supports the previously drawn conclusion to add a selector consisting of 3 compartments before the aeration tanks at the fuhais wwtp to help preventing filamentous bulking 5 conclusions 1 the asm1 model was modified by splitting the heterotrophic organisms into free filamentous organisms xffil and floc forming organisms xfloc and the soluble substrate to soluble substrate from the influent ss and soluble substrate produced from hydrolysis inside the flocs ss h this change facilitated the differentiation between free filamentous organisms and floc forming organisms in the filamentous model 2 the combination of the hsbo kst sdl and fbt theories was effective in distinguishing between the substrate uptake by free filamentous organisms and floc forming organisms 3 it was possible to predict the outcome of filamentous bulking using the filamentous model by converting the concentration of filamentous and non filamentous organisms inside the reactor to a filamentous score filamentous bulking would occur if the filamentous score is higher than 3 4 adding a selector changed the hydraulic behaviour from a completely mixed mode to a plug flow mode therefore creating a substrate gradient stimulated the floc forming organisms to outcompete the free filamentous organisms 5 the filamentous score predicted by the filamentous model was 4 2 which is in line with the observations at the fuhais wwtp showing that the plant is suffering from filamentous bulking 6 adding a selector with 3 compartments to the fuhais wwtp decreased the filamentous score to 1 5 which indicates that no sludge bulking is expected

12968,even low concentration monovalent silver ag and silver nanoparticles ag nps are emerging environmental threats seeking an eco friendly and cost effective continuous treatment process to mitigate their pollution in this study an attempt has been made to investigate the potential of spent coffee grounds scgs biochar in a fixed bed column to remove silver ions and silver nanoparticles from wastewater a series adsorption and desorption of fixed bed column experiments were performed under different operating conditions to determine the breakthrough curves btcs and understand the effect of initial concentration 50 100 mg l the quantity of biochar 0 5 1 g and the form of silver ag and ag nps on biochar removal capacity thomas and yoon nelson models were applied to simulate different column parameters such as breakthrough time saturation time the volume of treated effluent and percentage of removal these simulated results could assist in the scale up of the process for an actual industrial operation experimental data showed good agreement with both thomas and yoon nelson models where the simulated values were closely matched with the experimental values biochar was collected after the adsorption and characterised to confirm the morphology crystal structure and ionic state of silver the saturated column was regenerated by 0 05 m hno3 as eluent and used at least 3 times with 15 capacity loss compared to initial performance which demonstrated the viability and effectiveness of the biochar adsorption process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption kinetics biomass pyrolysis wastewater treatment biochar silver removal 1 introduction silver is one of the precious metals and is popular for its diverse industrial applications metallic silver or silver compounds are being used for various applications such as mirrors photographic plates solar panels radiography jewellery and high value tableware in addition distinct physicochemical properties such as antimicrobial action very low thermal and electrical resistance and special optical property surface plasma resonance spr make silver nanoparticles ag nps a useful addition to nanotechnology 1 2 however environmental exposure to silver ions ag and ag nps through waste streams raises concerns about human health and the ecosystem 3 4 biocidal products such as anti microbial textile and personal care and health care products are the key source of silver both ag and ag nps in urban wastewater streams 5 usage of silver based biocidal products is on the rise in the modern day lifestyle these externally used personal care products are often washed off during the day day activities additionally laundry of ag nps treated anti microbial textiles cause silver leaching to domestic wastewater 6 the production of ag nps increased by more than double in the last decade and the trend is expected to continue in the near and long term future to date 1700 products that contain ag nps are identified the source of ag is mainly from the photographic industries where ag i waste is discharged as thiosulfate complex form mainly as ag s2o3 2 3 in addition silver ions ag agcn ag nh3 2 enter the waste stream from other industrial sources such as mirror coating electroplating and mining 7 thus a high quantity of silver enters the wastewater stream via various sources and increases the pollutant load in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 8 although a good proportion around 75 of ag and ag nps can be removed by conventional or current wwtps 9 10 these silver species are a significant threat to the current treatment processes that are bacteria dominant anti microbial silver can damage the bacteria and reduce the overall wwtps efficiency 11 continuous discharge of residual silver contaminated effluent into natural water streams or agricultural soil could be a potential threat to the environment 12 13 additionally a significant proportion of the silver species are retained in the biosolids which may later be used for land application thus both routes are eventually releasing silver into the environment resulting in a negative impact on the aquatic ecosystem and human health 14 furthermore when these silver species ag and ag nps come into the wastewater stream multiple transformations are expected to occur in a complex environment such as wwtps understanding the aggregation and transformation behaviour of silver compounds and ag nps is fundamental to understand their transport phenomena and toxicity nature which are greatly influenced by the chemistry of water streams 15 16 the transformation of ag nps in aqueous media is mainly driven by four mechanisms oxidative dissolution sulfidation chlorination and photoreduction as presented in fig 1 17 18 under oxygen rich aqueous conditions ag nps transform into ag that dissolves in water however ag can be converted back to ag nps in the presence of sunlight and dissolved organic matters doms a recent study demonstrated that ag could be reduced to ag nps by humic acid from natural organic matters nom under dark conditions ambient temperature 30 c and increased ph 6 9 in addition the coexistence of formate acetate carbonate or sulphate can accelerate the adsorption process 19 however neither the surface functionality nor the nature of the core structure can hinder the anaerobic transformation of ag nps or agcl nps to ag2s which is more stable in a wastewater environment 20 21 under such conditions adsorption of nom on ag nps surface limits the reduction reaction to produce toxic ag 22 however any further environmental change can destabilise the equilibrium and regenerate the toxic ag in wwtps with an hs rich environment especially in domestic wastewater both ag nps and ag can undergo sulfidation under anaerobic environments and produce ag2s solid that is claimed as barely bioavailable and less toxic 23 however a recent study found that the sulfidized species of silver showed toxic impacts on soil microorganisms 24 in the cl rich environment such as seawater ag nps dissolve into ag and produce agcl nps and agclx x 1 compounds a significant proportion of ag nps can be reduced to produce ag ions that transform into ag2s and agcl these sulphide and chloride species of silver are stable forms in terms of toxicity to a certain extent in the wastewater environment but they are still bioavailable and toxic for some organisms such as plants and caenorhabditis elegans 25 additionally transformation reaction equilibrium can shift in to reverse direction based on the surrounding environment and contact time 26 proven silver removal technology is still not available to treat bulk scale wastewater some complex and economically unfeasible treatment processes such as reverse osmosis membrane and filtration are available for the total removal of silver 2 besides a low concentration of silver makes the treatment processes more challenging adsorption by biomass waste derived biochar can offer an effective solution to these challenges 27 the adsorption process demonstrated tremendous success in removing several heavy metals from wastewater 28 biosorption is an adsorption process where the adsorbents come from biological origin to remove a wide range of contaminants such as toxic metals this technique is simple sustainable and cost effective for handling a large quantity of wastewater with a low concentration of metals 29 30 although activated carbon is the most widely used commercial adsorbent multiple investigations of silver removal by activated carbon or other synthetic and natural adsorbents challenged the commercialisation of such technology due to the cost effectiveness and environmental footprint 27 biochar has been successfully used to remove numerous contaminants such as antibiotics removal 31 32 phenols 33 35 and heavy metals 36 37 from wastewater for example a study investigated the application of biochar to adsorption of different heavy metals like copper zinc and lead from the aqueous phase the results revealed that the biochar achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 128 7 μg g for copper 107 μg g for zinc and 4 49 μg g for lead 38 another study reported the generation of biochar from pyrolysis of digested sludge and applied to remove cadmium and lead from wastewaters 39 the results showed that the biochar achieved excellent adsorption capacity for lead and cadmium which were 0 75 and 0 55 mmol g 39 the adsorption capacity of the biochar was attributed to the presence of various functional groups on biochar surfaces and its porous structure however the higher adsorption capacity for the lead was ascribed to the increased affinity compared to cadmium 39 in addition biochar is a potential support matrix to immobilize nanoparticles 40 41 which can be advantageous for removing ag nps from wastewater due to the continuous generation of a large volume of wastewater sustainable and cost effective solutions are required therefore continuous adsorption of silver species might mitigate silver pollution spent coffee grounds scgs are the waste residue generated from the production of instant coffee and coffee brewing 42 the estimated generation of spent coffee grounds scgs was 18 6 billion kg in 2016 43 landfilling of these scgs can be a burden because of the greenhouse gas ghgs emissions 44 biochar produced from scgs can be utilised to remove silver from wastewater this approach can solve two problems with single technological innovation according to the literature only a few studies have been performed on silver ag and ag nps removal by using biochar produced from biomass waste and most of them were limited to batch experiments in most of the studies ag ions were used for laboratory investigation however silver transformation reactions confirm that all ag nps are not converted into ag and sometimes ag ions are transformed into ag nps in a natural environment thus it is crucial to evaluate the suitability of a process for both species of silver to ensure the complete removal of silver most importantly only one study was found where biochar was used to adsorb ag nps for batch scale and to the best of our knowledge there is no study reported on the adsorption of ag nps using biochar in a continuous mode assessing the potential of scgs biochar to remove silver ag and ag nps from wastewater in a continuous mode was the key objective of the present study to establish its industrial scale applicability in this study for the first time a laboratory scale fixed bed adsorption column was used to understand the potential of scgs biochar in the adsorption of ag and ag nps from wastewater on a continuous mode the performance of the dynamic adsorption column was evaluated by varying process parameters such as initial concentration the quantity of biochar and the form of silver ag and ag nps experimental column characteristic parameters were compared with the simulated values from thomas and yoon nelson models to establish the hypothesis morphology and chemistry of silver after adsorption was confirmed by sem eds and xps analysis in addition the reusability of such a column was analysed to establish the economic feasibility of the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials scgs were collected from juliette s espresso a coffee shop at the jcu townsville bebegu yumba campus laboratory grade silver nitrate solid agno3 99 99 ag nps powder 99 99 wt wt and nitric acid hno3 99 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich with the lot s6506 25g lot mkcj2718 and lot 225711 475ml respectively 2 2 pyrolysis experiments of scgs biomass scgs samples were dried in an oven at 105 c overnight to remove residual moisture spent coffee grounds biochar was produced via pyrolysis at 500 c in an inert environment by purging n2 gas 3 l min to ensure the absence of external oxygen using a fixed bed reactor a conventional electrical tube quartz furnace termolab portugal for each experiment about 10 g of scgs biomass was weighed in a quartz crucible and placed in the tube furnace the biomass sample was pyrolysed at 500 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and a residence time of 2 h after each pyrolysis experiment biochar was weighed grounded and collected for characterisation and adsorption testing a schematic diagram of the pyrolysis process is shown in fig 2 the particle size distribution of scgs biochar produced at 500 c was measured by the malvern mastersizer 3000 2 3 packed bed column system a glass tube of 11 mm inner diameter and 55 cm height was used to prepare the adsorption column a fine mesh of stainless steel was placed at the bottom of the tube to hold the packing materials for each experiment 1 g or 0 5 g of scgs biochar was mixed well with 54 g of quartz sands particle size 1 18 2 36 mm scgs biochar was comprised of fine particles for instance according to the particle size distribution 90 was 371 μm 50 was 184 μm and 10 was 24 μm small particle size is generally considered favourable for greater contact between solid and liquid phases and could be advantageous to achieve enhanced adsorption capacity 45 sand has been used as an inert media to avoid excessive pressure drops the packing mixture in the column provided a constant column height of 42 cm the top and bottom of the column were packed with only quartz sands with 4 cm height on each side to maintain a uniform flow finally the column was fitted with a peristaltic pump to ensure continuous flow at a constant flow rate fig 3a during each experiment a solution was made to flow continuously from top to bottom by holding a constant solution stock on top of the column avoiding any air trap inside the column and allowing the use of a whole cross section of the column thus every possible care was taken to avoid any possible changes in the flow rate or column height in this experiment initial silver concentration and quantity of biochar were varied to evaluate the dynamic column performance 2 4 packed bed column adsorption and regeneration studies continuous adsorption studies were carried out with silver nitrate agno3 and ag nps solution in double distilled water at room temperature 22 2 c 50 mg l and 100 mg l ag solutions were prepared by using agno3 these two concentrations were selected based on the literature where a wide range of initial concentrations 50 2000 mg l were studied for example a study demonstrated the application of biochar adsorption of heavy metals lead cadmium copper zinc and nickel using the initial concentrations of 20 250 mg l 46 another study demonstrated the removal of cobalt and nickel using an initial concentration of 50 250 mg l 47 ag nps power was added into double distilled water to produce 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag nps containing solutions that were continuously agitated by a magnetic stirred at 750 rpm overnight experiments were carried out maintaining the ph around 6 7 previous studies have shown that this ph range is highly advantageous to achieve the maximum adsorption while increasing or decreasing ph reduces the adsorption capacity for example a study showed that biochar achieved maximum adsorption for ni and co at ph 6 while low and higher ph decreased the adsorption significantly 47 for each experiment five litres of the solution was fed into the vertically oriented column using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex l s 07542 01 usa maintaining a constant flow rate of 10 ml min every half an hour ca 20 ml of the effluent was collected for icp aes analysis according to pap and his co workers breakthrough and exhaustion time are the two most used parameters when the concentration of the adsorbate in the effluent reached ca 10 and 90 of that in the inlet stream respectively 48 once the saturation was reached 0 05 m hno3 was passed through the column at a 7 ml min flow rate for 2 h hno3 was used to dissolve the adsorbed ag nps and to regenerate the column 49 after the acid treatment the column was washed with double distilled water until the ph of the effluent reached 7 5 to 8 5 the adsorption performance of the regenerated column was also studied under the same conditions as of the fresh column the regeneration rate was obtained from the following equation eq 1 50 1 of regeneration amount of silver desorbed amount of silver adsorbed 100 2 5 analytical methods silver ions ag concentration in influent and effluent solution was measured by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes makers of agilent 5100 varian liberty series ii singapore for ag nps solutions containing unadsorbed ag nps were acidified with 0 05 m hno3 to dissolve the ag nps into silver ions ag before the icp aes analysis a series of silver standards were measured at a wavelength of 338 289 nm maximum for significant figures and an independent ag standard solution was measured along with every sample solution for quality control and quantification purpose after the adsorption biochar was collected and dried in an oven at 105 c overnight to analyse the silver morphology and chemistry on biochar by x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the xrd technique was used to understand the mechanisms of silver adsorption the bruker phaser d2 x ray powder diffractometer cu radiation was used the xrd spectra were collected from 5 to 65 with a scan step size of 0 02 and a time step of 1 s the sem eds was used to get insights into silver distribution on biochar samples before and after the adsorption test the jeol jsm5410lva sem was used where a beam of high energy electrons was scanned across the surface of the biochar samples to get high magnification and high resolution imaging of the biochar surfaces for xps analysis the kratos axis supra was used to reveal the elemental composition and oxidation states of the biochar surfaces and adsorbed silver 2 6 column data analysis the breakthrough bt curve expresses the performance of a fixed bed adsorption column the time to reach a breakthrough and the shape are vital parameters to determine the operational and dynamic response of a fixed bed adsorption column 51 a number of column process parameters such as the quantity of adsorbent used initial concentration of adsorbate flow rate and fixed bed column height have a strong impact on the shape and nature of the bt curve 52 in these experiments the quantity of biochar used initial concentration of silver ag and ag nps were the variables tested the volume of the treated effluent is obtained by the bt point t b defined as the time where c t c 0 becomes 0 1 the exhaustion or saturation time t s is the point when the effluent concentration c t from a column reaches about 90 of the influent concentration c 0 53 54 a typical bt curve is generally obtained by a c t c 0 versus volume of the treated effluent v or running time t plot for fixed bed column height as shown in fig 3 b the total mass q s of silver adsorbed by the biochar was calculated from the area above the breakthrough curve by using eq 2 2 q s qa 1000 m q 1000 m t t 0 t t s c ad dt q 1000 m t t 0 t t s c 0 c t dt where q and m are the volumetric flow rate ml min and dry weight of adsorbent scgs biochar g respectively adsorption capacity q b at bt time t b was calculated from the area above the breakthrough curve by eq 3 3 q b q 1000 m t t 0 t t b c 0 c t dt the time equivalent to total capacity is expressed by eq 4 52 4 q s t 0 t 1 c t c 0 dt a 1 a 2 the time equivalent to usable capacity is calculated by eq 5 5 q b t 0 t b 1 c t c 0 dt a 1 the mtz mass transfer zone is the area of a fixed bed column where the adsorption occurs more intense smaller values of mtz indicate the efficient utilisation of the adsorbents 55 the mtz length can be calculated by the eq 6 6 mtz h 1 q b q s according to fig 3 b the usable capacity of the bed is area a 1 up to the breakthrough time point t b and area a 2 is the unused portion of the column considering t u t b then eqs 4 and 5 can be solved either graphically or by mathematical integration all other dynamic column parameters such as effluent volume until breakthrough veff b effluent volume until saturation veff s the total amount of silver mtotal was passed through the column was calculated from the following equations 7 v eff s q t s 8 v eff b q t b 9 m total c 0 q t total 1000 the total percentage of silver removal was calculated from the following eq 10 10 of silver removal q total m total 100 2 7 theoretical models for breakthrough bt curves simulation breakthrough bt curves were simulated by using different theoretical models such as thomas and yoon nelson models experimental data were also compared with the model derived parameters to understand the compliance of silver adsorption by a fixed bed column and to predict the column parameters to scale up the full process thomas model is the most commonly used model to predict the adsorption capacity and concentration time profile of the whole breakthrough curve thomas model assumes 1 plug flow in the bed and 2 reversible kinetics reaction with langmuir isotherms for equilibrium 56 according to the model adsorption is assumed to be limited by mass transfer at the interface rather than the chemical interactions of molecules 57 these model equations are expressed in table 1 yoon nelson model is the simplest model that does not include any process parameters 58 the theoretical model assumes that the rate of adsorption for each adsorbate is proportional to the rate of decrease in adsorption 59 the model does not require explicit information about the characteristics of adsorbate and its type in fact it predicts 50 of the breakthrough time and simulates column data obtained from a single adsorbate system 60 yoon nelson model is expressed in table 1 where k t is the thomas constant ml mg min m is the quantity of biochar in the column q 0 is the maximum adsorption capacity t is the time min at a given flow rate q k yn is the yoon nelson constant rate min 1 and τ is the time required to maintain 50 of the initial sorbent in its original form min 58 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fixed bed adsorption column parameters on bt curves a summary of experimental parameters of silver ag and ag nps adsorption in a fixed bed column such as q s t s mtotal and percentage of removal is presented in table 2 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration on bt curves the effect of the initial concentration of ag and ag nps was investigated using two different concentrations 50 and 100 mg l with the same amount of biochar using a flow rate of 10 ml min at room temperature 22 02 c according to the results reported in table 2 adsorption capacities at saturation points q s increased with the increase in the initial concentration of silver ag and ag nps for instance 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag with the loading of 1 g biochar showed an adsorption capacity of 42 78 mg g and 45 85 mg g respectively similar results were reported in studies where maximum batch scale adsorption capacity was reported at 49 0 and 46 2 mg g 61 similarly 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag nps with 1 g biochar loading showed an adsorption capacity of 13 72 mg g and 19 12 mg g respectively increased adsorption capacities at higher initial concentrations were expected since a higher initial silver concentration offers a higher driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance for the adsorption process for the specific amount of adsorbent biochar 62 the ag nps adsorption using scgs biochar was significantly low when compared to a recent study reported on vineyard biochar where a maximum adsorption capacity of 88 9 mg g was reported for ag nps adsorption on the batch scale however the study was not conducted on a continuous mode where biochar and ag nps got in contact for a short time and the initial concentration of ag nps was 500 mg l 63 ag adsorption capacity 49 0 mg g carried out in batch mode in our previous study was higher than in this study 45 48 mg g a plausible reason could be in the batch mode the adsorbates may have a better interaction and higher contact time in the solutions with adsorbents which is favourable for the external diffusion 53 these findings were similar to previous studies 58 however it can be observed from table 2 that an increase in the initial silver concentration decreased the breakthrough and saturation time t b and t s resulting in an early saturation of the adsorption column and a low volume of treated effluent in addition at the higher initial concentration of silver the total amount of silver adsorbed mtotal increased however the percentage of silver removal and total volume of treated water decreased this could be attributed to the fact that the active binding sites of the biochar were occupied by the adsorbates and biochar got saturated quickly 64 in this study breakthrough time t b and saturation time t s were relatively low which could be attributed to the relatively low adsorption capacity of unmodified scgs biochar in addition at higher initial concentrations 100 mg l mtz values increased a bit for instance for the fixed bed column with 0 5 g biochar mtz length increased from 25 02 cm to 31 98 cm when the initial concentration was increased from 50 mg l to 100 mg l this was expected as the column received a higher quantity of silver and thereby reduced the performance 65 mtz length is an important parameter to determine the efficiency of the column it has been suggested that if the ratio of mtz length and the total bed length is 1 0 the mtz is fully developed and the column is considered highly efficient 66 besides the smaller mtz length indicates that most of the bed has been used at the breakthrough point and a steep breakthrough curve is generated in this study the initial concentration of 50 mg l showed a smaller mtz length compared to 100 mg l suggesting the former scenario was more efficient and economical on the other hand feed flow rate also plays a pivotal role in mtz though the effect of the feed flow rate on mtz was not examined in this study it has a significant impact on mtz for example naja and volesky 67 demonstrated the effect of the flow rate 2 16 cm min on mtz in a fixed bed column of a length of 60 cm the results of the study revealed that the higher flow rate of 16 cm min achieved the maximum mtz of around 18 cm in a rapid time nearly 10 min in comparison the slowest flow rate of 2 cm min achieved an mtz of approximately 16 cm after a long residence time 100 h 67 the high flow rates usually do not allow enough time for metal ions to penetrate the biochar pores and react with functional groups in contrast low flow rates allow adequate time for metal ions to immobilize on biochar but might not be desirable in terms of effectiveness therefore a flow rate of 4 cm min was suggested to achieve desirable results with a column length of up to 60 cm 67 however in this study a flow rate of 10 ml min was used which proved to achieve low mtz with 50 mg l concentration indicating an efficient performance of the column 3 1 2 effect of biochar quantity in the fixed bed column on bt curves the effect of biochar quantity on the bt curves and ag adsorption was studied by varying the weight of biochar 0 5 g and 1 g maintaining the other operational parameters constant the other process parameters included bed height flow rate and solution temperature which were maintained as 42 cm 10 ml min and 22 1 c respectively according to table 2 at the breakthrough time t b with the increase in the quantity of biochar the adsorption capacity q b increased while the maximum adsorption capacity q s decreased however by increasing the quantity of biochar from 0 5 g to 1 g in the column breakthrough time t b saturation time t s and the total percentage of silver removal were increased further the total volume of treated water increased with an increase in the biochar quantity as more biochar particles into the fixed bed column resulted in an increase in the number of available active adsorption sites for ag interaction 52 thus the increase in the adsorbent quantity can be considered favourable in scaling up the fixed bed adsorption column for industrial operation similar findings were reported in the literature 68 further in the fixed bed column when the quantity of biochar exceeded 1 g of weight the aqueous flow was noticed to get blocked this limited the study to a maximum of 1 g of biochar 3 1 3 effect of ag and ag nps in the fixed bed column on bt curves silver either ag or ag nps adsorption by biochar has not been well explored and all these investigations were only in batch mode 2 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that reports the adsorption potential of biochar in the removal of ag and ag nps in a continuous mode silver ions ag and ag nps have different degrees of interaction with particular biochar because of their different chemical properties in this study ag nps had half the adsorption capacity and removal percentage of ag under the same testing conditions according to table 2 the initial concentration of 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag nps with 1 g biochar loading recorded the maximum adsorption capacity of 13 72 mg g and 19 12 mg g respectively however 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag with 1 g biochar loading provided the maximum adsorption capacity of 42 78 mg g and 45 85 mg g respectively the results can be attributed to the ionic state of silver which is expected to directly influence adsorption 69 especially ionic silver has more affinity to the biochar than elemental silver such as ag nps 70 this could be explained as biochar being negatively charged in the water solution and attached with the positively charged ag moreover ag nps were coated with poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp this pvp tightly binds with the surface of the nanoparticles and helps to block them sterically from aggregate 71 the ag nps were adsorbed on the biochar surface because of the covalent interaction less strong than ionic between oxygen atom present in biochar and the carbonyl or the tertiary amine group of the pyrrolidone ring of pvp 63 72 in the scenario where the concentration of ag and ag nps was set as 100 mg l and 1 g biochar was loaded the fixed bed column got saturated more quickly for ag nps than for ag thus the total treated effluent volume at the saturation point veff s was 2100 ml and 900 ml respectively this saturation time or reduction in the treated volume of effluents for ag nps might be due to the short residence time in the column a shorter residence time limited the interaction between biochar and ag nps and may have led to low adsorption and low volume of treated effluents it is also worth mentioning that the possibility of batch adsorption study of ag nps hindered by technical difficulties cannot be ignored when it was required to collect the filtrate solution after batch adsorption for icp analysis the filtration process was also separating ag nps from the solution thus it was not possible to distinguish the effect of adsorption and filtration 3 2 simulation of bt curves and comparison with experimental bt curves thomas and yoon nelson models were used to compare the experimental results with theoretical model derived values table 3 summarizes the obtained theoretical values of silver ag and ag nps adsorption in a fixed bed column the thomas model considers all the adsorption parameters such as flow rate time and quantity of adsorbent but yoon nelson uses only time thus the thomas model seems to be more appropriate than the yoon nelson model an increase in the initial concentration resulted in a decrease in the thomas kinetic constant kt under all tested conditions for instance when the initial concentration of ag with 0 5 g of biochar loading was increased from 50 mg l to 100 mg l kt was noticed to decrease from 0 530 to 0 426 ml mg min respectively similar observations for both models were reported in a previous study of co ions adsorption 50 evidently the study showed that increasing the initial concentration of co from 25 mg l to 75 mg l decreased kt approximately three times from 0 00036 to 0 00012 ml mg min and similar results were obtained for ni ions the values for kt reduced from 0 00047 to 0 00013 ml mg min when the initial concentration of ni was increased from 25 mg l to 75 mg l 50 in contrast other kinetic parameter of the thomas model q 0 predicted adsorption bed capacity increased approximately two times with an increase in the initial concentration from 50 to 100 mg l of ag ions as well as ag nps for instance the values of q 0 increased from 23 84 to 47 25 mg g when the concentration of ag ions was increased from 50 to 100 mg l whereas for ag nps q 0 increased from 11 77 to 24 67 mg g these results are also consistent with the previous study carried out by 50 however opposite trends were noticed for the yoon nelson kinetic constant kyn that increased with an increase in the initial concentration of ag ions and ag nps for example kyn increased from 0 0274 to 0 0493 l mg min when the initial concentration of ag ions was increased from 50 to 100 mg l in addition τ min which represents the time required to complete 50 of breakthrough decreased from 34 87 to 12 90 min with an increase in the initial concentration these changes in kinetic parameters indicate the effect of mass transfer or hydrodynamic conditions on the models and thus should be used carefully in pilot scale studies additionally experimental and theoretical adsorption capacities for ag obtained at the saturation points were close to each other as well as those calculated from the batch experiments for ag nps initial ag nps concentration reversely affected the adsorption capacity derived from the yoon nelson model as reported in table 3 this could be due to the limitation of the yoon nelson model that assumes time as the only variable that affects bt curves a good correlation between the thomas and yoon nelson models was observed from the mid range of the breakthrough curves as shown in fig 4 this might be attributed to the rapid initial adsorption of pore diffusion or internal diffusion taking place at a slower rate depending on the silver particle size and pore size 73 these silver adsorption kinetics phenomena were the assumption of models that showed better compliance 56 furthermore both models can simulate the behaviour of the fixed bed column for all the experiments as shown in table 3 both the thomas and yoon nelson models had good agreement with the experimental breakthrough curves with a high correlation coefficient r2 values 0 90 implying the suitability of these models for the fixed bed column system similar results were reported when removing silver ions using vermiculite 56 however the experimental btcs in fig 4 showed a drastic rise at the beginning of the bt curves and after 75 100 min experimental lines of breakthrough curves were fitted well with the model derived curves this might be due to the rapid film diffusion or external diffusion at the beginning which was described by pseudo second order kinetic model 73 3 3 column regeneration and reusability after the first cycle of adsorption with 100 mg l of ag and 1 g of biochar loading the column was regenerated by using 0 05 m hno3 as eluent and running the second cycle of adsorption under similar conditions since under these conditions the column adsorbed the maximum quantity of silver the regeneration performance of this column could easily be possible to achieve for other column conditions where a lesser quantity of silver was adsorbed the regeneration process was repeated till the third cycle of adsorption to evaluate the reusability of the fixed bed column and understand the feasibility at an industrial scale in order to evaluate the performance the parameters such as maximum adsorption capacity q s at the saturation time t s saturation time t s removal and regeneration are reported in fig 5 according to the results in fig 5 maximum adsorption capacities q s at saturation time were noticed to be 45 85 43 38 and 39 26 mg g during the first second and third cycles respectively after the first adsorption cycle the regenerated column got saturated after 180 min operation which was 30 min early than the first cycle the loss in the maximum adsorption capacity was noticed to be 5 4 similarly after the second regeneration the column lost 14 4 maximum adsorption capacity compared to the first cycle moreover after each run the column treated 300 ml solution less than the previous run this capacity loss might occur due to the physicochemical change in the biochar by hno3 while regeneration and or the hno3 solution was unable to reach into some of the micropores to dissolve the adsorbed silver thus reducing the number of active adsorption sites similar capacity loss and lower volume of treated effluent were noticed in other studies which reported the use of a fixed bed adsorption column for silver ions removal 74 therefore it could be suggested that a setup that has three columns in series might be able to confirm the full removal of silver for a continuous process after three cycles of adsorptions the columns will need replacement with new materials to keep the column performance at optimum level 3 4 surface characteristics of silver loaded scgs biochar fig 6 a and b represent the sem images of biochar before adsorption c and d represent after adsorption of silver ions ag and e and f show the biochar after adsorption of ag nps these sem images were used to understand the change in surface characteristics and morphology of silver loaded scgs biochar before and after adsorption both forms of silver forms were noticed on the biochar surface as white beads in fig 6 c d e and f as silver backscatter electrons are stronger than light elements low atomic numbers such as carbon they appear brighter in the sem images 1 in addition there were no traces of such white beads on the raw biochar fig 6 a and b this indicates the presence of a significant amount of silver on the biochar 75 fig 6 c and d also indicated that the ag is oxidised on the biochar surface and formed ag nps which are distributed homogeneously however fig 6 e and f mainly showed the aggregates of ag nps but the aggregated quantity of ag nps was lower in this case which is expected due to the lower adsorption capacity of biochar contacted with ag nps containing solution from fig 6 g and h high peaks in the elemental analysis by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds confirmed that the white spots in the sem images are basically silver 76 implying successful adsorption of silver onto the scg biochar the oxygen signals in the eds spectrum could be attributed to adsorbed water and oxygen molecules to form silver oxide 1 in contrast aluminium and silicon peaks could be from sand which was used with scgs biochar in the fixed bed column to improve porosity x ray powder diffraction patterns of biochar before adsorption and after adsorption of ag ions and ag nps are shown in fig 7 a xrd spectrum of biochar before adsorption showed a broad peak with 2θ at around 24 which confirmed the existence of graphitic structure in the biochar 43 after the adsorption both the silver loaded biochar showed sharp peaks with 2θ at around 38 4 44 6 and 65 1 implying the presence of crystalline silver having face centred cubic fcc lattice structures 111 200 and 220 respectively 77 78 the xrd results further confirm that the white beads detected by sem eds were silver in addition higher intensity of xrd peaks corresponds to a higher degree of crystallinity 79 as noticed for biochar with ag nps compared to biochar with ag higher crystallinity might be explained as follows the lesser amount of ag nps may get ionised when in contact with the biochar to form silver ions however a few small sharp peaks of quartz were also identified at 2θ of around 20 9 26 5 and 29 9 80 as biochar collected after adsorption was contaminated with quartz sand which was used with biochar in the column sem eds and xrd analysis revealed the presence of silver in the biochar matrix furthermore xps analysis of the biochar after adsorption was conducted to determine the oxidation state of silver fig 7 b and c represent the xps analysis results of the biochar samples that were used to adsorb ag and ag nps respectively a separate data table of xps analysis is added as a supplementary document table s1 electron binding energy corresponding to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 orbitals were observed additionally in fig 7 b biochar adsorbed ag ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 could be divided into 368 56 369 34 and 374 54 375 29 ev respectively the peaks at the binding energy of 368 56 369 34 ev can confirm the presence of ag atomic concentration of 52 1 whereas peaks at 374 54 375 29 ev reveal the presence of metallic ag0 atomic concentration of 34 6 78 on the other hand peaks at nearly similar binding energies were also observed for the biochar with ag nps confirming the presence of both ag atomic concentration of 58 1 and ag0 atomic concentration of 38 6 81 multifunctional oxygenic groups presence on the biochar surface might participate in the electrostatic attraction during the adsorption process 82 both findings might confirm the chemical transformation of ag and ag nps in contact with scgs biochar which was also identified during the adsorption kinetic studies 73 previous research on the kinetic analysis showed that the silver adsorption by biochar was dominated by the pseudo second order kinetic model which was driven by surface interactions through chemisorption and precipitation 83 3 5 techno economic feasibility study sgcs derived biochar is eco friendly low cost and easily available in this study a single fixed bed column showed a good level of adsorption similar three columns in a series can ensure the complete removal of silver for instance 1 kg scgs biochar will be able to treat 1400 l of wastewater having 50 mg l of silver solution it can be noted that 50 mg l of silver concentration is quite higher than the realistic concentration which is 1 mg l therefore the same quantity of biochar may be able to treat several folds higher than the volume considered in this study in addition the same column can be used and regenerated at least three times by backwash with 0 05 m hno3 which will cost 2 5 as the scgs can be collected free of charge and dried by the sun there will be no additional cost for feedstock except the transportation cost although the biochar production by pyrolysis of scgs at 500 c is the most cost intensive process on the pilot scale the value added pyrolysis by product bio oil collection and selling can subsidise the energy cost of pyrolysis by around 50 12 84 the previous investigation showed that the production cost of biochar for a pilot scale pyrolysis plant could be usd 485 12 in addition pyrolytic conversion of the organic food waste such as scgs can reduce the ghg emission which is one of the major issues in view of global warming 85 however silver recovery from the spent biochar might also open some possibility of economic feasibility of the overall process after the silver recovery from biochar after 3rd cycle scgs biochar could be applied for soil remediation and carbon storage to avoid toxic impact and increase environmental benefit 86 compared to the environmental footprint and economic feasibility this fixed bed column process might be viable to be industrialised obviously it is a preliminary laboratory scale study where energy operational and equipment costs were not considered however adsorption capacity can significantly be increased by activation of biochar 87 and flow dynamics can be overcome by pelletising biochar before mixing with the sand 88 a detailed cost study of the full process using improvised biochar and treating real wastewater can confirm the prospect of this new approach 4 conclusion this study investigated the performance of a fixed bed column study to remove silver from wastewater using scg biochar in a continuous mode of operation this study provides the much needed fundamental understanding to evaluate the feasibility of scaling up this technique fixed bed column using scgs biochar demonstrated a significant removal efficiency of both ag and ag nps the initial concentration of silver biochar quantity and the form of silver ag and ag nps had a direct effect on column performance 50 mg l silver ions solution passing through a column with a flow rate of 10 ml min showed the maximum ag adsorption capacity of 42 78 mg g however under the same condition for 100 mg l of ag nps the maximum adsorption capacity for ag nps was 19 12 mg g thomas and yoon nelson s models fitted well the breakthrough curves and experimental operational parameters which could be useful to scale up the process for industrial application the column was regenerated and reused three times with a total capacity loss of only 14 4 using hno3 as eluent furthermore xrd sem eds and xps analysis of silver loaded biochar revealed the morphology and chemistry of silver ag and ag nps after adsorption especially the xps analysis demonstrated the chemical transformation of both forms of silver ag and ag nps which eventually reconfirmed that silver adsorption on scgs biochar was partially dominant by chemisorption and silver transformation in the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data supplementary material image 1 appendix a supplementary data supplementary

12968,even low concentration monovalent silver ag and silver nanoparticles ag nps are emerging environmental threats seeking an eco friendly and cost effective continuous treatment process to mitigate their pollution in this study an attempt has been made to investigate the potential of spent coffee grounds scgs biochar in a fixed bed column to remove silver ions and silver nanoparticles from wastewater a series adsorption and desorption of fixed bed column experiments were performed under different operating conditions to determine the breakthrough curves btcs and understand the effect of initial concentration 50 100 mg l the quantity of biochar 0 5 1 g and the form of silver ag and ag nps on biochar removal capacity thomas and yoon nelson models were applied to simulate different column parameters such as breakthrough time saturation time the volume of treated effluent and percentage of removal these simulated results could assist in the scale up of the process for an actual industrial operation experimental data showed good agreement with both thomas and yoon nelson models where the simulated values were closely matched with the experimental values biochar was collected after the adsorption and characterised to confirm the morphology crystal structure and ionic state of silver the saturated column was regenerated by 0 05 m hno3 as eluent and used at least 3 times with 15 capacity loss compared to initial performance which demonstrated the viability and effectiveness of the biochar adsorption process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption kinetics biomass pyrolysis wastewater treatment biochar silver removal 1 introduction silver is one of the precious metals and is popular for its diverse industrial applications metallic silver or silver compounds are being used for various applications such as mirrors photographic plates solar panels radiography jewellery and high value tableware in addition distinct physicochemical properties such as antimicrobial action very low thermal and electrical resistance and special optical property surface plasma resonance spr make silver nanoparticles ag nps a useful addition to nanotechnology 1 2 however environmental exposure to silver ions ag and ag nps through waste streams raises concerns about human health and the ecosystem 3 4 biocidal products such as anti microbial textile and personal care and health care products are the key source of silver both ag and ag nps in urban wastewater streams 5 usage of silver based biocidal products is on the rise in the modern day lifestyle these externally used personal care products are often washed off during the day day activities additionally laundry of ag nps treated anti microbial textiles cause silver leaching to domestic wastewater 6 the production of ag nps increased by more than double in the last decade and the trend is expected to continue in the near and long term future to date 1700 products that contain ag nps are identified the source of ag is mainly from the photographic industries where ag i waste is discharged as thiosulfate complex form mainly as ag s2o3 2 3 in addition silver ions ag agcn ag nh3 2 enter the waste stream from other industrial sources such as mirror coating electroplating and mining 7 thus a high quantity of silver enters the wastewater stream via various sources and increases the pollutant load in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 8 although a good proportion around 75 of ag and ag nps can be removed by conventional or current wwtps 9 10 these silver species are a significant threat to the current treatment processes that are bacteria dominant anti microbial silver can damage the bacteria and reduce the overall wwtps efficiency 11 continuous discharge of residual silver contaminated effluent into natural water streams or agricultural soil could be a potential threat to the environment 12 13 additionally a significant proportion of the silver species are retained in the biosolids which may later be used for land application thus both routes are eventually releasing silver into the environment resulting in a negative impact on the aquatic ecosystem and human health 14 furthermore when these silver species ag and ag nps come into the wastewater stream multiple transformations are expected to occur in a complex environment such as wwtps understanding the aggregation and transformation behaviour of silver compounds and ag nps is fundamental to understand their transport phenomena and toxicity nature which are greatly influenced by the chemistry of water streams 15 16 the transformation of ag nps in aqueous media is mainly driven by four mechanisms oxidative dissolution sulfidation chlorination and photoreduction as presented in fig 1 17 18 under oxygen rich aqueous conditions ag nps transform into ag that dissolves in water however ag can be converted back to ag nps in the presence of sunlight and dissolved organic matters doms a recent study demonstrated that ag could be reduced to ag nps by humic acid from natural organic matters nom under dark conditions ambient temperature 30 c and increased ph 6 9 in addition the coexistence of formate acetate carbonate or sulphate can accelerate the adsorption process 19 however neither the surface functionality nor the nature of the core structure can hinder the anaerobic transformation of ag nps or agcl nps to ag2s which is more stable in a wastewater environment 20 21 under such conditions adsorption of nom on ag nps surface limits the reduction reaction to produce toxic ag 22 however any further environmental change can destabilise the equilibrium and regenerate the toxic ag in wwtps with an hs rich environment especially in domestic wastewater both ag nps and ag can undergo sulfidation under anaerobic environments and produce ag2s solid that is claimed as barely bioavailable and less toxic 23 however a recent study found that the sulfidized species of silver showed toxic impacts on soil microorganisms 24 in the cl rich environment such as seawater ag nps dissolve into ag and produce agcl nps and agclx x 1 compounds a significant proportion of ag nps can be reduced to produce ag ions that transform into ag2s and agcl these sulphide and chloride species of silver are stable forms in terms of toxicity to a certain extent in the wastewater environment but they are still bioavailable and toxic for some organisms such as plants and caenorhabditis elegans 25 additionally transformation reaction equilibrium can shift in to reverse direction based on the surrounding environment and contact time 26 proven silver removal technology is still not available to treat bulk scale wastewater some complex and economically unfeasible treatment processes such as reverse osmosis membrane and filtration are available for the total removal of silver 2 besides a low concentration of silver makes the treatment processes more challenging adsorption by biomass waste derived biochar can offer an effective solution to these challenges 27 the adsorption process demonstrated tremendous success in removing several heavy metals from wastewater 28 biosorption is an adsorption process where the adsorbents come from biological origin to remove a wide range of contaminants such as toxic metals this technique is simple sustainable and cost effective for handling a large quantity of wastewater with a low concentration of metals 29 30 although activated carbon is the most widely used commercial adsorbent multiple investigations of silver removal by activated carbon or other synthetic and natural adsorbents challenged the commercialisation of such technology due to the cost effectiveness and environmental footprint 27 biochar has been successfully used to remove numerous contaminants such as antibiotics removal 31 32 phenols 33 35 and heavy metals 36 37 from wastewater for example a study investigated the application of biochar to adsorption of different heavy metals like copper zinc and lead from the aqueous phase the results revealed that the biochar achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 128 7 μg g for copper 107 μg g for zinc and 4 49 μg g for lead 38 another study reported the generation of biochar from pyrolysis of digested sludge and applied to remove cadmium and lead from wastewaters 39 the results showed that the biochar achieved excellent adsorption capacity for lead and cadmium which were 0 75 and 0 55 mmol g 39 the adsorption capacity of the biochar was attributed to the presence of various functional groups on biochar surfaces and its porous structure however the higher adsorption capacity for the lead was ascribed to the increased affinity compared to cadmium 39 in addition biochar is a potential support matrix to immobilize nanoparticles 40 41 which can be advantageous for removing ag nps from wastewater due to the continuous generation of a large volume of wastewater sustainable and cost effective solutions are required therefore continuous adsorption of silver species might mitigate silver pollution spent coffee grounds scgs are the waste residue generated from the production of instant coffee and coffee brewing 42 the estimated generation of spent coffee grounds scgs was 18 6 billion kg in 2016 43 landfilling of these scgs can be a burden because of the greenhouse gas ghgs emissions 44 biochar produced from scgs can be utilised to remove silver from wastewater this approach can solve two problems with single technological innovation according to the literature only a few studies have been performed on silver ag and ag nps removal by using biochar produced from biomass waste and most of them were limited to batch experiments in most of the studies ag ions were used for laboratory investigation however silver transformation reactions confirm that all ag nps are not converted into ag and sometimes ag ions are transformed into ag nps in a natural environment thus it is crucial to evaluate the suitability of a process for both species of silver to ensure the complete removal of silver most importantly only one study was found where biochar was used to adsorb ag nps for batch scale and to the best of our knowledge there is no study reported on the adsorption of ag nps using biochar in a continuous mode assessing the potential of scgs biochar to remove silver ag and ag nps from wastewater in a continuous mode was the key objective of the present study to establish its industrial scale applicability in this study for the first time a laboratory scale fixed bed adsorption column was used to understand the potential of scgs biochar in the adsorption of ag and ag nps from wastewater on a continuous mode the performance of the dynamic adsorption column was evaluated by varying process parameters such as initial concentration the quantity of biochar and the form of silver ag and ag nps experimental column characteristic parameters were compared with the simulated values from thomas and yoon nelson models to establish the hypothesis morphology and chemistry of silver after adsorption was confirmed by sem eds and xps analysis in addition the reusability of such a column was analysed to establish the economic feasibility of the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials scgs were collected from juliette s espresso a coffee shop at the jcu townsville bebegu yumba campus laboratory grade silver nitrate solid agno3 99 99 ag nps powder 99 99 wt wt and nitric acid hno3 99 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich with the lot s6506 25g lot mkcj2718 and lot 225711 475ml respectively 2 2 pyrolysis experiments of scgs biomass scgs samples were dried in an oven at 105 c overnight to remove residual moisture spent coffee grounds biochar was produced via pyrolysis at 500 c in an inert environment by purging n2 gas 3 l min to ensure the absence of external oxygen using a fixed bed reactor a conventional electrical tube quartz furnace termolab portugal for each experiment about 10 g of scgs biomass was weighed in a quartz crucible and placed in the tube furnace the biomass sample was pyrolysed at 500 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and a residence time of 2 h after each pyrolysis experiment biochar was weighed grounded and collected for characterisation and adsorption testing a schematic diagram of the pyrolysis process is shown in fig 2 the particle size distribution of scgs biochar produced at 500 c was measured by the malvern mastersizer 3000 2 3 packed bed column system a glass tube of 11 mm inner diameter and 55 cm height was used to prepare the adsorption column a fine mesh of stainless steel was placed at the bottom of the tube to hold the packing materials for each experiment 1 g or 0 5 g of scgs biochar was mixed well with 54 g of quartz sands particle size 1 18 2 36 mm scgs biochar was comprised of fine particles for instance according to the particle size distribution 90 was 371 μm 50 was 184 μm and 10 was 24 μm small particle size is generally considered favourable for greater contact between solid and liquid phases and could be advantageous to achieve enhanced adsorption capacity 45 sand has been used as an inert media to avoid excessive pressure drops the packing mixture in the column provided a constant column height of 42 cm the top and bottom of the column were packed with only quartz sands with 4 cm height on each side to maintain a uniform flow finally the column was fitted with a peristaltic pump to ensure continuous flow at a constant flow rate fig 3a during each experiment a solution was made to flow continuously from top to bottom by holding a constant solution stock on top of the column avoiding any air trap inside the column and allowing the use of a whole cross section of the column thus every possible care was taken to avoid any possible changes in the flow rate or column height in this experiment initial silver concentration and quantity of biochar were varied to evaluate the dynamic column performance 2 4 packed bed column adsorption and regeneration studies continuous adsorption studies were carried out with silver nitrate agno3 and ag nps solution in double distilled water at room temperature 22 2 c 50 mg l and 100 mg l ag solutions were prepared by using agno3 these two concentrations were selected based on the literature where a wide range of initial concentrations 50 2000 mg l were studied for example a study demonstrated the application of biochar adsorption of heavy metals lead cadmium copper zinc and nickel using the initial concentrations of 20 250 mg l 46 another study demonstrated the removal of cobalt and nickel using an initial concentration of 50 250 mg l 47 ag nps power was added into double distilled water to produce 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag nps containing solutions that were continuously agitated by a magnetic stirred at 750 rpm overnight experiments were carried out maintaining the ph around 6 7 previous studies have shown that this ph range is highly advantageous to achieve the maximum adsorption while increasing or decreasing ph reduces the adsorption capacity for example a study showed that biochar achieved maximum adsorption for ni and co at ph 6 while low and higher ph decreased the adsorption significantly 47 for each experiment five litres of the solution was fed into the vertically oriented column using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex l s 07542 01 usa maintaining a constant flow rate of 10 ml min every half an hour ca 20 ml of the effluent was collected for icp aes analysis according to pap and his co workers breakthrough and exhaustion time are the two most used parameters when the concentration of the adsorbate in the effluent reached ca 10 and 90 of that in the inlet stream respectively 48 once the saturation was reached 0 05 m hno3 was passed through the column at a 7 ml min flow rate for 2 h hno3 was used to dissolve the adsorbed ag nps and to regenerate the column 49 after the acid treatment the column was washed with double distilled water until the ph of the effluent reached 7 5 to 8 5 the adsorption performance of the regenerated column was also studied under the same conditions as of the fresh column the regeneration rate was obtained from the following equation eq 1 50 1 of regeneration amount of silver desorbed amount of silver adsorbed 100 2 5 analytical methods silver ions ag concentration in influent and effluent solution was measured by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes makers of agilent 5100 varian liberty series ii singapore for ag nps solutions containing unadsorbed ag nps were acidified with 0 05 m hno3 to dissolve the ag nps into silver ions ag before the icp aes analysis a series of silver standards were measured at a wavelength of 338 289 nm maximum for significant figures and an independent ag standard solution was measured along with every sample solution for quality control and quantification purpose after the adsorption biochar was collected and dried in an oven at 105 c overnight to analyse the silver morphology and chemistry on biochar by x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the xrd technique was used to understand the mechanisms of silver adsorption the bruker phaser d2 x ray powder diffractometer cu radiation was used the xrd spectra were collected from 5 to 65 with a scan step size of 0 02 and a time step of 1 s the sem eds was used to get insights into silver distribution on biochar samples before and after the adsorption test the jeol jsm5410lva sem was used where a beam of high energy electrons was scanned across the surface of the biochar samples to get high magnification and high resolution imaging of the biochar surfaces for xps analysis the kratos axis supra was used to reveal the elemental composition and oxidation states of the biochar surfaces and adsorbed silver 2 6 column data analysis the breakthrough bt curve expresses the performance of a fixed bed adsorption column the time to reach a breakthrough and the shape are vital parameters to determine the operational and dynamic response of a fixed bed adsorption column 51 a number of column process parameters such as the quantity of adsorbent used initial concentration of adsorbate flow rate and fixed bed column height have a strong impact on the shape and nature of the bt curve 52 in these experiments the quantity of biochar used initial concentration of silver ag and ag nps were the variables tested the volume of the treated effluent is obtained by the bt point t b defined as the time where c t c 0 becomes 0 1 the exhaustion or saturation time t s is the point when the effluent concentration c t from a column reaches about 90 of the influent concentration c 0 53 54 a typical bt curve is generally obtained by a c t c 0 versus volume of the treated effluent v or running time t plot for fixed bed column height as shown in fig 3 b the total mass q s of silver adsorbed by the biochar was calculated from the area above the breakthrough curve by using eq 2 2 q s qa 1000 m q 1000 m t t 0 t t s c ad dt q 1000 m t t 0 t t s c 0 c t dt where q and m are the volumetric flow rate ml min and dry weight of adsorbent scgs biochar g respectively adsorption capacity q b at bt time t b was calculated from the area above the breakthrough curve by eq 3 3 q b q 1000 m t t 0 t t b c 0 c t dt the time equivalent to total capacity is expressed by eq 4 52 4 q s t 0 t 1 c t c 0 dt a 1 a 2 the time equivalent to usable capacity is calculated by eq 5 5 q b t 0 t b 1 c t c 0 dt a 1 the mtz mass transfer zone is the area of a fixed bed column where the adsorption occurs more intense smaller values of mtz indicate the efficient utilisation of the adsorbents 55 the mtz length can be calculated by the eq 6 6 mtz h 1 q b q s according to fig 3 b the usable capacity of the bed is area a 1 up to the breakthrough time point t b and area a 2 is the unused portion of the column considering t u t b then eqs 4 and 5 can be solved either graphically or by mathematical integration all other dynamic column parameters such as effluent volume until breakthrough veff b effluent volume until saturation veff s the total amount of silver mtotal was passed through the column was calculated from the following equations 7 v eff s q t s 8 v eff b q t b 9 m total c 0 q t total 1000 the total percentage of silver removal was calculated from the following eq 10 10 of silver removal q total m total 100 2 7 theoretical models for breakthrough bt curves simulation breakthrough bt curves were simulated by using different theoretical models such as thomas and yoon nelson models experimental data were also compared with the model derived parameters to understand the compliance of silver adsorption by a fixed bed column and to predict the column parameters to scale up the full process thomas model is the most commonly used model to predict the adsorption capacity and concentration time profile of the whole breakthrough curve thomas model assumes 1 plug flow in the bed and 2 reversible kinetics reaction with langmuir isotherms for equilibrium 56 according to the model adsorption is assumed to be limited by mass transfer at the interface rather than the chemical interactions of molecules 57 these model equations are expressed in table 1 yoon nelson model is the simplest model that does not include any process parameters 58 the theoretical model assumes that the rate of adsorption for each adsorbate is proportional to the rate of decrease in adsorption 59 the model does not require explicit information about the characteristics of adsorbate and its type in fact it predicts 50 of the breakthrough time and simulates column data obtained from a single adsorbate system 60 yoon nelson model is expressed in table 1 where k t is the thomas constant ml mg min m is the quantity of biochar in the column q 0 is the maximum adsorption capacity t is the time min at a given flow rate q k yn is the yoon nelson constant rate min 1 and τ is the time required to maintain 50 of the initial sorbent in its original form min 58 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fixed bed adsorption column parameters on bt curves a summary of experimental parameters of silver ag and ag nps adsorption in a fixed bed column such as q s t s mtotal and percentage of removal is presented in table 2 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration on bt curves the effect of the initial concentration of ag and ag nps was investigated using two different concentrations 50 and 100 mg l with the same amount of biochar using a flow rate of 10 ml min at room temperature 22 02 c according to the results reported in table 2 adsorption capacities at saturation points q s increased with the increase in the initial concentration of silver ag and ag nps for instance 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag with the loading of 1 g biochar showed an adsorption capacity of 42 78 mg g and 45 85 mg g respectively similar results were reported in studies where maximum batch scale adsorption capacity was reported at 49 0 and 46 2 mg g 61 similarly 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag nps with 1 g biochar loading showed an adsorption capacity of 13 72 mg g and 19 12 mg g respectively increased adsorption capacities at higher initial concentrations were expected since a higher initial silver concentration offers a higher driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance for the adsorption process for the specific amount of adsorbent biochar 62 the ag nps adsorption using scgs biochar was significantly low when compared to a recent study reported on vineyard biochar where a maximum adsorption capacity of 88 9 mg g was reported for ag nps adsorption on the batch scale however the study was not conducted on a continuous mode where biochar and ag nps got in contact for a short time and the initial concentration of ag nps was 500 mg l 63 ag adsorption capacity 49 0 mg g carried out in batch mode in our previous study was higher than in this study 45 48 mg g a plausible reason could be in the batch mode the adsorbates may have a better interaction and higher contact time in the solutions with adsorbents which is favourable for the external diffusion 53 these findings were similar to previous studies 58 however it can be observed from table 2 that an increase in the initial silver concentration decreased the breakthrough and saturation time t b and t s resulting in an early saturation of the adsorption column and a low volume of treated effluent in addition at the higher initial concentration of silver the total amount of silver adsorbed mtotal increased however the percentage of silver removal and total volume of treated water decreased this could be attributed to the fact that the active binding sites of the biochar were occupied by the adsorbates and biochar got saturated quickly 64 in this study breakthrough time t b and saturation time t s were relatively low which could be attributed to the relatively low adsorption capacity of unmodified scgs biochar in addition at higher initial concentrations 100 mg l mtz values increased a bit for instance for the fixed bed column with 0 5 g biochar mtz length increased from 25 02 cm to 31 98 cm when the initial concentration was increased from 50 mg l to 100 mg l this was expected as the column received a higher quantity of silver and thereby reduced the performance 65 mtz length is an important parameter to determine the efficiency of the column it has been suggested that if the ratio of mtz length and the total bed length is 1 0 the mtz is fully developed and the column is considered highly efficient 66 besides the smaller mtz length indicates that most of the bed has been used at the breakthrough point and a steep breakthrough curve is generated in this study the initial concentration of 50 mg l showed a smaller mtz length compared to 100 mg l suggesting the former scenario was more efficient and economical on the other hand feed flow rate also plays a pivotal role in mtz though the effect of the feed flow rate on mtz was not examined in this study it has a significant impact on mtz for example naja and volesky 67 demonstrated the effect of the flow rate 2 16 cm min on mtz in a fixed bed column of a length of 60 cm the results of the study revealed that the higher flow rate of 16 cm min achieved the maximum mtz of around 18 cm in a rapid time nearly 10 min in comparison the slowest flow rate of 2 cm min achieved an mtz of approximately 16 cm after a long residence time 100 h 67 the high flow rates usually do not allow enough time for metal ions to penetrate the biochar pores and react with functional groups in contrast low flow rates allow adequate time for metal ions to immobilize on biochar but might not be desirable in terms of effectiveness therefore a flow rate of 4 cm min was suggested to achieve desirable results with a column length of up to 60 cm 67 however in this study a flow rate of 10 ml min was used which proved to achieve low mtz with 50 mg l concentration indicating an efficient performance of the column 3 1 2 effect of biochar quantity in the fixed bed column on bt curves the effect of biochar quantity on the bt curves and ag adsorption was studied by varying the weight of biochar 0 5 g and 1 g maintaining the other operational parameters constant the other process parameters included bed height flow rate and solution temperature which were maintained as 42 cm 10 ml min and 22 1 c respectively according to table 2 at the breakthrough time t b with the increase in the quantity of biochar the adsorption capacity q b increased while the maximum adsorption capacity q s decreased however by increasing the quantity of biochar from 0 5 g to 1 g in the column breakthrough time t b saturation time t s and the total percentage of silver removal were increased further the total volume of treated water increased with an increase in the biochar quantity as more biochar particles into the fixed bed column resulted in an increase in the number of available active adsorption sites for ag interaction 52 thus the increase in the adsorbent quantity can be considered favourable in scaling up the fixed bed adsorption column for industrial operation similar findings were reported in the literature 68 further in the fixed bed column when the quantity of biochar exceeded 1 g of weight the aqueous flow was noticed to get blocked this limited the study to a maximum of 1 g of biochar 3 1 3 effect of ag and ag nps in the fixed bed column on bt curves silver either ag or ag nps adsorption by biochar has not been well explored and all these investigations were only in batch mode 2 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that reports the adsorption potential of biochar in the removal of ag and ag nps in a continuous mode silver ions ag and ag nps have different degrees of interaction with particular biochar because of their different chemical properties in this study ag nps had half the adsorption capacity and removal percentage of ag under the same testing conditions according to table 2 the initial concentration of 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag nps with 1 g biochar loading recorded the maximum adsorption capacity of 13 72 mg g and 19 12 mg g respectively however 50 mg l and 100 mg l of ag with 1 g biochar loading provided the maximum adsorption capacity of 42 78 mg g and 45 85 mg g respectively the results can be attributed to the ionic state of silver which is expected to directly influence adsorption 69 especially ionic silver has more affinity to the biochar than elemental silver such as ag nps 70 this could be explained as biochar being negatively charged in the water solution and attached with the positively charged ag moreover ag nps were coated with poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp this pvp tightly binds with the surface of the nanoparticles and helps to block them sterically from aggregate 71 the ag nps were adsorbed on the biochar surface because of the covalent interaction less strong than ionic between oxygen atom present in biochar and the carbonyl or the tertiary amine group of the pyrrolidone ring of pvp 63 72 in the scenario where the concentration of ag and ag nps was set as 100 mg l and 1 g biochar was loaded the fixed bed column got saturated more quickly for ag nps than for ag thus the total treated effluent volume at the saturation point veff s was 2100 ml and 900 ml respectively this saturation time or reduction in the treated volume of effluents for ag nps might be due to the short residence time in the column a shorter residence time limited the interaction between biochar and ag nps and may have led to low adsorption and low volume of treated effluents it is also worth mentioning that the possibility of batch adsorption study of ag nps hindered by technical difficulties cannot be ignored when it was required to collect the filtrate solution after batch adsorption for icp analysis the filtration process was also separating ag nps from the solution thus it was not possible to distinguish the effect of adsorption and filtration 3 2 simulation of bt curves and comparison with experimental bt curves thomas and yoon nelson models were used to compare the experimental results with theoretical model derived values table 3 summarizes the obtained theoretical values of silver ag and ag nps adsorption in a fixed bed column the thomas model considers all the adsorption parameters such as flow rate time and quantity of adsorbent but yoon nelson uses only time thus the thomas model seems to be more appropriate than the yoon nelson model an increase in the initial concentration resulted in a decrease in the thomas kinetic constant kt under all tested conditions for instance when the initial concentration of ag with 0 5 g of biochar loading was increased from 50 mg l to 100 mg l kt was noticed to decrease from 0 530 to 0 426 ml mg min respectively similar observations for both models were reported in a previous study of co ions adsorption 50 evidently the study showed that increasing the initial concentration of co from 25 mg l to 75 mg l decreased kt approximately three times from 0 00036 to 0 00012 ml mg min and similar results were obtained for ni ions the values for kt reduced from 0 00047 to 0 00013 ml mg min when the initial concentration of ni was increased from 25 mg l to 75 mg l 50 in contrast other kinetic parameter of the thomas model q 0 predicted adsorption bed capacity increased approximately two times with an increase in the initial concentration from 50 to 100 mg l of ag ions as well as ag nps for instance the values of q 0 increased from 23 84 to 47 25 mg g when the concentration of ag ions was increased from 50 to 100 mg l whereas for ag nps q 0 increased from 11 77 to 24 67 mg g these results are also consistent with the previous study carried out by 50 however opposite trends were noticed for the yoon nelson kinetic constant kyn that increased with an increase in the initial concentration of ag ions and ag nps for example kyn increased from 0 0274 to 0 0493 l mg min when the initial concentration of ag ions was increased from 50 to 100 mg l in addition τ min which represents the time required to complete 50 of breakthrough decreased from 34 87 to 12 90 min with an increase in the initial concentration these changes in kinetic parameters indicate the effect of mass transfer or hydrodynamic conditions on the models and thus should be used carefully in pilot scale studies additionally experimental and theoretical adsorption capacities for ag obtained at the saturation points were close to each other as well as those calculated from the batch experiments for ag nps initial ag nps concentration reversely affected the adsorption capacity derived from the yoon nelson model as reported in table 3 this could be due to the limitation of the yoon nelson model that assumes time as the only variable that affects bt curves a good correlation between the thomas and yoon nelson models was observed from the mid range of the breakthrough curves as shown in fig 4 this might be attributed to the rapid initial adsorption of pore diffusion or internal diffusion taking place at a slower rate depending on the silver particle size and pore size 73 these silver adsorption kinetics phenomena were the assumption of models that showed better compliance 56 furthermore both models can simulate the behaviour of the fixed bed column for all the experiments as shown in table 3 both the thomas and yoon nelson models had good agreement with the experimental breakthrough curves with a high correlation coefficient r2 values 0 90 implying the suitability of these models for the fixed bed column system similar results were reported when removing silver ions using vermiculite 56 however the experimental btcs in fig 4 showed a drastic rise at the beginning of the bt curves and after 75 100 min experimental lines of breakthrough curves were fitted well with the model derived curves this might be due to the rapid film diffusion or external diffusion at the beginning which was described by pseudo second order kinetic model 73 3 3 column regeneration and reusability after the first cycle of adsorption with 100 mg l of ag and 1 g of biochar loading the column was regenerated by using 0 05 m hno3 as eluent and running the second cycle of adsorption under similar conditions since under these conditions the column adsorbed the maximum quantity of silver the regeneration performance of this column could easily be possible to achieve for other column conditions where a lesser quantity of silver was adsorbed the regeneration process was repeated till the third cycle of adsorption to evaluate the reusability of the fixed bed column and understand the feasibility at an industrial scale in order to evaluate the performance the parameters such as maximum adsorption capacity q s at the saturation time t s saturation time t s removal and regeneration are reported in fig 5 according to the results in fig 5 maximum adsorption capacities q s at saturation time were noticed to be 45 85 43 38 and 39 26 mg g during the first second and third cycles respectively after the first adsorption cycle the regenerated column got saturated after 180 min operation which was 30 min early than the first cycle the loss in the maximum adsorption capacity was noticed to be 5 4 similarly after the second regeneration the column lost 14 4 maximum adsorption capacity compared to the first cycle moreover after each run the column treated 300 ml solution less than the previous run this capacity loss might occur due to the physicochemical change in the biochar by hno3 while regeneration and or the hno3 solution was unable to reach into some of the micropores to dissolve the adsorbed silver thus reducing the number of active adsorption sites similar capacity loss and lower volume of treated effluent were noticed in other studies which reported the use of a fixed bed adsorption column for silver ions removal 74 therefore it could be suggested that a setup that has three columns in series might be able to confirm the full removal of silver for a continuous process after three cycles of adsorptions the columns will need replacement with new materials to keep the column performance at optimum level 3 4 surface characteristics of silver loaded scgs biochar fig 6 a and b represent the sem images of biochar before adsorption c and d represent after adsorption of silver ions ag and e and f show the biochar after adsorption of ag nps these sem images were used to understand the change in surface characteristics and morphology of silver loaded scgs biochar before and after adsorption both forms of silver forms were noticed on the biochar surface as white beads in fig 6 c d e and f as silver backscatter electrons are stronger than light elements low atomic numbers such as carbon they appear brighter in the sem images 1 in addition there were no traces of such white beads on the raw biochar fig 6 a and b this indicates the presence of a significant amount of silver on the biochar 75 fig 6 c and d also indicated that the ag is oxidised on the biochar surface and formed ag nps which are distributed homogeneously however fig 6 e and f mainly showed the aggregates of ag nps but the aggregated quantity of ag nps was lower in this case which is expected due to the lower adsorption capacity of biochar contacted with ag nps containing solution from fig 6 g and h high peaks in the elemental analysis by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds confirmed that the white spots in the sem images are basically silver 76 implying successful adsorption of silver onto the scg biochar the oxygen signals in the eds spectrum could be attributed to adsorbed water and oxygen molecules to form silver oxide 1 in contrast aluminium and silicon peaks could be from sand which was used with scgs biochar in the fixed bed column to improve porosity x ray powder diffraction patterns of biochar before adsorption and after adsorption of ag ions and ag nps are shown in fig 7 a xrd spectrum of biochar before adsorption showed a broad peak with 2θ at around 24 which confirmed the existence of graphitic structure in the biochar 43 after the adsorption both the silver loaded biochar showed sharp peaks with 2θ at around 38 4 44 6 and 65 1 implying the presence of crystalline silver having face centred cubic fcc lattice structures 111 200 and 220 respectively 77 78 the xrd results further confirm that the white beads detected by sem eds were silver in addition higher intensity of xrd peaks corresponds to a higher degree of crystallinity 79 as noticed for biochar with ag nps compared to biochar with ag higher crystallinity might be explained as follows the lesser amount of ag nps may get ionised when in contact with the biochar to form silver ions however a few small sharp peaks of quartz were also identified at 2θ of around 20 9 26 5 and 29 9 80 as biochar collected after adsorption was contaminated with quartz sand which was used with biochar in the column sem eds and xrd analysis revealed the presence of silver in the biochar matrix furthermore xps analysis of the biochar after adsorption was conducted to determine the oxidation state of silver fig 7 b and c represent the xps analysis results of the biochar samples that were used to adsorb ag and ag nps respectively a separate data table of xps analysis is added as a supplementary document table s1 electron binding energy corresponding to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 orbitals were observed additionally in fig 7 b biochar adsorbed ag ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 could be divided into 368 56 369 34 and 374 54 375 29 ev respectively the peaks at the binding energy of 368 56 369 34 ev can confirm the presence of ag atomic concentration of 52 1 whereas peaks at 374 54 375 29 ev reveal the presence of metallic ag0 atomic concentration of 34 6 78 on the other hand peaks at nearly similar binding energies were also observed for the biochar with ag nps confirming the presence of both ag atomic concentration of 58 1 and ag0 atomic concentration of 38 6 81 multifunctional oxygenic groups presence on the biochar surface might participate in the electrostatic attraction during the adsorption process 82 both findings might confirm the chemical transformation of ag and ag nps in contact with scgs biochar which was also identified during the adsorption kinetic studies 73 previous research on the kinetic analysis showed that the silver adsorption by biochar was dominated by the pseudo second order kinetic model which was driven by surface interactions through chemisorption and precipitation 83 3 5 techno economic feasibility study sgcs derived biochar is eco friendly low cost and easily available in this study a single fixed bed column showed a good level of adsorption similar three columns in a series can ensure the complete removal of silver for instance 1 kg scgs biochar will be able to treat 1400 l of wastewater having 50 mg l of silver solution it can be noted that 50 mg l of silver concentration is quite higher than the realistic concentration which is 1 mg l therefore the same quantity of biochar may be able to treat several folds higher than the volume considered in this study in addition the same column can be used and regenerated at least three times by backwash with 0 05 m hno3 which will cost 2 5 as the scgs can be collected free of charge and dried by the sun there will be no additional cost for feedstock except the transportation cost although the biochar production by pyrolysis of scgs at 500 c is the most cost intensive process on the pilot scale the value added pyrolysis by product bio oil collection and selling can subsidise the energy cost of pyrolysis by around 50 12 84 the previous investigation showed that the production cost of biochar for a pilot scale pyrolysis plant could be usd 485 12 in addition pyrolytic conversion of the organic food waste such as scgs can reduce the ghg emission which is one of the major issues in view of global warming 85 however silver recovery from the spent biochar might also open some possibility of economic feasibility of the overall process after the silver recovery from biochar after 3rd cycle scgs biochar could be applied for soil remediation and carbon storage to avoid toxic impact and increase environmental benefit 86 compared to the environmental footprint and economic feasibility this fixed bed column process might be viable to be industrialised obviously it is a preliminary laboratory scale study where energy operational and equipment costs were not considered however adsorption capacity can significantly be increased by activation of biochar 87 and flow dynamics can be overcome by pelletising biochar before mixing with the sand 88 a detailed cost study of the full process using improvised biochar and treating real wastewater can confirm the prospect of this new approach 4 conclusion this study investigated the performance of a fixed bed column study to remove silver from wastewater using scg biochar in a continuous mode of operation this study provides the much needed fundamental understanding to evaluate the feasibility of scaling up this technique fixed bed column using scgs biochar demonstrated a significant removal efficiency of both ag and ag nps the initial concentration of silver biochar quantity and the form of silver ag and ag nps had a direct effect on column performance 50 mg l silver ions solution passing through a column with a flow rate of 10 ml min showed the maximum ag adsorption capacity of 42 78 mg g however under the same condition for 100 mg l of ag nps the maximum adsorption capacity for ag nps was 19 12 mg g thomas and yoon nelson s models fitted well the breakthrough curves and experimental operational parameters which could be useful to scale up the process for industrial application the column was regenerated and reused three times with a total capacity loss of only 14 4 using hno3 as eluent furthermore xrd sem eds and xps analysis of silver loaded biochar revealed the morphology and chemistry of silver ag and ag nps after adsorption especially the xps analysis demonstrated the chemical transformation of both forms of silver ag and ag nps which eventually reconfirmed that silver adsorption on scgs biochar was partially dominant by chemisorption and silver transformation in the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12969,membrane technology is a viable alternative to many conventional methods currently used to process traditional chinese medicine tcm however membrane fouling is a significant obstacle to the application of membrane technology in tcm in this study the ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling from tcm water extracts under constant transmembrane pressure tmp and constant flux operation was studied in connection with critical and threshold flux determinations meanwhile the physicochemical foulant membrane interactions were analyzed using the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory at constant tmp operation the high pressure resulted in a rapid drop in permeate flux at the start of the filtration period but the steady state fluxes did not increase significantly with an increase in tmp at constant flux operation the tmp increased somewhat when the permeate flux was below the threshold flux fouling was severe above the threshold flux and the tmp rapidly increased by displaying fouling resistance as a function of permeate volume the constant flux operation was compared to a constant tmp operation beginning at the same flux imposed during the constant flux operation below the threshold flux fouling resistance was similar for constant tmp and constant flux operations however above the threshold flux fouling resistance under constant flux operation was much greater than fouling resistance under constant tmp operation the results of physicochemical interactions showed that there are attractive interactions between hydrophobic membrane and foulants in the tcm water extracts these interactions should be considered a key factor leading to serious membrane fouling keywords constant transmembrane pressure constant flux membrane fouling traditional chinese medicine xdlvo theory 1 introduction traditional chinese medicine tcm refers to substances that are used to prevent treat and diagnose diseases and have functions of rehabilitation and health care under the guidance of tcm theory tcms are derived from plants animals and minerals but most are herbal medicines tcm preparation involves extraction separation purification concentration and drying extraction is usually the first step in tcm processing and water is the most commonly used extraction solvent due to the large polarity and good solubility of water the water extracts of tcm contain not only active ingredients but also a large number of inactive ingredients from the medicinal portion the medicinal portions of herbal medicine for example may include roots rhizomes skins flowers leaves seeds and other plant tissues these medicinal portions often contain a large number of plant tissue compositions such as protein starch pectin and tannin these components are usually without any special biological activity and are often taken as inactive ingredients or impurities such impurities are primarily responsible for serious problems with tcm preparations such as the need for large doses high hygroscopicity and poor stability which must be eliminated the conventional methods of removing impurities in tcm extracts include centrifugation ethanol precipitation and macroporous resin adsorption which are characterized by high energy consumption low efficiency high cost and environmental effects that do not meet the standards of modern green manufacturing compared with conventional methods membrane technology has the advantages of high efficiency low energy consumption and environmental safety many kinds of membrane technology have been used to process tcm such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration reverse osmosis and membrane distillation among them mf and uf are often used to remove the impurities in tcm extracts to replace conventional methods we recently reported a review of these membrane types 1 membrane technology is viewed as a viable alternative to many of the conventional methods currently used in the tcm industry 1 2 membrane fouling is a major drawback of membrane technology however indeed membrane fouling lowers permeate flux diminishes operational efficiency shortens the membrane s lifespan and the raises energy demands and frequency of membrane cleaning many factors affect membrane fouling including the operation mode constant transmembrane pressure and constant flux operation the filtration mode cross flow or dead end filtration hydrodynamic conditions and the membrane s characteristics several reports found that the operation mode has an important effect on the membrane system 3 9 membrane systems operate in two main modes constant transmembrane pressure tmp and constant flux operation under constant tmp operation the tmp of the membrane system is kept constant and the permeate flux is decreased due to the decline of membrane permeability caused by fouling under constant flux operation the permeate flux is kept constant and the tmp is increased in treating wastewater using a membrane bioreactor defrance and jaffrin 3 discovered that when filtration was carried out at constant permeate flux the tmp and in turn the hydraulic resistance of the fouling layer was lower than when filtration was carried out at constant tmp vyas et al 8 investigated the mf performance of lactalbumin suspensions during constant tmp and constant flux operations irreversible fouling was found to be worse under constant flux mode this was attributed to the smaller particle size deposition and hence greater pore penetration in low constant flux mode in a study of uf membrane fouling from emulsified oil miller et al 6 discovered that membrane fouling resistance was similar under constant tmp and constant flux operations when the permeate flux was low at high fluxes however membrane resistance with constant flux was substantially higher than with constant tmp he et al 4 found that the mf membrane fouling from oily water was comparable between constant tmp and constant flux operations at low permeate flux many studies 4 9 13 have illustrated that the permeate flux plays a key role in membrane fouling behavior under both constant tmp and constant flux operations bacchin et al 14 explained membrane fouling behavior according to the type of transport phenomena involved in the mass deposition the occurrence of membrane fouling can be taken as the combined action of molecular diffusion shear induced diffusion lateral migration and surface interactions the permeate flux in the membrane process considerably affects transport phenomena and therefore fouling behavior 14 several concepts have been proposed to explain the effect of permeate flux on membrane fouling behavior such as the critical flux 15 threshold flux 16 limiting flux 17 and sustainable flux 14 the rate and degree of membrane fouling are the core parameters that define different types of membrane fluxes among these fluxes the critical flux and threshold flux are widely used to characterize the fouling degree and to guide the efficient operation of membrane systems for different kinds of feed 13 18 20 macromolecules e g protein starch pectin and tannin in the tcm water extracts are considered to be the main foulants that cause serious membrane fouling 1 foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions are the fundamental principles of membrane fouling therefore studies on these interactions are helpful for understanding the fouling behavior of tcm extracts the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory has been widely used in the analysis of foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions in membrane fouling caused by organics 21 23 and it is a powerful tool for characterizing of physicochemical interactions to our knowledge the critical flux and threshold flux have not yet been applied in research on the membrane fouling behavior of tcm water extracts with complex components in this study we investigate the effect of constant tmp and constant flux operations on uf membrane fouling from tcm water extracts the critical flux and threshold flux are used to characterize membrane fouling behavior meanwhile foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions for tcm water extracts are analyzed the results of our study can serve as an important reference for operating membrane systems used to process tcm 2 background and theory 2 1 critical and threshold fluxes field et al 15 first proposed the concept of a critical flux in 1995 stating that there is a critical flux below which the flux does not diminish over time and above which fouling is seen the critical flux can be taken as the flux at which the flux tmp curve starts to deviate from linearity and it has two forms the strong form and the weak form fig 1 the flux at which the tmp begins to deviate from the pure water line is known as the strong form of critical flux the weak form assumes that fouling occurs extremely quickly upon start up and the flux tmp connection is lower than the pure water line the critical flux is also as the first permeate flux for which irreversible fouling appears 15 for the occurrence of critical flux bacchin et al 14 provided a detailed explanation based on the types of transport phenomena involved in mass deposition the classification of critical flux was also described based on flux tmp fouling equations critical flux mainly focuses on the permeate flux in a low fouling state especially in the flux below which the fouling does not occur critical flux is unconcerned with the rate of fouling and ignores the operation s economics the critical flux for complex feed is relatively low and consumes a significant amount of time and energy therefore the concept of a threshold flux became of focus of many researchers 16 24 26 field and pearce 16 first put forward the concept of a threshold flux as follows the threshold is that flux at or below which a low and near constant rate of fouling occurs but above which the rate of fouling increases markedly the fouling rate is the key to defining the threshold flux the threshold flux can distinguish between the slow and rapid fouling regimes allowing membrane systems to operate at sufficiently high flux with an acceptable fouling degree 2 2 fouling layer resistance 7 in membrane filtration with a fouling layer a resistance model based on darcy s law is commonly used 1 j 1 a dv dt p μ r m r c where j is the permeate flux l m2 h lmh p is the transmembrane pressure tmp pa μ is the viscosity of feed pa s r m is the resistance of a clean membrane m 1 r c is the fouling layer cake resistance m 1 and a is the effective filtration membrane area m2 the fouling layer resistance is commonly considered to be proportional to the solid mass deposited on the membrane surface furthermore under conditions of relatively thin fouling layers such as those in this study r c can be expressed as follows 2 r c α c b v a where α is the specific cake resistance m kg c b is the foulant concentration of bulk mg l and v is the cumulative permeate volume m3 in view of the fact that in practice c b is seldom determined the quantity 3 i α c b called the fouling index provides a measure of the feed fouling potential 2 3 modified fouling index under constant tmp operation we can substitute eq 2 into eq 1 4 μα c b 2 δ p a 2 v 2 μ r m δ p a v t 0 in order to interpret experimental data eq 4 is commonly modified as follows 5 t v μα c b 2 δ p a 2 v μ r m δ p a the modified fouling index mfi is defined as the slope of the linear portion of the t v versus v curve 27 6 mfi const pressure μα c b 2 δ p a 2 the mfi is derived based on the cake filtration theory a high mfi indicates a high resistance cake on the membrane during constant flux operation the membrane system pressure is increased with filtering time due to the occurrence of fouling boerlage et al 28 described the mfi derivation under constant flux operation eq 7 depicts the link between the tmp and filtering time 7 p j 2 μit jμ r m which describes the tmp increase that is needed to maintain a constant flux with a cake formed on a membrane the fouling index i can be determined from the slope of the linear region in a plot of p versus time mfi const flux is calculated as follows 8 mfi const flux μi 2 p 0 a 2 k j 2 1 2 p 0 a 2 where k is the slope of the p versus time curve and p 0 is the standard pressure of 2 bar 28 2 4 xdlvo theory according to the discussion by van oss 29 the interaction energy between two surfaces in water media is the sum of lifshitz van der waals lw acid base ab

ltd tongchuan shaanxi china the water extracts of salviae miltiorrhizae bge were prepared as follows 5 l of water was added to 500 g of salviae miltiorrhizae bge this was decocted twice for 1 5 h each time and the water extracts were then extracted from the residue with gauze the water extracts were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was stored in a refrigerator at 10 c the properties of the prepared tcm water extracts are listed in table 1 viscosity was measured using a brookfield viscometer lvdv ii brookfield engineering labs inc usa turbidity was determined with a scattered light turbidimeter wzs 188 nesa scientific instrument co ltd china ph and conductivity were measured using a conductivity meter sevenexcellence s400 k mettler toledo switzerland all tests were performed at room temperature the total dissolved solids tds were determined by placing a known volume of the sample in an evaporating dish and drying the sample fully in an oven at 105 2 c the protein starch pectin and tannin were determined as described in our previous work 31 bovine serum albumin bsa soluble starch ss pectin pe and tannin ta were taken as the macromolecule model foulants bsa pe and ta were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd ss was purchased from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 50 kda risingsun membrane technology beijing co ltd china were employed before using them the membranes were prefiltered with pure water at 3 bar pressure for 30 min such that the water flux reached a stable state 3 2 experimental setup and procedures a dead end filtration cell 8400 model millipore usa was used the dead end cell with an active membrane area of 0 01628 m2 was equipped with a porous support the filtrate was collected in a glass beaker placed on an electronic balance cpa 225d sartorius co ltd germany connected to a computer to record the permeate flux data a magnetic agitator was used to alter the stirring speed under constant pressure operation the desired pressure measured by a precision pressure gauge was supplied by a nitrogen gas cylinder a precision peristaltic pump bt100 1f baoding lange constant flow pump co ltd china was connected to the outlet of the permeate to control the flux during constant flux operation all operations were performed at room temperature 3 3 determining the critical flux and threshold flux the critical flux and threshold flux can be obtained from flux pressure measurements often by flux or pressure stepping 4 12 14 bacchin et al 14 give a detailed comparison of the different methods to understand the impact of operation modes on the fouling behavior of tcm water extracts we performed a pressure stepping experiment constant tmp mode and a flux stepping experiment constant flux mode for these experiments we started with a low pressure flux that was kept for a certain period of time until the flux pressure stabilized the pressure flux was then gradually increased at a low rate and each pressure flux was retained for a certain period of time while the flux pressure was recorded the critical flux can be taken as the flux at which the flux tmp curve starts to deviate from linearity as shown in fig 1 under the flux stepping experiment the threshold flux can be taken as the flux at which the slope dtmp dflux kpa lmh of the flux tmp curve increases markedly 3 4 contact angle measurements the contact angle of the pvdf membranes was measured using a contact angle detector dsa100 krüss germany the contact angle of foulants i e protein starch pectin and tannin was measured as follows 22 first four kinds of individual foulant solutions at 2 g l were prepared with deionized water and the dead end membrane filtration without stirring was conducted for 24 h to fully cover the membrane surface with foulants then the membrane was dried for 12 h at 40 c in a vacuum oven and the contact angle of the deposited foulant was measured using the contact angle detector meanwhile the foulant mixture solution consisting of protein starch pectin and tannin was prepared at 2 g l the concentration of each foulant was 0 5 g l and the operations of membrane filtration and the contact angle measurement were conducted according to the above mentioned procedures in order to understand the physicochemical foulant membrane interactions in real tcm material systems the membrane filtration of tcm water extracts obtained in this study was carried out and the contact angle of foulant membrane was measured the contact angle values of the pvdf membrane foulants and tcm water extracts are shown in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 critical and threshold flux determination the constant tmp method was used to determine the critical flux the results are shown in fig 2 when increasing the tmp the flux tmp line was linear until the tmp increased to 20 kpa once the tmp was 20 kpa the flux tmp line began to deviate under constant pressure mode the critical flux was delimited at the point where the flux tmp line became non linear 14 so flux of 6 27 lmh the stable flux under the tmp of 20 kpa was taken as the critical flux since the feed flux tmp curve was significantly lower than the pure water line this critical flux was the weak form of critical flux when the tmp was higher than 20 kpa the rate of the increase in flux became sluggish and the stable flux in the tmp range of 25 100 kpa was similar the flux became independent of tmp during this stage and reached its highest value which can be taken as the limiting flux 6 63 lmh fig 2 also shows significant evidence of hysteresis after decreasing the tmp when reducing the tmp the flux was far below that at the same tmp when the tmp increased the same phenomenon was also observed by ahmad et al 32 in their study on the uf behavior of palm oil mill effluent the results from fig 2 show that the tcm water extracts can cause serious membrane fouling leading to low production efficiency this hinders the wide application of membrane technology in the field of tcm the different macromolecules including protein starch pectin and tannin co existing in tcm water extracts are the main foulants they render tcm water extracts complex macromolecule solutions that cause severe membrane fouling and low permeability 1 therefore an appropriate operation mode and operation parameters are important for membrane filtration with tcm water extracts the effects of different operation modes and parameters are discussed in section 4 4 fig 3 depicts the effect of the stirring speed on the critical flux under constant tmp operation the critical flux increased with an increase in the stirring speed at the stirring speed of 0 rpm the permeation flux increased only slightly when the tmp increased from 10 kpa to 15 kpa once the tmp was 15 kpa the permeation flux showed a slight downward trend and a steady flux was reached when the tmp was above 30 kpa according to the definition of critical flux it is difficult to determine the critical flux due to the sensitive change in the initially narrow tmp variation range the steady flux at a tmp of 15 kpa was 1 47 lmh thus the critical flux was below 1 47 lmh at a stirring speed of 0 rpm the critical flux rapidly increased and reached 6 27 lmh when the stirring speed increased to 200 rpm the critical flux increased from 6 27 lmh to 9 58 lmh when the stirring speed changed from 200 rpm to 400 rpm when the stirring speed increased to 600 rpm the critical flux only reached 10 28 lmh and the rate of increase decreased considerably bacchin et al 14 provided a detailed analysis of the effect of hydrodynamics on the critical flux generally the critical flux increases with an increase in the strength of hydrodynamics high stirring speeds represent strong hydrodynamics which have several effects they enhance the reverse diffusion rate of substances from the membrane surface to the main body of the solution they reduce the concentration of substances on the membrane surface they weaken the concentration polarization phenomenon and they reduce the thickness of the membrane boundary layer together these effects result in an increased critical flux with an increase in stirring speed the critical flux does not always increase but will eventually reach a steady state flux this is because the high flux resulting from high stirring speeds leads to more substance deposition on the membrane surface which partially offsets the flux increase caused by the high stirring speed at the same time high stirring speeds incur high energy consumption therefore it is necessary to control the hydrodynamic conditions of the membrane system within an appropriate range in order to improve the membrane flux and reduce energy consumption the feed concentration is also an important factor for the critical flux as shown in fig 4 the critical flux increased from 6 27 lmh to 9 58 lmh when the concentration of tcm water extracts declined from 36 6 mg ml to 12 2 mg ml the feed concentration can affect the dynamic viscosity of feed and hence affect the transportation rate of substances from the membrane face meanwhile other physicochemical properties of feed such as the ionic strength ph and conductivity can also be affected by the change of feed concentration on the whole it is beneficial to reduce membrane fouling and increase the membrane flux by declining the feed concentration especially for complex feed the variations in tmp with permeate flux using the flux stepping method in constant flux mode are shown in fig 5 the initial flux was set to 5 53 lmh and then increased gradually at 15 min intervals for each flux point in order for the system to reach a steady state three linear regressions labeled a b and c were drawn in accordance with the results the coefficient r2 of lines a b and c was 0 9392 0 9838 and 0 9960 respectively a higher r2 represents a good linear relationship the slope dtmp dflux kpa lmh of regression for lines a b and c was 1 4067 7 1215 and 12 121 respectively the slope represents the rate of fouling and the reciprocal of the slope dflux dtmp lmh kpa represents the membrane permeability the greater the slope the greater the rate of fouling and the lower the membrane permeability the intersection of two regression lines is the inflection point of the flux at which the pollution state of the membrane system becomes more serious as seen in fig 5 the intersection of regression lines a and b is the start up flux where the tmp flux line becomes non linear according to the above definition at a flux value of 8 77 lmh the intersection of regression lines a and b represents the weak form of the critical flux the intersection of regression lines b and c represents the flux at which the rate of fouling increases markedly so a flux value of 12 85 lmh the intersection of regression lines b and c is the threshold flux at fluxes lower than 8 77 lmh the tmp and fouling rate of the membrane system remained low with an increase in flux as shown by regression line a indicating slight membrane fouling when the flux was between 8 77 and 12 85 lmh the tmp was increased slightly with the flux and the fouling rate was relatively stable at all fluxes as shown by regression line b at fluxes 12 85 lmh the tmp points began to deviate from regression line b and fouling increased at a greater rate indicating more serious membrane fouling fig 5 shows that the tmp increased nonlinearly in region c and so only the first three points were used to fit line c with a continuous increase in flux the tmp increased rapidly and irregularly based on the above analysis the flux under constant flux operation can be divided into three regions region i 8 77 lmh light fouling region ii 8 77 12 85 lmh low fouling and region iii 12 85 lmh rapid fouling region i is a sub critical zone at which the flux is below the critical flux regions ii and iii are supra critical zones at which the flux is above the critical flux taking into account operational efficiency and fouling costs the actual flux should be controlled in a suitable range at which the membrane system had satisfactory flux and acceptable fouling to extend the lifespan of the membrane therefore given our results the flux in region ii 8 77 12 85 lmh between the critical flux and threshold flux is desirable the factors that affect the critical flux were reviewed by bacchin et al 14 including feed properties e g ph ionic strength concentration and particle size hydrodynamics e g crossflow velocity and membrane properties e g porosity pore size surface charge and hydrophilicity the factors that affect the critical flux also affect the threshold flux therefore the critical flux and threshold flux will vary for different feeds and membrane systems however the fouling regions of a membrane system namely the light fouling region low fouling region and rapid fouling region obtained from the critical flux and threshold flux are universal as long as the critical flux and threshold flux can be determined hydrodynamics at the membrane surface have a major influence on the critical flux and threshold flux 14 generally the critical flux and threshold flux increase with the strength of the hydrodynamics for specific feeds and membrane systems a larger flux region can be divided according to membrane fouling under different hydrodynamic conditions with a division of zones similar to that in fig 5 we defined the three different zones shown in fig 6 the light fouling zone blue zone the low fouling zone yellow zone and the rapid fouling zone white zone compared with fig 5 the zone division in fig 6 contains the critical and threshold fluxes at different hydrodynamic conditions covering a wider range of operating conditions with better guidance for practical operations comparing the results of the critical flux obtained from under the modes of constant flux and constant pressure we found that the critical flux in constant flux mode was higher than that in constant pressure mode similar results were observed by xu and gao 12 in the uf of seawater under constant tmp operation the initial flux is the maximum flux and the flux declines as the filtration time increases by contrast the overall permeate flux is kept constant under constant flux operation therefore there is a difference in hydrodynamic conditions and fouling behavior between the two operations under constant tmp operation it is often difficult to control the tmp at a sufficiently low value to accurately measure the critical flux this is especially problematic for complex feed on the other hand if several pressure points in the initial period are not properly controlled the initial flux will most likely exceed the actual critical flux causing serious membrane fouling and making the detected critical flux less than the actual critical flux therefore the constant flux operation is more commonly used to detect the critical and threshold fluxes 4 13 based on the above the critical flux 8 77 lmh obtained from the constant flux operation was used as the critical flux in the following analysis and discussion 4 2 operation at constant tmp model the constant tmp operation was performed at six pressures 10 20 33 66 100 and 120 kpa the temporal variation of flux under different tmps is shown in fig 7 the flux decreased rapidly during the initial filtration 0 5 min and the declining trends became more moderate as the filtration time increased this is typical flux behavior under constant tmp operation a higher tmp will lead to a higher initial permeation flux which makes pollutants deposit on the membrane surface at a faster speed eventually causing more serious membrane fouling as shown in fig 7 the steady state fluxes of different tmps were similar and did not increase significantly with an increase in tmp this can be explained by the severe membrane fouling caused by high tmp counteracting the rise in permeate flux caused by the increase in tmp based the flux data shown in fig 7 we obtained related parameters listed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the initial flux j0 at tmps of 10 and 20 kpa was 6 63 and 7 37 lmh respectively both of which were lower than the critical flux 8 77 lmh and can be taken as subcritical flux operations the j0 at tmps of 33 66 100 and 120 kpa were all higher than the critical flux 8 77 lmh and can be taken as supercritical flux operations the results showed that both fdr 0 5min and fdr 0 120min for subcritical flux operations are significantly lower than those for supercritical flux operations meanwhile we found that the fdr 0 5min accounts for a large proportion in the total fdr especially for supercritical flux operations four classical membrane blocking models 33 viz complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration models are often used to describe the flux decline mechanisms at constant tmp operation fig 8 shows the experimental data in fig 7 plotted in terms of t v versus cumulative permeate volume the experimental data under different tmps fit the cake filtration model well during almost the entire filtration process expect for a short initial period the fitting coefficient r2 of the membrane blocking models for different tmps at the initial filtration period is shown in table 4 compared with the intermediate blocking model and complete blocking model the standard blocking model fits the experiment data well under different tmps during the initial filtration period 4 3 operation at constant flux model four fluxes were used under constant flux operation 6 63 7 37 10 32 and 14 00 lmh among these fluxes two fluxes 6 63 and 7 37 lmh were below the critical flux i e 8 77 lmh one flux 10 32 lmh was below the threshold flux i e 12 87 lmh and one flux was above the threshold flux i e 12 87 lmh at the same time the fluxes of 6 63 7 37 and 14 00 lmh were identical to the initial membrane fluxes of 10 20 and 33 kpa respectively created under constant tmp operation the temporal variation of tmp and normalized pressure increase under different constant fluxes are shown in fig 9a and b the tmp increased as the forced flux increased higher fluxes delivered more foulant to the membrane surface increasing foulant buildup on the membrane however there was a considerable qualitative difference in fouling behavior across membranes operating above and below the threshold flux membranes operating at 6 63 and 7 37 lmh i e below the threshold flux showed only a slight increase in tmp during the first few minutes followed by a gradual increase in tmp at the initial period of filtration the concentration polarization and pore blockage were often the main factors responsible for membrane fouling fouling could not be avoided at start up even at extremely low fluxes this result was also found by miller et al 6 and marshall et al 34 the membranes quickly fouled at fluxes of 14 lmh above the threshold flux foulants were transported to the membrane surface faster than they could be eliminated by shear forces and diffusion over the threshold flux others researchers reported tmp profiles with a similar shape in which the tmp exhibited a sharp upturn after fouling and then rapidly increased 6 13 the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface which increased the resistance to water transport through the membrane likely corresponded to the upturn in the tmp profile 4 4 comparison of constant tmp and constant flux models in membrane fouling profiles the membrane fouling resistance with a cumulative permeate volume between constant tmp and constant flux operations below the threshold flux i e 12 87 lmh is shown in fig 10 constant flux operations were carried out at 6 63 and 7 37 lmh and constant tmp operations were carried out at 10 and 20 kpa corresponding to initial fluxes of 6 63 and 7 37 lmh respectively the membrane fouling resistance for both constant tmp and constant flow operations showed a trend of rapid increase during the initial period following by relative stability for a long time as illustrated in fig 10 in general the interaction between pollutants and the membrane reduced fouling in start up filtration when the feed comes into contact with the membrane the pollutants in the feed are adsorbed at the interior and surface of the membrane causing the membrane to become blocked we found that the fouling resistance was similar between the constant tmp operation at 10 kpa and the constant flux operation at 6 63 lmh and between the constant tmp operation at 20 kpa and the constant flux operation at 7 67 lmh the fouling resistance was found to be comparable between the constant tmp operation at 10 kpa and the constant flux operation at 6 63 lmh as well as between the constant tmp operation at 20 kpa and the constant flux operation at 7 67 lmh he et al 4 and miller et al 6 discovered similar phenomena according to their findings the fouling resistance was comparable in all constant tmp and constant flux operations below the threshold flux however in our study the fouling resistance increased significantly with increasing constant tmp and flux even below the threshold flux the difference in fouling behavior below the threshold flux may be caused mainly by feed property differences changes in operational conditions may have a strong impact on the fouling behavior of highly polluting feeds membrane fouling resistances produced during constant tmp and constant flux operations above the threshold flux i e 12 85 lmh are shown in fig 11 an initial flux of 14 lmh was obtained in a constant tmp operation at 33 kpa and a constant flux operation was also performed at 14 lmh compared with the fouling that occurred below the threshold flux fouling above the threshold flux produced distinct behavior under constant tmp and constant flux operations the membrane fouling resistance produced under the constant flux operation was similar to that produced under the constant tmp operation when the cumulative permeate volume was less than about 10 ml however fouling resistance increased rapidly at constant flux when the cumulative permeate volume was larger than 10 ml which was much greater than fouling resistance during the constant tmp operation similar behavior was observed by miller et al 6 the initial high flux over the threshold flux induced quick fouling and a steep drop in permeate flux in a short amount of time during the constant tmp operation as illustrated in fig 7 following that the permeate flux decreased below the threshold flux the fouling rate was reduced and ultimately the fouling resistance reached a somewhat stable state table 5 compares the mfi and fouling index between constant tmp and constant flux operations below the threshold flux both the mfi and the fouling index under constant flux operation showed lower values than those under constant tmp operation above the threshold flux both the mfi and the fouling index under constant flux operation far outweighed those under constant tmp operation the concept of a local flux proposed by ognier et al 35 can explain the fouling phenomenon under a constant flux operation the number of pores open to the permeate flow decreases due to interactions between pollutants and the membrane as the permeate flow remains constant throughout the constant flux operation the local flux in the remaining open pores increases to maintain the same flux potentially increasing pollutant transport to the membrane and causing faster fouling the local flux reaches a very high level once numerous pores are blocked and a cake layer develops resulting in extremely high fouling resistance when the flux is above the threshold flux at constant flux operation the local flux will become much greater than the threshold flux in a short time causing more serious membrane fouling 4 5 foulant membrane interactions the surface tension parameters for the individual foulants bas ss pe and ta foulant mixtures and tcm water extracts table 6 showed that all of them exhibited high electron donor monopolarity i e high electron donor components γ and low electron acceptor components r this is similar to the alginate and humic acid reported in previous studies 21 22 the free energy of cohesion g cwc tot the sum of lw and ab free energy components represents the interaction energy when two surfaces of the same material are immersed in a solvent water in this study and brought into contact here g cwc tot provides quantitative insights regarding the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a given material if g cwc tot is negative the material is in a thermodynamically unstable state and tends to attract each other in water indicating its apolar property hydrophobicity if the g cwc tot is positive the material is in a thermodynamically stable state and tends to repulse each other indicating its polar property hydrophilicity as shown in table 6 the g cwc tot of bsa pe and the foulant mixtures is negative and the g cwc tot of ss ta and tcm water extracts is positive this indicates that ss ta and tcm water extracts have relative stronger hydrophilicity than bsa and pe which are the same results from the contact angle with water table 2 ss is a polysaccharide compound containing a large number of hydroxyl groups and ta comprises polyphenols with a large number of phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups as such ss and ta have relatively strong hydrophilicity tcm water extracts are obtained from the roots and rhizomes of salviae miltiorrhizae bge which contain not only ss and ta but also water soluble phenolic acids including salvianolic acid a salvianolic acid b salvianolic acid c caffeic acid and so on thus tcm water extracts are hydrophilic the virgin pvdf membrane had the lowest g cwc tot at 101 04 mj m2 indicating the strongest hydrophobicity the surface free energy of adhesion g cwm tot between foulants and the membrane is shown in table 7 here g cwm tot provides quantitative insights into the interactions between foulants and the membrane all of the values of g cwm tot are negative which means that attractive interactions occur between foulants and the membrane from the values of g cwm tot for ss ta and tcm water extracts these foulants are expected to exhibit relatively lower adhesion than those of bsa pe and foulant mixtures with the pvdf membrane moreover our results indicate that protein and pectin may play a key role in the membrane fouling of tcm water extracts many studies have found that hydrophobic membrane foulant and foulant foulant interactions have an important effect on the fouling state of mf and uf 36 38 in general the initial decline of permeate flux is often caused by the interaction between foulants and membranes 21 as shown in figs 7 and 9 the permeate flux tmp rapidly declined increased at the initial stage of membrane filtration indicating serious membrane fouling caused by the hydrophobic interactions between foulants and the membrane therefore the inhibition of foulant migration toward the membrane surface is beneficial for weakening the hydrophobic interactions 38 this can be realized by strengthening the hydrodynamic conditions for example by increasing crossflow intensity and using a turbulence promoter on the other hand membrane modification is a relatively simple and effective way to realize special functions in membrane materials e g high anti fouling capacity 39 super wettability 40 super amphiphobic 41 and intelligent responsiveness 42 many researchers have shown that the adsorption of hydrophilic substances e g dopamine 43 44 polyethylene glycol 45 and chitosan 46 on the surface or the inner pore wall of membrane materials by certain methods e g blending impregnation coating and grafting can effectively enhance antifouling characteristics this is mainly due to the weakening of hydrophobic interactions between foulants and the membrane by improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane materials 5 conclusions we studied the effect of constant tmp and constant flux operations on membrane fouling from tcm water extracts the critical flux weak form and threshold flux of tcm water extracts with complex components were determined meanwhile the physicochemical foulant membrane interactions for tcm water extracts were analyzed using xdlvo theory constant tmp operation experiments were performed at different pressures high tmp resulted in a high initial flux and a rapid drop in permeate flux at the beginning of the filtration period the steady state fluxes did not increase significantly with an increase in tmp this can be explained by the severe membrane fouling caused by high tmp counteracting the rise in permeate flux caused by the increase in tmp constant flux operation experiments were carried out at fluxes above and below the threshold flux the tmp increased somewhat when the permeate flux was below the threshold flux fouling was severe above the threshold flux and the tmp rapidly increased by displaying fouling resistance as a function of permeate volume we compared constant flux operation fouling resistance to constant tmp operation fouling resistance beginning at the same flux imposed during the constant flux operation below the threshold flux the fouling resistance under constant tmp and constant flux operations was similar however above the threshold flux the fouling resistance under constant flux operation was much greater than that under constant tmp operation we also found that the critical flux and threshold flux are relatively low under both constant tmp and constant flux operations this indicates that there is serious fouling in the membrane process of tcm water extracts the analysis of the physicochemical interactions showed that there are attractive interactions between the hydrophobic pvdf membrane and foulants including protein starch pectin and tannin in the tcm water extracts these interactions should be considered a key factor leading to serious membrane fouling therefore the application of anti fouling strategies that target these interactions including the inhibition of foulant migration and hydrophilic modification of membrane materials would be beneficial for reducing membrane fouling in tcm water extracts and improving the efficiency of

12969,membrane technology is a viable alternative to many conventional methods currently used to process traditional chinese medicine tcm however membrane fouling is a significant obstacle to the application of membrane technology in tcm in this study the ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling from tcm water extracts under constant transmembrane pressure tmp and constant flux operation was studied in connection with critical and threshold flux determinations meanwhile the physicochemical foulant membrane interactions were analyzed using the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory at constant tmp operation the high pressure resulted in a rapid drop in permeate flux at the start of the filtration period but the steady state fluxes did not increase significantly with an increase in tmp at constant flux operation the tmp increased somewhat when the permeate flux was below the threshold flux fouling was severe above the threshold flux and the tmp rapidly increased by displaying fouling resistance as a function of permeate volume the constant flux operation was compared to a constant tmp operation beginning at the same flux imposed during the constant flux operation below the threshold flux fouling resistance was similar for constant tmp and constant flux operations however above the threshold flux fouling resistance under constant flux operation was much greater than fouling resistance under constant tmp operation the results of physicochemical interactions showed that there are attractive interactions between hydrophobic membrane and foulants in the tcm water extracts these interactions should be considered a key factor leading to serious membrane fouling keywords constant transmembrane pressure constant flux membrane fouling traditional chinese medicine xdlvo theory 1 introduction traditional chinese medicine tcm refers to substances that are used to prevent treat and diagnose diseases and have functions of rehabilitation and health care under the guidance of tcm theory tcms are derived from plants animals and minerals but most are herbal medicines tcm preparation involves extraction separation purification concentration and drying extraction is usually the first step in tcm processing and water is the most commonly used extraction solvent due to the large polarity and good solubility of water the water extracts of tcm contain not only active ingredients but also a large number of inactive ingredients from the medicinal portion the medicinal portions of herbal medicine for example may include roots rhizomes skins flowers leaves seeds and other plant tissues these medicinal portions often contain a large number of plant tissue compositions such as protein starch pectin and tannin these components are usually without any special biological activity and are often taken as inactive ingredients or impurities such impurities are primarily responsible for serious problems with tcm preparations such as the need for large doses high hygroscopicity and poor stability which must be eliminated the conventional methods of removing impurities in tcm extracts include centrifugation ethanol precipitation and macroporous resin adsorption which are characterized by high energy consumption low efficiency high cost and environmental effects that do not meet the standards of modern green manufacturing compared with conventional methods membrane technology has the advantages of high efficiency low energy consumption and environmental safety many kinds of membrane technology have been used to process tcm such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration reverse osmosis and membrane distillation among them mf and uf are often used to remove the impurities in tcm extracts to replace conventional methods we recently reported a review of these membrane types 1 membrane technology is viewed as a viable alternative to many of the conventional methods currently used in the tcm industry 1 2 membrane fouling is a major drawback of membrane technology however indeed membrane fouling lowers permeate flux diminishes operational efficiency shortens the membrane s lifespan and the raises energy demands and frequency of membrane cleaning many factors affect membrane fouling including the operation mode constant transmembrane pressure and constant flux operation the filtration mode cross flow or dead end filtration hydrodynamic conditions and the membrane s characteristics several reports found that the operation mode has an important effect on the membrane system 3 9 membrane systems operate in two main modes constant transmembrane pressure tmp and constant flux operation under constant tmp operation the tmp of the membrane system is kept constant and the permeate flux is decreased due to the decline of membrane permeability caused by fouling under constant flux operation the permeate flux is kept constant and the tmp is increased in treating wastewater using a membrane bioreactor defrance and jaffrin 3 discovered that when filtration was carried out at constant permeate flux the tmp and in turn the hydraulic resistance of the fouling layer was lower than when filtration was carried out at constant tmp vyas et al 8 investigated the mf performance of lactalbumin suspensions during constant tmp and constant flux operations irreversible fouling was found to be worse under constant flux mode this was attributed to the smaller particle size deposition and hence greater pore penetration in low constant flux mode in a study of uf membrane fouling from emulsified oil miller et al 6 discovered that membrane fouling resistance was similar under constant tmp and constant flux operations when the permeate flux was low at high fluxes however membrane resistance with constant flux was substantially higher than with constant tmp he et al 4 found that the mf membrane fouling from oily water was comparable between constant tmp and constant flux operations at low permeate flux many studies 4 9 13 have illustrated that the permeate flux plays a key role in membrane fouling behavior under both constant tmp and constant flux operations bacchin et al 14 explained membrane fouling behavior according to the type of transport phenomena involved in the mass deposition the occurrence of membrane fouling can be taken as the combined action of molecular diffusion shear induced diffusion lateral migration and surface interactions the permeate flux in the membrane process considerably affects transport phenomena and therefore fouling behavior 14 several concepts have been proposed to explain the effect of permeate flux on membrane fouling behavior such as the critical flux 15 threshold flux 16 limiting flux 17 and sustainable flux 14 the rate and degree of membrane fouling are the core parameters that define different types of membrane fluxes among these fluxes the critical flux and threshold flux are widely used to characterize the fouling degree and to guide the efficient operation of membrane systems for different kinds of feed 13 18 20 macromolecules e g protein starch pectin and tannin in the tcm water extracts are considered to be the main foulants that cause serious membrane fouling 1 foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions are the fundamental principles of membrane fouling therefore studies on these interactions are helpful for understanding the fouling behavior of tcm extracts the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory has been widely used in the analysis of foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions in membrane fouling caused by organics 21 23 and it is a powerful tool for characterizing of physicochemical interactions to our knowledge the critical flux and threshold flux have not yet been applied in research on the membrane fouling behavior of tcm water extracts with complex components in this study we investigate the effect of constant tmp and constant flux operations on uf membrane fouling from tcm water extracts the critical flux and threshold flux are used to characterize membrane fouling behavior meanwhile foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions for tcm water extracts are analyzed the results of our study can serve as an important reference for operating membrane systems used to process tcm 2 background and theory 2 1 critical and threshold fluxes field et al 15 first proposed the concept of a critical flux in 1995 stating that there is a critical flux below which the flux does not diminish over time and above which fouling is seen the critical flux can be taken as the flux at which the flux tmp curve starts to deviate from linearity and it has two forms the strong form and the weak form fig 1 the flux at which the tmp begins to deviate from the pure water line is known as the strong form of critical flux the weak form assumes that fouling occurs extremely quickly upon start up and the flux tmp connection is lower than the pure water line the critical flux is also as the first permeate flux for which irreversible fouling appears 15 for the occurrence of critical flux bacchin et al 14 provided a detailed explanation based on the types of transport phenomena involved in mass deposition the classification of critical flux was also described based on flux tmp fouling equations critical flux mainly focuses on the permeate flux in a low fouling state especially in the flux below which the fouling does not occur critical flux is unconcerned with the rate of fouling and ignores the operation s economics the critical flux for complex feed is relatively low and consumes a significant amount of time and energy therefore the concept of a threshold flux became of focus of many researchers 16 24 26 field and pearce 16 first put forward the concept of a threshold flux as follows the threshold is that flux at or below which a low and near constant rate of fouling occurs but above which the rate of fouling increases markedly the fouling rate is the key to defining the threshold flux the threshold flux can distinguish between the slow and rapid fouling regimes allowing membrane systems to operate at sufficiently high flux with an acceptable fouling degree 2 2 fouling layer resistance 7 in membrane filtration with a fouling layer a resistance model based on darcy s law is commonly used 1 j 1 a dv dt p μ r m r c where j is the permeate flux l m2 h lmh p is the transmembrane pressure tmp pa μ is the viscosity of feed pa s r m is the resistance of a clean membrane m 1 r c is the fouling layer cake resistance m 1 and a is the effective filtration membrane area m2 the fouling layer resistance is commonly considered to be proportional to the solid mass deposited on the membrane surface furthermore under conditions of relatively thin fouling layers such as those in this study r c can be expressed as follows 2 r c α c b v a where α is the specific cake resistance m kg c b is the foulant concentration of bulk mg l and v is the cumulative permeate volume m3 in view of the fact that in practice c b is seldom determined the quantity 3 i α c b called the fouling index provides a measure of the feed fouling potential 2 3 modified fouling index under constant tmp operation we can substitute eq 2 into eq 1 4 μα c b 2 δ p a 2 v 2 μ r m δ p a v t 0 in order to interpret

mfi const pressure μα c b 2 δ p a 2 the mfi is derived based on the cake filtration theory a high mfi indicates a high resistance cake on the membrane during constant flux operation the membrane

standard pressure of 2 bar 28 2 4 xdlvo theory according to the discussion by van oss 29 the interaction energy between two surfaces in water media is the sum of lifshitz van der waals lw acid base ab

ltd tongchuan shaanxi china the water extracts of salviae miltiorrhizae bge were prepared as follows 5 l of water was added to 500 g of salviae miltiorrhizae bge this was decocted twice for 1 5 h each

were performed at room temperature the total dissolved solids tds were determined by placing a known volume of the sample in an evaporating dish and drying the sample fully in an oven at 105 2 c the protein starch pectin and tannin were determined as described in our previous work 31 bovine serum albumin bsa soluble starch ss pectin pe and tannin ta were taken as the macromolecule model foulants bsa pe and ta were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd ss was purchased from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 50 kda risingsun membrane technology beijing co ltd china were employed before using them the membranes were prefiltered with pure water at 3 bar pressure for 30 min such that the water flux reached a stable state 3 2 experimental setup and procedures a dead end filtration cell 8400 model millipore usa was used the dead end cell with an active membrane area of 0 01628 m2 was equipped with a porous support the filtrate was collected in a glass beaker placed on an electronic balance cpa 225d sartorius co ltd germany connected to a computer to record the permeate flux data a magnetic agitator was used to alter the stirring speed under constant pressure operation the desired pressure measured by a precision pressure gauge was supplied by a nitrogen gas cylinder a precision peristaltic pump bt100 1f baoding lange constant flow pump co ltd china was connected to the outlet of the permeate to control the flux during constant flux operation all operations were performed at room temperature 3 3 determining the critical flux and threshold flux the critical flux and threshold flux can be obtained from flux pressure measurements often by flux or pressure stepping 4 12 14 bacchin et al 14 give a detailed comparison of the different methods to understand the impact of operation modes on the fouling behavior of tcm water extracts we performed a pressure stepping experiment constant tmp mode and a flux stepping experiment constant flux mode for these experiments we started with a low pressure flux that was kept for a certain period of time until the flux pressure stabilized the pressure flux was then gradually increased at a low rate and each pressure flux was retained for a certain period of time while the flux pressure was recorded the critical flux can be taken as the flux at which the flux tmp curve starts to deviate from linearity as shown in fig 1 under the flux stepping experiment the threshold flux can be taken as the flux at which the slope dtmp dflux kpa lmh of the flux tmp curve increases markedly 3 4 contact angle measurements the contact angle of the pvdf membranes was measured using a contact angle detector dsa100 krüss germany the contact angle of foulants i e protein starch pectin and tannin was measured as follows 22 first four kinds of individual foulant solutions at 2 g l were prepared with deionized water and the dead end membrane filtration without stirring was conducted for 24 h to fully cover the membrane surface with foulants then the membrane was dried for 12 h at 40 c in a vacuum oven and the contact angle of the deposited foulant was measured using the contact angle detector meanwhile the foulant mixture solution consisting of protein starch pectin and tannin was prepared at 2 g l the concentration of each foulant was 0 5 g l and the operations of membrane filtration and the contact angle measurement were conducted according to the above mentioned procedures in order to understand the physicochemical foulant membrane interactions in real tcm material systems the membrane filtration of tcm water extracts obtained in this study was carried out and the contact angle of foulant membrane was measured the contact angle values of the pvdf membrane foulants and tcm water extracts are shown in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 critical and threshold flux determination the constant tmp method was used to determine the critical flux the results are shown in fig 2 when increasing the tmp the flux tmp line was linear until the tmp increased to 20 kpa once the tmp was 20 kpa the flux tmp line began to deviate under constant pressure mode the critical flux was delimited at the point where the flux tmp line became non linear 14 so flux of 6 27 lmh the stable flux under the tmp of 20 kpa was taken as the critical flux since the feed flux tmp curve was significantly lower than the pure water line this critical flux was the weak form of critical flux when the tmp was higher than 20 kpa the rate of the increase in flux became sluggish and the stable flux in the tmp range of 25 100 kpa was similar the flux became independent of tmp during this stage and reached its highest value which can be taken as the limiting flux 6 63 lmh fig 2 also shows significant evidence of hysteresis after decreasing the tmp when reducing the tmp the flux was far below that at the same tmp when the tmp increased the same phenomenon was also observed by ahmad et al 32 in their study on the uf behavior of palm oil mill effluent the results from fig 2 show that the tcm water extracts can cause serious membrane fouling leading to low production efficiency this hinders the wide application of membrane technology in the field of tcm the different macromolecules including protein starch pectin and tannin co existing in tcm water extracts are the main foulants they render tcm water extracts complex macromolecule solutions that cause severe membrane fouling and low permeability 1 therefore an appropriate operation mode and operation parameters are important for membrane filtration with tcm water extracts the effects of different operation modes and parameters are discussed in section 4 4 fig 3 depicts the effect of the stirring speed on the critical flux under constant tmp operation the critical flux increased with an increase in the stirring speed at the stirring speed of 0 rpm the permeation flux increased only slightly when the tmp increased from 10 kpa to 15 kpa once the tmp was 15 kpa the permeation flux showed a slight downward trend and a steady flux was reached when the tmp was above 30 kpa according to the definition of critical flux it is difficult to determine the critical flux due to the sensitive change in the initially narrow tmp variation range the steady flux at a tmp of 15 kpa was 1 47 lmh thus the critical flux was below 1 47 lmh at a stirring speed of 0 rpm the critical flux rapidly increased and reached 6 27 lmh when the stirring speed increased to 200 rpm the critical flux increased from 6 27 lmh to 9 58 lmh when the stirring speed changed from 200 rpm to 400 rpm when the stirring speed increased to 600 rpm the critical flux only reached 10 28 lmh and the rate of increase decreased considerably bacchin et al 14 provided a detailed analysis of the effect of hydrodynamics on the critical flux generally the critical flux increases with an increase in the strength of hydrodynamics high stirring speeds represent strong hydrodynamics which have several effects they enhance the reverse diffusion rate of substances from the membrane surface to the main body of the solution they reduce the concentration of substances on the membrane surface they weaken the concentration polarization phenomenon and they reduce the thickness of the membrane boundary layer together these effects result in an increased critical flux with an increase in stirring speed the critical flux does not always increase but will eventually reach a steady state flux this is because the high flux resulting from high stirring speeds leads to more substance deposition on the membrane surface which partially offsets the flux increase caused by the high stirring speed at the same time high stirring speeds incur high energy consumption therefore it is necessary to control the hydrodynamic conditions of the membrane system within an appropriate range in order to improve the membrane flux and reduce energy consumption the feed concentration is also an important factor for the critical flux as shown in fig 4 the critical flux increased from 6 27 lmh to 9 58 lmh when the concentration of tcm water extracts declined from 36 6 mg ml to 12 2 mg ml the feed concentration can affect the dynamic viscosity of feed and hence affect the transportation rate of substances from the membrane face meanwhile other physicochemical properties of feed such as the ionic strength ph and conductivity can also be affected by the change of feed concentration on the whole it is beneficial to reduce membrane fouling and increase the membrane flux by declining the feed concentration especially for complex feed the variations in tmp with permeate flux using the flux stepping method in constant flux mode are shown in fig 5 the initial flux was set to 5 53 lmh and then increased gradually at 15 min intervals for each flux point in order for the system to reach a steady state three linear regressions labeled a b and c were drawn in accordance with the results the coefficient r2 of lines a b and c was 0 9392 0 9838 and 0 9960 respectively a higher r2 represents a good linear relationship the slope dtmp dflux kpa lmh of regression for lines a b and c was 1 4067 7 1215 and 12 121 respectively the slope represents the rate of fouling and the reciprocal of the slope dflux dtmp lmh kpa represents the membrane permeability the greater the slope the greater the rate of fouling and the lower the membrane permeability the intersection of two regression lines is the inflection point of the flux at which the pollution state of the membrane system becomes more serious as seen in fig 5 the intersection of regression lines a and b is the start up flux where the tmp flux line becomes non linear according to the above definition at a flux value of 8 77 lmh the intersection of regression lines a and b represents the weak form of the critical flux the intersection of regression lines b and c represents the flux at which the rate of fouling increases markedly so a flux value of 12 85 lmh the intersection of regression lines b and c is the threshold flux at fluxes lower than 8 77 lmh the tmp and fouling rate of the membrane system remained low with an increase in flux as shown by regression line a indicating slight membrane fouling when the flux was between 8 77 and 12 85 lmh the tmp was increased slightly with the flux and the fouling rate was relatively stable at all fluxes as shown by regression line b at fluxes 12 85 lmh the tmp points began to deviate from regression line b and fouling increased at a greater rate indicating more serious membrane fouling fig 5 shows that the tmp increased nonlinearly in region c and so only the first three points were used to fit line c with a continuous increase in flux the tmp increased rapidly and irregularly based on the above analysis the flux under constant flux operation can be divided into three regions region i 8 77 lmh light fouling region ii 8 77 12 85 lmh low fouling and region iii 12 85 lmh rapid fouling region i is a sub critical zone at which the flux is below the critical flux regions ii and iii are supra critical zones at which the flux is above the critical flux taking into account operational efficiency and fouling costs the actual flux should be controlled in a suitable range at which the membrane system had satisfactory flux and acceptable fouling to extend the lifespan of the membrane therefore given our results the flux in region ii 8 77 12 85 lmh between the critical flux and threshold flux is desirable the factors that affect the critical flux were reviewed by bacchin et al 14 including feed properties e g ph ionic strength concentration and particle size hydrodynamics e g crossflow velocity and membrane properties e g porosity pore size surface charge and hydrophilicity the factors that affect the critical flux also affect the threshold flux therefore the critical flux and threshold flux will vary for different feeds and membrane systems however the fouling regions of a membrane system namely the light fouling region low fouling region and rapid fouling region obtained from the critical flux and threshold flux are universal as long as the critical flux and threshold flux can be determined hydrodynamics at the membrane surface have a major influence on the critical flux and threshold flux 14 generally the critical flux and threshold flux increase with the strength of the hydrodynamics for specific feeds and membrane systems a larger flux region can be divided according to membrane fouling under different hydrodynamic conditions with a division of zones similar to that in fig 5 we defined the three different zones shown in fig 6 the light fouling zone blue zone the low fouling zone yellow zone and the rapid fouling zone white zone compared with fig 5 the zone division in fig 6 contains the critical and threshold fluxes at different hydrodynamic conditions covering a wider range of operating conditions with better guidance for practical operations comparing the results of the critical flux obtained from under the modes of constant flux and constant pressure we found that the critical flux in constant flux mode was higher than that in constant pressure mode similar results were observed by xu and gao 12 in the uf of seawater under constant tmp operation the initial flux is the maximum flux and the flux declines as the filtration time increases by contrast the overall permeate flux is kept constant under constant flux operation therefore there is a difference in hydrodynamic conditions and fouling behavior between the two operations under constant tmp operation it is often difficult to control the tmp at a sufficiently low value to accurately measure the critical flux this is especially problematic for complex feed on the other hand if several pressure points in the initial period are not properly controlled the initial flux will most likely exceed the actual critical flux causing serious membrane fouling and making the detected critical flux less than the actual critical flux therefore the constant flux operation is more commonly used to detect the critical and threshold fluxes 4 13 based on the above the critical flux 8 77 lmh obtained from the constant flux operation was used as the critical flux in the following analysis and discussion 4 2 operation at constant tmp model the constant tmp operation was performed at six pressures 10 20 33 66 100 and 120 kpa the temporal variation of flux under different tmps is shown in fig 7 the flux decreased rapidly during the initial filtration 0 5 min and the declining trends became more moderate as the filtration time increased this is typical flux behavior under constant tmp operation a higher tmp will lead to a higher initial permeation flux which makes pollutants deposit on the membrane surface at a faster speed eventually causing more serious membrane fouling as shown in fig 7 the steady state fluxes of different tmps were similar and did not increase significantly with an increase in tmp this can be explained by the severe membrane fouling caused by high tmp counteracting the rise in permeate flux caused by the increase in tmp based the flux data shown in fig 7 we obtained related parameters listed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the initial flux j0 at tmps of 10 and 20 kpa was 6 63 and 7 37 lmh respectively both of which were lower than the critical flux 8 77 lmh and can be taken as subcritical flux operations the j0 at tmps of 33 66 100 and 120 kpa were all higher than the critical flux 8 77 lmh and can be taken as supercritical flux operations the results showed that both fdr 0 5min and fdr 0 120min for subcritical flux operations are significantly lower than those for supercritical flux operations meanwhile we found that the fdr 0 5min accounts for a large proportion in the total fdr especially for supercritical flux operations four classical membrane blocking models 33 viz complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration models are often used to describe the flux decline mechanisms at constant tmp operation fig 8 shows the experimental data in fig 7 plotted in terms of t v versus cumulative permeate volume the experimental data under different tmps fit the cake filtration model well during almost the entire filtration process expect for a short initial period the fitting coefficient r2 of the membrane blocking models for different tmps at the initial filtration period is shown in table 4 compared with the intermediate blocking model and complete blocking model the standard blocking model fits the experiment data well under different tmps during the initial filtration period 4 3 operation at constant flux model four fluxes were used under constant flux operation 6 63 7 37 10 32 and 14 00 lmh among these fluxes two fluxes 6 63 and 7 37 lmh were below the critical flux i e 8 77 lmh one flux 10 32 lmh was below the threshold flux i e 12 87 lmh and one flux was above the threshold flux i e 12 87 lmh at the same time the fluxes of 6 63 7 37 and 14 00 lmh were identical to the initial membrane fluxes of 10 20 and 33 kpa respectively created under constant tmp operation the temporal variation of tmp and normalized pressure increase under different constant fluxes are shown in fig 9a and b the tmp increased as the forced flux increased higher fluxes delivered more foulant to the membrane surface increasing foulant buildup on the membrane however there was a considerable qualitative difference in fouling behavior across membranes operating above and below the threshold flux membranes operating at 6 63 and 7 37 lmh i e below the threshold flux showed only a slight increase in tmp during the first few minutes followed by a gradual increase in tmp at the initial period of filtration the concentration polarization and pore blockage were often the main factors responsible for membrane fouling fouling could not be avoided at start up even at extremely low fluxes this result was also found by miller et al 6 and marshall et al 34 the membranes quickly fouled at fluxes of 14 lmh above the threshold flux foulants were transported to the membrane surface faster than they could be eliminated by shear forces and diffusion over the threshold flux others researchers reported tmp profiles with a similar shape in which the tmp exhibited a sharp upturn after fouling and then rapidly increased 6 13 the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface which increased the resistance to water transport through the membrane likely corresponded to the upturn in the tmp profile 4 4 comparison of constant tmp and constant flux models in membrane fouling profiles the membrane fouling resistance with a cumulative permeate volume between constant tmp and constant flux operations below the threshold flux i e 12 87 lmh is shown in fig 10 constant flux operations were carried out at 6 63 and 7 37 lmh and constant tmp operations were carried out at 10 and 20 kpa corresponding to initial fluxes of 6 63 and 7 37 lmh respectively the membrane fouling resistance for both constant tmp and constant flow operations showed a trend of rapid increase during the initial period following by relative stability for a long time as illustrated in fig 10 in general the interaction between pollutants and the membrane reduced fouling in start up filtration when the feed comes into contact with the membrane the pollutants in the feed are adsorbed at the interior and surface of the membrane causing the membrane to become blocked we found that the fouling resistance was similar between the constant tmp operation at 10 kpa and the constant flux operation at 6 63 lmh and between the constant tmp operation at 20 kpa and the constant flux operation at 7 67 lmh the fouling resistance was found to be comparable between the constant tmp operation at 10 kpa and the constant flux operation at 6 63 lmh as well as between the constant tmp operation at 20 kpa and the constant flux operation at 7 67 lmh he et al 4 and miller et al 6 discovered similar phenomena according to their findings the fouling resistance was comparable in all constant tmp and constant flux operations below the threshold flux however in our study the fouling resistance increased significantly with increasing constant tmp and flux even below the threshold flux the difference in fouling behavior below the threshold flux may be caused mainly by feed property differences changes in operational conditions may have a strong impact on the fouling behavior of highly polluting feeds membrane fouling resistances produced during constant tmp and constant flux operations above the threshold flux i e 12 85 lmh are shown in fig 11 an initial flux of 14 lmh was obtained in a constant tmp operation at 33 kpa and a constant flux operation was also performed at 14 lmh compared with the fouling that occurred below the threshold flux fouling above the threshold flux produced distinct behavior under constant tmp and constant flux operations the membrane fouling resistance produced under the constant flux operation was similar to that produced under the constant tmp operation when the cumulative permeate volume was less than about 10 ml however fouling resistance increased rapidly at constant flux when the cumulative permeate volume was larger than 10 ml which was much greater than fouling resistance during the constant tmp operation similar behavior was observed by miller et al 6 the initial high flux over the threshold flux induced quick fouling and a steep drop in permeate flux in a short amount of time during the constant tmp operation as illustrated in fig 7 following that the permeate flux decreased below the threshold flux the fouling rate was reduced and ultimately the fouling resistance reached a somewhat stable state table 5 compares the mfi and fouling index between constant tmp and constant flux operations below the threshold flux both the mfi and the fouling index under constant flux operation showed lower values than those under constant tmp operation above the threshold flux both the mfi and the fouling index under constant flux operation far outweighed those under constant tmp operation the concept of a local flux proposed by ognier et al 35 can explain the fouling phenomenon under a constant flux operation the number of pores open to the permeate flow decreases due to interactions between pollutants and the membrane as the permeate flow remains constant throughout the constant flux operation the local flux in the remaining open pores increases to maintain the same flux potentially increasing pollutant transport to the membrane and causing faster fouling the local flux reaches a very high level once numerous pores are blocked and a cake layer develops resulting in extremely high fouling resistance when the flux is above the threshold flux at constant flux operation the local flux will become much greater than the threshold flux in a short time causing more serious membrane fouling 4 5 foulant membrane interactions the surface tension parameters for the individual foulants bas ss pe and ta foulant mixtures and tcm water extracts table 6 showed that all of them exhibited high electron donor monopolarity i e high electron donor components γ and low electron acceptor components r this is similar to the alginate and humic acid reported in previous studies 21 22 the free energy of cohesion g cwc tot the sum of lw and ab free energy components represents the interaction energy when two surfaces of the same material are immersed in a solvent water in this study and brought into contact here g cwc tot provides quantitative insights regarding the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a given material if g cwc tot is negative the material is in a thermodynamically unstable state and tends to attract each other in water indicating its apolar property hydrophobicity if the g cwc tot is positive the material is in a thermodynamically stable state and tends to repulse each other indicating its polar property hydrophilicity as shown in table 6 the g cwc tot of bsa pe and the foulant mixtures is negative and the g cwc tot of ss ta and tcm water extracts is positive this indicates that ss ta and tcm water extracts have relative stronger hydrophilicity than bsa and pe which are the same results from the contact angle with water table 2 ss is a polysaccharide compound containing a large number of hydroxyl groups and ta comprises polyphenols with a large number of phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups as such ss and ta have relatively strong hydrophilicity tcm water extracts are obtained from the roots and rhizomes of salviae miltiorrhizae bge which contain not only ss and ta but also water soluble phenolic acids including salvianolic acid a salvianolic acid b salvianolic acid c caffeic acid and so on thus tcm water extracts are hydrophilic the virgin pvdf membrane had the lowest g cwc tot at 101 04 mj m2 indicating the strongest hydrophobicity the surface free energy of adhesion g cwm tot between foulants and the membrane is shown in table 7 here g cwm tot provides quantitative insights into the interactions between foulants and the membrane all of the values of g cwm tot are negative which means that attractive interactions occur between foulants and the membrane from the values of g cwm tot for ss ta and tcm water extracts these foulants are expected to exhibit relatively lower adhesion than those of bsa pe and foulant mixtures with the pvdf membrane moreover our results indicate that protein and pectin may play a key role in the membrane fouling of tcm water extracts many studies have found that hydrophobic membrane foulant and foulant foulant interactions have an important effect on the fouling state of mf and uf 36 38 in general the initial decline of permeate flux is often caused by the interaction between foulants and membranes 21 as shown in figs 7 and 9 the permeate flux tmp rapidly declined increased at the initial stage of membrane filtration indicating serious membrane fouling caused by the hydrophobic interactions between foulants and the membrane therefore the inhibition of foulant migration toward the membrane surface is beneficial for weakening the hydrophobic interactions 38 this can be realized by strengthening the hydrodynamic conditions for example by increasing crossflow intensity and using a turbulence promoter on the other hand membrane modification is a relatively simple and effective way to realize special functions in membrane materials e g high anti fouling capacity 39 super wettability 40 super amphiphobic 41 and intelligent responsiveness 42 many researchers have shown that the adsorption of hydrophilic substances e g dopamine 43 44 polyethylene glycol 45 and chitosan 46 on the surface or the inner pore wall of membrane materials by certain methods e g blending impregnation coating and grafting can effectively enhance antifouling characteristics this is mainly due to the weakening of hydrophobic interactions between foulants and the membrane by improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane materials 5 conclusions we studied the effect of constant tmp and constant flux operations on membrane fouling from tcm water extracts the critical flux weak form and threshold flux of tcm water extracts with complex components were determined meanwhile the physicochemical foulant membrane interactions for tcm water extracts were analyzed using xdlvo theory constant tmp operation experiments were performed at different pressures high tmp resulted in a high initial flux and a rapid drop in permeate flux at the beginning of the filtration period the steady state fluxes did not increase significantly with an increase in tmp this can be explained by the severe membrane fouling caused by high tmp counteracting the rise in permeate flux caused by the increase in tmp constant flux operation experiments were carried out at fluxes above and below the threshold flux the tmp increased somewhat when the permeate flux was below the threshold flux fouling was severe above the threshold flux and the tmp rapidly increased by displaying fouling resistance as a function of permeate volume we compared constant flux operation fouling resistance to constant tmp operation fouling resistance beginning at the same flux imposed during the constant flux operation below the threshold flux the fouling resistance under constant tmp and constant flux operations was similar however above the threshold flux the fouling resistance under constant flux operation was much greater than that under constant tmp operation we also found that the critical flux and threshold flux are relatively low under both constant tmp and constant flux operations this indicates that there is serious fouling in the membrane process of tcm water extracts the analysis of the physicochemical interactions showed that there are attractive interactions between the hydrophobic pvdf membrane and foulants including protein starch pectin and tannin in the tcm water extracts these interactions should be considered a key factor leading to serious membrane fouling therefore the application of anti fouling strategies that target these interactions including the inhibition of foulant migration and hydrophilic modification of membrane materials would be beneficial for reducing membrane fouling in tcm water extracts and improving the efficiency of
