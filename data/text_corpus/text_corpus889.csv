4445,in recent decades the development of numerical tools has facilitated the ability to reproduce extreme flood events which allows a far better understanding of their features contributing to mitigate their negative effects in similar future scenarios this paper analyzes the flood event that occurred in december 1876 in badajoz spain guadiana basin one of the most catastrophic flood events recorded in europe using a three stage methodology first an estimation of the precipitation recorded in the guadiana river basin during the days prior to the event was carried out starting from the precipitation data recorded in two precipitation stations located in the western part of the basin second guadiana river flow in badajoz was obtained by means of the hec hms code using the precipitation estimated in the first stage third the flood registered on december 1876 in badajoz was reproduced using the numerical code iber the peak flow obtained was equal to 12 774 1 360 m3s 1 this value improves the accuracy of estimated shown in previous works which most of them are lower limits of this value numerical results of the flood event in badajoz and in areas surrounding the city show a good agreement with water marks and some descriptions of the event found in the literature results obtained in this work demonstrate the ability of the methodology to reproduce historical extreme flood events even when the availability of input data is relatively scarce keywords historical extreme flood rainfall estimation river discharge estimation numerical simulation iber 1 introduction since ancient times flood events have had a direct impact on the development of civilizations some of these events had positive societal impacts for the inhabitants of the affected areas such as the seasonal flooding of the nile river in the ancient egypt however other events had negative effects e g the recurrent floods of the tiber river that destroyed the harbour of ostia near rome cited by the roman author strabo 64 58 bc 21 25 ad strabo geographica v 3 5 some of these events are especially interesting due to their extraordinary influence on the population and have been studied from different scientific perspectives e g historical archaeological meteorology and hydrology associated to early instrumentation however in recent years the development of numerical tools strongly supported on the increment of the computational power has facilitated the ability of the numerical simulations to reproduce such events with increasing detail these simulations allow a far better understanding of those historical flood events helping to fill in the many gaps of the characterization in space and time of the phenomenon this deeper understanding of the flood s behaviour contributes with relevant information to mitigate their negative effects in similar future scenarios an increasing likely possibility under climate change scenarios groisman et al 2005 beniston 2009 morss et al 2011 according to the european directive e d 2007 60 c it is important to assess potential risks derived from flood events through a description of the floods which have occurred in the past and which have had significant adverse impacts on human health the environment cultural heritage and economic activity and for which the likelihood of similar future events is still relevant including their flood extent and conveyance routes and an assessment of the adverse impacts they have entailed which highlights the importance of reproducing historical extreme flood events with numerical tools some interesting examples of historical flood events often resulting from extreme precipitation are shown by eulenstein and kellerer pirklbauer 2020 long 2008 elleder et al 2020a elleder et al 2020b portugués mollá et al 2016 and trigo et al 2016 benito et al 2015 show a very thorough compilation of 46 flood events across europe where the reader can find references of events in the basins of tagus danube and rhine in 1876 this work shows a very interesting conclusion present flood magnitudes are similar to those registered in the last millennium this fact underscores the high importance of improving the knowledge of historical events to face similar future scenarios concerning the tagus basin salgueiro et al 2013 benito et al 2003 daveau et al 1978 and loureiro 2009 show peak values corresponding to the flood event registered in 1876 that highlight the event of december 1876 as one of the most extreme events registered in europe the catastrophic flood occurred on december 7 1876 in badajoz spain and most of the southern sector of portugal is described by trigo et al 2014 where the authors highlight the record precipitation values in the iberian peninsula during the weeks prior to the event and the exceptional synoptic situation in zamora cabanillas 1999 the reader can also find a detailed description of the 1876 event as well as other floods registered in the guadiana river basin both works describe record rainfall values in late november and early december 1876 the estimated values of discharge flow corresponding to the flood registered on december 1876 in badajoz reach values greater than 10 000 m3 s 1 ortega 2007 the authors using analysis of palaefloods conclude that the event of 1876 was surpassed only by the event of 1603 the historical descriptions of the event shown that the palmas bridge in badajoz was destroyed gonzález 1995 ortega 2007 other flood events as floods registered in january 1940 or march 1947 in badajoz reach values near 7 500 and 8 000 m3 s 1 respectively ortega 2007 this highlights the magnitude of the event registered in december 1876 as a clear outlier this document is organized as follows in section 2 the area of study the evolution of the flood event and its consequences in iberian peninsula are described then the precipitation dataset along with the hydrological and hydraulic models used in this paper are briefly described in section 3 the estimation of the precipitation the discharge flow and the numerical simulations of the flood event in badajoz are shown in section 4 along with the discussion of the results finally section 5 provides the main conclusions of this work the main objective of this work is to reproduce the flood registered on december 7 1876 in the city of badajoz by means of the numerical model iber bladé et al 2014 for this purpose the work was mainly divided into three stages in the first one an estimation of the precipitation recorded in the guadiana river basin during the days prior to the event was carried out next the rain runoff process associated with the precipitation in the guadiana basin was computed using the hec hms code feldman 2000 scharffenberg et al 2018 in order to obtain an estimation of the discharge flow in badajoz during the event once this discharge flow was computed iber was used to reproduce the flood event registered in badajoz 2 area of study and description of the event the basin of the international guadiana river is located in the south west of the iberian peninsula area 68 000 km2 with 83 located in spain and 17 in portugal agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 guadiana river has an approximate length of 800 km with an elevation that ranges from near 1300 m a s l at the head waters in the lagunas de ruidera castilla la mancha region spain to the sea level at its junction with the atlantic ocean in ayamonte just in the border between portugal and spain at present the natural regime of the river is highly modified by the construction of several large reservoirs as for example the orellana impoundment 808 hm3 or the cijara impoundment 1 505 hm3 that have increased the storage capacity of the river since 1954 to 14 000 hm3 snirh 2019 from a geomorphological point of view the river reach shows several special hydraulic characteristics the upper part of the basin is a plain based on carbonates the medium part crosses a paleozoic range entering the tertiary basin of extremadura in the lower part of the basin the river flows into the rocks in particular the city of badajoz spain is located at the transition of the tertiary basin to the paleozoic the reader can find a detailed description of the guadiana river in canuto et al 2019 badajoz is one of the most important riverine cities of the guadiana catchment with a population of ca 200 000 inhabitants and it is located near the border with portugal at an elevation of 120 m above sea level fig 1 d the city was founded in the year 875 ce gonzález rodríguez 1999 taking advantage of its strategic location just when the guadiana river passes between two important promontories originally the city was situated on the promontory to the se growing on the left bank of the river later the medieval bridge the palmas bridge of great strategic importance was built around the year 1460 to defend this bridge the hill located to the nw was later populated building a fortification at the end of the 19th century with the arrival of the railroad network the city also grew on the right bank of the river old maps of the city of badajoz corresponding to 1873 and 1946 fig 1 e and fig 1 g respectively reveal that the city has not been subjected to great human induced changes until mid twentieth century fig 1 e shows a map of badajoz made by the army general staff corps and published by the depósito de la guerra in 1873 at a scale of 1 5000 we have used the copy preserved in the municipal historical archive of badajoz a digital copy is available on the extremadura government s spatial data infrastructure website http www ideex es geoportal fig 1 g shows the image corresponding to badajoz of the photographic flight of mainland spain carried out in 1946 by the us army map service it is an orthophoto also available on the extremadura government s spatial data infrastructure website during the last century several modifications can be observed in current maps of the area fig 1 f these changes mainly influence the land uses of the area of study badajoz suffered the greatest adverse effects derived from the floods registered in 1876 the 1876 flood was generated by an episode of almost two weeks of continuous rainfalls end of november beginning of december corresponding to one of the most extreme precipitation events in the western iberian peninsula fragoso et al 2010 the consequences of this extreme precipitation event were observed in the riverbanks of several rivers including the three large southern iberian rivers tagus guadiana and guadalquivir newspapers in portugal and spain describe the effects of this event including titles such as diario de noticias gazeta do algarve el magisterio extremeño la ilustración española or la crónica in portugal according to diario de noticias almost 95 of the buildings in the village of mértola were completely destroyed gazeta do algarve published that some villages as pomarão alcoutim or vila real de santo antonio almost disappeared in central west spain the effects of the flood were similar to those registered in portugal the communications by road and train were destroyed in badajoz the palmas bridge main communication between both sides of the river collapsed for the first time since 1603 gonzález 1995 ortega 2007 other cities as mérida olivenza or talavera la real were also affected by this event loureiro 2009 refers to the event registered in 1876 like the biggest one in the basin of the tagus river in portugal fig 2 shows some of the main scenes derived by the flood in badajoz mérida and seville published by la ilustración española y americana the evolution of this extreme precipitation event is related to successive frontal systems with atlantic origin often with a sw to ne direction trigo et al 2014 a detailed synoptic analysis of the event is also shown in zamora cabanillas 1999 and trigo et al 2014 therefore this outstating flood cannot be considered as a flash flood event as in that case the delay between the precipitation peak and the flood only takes a few hours yin et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 spain02 precipitation dataset the observational gridded data set spain02 herrera et al 2012 2016 kotlarski et al 2019 was employed in this work to estimate the precipitation recorded during the event of december 1876 spain02 represents a set of high resolution daily precipitation and temperature gridded datasets developed for spain a high dense network of around 2500 control stations for the period 1950 2007 was selected from the spanish meteorological agency aemet in order to build the mesh that divides the domain in pixels that act as interpolated data point herrera et al 2012 2016 kotlarski et al 2019 in this work the data were obtained from the version spain02 v5 the spatial resolution of spain02 v5 is equal to 0 1 10 km the availability of data to estimate the precipitation in the entire basin is relatively scarce this is a common caveat when trying to reproduce historical floods the most relevant available data are the daily rainfall registered in the stations of évora and badajoz see fig 1 during the months of november and december 1876 these stations are located in the western part of the basin so the spatial distribution precipitation in the entire guadiana basin is difficult to determine fortunately precipitation obtained in the western and central sectors of iberia is highly dependent on synoptic circulation with a western component trigo and dacamara 2000 cortesi et al 2013 in fact it has been shown objectively that almost all the winter precipitation that falls in the guadiana basin is prevenient from the atlantic ocean gimeno et al 2010 2012 this fact implies that before reaching the basin upstream badajoz the same synoptic systems have already affected the precipitation over both cities évora and badajoz this physical constrain provides the rationale to stablish a simple statistical model linking the daily precipitation observed in these two stations with the daily precipitation in the guadiana basin upstream badajoz where no stations were available in 1876 a multivariate linear adjustment was carried out for the months of november and december of the years 1977 2006 between the rainfall registered in évora and badajoz with the rainfall associated to each of the pixels 571 interpolated data points belonging to the upstream guadiana river basin according to spain02 for each interpolated data point of the basin a relationship was established with both reference stations évora and badajoz as follows 1 p i c 0 i c 1 i p b c 2 i p e where pi is the precipitation at point i interpolated data point pb and pe are the precipitation at badajoz and évora respectively three coefficients were obtained from the linear fitting depending on the point i 3 2 hydrologic model hec hms the semi distributed model hec hms feldman 2000 scharffenberg et al 2018 was used to model the basin of the guadiana river to estimate the flow registered in badajoz hec hms is mainly divided into four components i an analytical model calculation of direct runoff and channel routing ii a basin model representation of hydrological elements in a watershed iii a system to manage input data and store data iv a post processing tool to report and illustrate simulation results this modelling system is one of the most used for hydrological procedures du et al 2012 akter and ahmed 2015 bai et al 2019 fraga et al 2020 two main processes were taken into account in the methodology implemented in this work loss and transform methods loss method calculates the infiltration capability of the terrain and provides the excess rainfall which is subject to surface runoff whereas the transform method models the way of how to convert this excess rainfall into runoff the soil conservation service scs curve number was selected to account for the surface runoff processes this method implements the curve number cn methodology for incremental losses since it was designed to calculate the losses during periods of heavy rainfall nrcs 2007 in the same way the scs unit hydrograph was also selected for the transformation method more information about the loss and transform methods used in this work are detailed in nrcs 2007 the basin of the guadiana river that flows into badajoz was divided in 35 sub basins according to their topographic features which range between 4 and 4538 km2 with an average size of 1346 km2 these sub basins were considered for the implementation of the hec hms model fig 3 the catchment size at badajoz is 48 530 km2 the lag time of the sub basins and the reaches was calculated using data from digital terrain models extracted by means of hec geohms tool hec geohms geospatial hydrologic modeling extension user s manual version 5 2010 the mean curve numbers cn defined for each sub basin were obtained from the work of the guadiana hydrographic confederation chg c h g 2003 these curve numbers were adapted to the humid soil conditions corresponding to the specific wet state observed prior to the event of 1876 trigo et al 2014 by applying the classic equations of the scs eq 1 these soil conditions were considered due to in the previous days of the main event which occurs between 4 and 7 december the averaged rain over the guadiana basin surpasses the limit established in previous works to consider moist soil conditions scs 1972 fernández nóvoa et al 2020 in addition previous studies developed in the iberian peninsula detected variations near 5 between theoretical and calibrated curve number values fernández nóvoa et al 2020 moreover added uncertainty associated to discrepancies in the land use and vegetation representation could also exist therefore a range of 10 was applied to the curve number values obtained in order to take into account the uncertainty of this parameter lag time tl values were obtained using eq 3 starting from the concentration time tc tc was computed according to ministerio de fomento 2016 and tl ranging between 0 35 and 0 6 times the tc value in order to take into account uncertainties associated to the calculation of this parameter and following recommendations of previous studies ncrs 1972 témez 1991 chg 2003 in eq 3 lc is the length of the longest flow channel km and jc is its corresponding slope m m the values of cns range from 85 to 90 and the average values of the tl range from 42 to 1303 min 2 cn moist 23 cn average 10

discharge flow in badajoz which constitute the input for iber 3 3 hydraulic model iber iber is a numerical tool that solves the 2d depth averaged shallow water equations using the finite volume method bladé et al 2014 recently some of the authors have developed garcía feal et al 2018 a new implementation of the model in c namely iber and cuda nvidia 2020 this new implementation of iber improves the efficiency of the simulations by achieving a speed up of two orders of magnitude with the same precision by using gpu graphical processing unit computing hpc high performance computing techniques these optimizations rise the possibility to employ the model in large spatio temporal domains gonzález cao et al 2019a garcía feal et al 2020 fernández nóvoa et al 2020 or time constrained applications fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019b also some applications of hybridization of iber with other cfd models like dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 were developed to analyse the behaviour of dams in high precipitation scenarios gonzález cao et al 2018 the software package is freely available and can be downloaded from its official website https iberaula es it also includes a gui graphical user interface with pre processing and post processing tools in the present study iber was applied to analyse the flood event registered in badajoz spain in december 1876 the domain defined in iber along with its inlet and outlet boundaries in the area of badajoz is shown in fig 4 the inlet condition is defined as a critical subcritical condition by defining the time series of the hydrograph and the outlet condition is defined as a supercritical critical condition the domain was discretized using a mesh of unstructured triangles whose characteristic size varies from 0 5 to 20 m with a total of 723 971elements the georeferenced image corresponds to the so called american photographic flight of 1946 this image will be used as a reference to define the different areas of the numerical domain in iber since it corresponds reasonably well with the map of the city of badajoz of 1873 fig 1 panel e we acknowledge that the image from the american flight shows some built up areas that did not appear in the 1873 map but in general the coincidence of most spatial features level is quite high the american flight image is also used as a reference since it covers a wider area and has a higher resolution once the numerical domain was defined and discretized it was adapted to the topography of the area by means of a dtm with a spatial resolution of 5 m that was retrieved from the spanish national geographic institute ign https www ign es web ign portal there is also information regarding the topography of the area corresponding to the early and mid 20th century a comparison study was carried out between the elevations provided by these sources and those provided by the 5 m dtm obtained from ign the differences obtained in this study are small and can be attributed to the lack of precision of the older data therefore the 5 m dtm from ign was taken as reference data determination of land uses is a difficult task when leading with historical flood events furthermore in some cases the component of the uncertainty of the hydraulic simulations associated to the determination of the land uses is highest one balasch et al 2011 this is not the case of the event analised in this paper since uncertainty associated to other variables curve numbers lag times is greater than uncertainty associated to land uses also the time step of the input data of the simulations daily precipitation data makes that the determination of land uses is not a key point of the numerical simulations therefore land uses defined in the domain correspond to a constant generic value according to mapama 2011 manning coefficients of the area of study can range from 0 015 to 0 04 s m 1 3 therefore a mean value equal to 0 027 sm 1 3 was applied to the entire domain special mention should be made to the palmas bridge located in badajoz this bridge has undergone various modifications over the past centuries it is about 590 m long and had 28 semicircular arches in 1873 each of them with different dimensions to model this bridge the tools implemented in iber were used to design this type of structures a series of simplification hypotheses were assumed given its constructive complexity in particular it was assumed that the height of the bridge is constant in the plans it can be seen that it presents a slightly higher elevation in the centre than in the ends additionally straight arches were considered since the definition of semicircular arches in iber would imply a significant increase in the complexity of the design that does not make sense in view of the existing uncertainty in the rest of input data a general view of the palmas bridge a detailed image of one of its arches the simplifications considered to model each arch of the bridge along with a scheme of an actual arch are shown in fig 5 to study the effect of the bridge on the elevation of the water level two simulations were carried out the first one was made taking into account the bridge and the second one without the bridge all the numerical simulations of iber and badajoz were performed using a gpu geforce rtx 2080 ti 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of the precipitation in the basin of the guadiana river during november and december 1876 the correlation between each interpolated data point and the two reference stations was calculated using eq 1 for each grid point in the spanish guadiana basin obtaining a higher correlation higher than 0 9 for the interpolated data points near the border between both countries and decreasing slightly to correlation values around 0 7 for the interpolated data points situated close to the guadiana headwaters the mean correlation which was calculated by averaging the correlation at the 571 interpolated data points is equal to 0 9 with an average statistical significance greater than 99 assuming that the relationship between the reference stations and the interpolated data points derived from spain02 has been maintained over time the rainfall at each point of the basin in 1876 can be inferred by applying eq 1 to the rainfall data collected in évora and badajoz during the event under study in 1876 mean reconstructed daily precipitation for november december 1876 is shown in fig 6 it provides a good representation of the synoptic situation as can be inferred from the work of trigo et al 2014 in addition it is especially remarkable the main event occurring over the guadiana basin between 4 and 7 december whose spatial precipitation pattern is shown in fig 7 thus the spatial distribution of the precipitation corresponding to the event can be obtained and used as the input data of the hec hms model in order to calculate the flow in badajoz associated with this precipitation 4 2 estimation of the discharge flow in badajoz in december 1876 once the precipitation in the entire basin of the guadiana river is obtained the time series of the discharge flow at badajoz can be estimated using the hec hms model the daily discharge flow at badajoz between the 4th and 12th of december 1876 can be observed in fig 8 the average peak flow solid line reaches a value of 12 774 m3 s 1 with an associated uncertainty dashed lines ranging from 11 417 m3 s 1 to 14 043 m3 s 1 these values are consistent with those estimated in the literature zamora cabanillas 1999 ortega 2007 ortega and garzón 2009 trigo et al 2014 where lower limits of the peak flow in the range of 10 000 and 10 500 m3s 1 are depicted cedex 1997 shows that another extreme event was registered in march 1947 the water mark of this event in the puente de palmas is 2 5 m below the water mark of the event of 1876 data obtained from gauge stations of puente de palmas data recorded from 1913 to 1993 and benavides data recorded from 1916 to 1985 located 11 km downstream the puente de palmas show values of 10 000 and 10 500 m3s 1 respectively for this event 06 03 1947 cedex 1997 estimate the peak value corresponding to the event of 1876 as 15 000 m3 s 1 therefore the peak flow of the event registered in 1876 must be higher than 10 000 m3s 1 this peak value highlights this event as the most extreme event recorded in badajoz exceeding the estimated value of peak discharge for the event of 1603 ortega 2007 in addition the peak value obtained with hec hms model is reached on day 7 which is also in full agreement with the references zamora cabanillas 1999 ortega 2007 trigo et al 2014 4 3 numerical analysis of the flood event of 1876 in badajoz once the time series of flow reaching badajoz has been calculated it can be used as an inlet condition in the numerical domain defined in iber first we perform a validation of the numerical results obtained through comparing the water levels attained in the simulations with the historical benchmarks available in the city of badajoz and the references that can be consulted in the literature the maximum extension of the flooded area obtained with iber is shown in fig 9 together with an estimate of the flooded area obtained from the benchmarks and considering the topography of the area extracted from the badajoz plan of the year 1873 although both results show a similar extension several discrepancies are clearly visible these relatively confined discrepancies can be attributed to the following two facts i the control points used for the georeferencing process of the 1873 map were located around the bastioned enclosure on the left bank of the guadiana river and at the head of the river bridge and fort of san cristóbal on the right bank being impossible to locate more exterior points this causes a progressive increase in map deformations as we move away from the urban area areas outlined in yellow in fig 9 and ii the variation in the surroundings of rivillas stream is due to the intense anthropogenic occupation throughout the end of the 20th century considerably modifying the topography of the stream and its banks in zamora cabanillas 1999 a reference to the 1876 event is mentioned stating that water rose between 9 and 10 m in the vicinity of the palmas bridge fig 10 shows the maximum numerical water depth of the water surface near the bridge obtained with the average flow results were obtained with red line and without the bridge blue line the maximum water level reached was 11 2 m when the bridge is considered and diminishing considerably to 8 6 m without the bridge these results taken into account the uncertainties associated to the input parameters of the numerical model are compatible with the available records if one considers that the bridge broke before the flow reached the potential maximum level of 11 m even so it realistically reproduces the sequence of events reported in the chronicle of the bridge breakage from the magazine el magisterio extremeño we have spent fifteen days of copious and incessant rain in guadiana rivillas and gévora you can see a considerable flood its waters are penetrating through the streets shortly after two a sudden and considerable drop in the water level the bridge has broken the sinking of many houses they increase panic in zamora cabanillas 1999 the situation is described in a similar way at three in the morning the flood suddenly subsided due to the collapse of the bridge indeed once the bridge disappeared the water level descended as shown in numerical simulations since higher water depths were obtained when considering the bridge the results shown in the following paragraphs correspond to that case there is a well known historical benchmark placed in the palmas gate near the palmas bridge in the left riverbank fig 11 panel a p g where a water depth around 1 33 m can be estimated fig 11 panel c the numerical simulation results obtained near that control benchmark imply a depth close to 1 5 m a value that is in good agreement with field data fig 11 panel b there are also some estimations on the extent of the water surface in the trinidad gate area on the other side of the city walls fig 11 panel a t g similarly we also provide the extension of the water surface obtained in the trinidad gate using the average flow fig 11 panel d it can be verified that the extension of the water sheet obtained in the numerical simulations is very close to field estimations fig 11 panel e there are certain discrepancies between the numerical results and the field measurements that are likely due to the uncertainties derived from the input data to iber and to the low spatial resolution of the dtms some of the streets near the trinidad gate are very narrow and difficult to reproduce using dtms with spatial resolution lower than 1 m nevertheless the spatial extent of the flooded area in this sector shows a reasonable agreement finally an additional evaluation assessment was applied to the maximum water depth registered at the trinidad gate specifically in the intersection of eugenio hermoso and ronda del pilar streets the maximum water depth can be estimated as 3 m fig 11 panel g the maximum water level obtained with iber using the average flow in this area is near 2 8 m fig 11 panel f and therefore the numerical results approximate reasonably well the reference data table 1 summarizes the location of the water marks along with the values of numerical water depth the water depth estimated from field measurements and the error of the numerical results once the precision of the numerical results has been verified the flood in early december 1876 can be analysed in more detail the evolution of the flood extent and magnitude from 4 to 12 december is shown in fig 12 results from 4 to 7 december were obtained considering the bridge still stood whilst results from 8 to 12 december were obtained considering that the bridge had collapsed the situation corresponding to the 4 december shows that some areas near badajoz were flooded due to the continuous precipitation recorded during the previous days as the flow increased the fields upstream badajoz started to flood days 5 and 6 the situation became critical on december 7 and 8 water depth reached the maximum values and the extension of the water flooded surface stretched the entire domain on december 7 on december 9 the water level decreased although the situation continued to be serious water levels kept declining until reaching a controllable situation already on december 12 this evolution of the flood is consistent with the detailed description shown by zamora cabanillas 1999 where it is clearly stated that the flood started on december 7 in the early morning in fact it is revealed in several references zamora cabanillas 1999 ortega 2007 that at 2 00 am the state of the river did not bode well el magisterio extremeño issue n 35 corresponding to december 15 1876 gonzález rodríguez 1995 the results of maximum water depths obtained for the entire numerical domain are shown in fig 13 panel a in general it can be seen that the fields upstream badajoz were totally flooded and that the area downstream badajoz was somewhat less affected which is mainly due to the topography of the area more specifically fig 13 panel b shows the maps of maximum water depth and fig 13 panel c maximum velocity obtained near the palmas bridge the maximum water depth near the bridge reached values close to 12 m as mentioned above and the maximum speed reached values close to 10 m s 1 these values are extraordinarily high and are probably the origin of the bridge collapse unfortunately there is no data on water velocity during the event to confirm this point 5 conclusions in this work the numerical reproduction of the flood event registered in badajoz on 7 december 1876 was carried out by means of the iber according to previous research this is the greatest flood event in the guadiana basin since 1603 ortega and garzón 2009 the task was divided into three stages first the determination of the spatial temporal pattern of rainfall in the entire basin of the guadiana river corresponding to the event was obtained from the daily rainfall records available at two meteorological stations namely at the cities of évora in portugal and badajoz in spain located in the extreme west of the basin fortunately the vast majority of synoptic systems responsible for precipitation across the entire guadiana basin in the winter months are also responsible for the precipitation events in évora and badajoz this physical base connection is essential to guarantee the good representativeness that these two stations offer as the validation of a simple model with recent data has confirmed thus the quality of reconstruction of the daily precipitation field during this extreme event in 1876 was well assured and confirmed through a validation exercise for present climate then once the pattern of rainfall was obtained the guadiana river basin was modeled by means of hec hms code to estimate the river discharge in badajoz this method allows obtaining the peak discharge in badajoz 12 774 1 360 m3s 1 this peak value surpasses the higher historical peak value obtained for the event of 1603 ortega and garzón 2009 finally the numerical reproduction of the flood event registered in badajoz was performed using iber to achieve this goal we took into account a number of structural features including the present and old topography of the area of study the effects of land uses and structures for example the palmas bridge the numerical simulation results obtained with iber were compared with reference data benchmarks and data obtained from bibliography showing a good agreement with reference data once the accuracy of the numerical results was assured the reconstruction of the daily evolution of the flood and detailed analysis of the water depth and water velocities near the palmas bridge was carried out the numerical simulations shown that the area near badajoz was flooded during almost 4 days and the maximum water depths reached values near 10 m before the collapse of the palmas bridge maximum velocity in the vicinity of the bridge was about 10 m s 1 a high value that undoubtedly influenced the collapse of some of the arches of the bridge the work has demonstrated the ability of iber to reproduce historical extreme flood events even when the availability of input data is relatively scarce finally we are confident that the multidisciplinary methodology presented here can be adapted to characterize in detail other major historical floods with scarce meteorological and hydrological data

4445,in recent decades the development of numerical tools has facilitated the ability to reproduce extreme flood events which allows a far better understanding of their features contributing to mitigate their negative effects in similar future scenarios this paper analyzes the flood event that occurred in december 1876 in badajoz spain guadiana basin one of the most catastrophic flood events recorded in europe using a three stage methodology first an estimation of the precipitation recorded in the guadiana river basin during the days prior to the event was carried out starting from the precipitation data recorded in two precipitation stations located in the western part of the basin second guadiana river flow in badajoz was obtained by means of the hec hms code using the precipitation estimated in the first stage third the flood registered on december 1876 in badajoz was reproduced using the numerical code iber the peak flow obtained was equal to 12 774 1 360 m3s 1 this value improves the accuracy of estimated shown in previous works which most of them are lower limits of this value numerical results of the flood event in badajoz and in areas surrounding the city show a good agreement with water marks and some descriptions of the event found in the literature results obtained in this work demonstrate the ability of the methodology to reproduce historical extreme flood events even when the availability of input data is relatively scarce keywords historical extreme flood rainfall estimation river discharge estimation numerical simulation iber 1 introduction since ancient times flood events have had a direct impact on the development of civilizations some of these events had positive societal impacts for the inhabitants of the affected areas such as the seasonal flooding of the nile river in the ancient egypt however other events had negative effects e g the recurrent floods of the tiber river that destroyed the harbour of ostia near rome cited by the roman author strabo 64 58 bc 21 25 ad strabo geographica v 3 5 some of these events are especially interesting due to their extraordinary influence on the population and have been studied from different scientific perspectives e g historical archaeological meteorology and hydrology associated to early instrumentation however in recent years the development of numerical tools strongly supported on the increment of the computational power has facilitated the ability of the numerical simulations to reproduce such events with increasing detail these simulations allow a far better understanding of those historical flood events helping to fill in the many gaps of the characterization in space and time of the phenomenon this deeper understanding of the flood s behaviour contributes with relevant information to mitigate their negative effects in similar future scenarios an increasing likely possibility under climate change scenarios groisman et al 2005 beniston 2009 morss et al 2011 according to the european directive e d 2007 60 c it is important to assess potential risks derived from flood events through a description of the floods which have occurred in the past and which have had significant adverse impacts on human health the environment cultural heritage and economic activity and for which the likelihood of similar future events is still relevant including their flood extent and conveyance routes and an assessment of the adverse impacts they have entailed which highlights the importance of reproducing historical extreme flood events with numerical tools some interesting examples of historical flood events often resulting from extreme precipitation are shown by eulenstein and kellerer pirklbauer 2020 long 2008 elleder et al 2020a elleder et al 2020b portugués mollá et al 2016 and trigo et al 2016 benito et al 2015 show a very thorough compilation of 46 flood events across europe where the reader can find references of events in the basins of tagus danube and rhine in 1876 this work shows a very interesting conclusion present flood magnitudes are similar to those registered in the last millennium this fact underscores the high importance of improving the knowledge of historical events to face similar future scenarios concerning the tagus basin salgueiro et al 2013 benito et al 2003 daveau et al 1978 and loureiro 2009 show peak values corresponding to the flood event registered in 1876 that highlight the event of december 1876 as one of the most extreme events registered in europe the catastrophic flood occurred on december 7 1876 in badajoz spain and most of the southern sector of portugal is described by trigo et al 2014 where the authors highlight the record precipitation values in the iberian peninsula during the weeks prior to the event and the exceptional synoptic situation in zamora cabanillas 1999 the reader can also find a detailed description of the 1876 event as well as other floods registered in the guadiana river basin both works describe record rainfall values in late november and early december 1876 the estimated values of discharge flow corresponding to the flood registered on december 1876 in badajoz reach values greater than 10 000 m3 s 1 ortega 2007 the authors using analysis of palaefloods conclude that the event of 1876 was surpassed only by the event of 1603 the historical descriptions of the event shown that the palmas bridge in badajoz was destroyed gonzález 1995 ortega 2007 other flood events as floods registered in january 1940 or march 1947 in badajoz reach values near 7 500 and 8 000 m3 s 1 respectively ortega 2007 this highlights the magnitude of the event registered in december 1876 as a clear outlier this document is organized as follows in section 2 the area of study the evolution of the flood event and its consequences in iberian peninsula are described then the precipitation dataset along with the hydrological and hydraulic models used in this paper are briefly described in section 3 the estimation of the precipitation the discharge flow and the numerical simulations of the flood event in badajoz are shown in section 4 along with the discussion of the results finally section 5 provides the main conclusions of this work the main objective of this work is to reproduce the flood registered on december 7 1876 in the city of badajoz by means of the numerical model iber bladé et al 2014 for this purpose the work was mainly divided into three stages in the first one an estimation of the precipitation recorded in the guadiana river basin during the days prior to the event was carried out next the rain runoff process associated with the precipitation in the guadiana basin was computed using the hec hms code feldman 2000 scharffenberg et al 2018 in order to obtain an estimation of the discharge flow in badajoz during the event once this discharge flow was computed iber was used to reproduce the flood event registered in badajoz 2 area of study and description of the event the basin of the international guadiana river is located in the south west of the iberian peninsula area 68 000 km2 with 83 located in spain and 17 in portugal agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 guadiana river has an approximate length of 800 km with an elevation that ranges from near 1300 m a s l at the head waters in the lagunas de ruidera castilla la mancha region spain to the sea level at its junction with the atlantic ocean in ayamonte just in the border between portugal and spain at present the natural regime of the river is highly modified by the construction of several large reservoirs as for example the orellana impoundment 808 hm3 or the cijara impoundment 1 505 hm3 that have increased the storage capacity of the river since 1954 to 14 000 hm3 snirh 2019 from a geomorphological point of view the river reach shows several special hydraulic characteristics the upper part of the basin is a plain based on carbonates the medium part crosses a paleozoic range entering the tertiary basin of extremadura in the lower part of the basin the river flows into the rocks in particular the city of badajoz spain is located at the transition of the tertiary basin to the paleozoic the reader can find a detailed description of the guadiana river in canuto et al 2019 badajoz is one of the most important riverine cities of the guadiana catchment with a population of ca 200 000 inhabitants and it is located near the border with portugal at an elevation of 120 m above sea level fig 1 d the city was founded in the year 875 ce gonzález rodríguez 1999 taking advantage of its strategic location just when the guadiana river passes between two important promontories originally the city was situated on the promontory to the se growing on the left bank of the river later the medieval bridge the palmas bridge of great strategic importance was built around the year 1460 to defend this bridge the hill located to the nw was later populated building a fortification at the end of the 19th century with the arrival of the railroad network the city also grew on the right bank of the river old maps of the city of badajoz corresponding to 1873 and 1946 fig 1 e and fig 1 g respectively reveal that the city has not been subjected to great human induced changes until mid twentieth century fig 1 e shows a map of badajoz made by the army general staff corps and published by the depósito de la guerra in 1873 at a scale of 1 5000 we have used the copy preserved in the municipal historical archive of badajoz a digital copy is available on the extremadura government s spatial data infrastructure website http www ideex es geoportal fig 1 g shows the image corresponding to badajoz of the photographic flight of mainland spain carried out in 1946 by the us army map service it is an orthophoto also available on the extremadura government s spatial data infrastructure website during the last century several modifications can be observed in current maps of the area fig 1 f these changes mainly influence the land uses of the area of study badajoz suffered the greatest adverse effects derived from the floods registered in 1876 the 1876 flood was generated by an episode of almost two weeks of continuous rainfalls end of november beginning of december corresponding to one of the most extreme precipitation events in the western iberian peninsula fragoso et al 2010 the consequences of this extreme precipitation event were observed in the riverbanks of several rivers including the three large southern iberian rivers tagus guadiana and guadalquivir newspapers in portugal and spain describe the effects of this event including titles such as diario de noticias gazeta do algarve el magisterio extremeño la ilustración española or la crónica in portugal according to diario de noticias almost 95 of the buildings in the village of mértola were completely destroyed gazeta do algarve published that some villages as pomarão alcoutim or vila real de santo antonio almost disappeared in central west spain the effects of the flood were similar to those registered in portugal the communications by road and train were destroyed in badajoz the palmas bridge main communication between both sides of the river collapsed for the first time since 1603 gonzález 1995 ortega 2007 other cities as mérida olivenza or talavera la real were also affected by this event loureiro 2009 refers to the event registered in 1876 like the biggest one in the basin of the tagus river in portugal fig 2 shows some of the main scenes derived by the flood in badajoz mérida and seville published by la ilustración española y americana the evolution of this extreme precipitation event is related to successive frontal systems with atlantic origin often with a sw to ne direction trigo et al 2014 a detailed synoptic analysis of the event is also shown in zamora cabanillas 1999 and trigo et al 2014 therefore this outstating flood cannot be considered as a flash flood event as in that case the delay between the precipitation peak and the flood only takes a few hours yin et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 spain02 precipitation dataset the observational gridded data set spain02 herrera et al 2012 2016 kotlarski et al 2019 was employed in this work to estimate the precipitation recorded during the event of december 1876 spain02 represents a set of high resolution daily precipitation and temperature gridded datasets developed for spain a high dense network of around 2500 control stations for the period 1950 2007 was selected from the spanish meteorological agency aemet in order to build the mesh that divides the domain in pixels that act as interpolated data point herrera et al 2012 2016 kotlarski et al 2019 in this work the data were obtained from the version spain02 v5 the spatial resolution of spain02 v5 is equal to 0 1 10 km the availability of data to estimate the precipitation in the entire basin is relatively scarce this is a common caveat when trying to reproduce historical floods the most relevant available data are the daily rainfall registered in the stations of évora and badajoz see fig 1 during the months of november and december 1876 these stations are located in the western part of the basin so the spatial distribution precipitation in the entire guadiana basin is difficult to determine fortunately precipitation obtained in the western and central sectors of iberia is highly dependent on synoptic circulation with a western component trigo and dacamara 2000 cortesi et al 2013 in fact it has been shown objectively that almost all the winter precipitation that falls in the guadiana basin is prevenient from the atlantic ocean gimeno et al 2010 2012 this fact implies that before reaching the basin upstream badajoz the same synoptic systems have already affected the precipitation over both cities évora and badajoz this physical constrain provides the rationale to stablish a simple statistical model linking the daily precipitation observed in these two stations with the daily precipitation in the guadiana basin upstream badajoz where no stations were available in 1876 a multivariate linear adjustment was carried out for the months of november and december of the years 1977 2006 between the rainfall registered in évora and badajoz with the rainfall associated to each of the pixels 571 interpolated data points belonging to the upstream guadiana river basin according to spain02 for each interpolated data point of the basin a relationship was established with both reference stations évora and badajoz as follows 1 p i c 0 i c 1 i p b c 2 i p e where pi is the precipitation at point i interpolated data point pb and pe are the precipitation at badajoz and évora respectively three coefficients were obtained from the linear fitting depending on the point i 3 2 hydrologic model hec hms the semi distributed model hec hms feldman 2000 scharffenberg et al 2018 was used to model the basin of the guadiana river to estimate the flow registered in badajoz hec hms is mainly divided into four components i an analytical model calculation of direct runoff and channel routing ii a basin model representation of hydrological elements in a watershed iii a system to manage input data and store data iv a post processing tool to report and illustrate simulation results this modelling system is one of the most used for hydrological procedures du et al 2012 akter and ahmed 2015 bai et al 2019 fraga et al 2020 two main processes were taken into account in the methodology implemented in this work loss and transform methods loss method calculates the infiltration capability of the terrain and provides the excess rainfall which is subject to surface runoff whereas the transform method models the way of how to convert this excess rainfall into runoff the soil conservation service scs curve number was selected to account for the surface runoff processes this method implements the curve number cn methodology for incremental losses since it was designed to calculate the losses during periods of heavy rainfall nrcs 2007 in the same way the scs unit hydrograph was also selected for the transformation method more information about the loss and transform methods used in this work are detailed in nrcs 2007 the basin of the guadiana river that flows into badajoz was divided in 35 sub basins according to their topographic features which range between 4 and 4538 km2 with an average size of 1346 km2 these sub basins were considered for the implementation of the hec hms model fig 3 the catchment size at badajoz is 48 530 km2 the lag time of the sub basins and the reaches was calculated using data from digital terrain models extracted by means of hec geohms tool hec geohms geospatial hydrologic modeling extension user s manual version 5 2010 the mean curve numbers cn defined for each sub basin were obtained from the work of the guadiana hydrographic confederation chg c h g 2003 these curve numbers were adapted to the humid soil conditions corresponding to the specific wet state observed prior to the event of 1876 trigo et al 2014 by applying the classic equations of the scs eq 1 these soil conditions were considered due to in the previous days of the main event which occurs between 4 and 7 december the averaged rain over the guadiana basin surpasses the limit established in previous works to consider moist soil conditions scs 1972 fernández nóvoa et al 2020 in addition previous studies developed in the iberian peninsula detected variations near 5 between theoretical and calibrated curve number values fernández nóvoa et al 2020 moreover added uncertainty associated to discrepancies in the land use and vegetation representation could also exist therefore a range of 10 was applied to the curve number values obtained in order to take into account the uncertainty of this parameter lag time tl values were obtained using eq 3 starting from the concentration time tc tc was computed according to ministerio de fomento 2016 and tl ranging between 0 35 and 0 6 times the tc value in order to take into account uncertainties associated to the calculation of this parameter and following recommendations of previous studies ncrs 1972 témez 1991 chg 2003 in eq 3 lc is the length of the longest flow channel km and jc is its corresponding slope m m the values of cns range from 85 to 90 and the average values of the tl range from 42 to 1303 min 2 cn moist 23 cn average 10

discharge flow in badajoz which constitute the input for iber 3 3 hydraulic model iber iber is a numerical tool that solves the 2d depth averaged shallow water equations using the finite volume method bladé et al 2014 recently some of the authors have developed garcía feal et al 2018 a new implementation of the model in c namely iber and cuda nvidia 2020 this new implementation of iber improves the efficiency of the simulations by achieving a speed up of two orders of magnitude with the same precision by using gpu graphical processing unit computing hpc high performance computing techniques these optimizations rise the possibility to employ the model in large spatio temporal domains gonzález cao et al 2019a garcía feal et al 2020 fernández nóvoa et al 2020 or time constrained applications fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019b also some applications of hybridization of iber with other cfd models like dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 were developed to analyse the behaviour of dams in high precipitation scenarios gonzález cao et al 2018 the software package is freely available and can be downloaded from its official website https iberaula es it also includes a gui graphical user interface with pre processing and post processing tools in the present study iber was applied to analyse the flood event registered in badajoz spain in december 1876 the domain defined in iber along with its inlet and outlet boundaries in the area of badajoz is shown in fig 4 the inlet condition is defined as a critical subcritical condition by defining the time series of the hydrograph and the outlet condition is defined as a supercritical critical condition the domain was discretized using a mesh of unstructured triangles whose characteristic size varies from 0 5 to 20 m with a total of 723 971elements the georeferenced image corresponds to the so called american photographic flight of 1946 this image will be used as a reference to define the different areas of the numerical domain in iber since it corresponds reasonably well with the map of the city of badajoz of 1873 fig 1 panel e we acknowledge that the image from the american flight shows some built up areas that did not appear in the 1873 map but in general the coincidence of most spatial features level is quite high the american flight image is also used as a reference since it covers a wider area and has a higher resolution once the numerical domain was defined and discretized it was adapted to the topography of the area by means of a dtm with a spatial resolution of 5 m that was retrieved from the spanish national geographic institute ign https www ign es web ign portal there is also information regarding the topography of the area corresponding to the early and mid 20th century a comparison study was carried out between the elevations provided by these sources and those provided by the 5 m dtm obtained from ign the differences obtained in this study are small and can be attributed to the lack of precision of the older data therefore the 5 m dtm from ign was taken as reference data determination of land uses is a difficult task when leading with historical flood events furthermore in some cases the component of the uncertainty of the hydraulic simulations associated to the determination of the land uses is highest one balasch et al 2011 this is not the case of the event analised in this paper since uncertainty associated to other variables curve numbers lag times is greater than uncertainty associated to land uses also the time step of the input data of the simulations daily precipitation data makes that the determination of land uses is not a key point of the numerical simulations therefore land uses defined in the domain correspond to a constant generic value according to mapama 2011 manning coefficients of the area of study can range from 0 015 to 0 04 s m 1 3 therefore a mean value equal to 0 027 sm 1 3 was applied to the entire domain special mention should be made to the palmas bridge located in badajoz this bridge has undergone various modifications over the past centuries it is about 590 m long and had 28 semicircular arches in 1873 each of them with different dimensions to model this bridge the tools implemented in iber were used to design this type of structures a series of simplification hypotheses were assumed given its constructive complexity in particular it was assumed that the height of the bridge is constant in the plans it can be seen that it presents a slightly higher elevation in the centre than in the ends additionally straight arches were considered since the definition of semicircular arches in iber would imply a significant increase in the complexity of the design that does not make sense in view of the existing uncertainty in the rest of input data a general view of the palmas bridge a detailed image of one of its arches the simplifications considered to model each arch of the bridge along with a scheme of an actual arch are shown in fig 5 to study the effect of the bridge on the elevation of the water level two simulations were carried out the first one was made taking into account the bridge and the second one without the bridge all the numerical simulations of iber and badajoz were performed using a gpu geforce rtx 2080 ti 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of the precipitation in the basin of the guadiana river during november and december 1876 the correlation between each interpolated data point and the two reference stations was calculated using eq 1 for each grid point in the spanish guadiana basin obtaining a higher correlation higher than 0 9 for the interpolated data points near the border between both countries and decreasing slightly to correlation values around 0 7 for the interpolated data points situated close to the guadiana headwaters the mean correlation which was calculated by averaging the correlation at the 571 interpolated data points is equal to 0 9 with an average statistical significance greater than 99 assuming that the relationship between the reference stations and the interpolated data points derived from spain02 has been maintained over time the rainfall at each point of the basin in 1876 can be inferred by applying eq 1 to the rainfall data collected in évora and badajoz during the event under study in 1876 mean reconstructed daily precipitation for november december 1876 is shown in fig 6 it provides a good representation of the synoptic situation as can be inferred from the work of trigo et al 2014 in addition it is especially remarkable the main event occurring over the guadiana basin between 4 and 7 december whose spatial precipitation pattern is shown in fig 7 thus the spatial distribution of the precipitation corresponding to the event can be obtained and used as the input data of the hec hms model in order to calculate the flow in badajoz associated with this precipitation 4 2 estimation of the discharge flow in badajoz in december 1876 once the precipitation in the entire basin of the guadiana river is obtained the time series of the discharge flow at badajoz can be estimated using the hec hms model the daily discharge flow at badajoz between the 4th and 12th of december 1876 can be observed in fig 8 the average peak flow solid line reaches a value of 12 774 m3 s 1 with an associated uncertainty dashed lines ranging from 11 417 m3 s 1 to 14 043 m3 s 1 these values are consistent with those estimated in the literature zamora cabanillas 1999 ortega 2007 ortega and garzón 2009 trigo et al 2014 where lower limits of the peak flow in the range of 10 000 and 10 500 m3s 1 are depicted cedex 1997 shows that another extreme event was registered in march 1947 the water mark of this event in the puente de palmas is 2 5 m below the water mark of the event of 1876 data obtained from gauge stations of puente de palmas data recorded from 1913 to 1993 and benavides data recorded from 1916 to 1985 located 11 km downstream the puente de palmas show values of 10 000 and 10 500 m3s 1 respectively for this event 06 03 1947 cedex 1997 estimate the peak value corresponding to the event of 1876 as 15 000 m3 s 1 therefore the peak flow of the event registered in 1876 must be higher than 10 000 m3s 1 this peak value highlights this event as the most extreme event recorded in badajoz exceeding the estimated value of peak discharge for the event of 1603 ortega 2007 in addition the peak value obtained with hec hms model is reached on day 7 which is also in full agreement with the references zamora cabanillas 1999 ortega 2007 trigo et al 2014 4 3 numerical analysis of the flood event of 1876 in badajoz once the time series of flow reaching badajoz has been calculated it can be used as an inlet condition in the numerical domain defined in iber first we perform a validation of the numerical results obtained through comparing the water levels attained in the simulations with the historical benchmarks available in the city of badajoz and the references that can be consulted in the literature the maximum extension of the flooded area obtained with iber is shown in fig 9 together with an estimate of the flooded area obtained from the benchmarks and considering the topography of the area extracted from the badajoz plan of the year 1873 although both results show a similar extension several discrepancies are clearly visible these relatively confined discrepancies can be attributed to the following two facts i the control points used for the georeferencing process of the 1873 map were located around the bastioned enclosure on the left bank of the guadiana river and at the head of the river bridge and fort of san cristóbal on the right bank being impossible to locate more exterior points this causes a progressive increase in map deformations as we move away from the urban area areas outlined in yellow in fig 9 and ii the variation in the surroundings of rivillas stream is due to the intense anthropogenic occupation throughout the end of the 20th century considerably modifying the topography of the stream and its banks in zamora cabanillas 1999 a reference to the 1876 event is mentioned stating that water rose between 9 and 10 m in the vicinity of the palmas bridge fig 10 shows the maximum numerical water depth of the water surface near the bridge obtained with the average flow results were obtained with red line and without the bridge blue line the maximum water level reached was 11 2 m when the bridge is considered and diminishing considerably to 8 6 m without the bridge these results taken into account the uncertainties associated to the input parameters of the numerical model are compatible with the available records if one considers that the bridge broke before the flow reached the potential maximum level of 11 m even so it realistically reproduces the sequence of events reported in the chronicle of the bridge breakage from the magazine el magisterio extremeño we have spent fifteen days of copious and incessant rain in guadiana rivillas and gévora you can see a considerable flood its waters are penetrating through the streets shortly after two a sudden and considerable drop in the water level the bridge has broken the sinking of many houses they increase panic in zamora cabanillas 1999 the situation is described in a similar way at three in the morning the flood suddenly subsided due to the collapse of the bridge indeed once the bridge disappeared the water level descended as shown in numerical simulations since higher water depths were obtained when considering the bridge the results shown in the following paragraphs correspond to that case there is a well known historical benchmark placed in the palmas gate near the palmas bridge in the left riverbank fig 11 panel a p g where a water depth around 1 33 m can be estimated fig 11 panel c the numerical simulation results obtained near that control benchmark imply a depth close to 1 5 m a value that is in good agreement with field data fig 11 panel b there are also some estimations on the extent of the water surface in the trinidad gate area on the other side of the city walls fig 11 panel a t g similarly we also provide the extension of the water surface obtained in the trinidad gate using the average flow fig 11 panel d it can be verified that the extension of the water sheet obtained in the numerical simulations is very close to field estimations fig 11 panel e there are certain discrepancies between the numerical results and the field measurements that are likely due to the uncertainties derived from the input data to iber and to the low spatial resolution of the dtms some of the streets near the trinidad gate are very narrow and difficult to reproduce using dtms with spatial resolution lower than 1 m nevertheless the spatial extent of the flooded area in this sector shows a reasonable agreement finally an additional evaluation assessment was applied to the maximum water depth registered at the trinidad gate specifically in the intersection of eugenio hermoso and ronda del pilar streets the maximum water depth can be estimated as 3 m fig 11 panel g the maximum water level obtained with iber using the average flow in this area is near 2 8 m fig 11 panel f and therefore the numerical results approximate reasonably well the reference data table 1 summarizes the location of the water marks along with the values of numerical water depth the water depth estimated from field measurements and the error of the numerical results once the precision of the numerical results has been verified the flood in early december 1876 can be analysed in more detail the evolution of the flood extent and magnitude from 4 to 12 december is shown in fig 12 results from 4 to 7 december were obtained considering the bridge still stood whilst results from 8 to 12 december were obtained considering that the bridge had collapsed the situation corresponding to the 4 december shows that some areas near badajoz were flooded due to the continuous precipitation recorded during the previous days as the flow increased the fields upstream badajoz started to flood days 5 and 6 the situation became critical on december 7 and 8 water depth reached the maximum values and the extension of the water flooded surface stretched the entire domain on december 7 on december 9 the water level decreased although the situation continued to be serious water levels kept declining until reaching a controllable situation already on december 12 this evolution of the flood is consistent with the detailed description shown by zamora cabanillas 1999 where it is clearly stated that the flood started on december 7 in the early morning in fact it is revealed in several references zamora cabanillas 1999 ortega 2007 that at 2 00 am the state of the river did not bode well el magisterio extremeño issue n 35 corresponding to december 15 1876 gonzález rodríguez 1995 the results of maximum water depths obtained for the entire numerical domain are shown in fig 13 panel a in general it can be seen that the fields upstream badajoz were totally flooded and that the area downstream badajoz was somewhat less affected which is mainly due to the topography of the area more specifically fig 13 panel b shows the maps of maximum water depth and fig 13 panel c maximum velocity obtained near the palmas bridge the maximum water depth near the bridge reached values close to 12 m as mentioned above and the maximum speed reached values close to 10 m s 1 these values are extraordinarily high and are probably the origin of the bridge collapse unfortunately there is no data on water velocity during the event to confirm this point 5 conclusions in this work the numerical reproduction of the flood event registered in badajoz on 7 december 1876 was carried out by means of the iber according to previous research this is the greatest flood event in the guadiana basin since 1603 ortega and garzón 2009 the task was divided into three stages first the determination of the spatial temporal pattern of rainfall in the entire basin of the guadiana river corresponding to the event was obtained from the daily rainfall records available at two meteorological stations namely at the cities of évora in portugal and badajoz in spain located in the extreme west of the basin fortunately the vast majority of synoptic systems responsible for precipitation across the entire guadiana basin in the winter months are also responsible for the precipitation events in évora and badajoz this physical base connection is essential to guarantee the good representativeness that these two stations offer as the validation of a simple model with recent data has confirmed thus the quality of reconstruction of the daily precipitation field during this extreme event in 1876 was well assured and confirmed through a validation exercise for present climate then once the pattern of rainfall was obtained the guadiana river basin was modeled by means of hec hms code to estimate the river discharge in badajoz this method allows obtaining the peak discharge in badajoz 12 774 1 360 m3s 1 this peak value surpasses the higher historical peak value obtained for the event of 1603 ortega and garzón 2009 finally the numerical reproduction of the flood event registered in badajoz was performed using iber to achieve this goal we took into account a number of structural features including the present and old topography of the area of study the effects of land uses and structures for example the palmas bridge the numerical simulation results obtained with iber were compared with reference data benchmarks and data obtained from bibliography showing a good agreement with reference data once the accuracy of the numerical results was assured the reconstruction of the daily evolution of the flood and detailed analysis of the water depth and water velocities near the palmas bridge was carried out the numerical simulations shown that the area near badajoz was flooded during almost 4 days and the maximum water depths reached values near 10 m before the collapse of the palmas bridge maximum velocity in the vicinity of the bridge was about 10 m s 1 a high value that undoubtedly influenced the collapse of some of the arches of the bridge the work has demonstrated the ability of iber to reproduce historical extreme flood events even when the availability of input data is relatively scarce finally we are confident that the multidisciplinary methodology presented here can be adapted to characterize in detail other major historical floods with scarce meteorological and hydrological data

4446,understanding the quantity and quality of riverine carbon is crucial to predict the changes in the global carbon cycle and to efficiently manage drinking water quality we investigated the loads and 14c ages of carbon exported by the five largest rivers in south korea using water samples collected seasonally along with daily water discharge data in 2012 2013 a total of 581 gg c was discharged by the five rivers annually releasing 7 9 1 5 and 0 6 g c m 2 yr 1 of dic doc and poc respectively from the river basins about 30 50 of annual riverine carbon loads were released during the summer monsoon period june august indicating strong effects of precipitation on the riverine carbon loads modern to old up to 1020 ybp carbon was released from the five river basins the δ14c ranged from 88 7 to 26 9 for dic 124 3 to 0 8 for doc and 125 5 to 35 1 for poc demonstrating dynamically changing sources of riverine carbon the δ14cdic δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc were the most enriched during the summer in almost all river systems indicating that relatively young carbon is exported in summer although old carbon is released in the other seasons the chemical weathering of both silicates and carbonates by co2 was a dominant process to generate riverine dic while the contribution from c3 plants was dominant for riverine doc the results suggest that both loads and ages of riverine carbon could be strongly influenced by the asian summer monsoon keywords dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc particulate organic carbon poc 14c 13c loads 1 introduction riverine carbon export is a key component of the global carbon cycle connecting terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems and can be used to determine whether a river basin acts as a carbon sink or a source the three forms of riverine carbon i e dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc account for 80 of the total riverine carbon loads and have been studied extensively ludwig et al 1998 meybeck 2003 huang et al 2012 the number of studies on particulate inorganic carbon pic is relatively small because the physical transfer of pic from lands to the oceans does not directly alter carbon sinks or sources in the global carbon cycle meybeck 2003 since riverine carbon species can influence the concentrations of pollutants by precipitation adsorption and complexation the ratio among the carbon forms can be directly linked with the fate of pollutants in rivers jaffé et al 2004 the ratio among the carbon forms is regulated by a variety of biogeochemical reactions and processes such as photosynthesis respiration sedimentation and co2 evasion meybeck 1993 raymond and bauer 2001 raymond et al 2013 concentrations of dic dic in rivers are mainly controlled by carbonic acid weathering of soils and rocks of the corresponding watershed oh and raymond 2006 shin et al 2011b while doc and poc are determined by the dynamic changes of inputs and outputs of organic matter om inputs of om include autochthonous production as well as allochthonous contributions from watersheds including soil organic matter som geologic deposits of organic materials e g coal or kerogen petsch et al 2001 longbottom and hockaday 2019 and wastewater treatment plants aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 griffith et al 2009 wei et al 2010 whereas outputs include burial of organic matter to the bottom of lakes and rivers tranvik et al 2009 and respiration followed by co2 evasion raymond et al 2013 the concentrations and loads of riverine carbon are strongly dependent on precipitation ppt and watershed hydrology riverine carbon load is calculated by multiplying carbon and discharge q thus an increase in ppt can raise the riverine carbon load even though carbon concentrations are diluted raymond and oh 2007 li and bush 2015 consequently riverine carbon export during summer monsoon can account for a large portion of annual carbon loads in asia such that 36 44 of annual doc and 71 86 of annual poc were transported by the huanghe river and the yangtze river respectively to the western bohai sea during only 2 3 summer months in 2009 wang et al 2012 furthermore anthropogenic impacts by dams and reservoirs can change hydrology by controlling inflow and releases the rivers that have many artificial dams and reservoirs differ from natural river systems in that they can have large seasonal variations of hydrological residence time hrt park et al 2009 and possibly carbon loads the increased ppt during summer monsoon can not only increase riverine carbon loads but also change the biogeochemical properties of river water by shifting the major sources of carbon wang et al 2012 dual carbon isotopes 13c and 14c have been used to determine the sources of riverine carbon raymond and bauer 2001 mayorga et al 2005 marwick et al 2015 whereas δ13c lies in a relatively narrow range from about 40 to 0 δ14c covers a wide range from 1000 to 200 in rivers and thus the dual carbon isotope analysis has merits to identify the sources of carbon compared to a single carbon isotope analysis butman et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 although studies have been conducted using the dual carbon isotope analysis for the major rivers of the world the studies examined one or two forms of carbon in general typically doc or poc butman et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 with 10 of the analyses conducted for all three forms of carbon i e dic doc and poc marwick et al 2015 dual carbon isotopes have been used for rivers in asia including the yellow river the changjiang river the mekong river and rivers in japan and taiwan kao and liu 1997 alam et al 2007 wang et al 2012 2016 martin et al 2013 however no rivers in asia have been analyzed for all three forms of carbon using dual carbon isotopes marwick et al 2015 riverine carbon with the 14c ages of modern to 10 000 ybp years before present was reported worldwide and the rivers in asia also showed similar ranges in the 14c ages marwick et al 2015 rivers in korea can share the characteristics of the rivers in asia such as changing hydrology under monsoon climates and anthropogenic perturbations of natural systems by many dams and reservoirs although many studies have been conducted for streams and a few large river systems in korea shin et al 2011a 2015 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2013 there has been no study on the annual carbon loads and the 14c ages for the major river systems in the republic of korea south korea the objectives of this study are 1 to estimate annual riverine carbon loads including dic doc and poc and 2 to examine seasonal changes of riverine carbon dynamics using dual carbon isotope analysis for the five largest rivers in south korea under asian monsoon climates here we report estimates of annual riverine carbon loads dic doc and poc and dual carbon isotope results for the five largest river systems in south korea for the first time which will deepen our understanding of river

riverine carbon water samples were collected on a seasonal basis from february 2012 to november 2013 at the middle of the bridge that is located on the lower reach of the five rivers to prevent the influence of tidal seawater fig 1 a total of 12 water samples were collected per river hr and gr and 10 11 water samples per river yr sr and nr in 2012 2013 all the water samples in a sampling campaign were collected within one to three days the water samples of the first two sampling campaigns feb and may 2012 were filtered using whatman glass fiber filter of 0 7 μm pore size on the site and were transported to the laboratory on ice to avoid temporal variation filtration was done in the lab after collecting all the river water samples within the two days in the other campaigns all filters were pre combusted at 400 c for 4 h about 300 ml of filtered water was refrigerated below 4 c after 100 μl of saturated hgcl2 was added to prevent microbial respiration in a pre combusted bod bottle for δ14cdic analysis about 1 l of filtered water was transferred to a polycarbonate bottle and was frozen for δ14cdoc and the residue on the filter was frozen for δ14cpoc analysis alkalinity

quantification limit was 0 01 meq l 1 for mg2 and so4 2 and 0 1 meq l 1 for ca2 and the maximum error of alkalinity was estimated to be about 10 riverine doc was analyzed using shimadzu toc vcph shimadzu corporation japan for filtered samples before poc analysis each filter was fumigated using concentrated hcl vapor for 6 h in a desiccator to remove inorganic carbon and dried at 80 c for 24 h hedges and stern 1984 komada et al 2008 organic carbon on the filter was combusted at 900 c by shimadzu ssm 5000a shimadzu corporation japan and the generated co2 was measured by the non dispersive

loadest load estimator program by us geological survey runkel et al 2004 was used to quantify riverine carbon loads which used a relationship between intermittently measured loads concentration q and continuously measured daily q although other methods of load estimation could be applied e g beale s ratio estimator sickman et al 2007 we selected the loadest software which has been used extensively in many studies on riverine loads lee et al 2019 raymond and oh 2007 song et al 2020 stets et al 2014 the daily q data for each site or the nearest gauging station were downloaded from wamis for 2012 2013 the distance between the sampling site and the gaging station ranged from 0 km gr to 8 km nr there no major confluence between the points and thus we expect little change in q a log linear relationship between loads and q was used to estimate daily dic doc and poc loads that were summed to estimate annual carbon loads in 2012 2013 model 1 of loadest the calculated poc load bias exceeded 25 after a typhoon hit in the nr in 2012 and thus the poc load was estimated by the loadest model 1 for the two separate periods the period of high q mean 3 standard deviation and the period of normal q to prevent overestimation a total of 11 days of the nr was categorized as the high q period q 0 16 km3 day 1 the poc loads of the two periods were combined to provide the annual poc load 2 3 dual carbon isotope analysis dual carbon isotope 14c and 13c analysis was conducted for river water samples collected seasonally in 2013 for 14c dic analysis filtered water samples were acidified using 40 h3po4 solution to convert dic to co2 then the released co2 was extracted cryogenically in a vacuum line and sealed in a pre baked pyrex tube raymond and bauer 2001 for 14c doc analysis each filtered water sample was also acidified with 40 h3po4 solution and sparged with helium gas to remove dic then the sample was oxidized with ultrahigh purity o2 gas using a uv lamp for 4 h raymond and bauer 2001 the oxidized co2 was purified cryogenically in a vacuum line and sealed in a combusted pyrex tube for 14c poc analysis each filter was fumigated with concentrated hcl vapor dried sealed in a pre burned quartz tube with cuo and a few strands of silver and oxidized at 850 c druffel et al 1992 the generated co2 from this step was collected in a pre combusted pyrex tube in the same manner as dic and doc dual carbon isotopes δ13c and δ14c were measured at the nosams national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry facility at the woods hole oceanographic institution http www whoi edu nosams in the usa the co2 samples in the sealed pyrex tubes were converted to graphite targets using fe catalyst under 1 atm h2 at 600 c mcnichol et al 1994 the graphite target was analyzed by accelerator mass spectrometry for δ14c and δ13c was measured using the optima isotope ratio mass spectrometer the 14c pre treatment and analysis are explained in detail in a review raymond and bauer 2001 the dual carbon isotope analyses for dic and doc were conducted for the water samples collected over the four seasons while the analysis for poc for summer and winter only the isosource program was used to calculate the contribution of possible sources to riverine doc https www epa gov eco research stable isotope mixing models estimating source proportions phillips and gregg 2003 the δ13c and δ14c of three main sources c3 plant c4 plant and fossil organic carbon of previous studies cerling et al 1997 kohn 2010 marwick et al 2015 were used as the end members of the isosource mixing model 2 4 statistical data analysis statistical analysis of concentration load yield and carbon isotopes of riverine carbon was conducted using the spss statistics v20 program ibm new york usa one way analysis of variance anova test and tukey s test were used to determine the difference of concentrations loads yields and carbon isotope ratios among the rivers and seasons the t test was conducted to compare carbon isotope ratios between the five rivers and the global rivers the relationships between δ13c and δ14c of each carbon species were analyzed using linear regression 3 results 3 1 loads and yields of riverine carbon annual mean dic doc and poc of the five rivers ranged from 7 1 to 14 1 mg l 1 1 4 to 3 7 mg l 1 and 0 5 to 2 4 mg l 1 respectively that were similar to the results of previous studies on some of the rivers lee et al 2007 shin et al 2011a 2011b 2015 kim et al 2013 annual flow weighted mean dic doc and poc concentrations dic f doc f and poc f respectively ranged from 5 2 to 11 2 mg l 1 1 4 to 3 6 mg l 1 and 0 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 respectively the lower dic f than dic was due to the negative correlation between dic and river discharge q suggesting that dic was diluted by increased q although dic was higher than what dilution accounted for in contrast doc was not dependent on q p 0 05 and poc increased as q increased resulting in similar or slightly higher flow weighted mean concentrations than the simple averages a total of 601 1 and 560 1 gg c yr 1 of riverine carbon were transported by the five rivers in 2012 and 2013 corresponding to the carbon yields i e riverine carbon loads basin area of 10 3 and 9 6 g c m 2 yr 1 respectively table 2 the yr showed the largest riverine carbon yields of 17 1 g c m 2 yr 1 and the sr the lowest carbon yields of 4 7 g c m 2 yr 1 table 2 dic was the dominant form of riverine carbon accounting for 80 of the total carbon loads with 14 by doc and 6 by poc in the five rivers the proportion was calculated dividing total dic loads total doc loads and total poc loads by total carbon loads respectively table 2 the riverine carbon loads were dependent on basin size and the hr with the largest basin area contributed 49 of the total carbon loads of the five rivers the riverine carbon load in this study can be underestimated because all extreme hydrologic events were not included text s1 and table s1 however since the annual ppt during the study period was 89 113 of the annual mean ppt for 1981 2010 the results of this study can be applied for years of similar mean annual ppt furthermore this is the first study to estimate annual riverine carbon loads for dic doc and poc in the five major rivers in south korea which can be a basis for future comparison the annual ppt was 1479 and 1163 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively and 36 51 of annual ppt rained during summer in south korea korean meteorological administration 2013 2014 the riverine carbon yields of the basins ranged from 2 4 to 6 2 g m 2 season 1 during summer which corresponds to 34 46 of the annual carbon yields including dic doc and poc the contribution of summer carbon yields to the annual carbon yields were 34 45 for dic 37 50 for doc and 33 47 for poc fig 2 3 2 δ 13c and δ14c of the five rivers the δ13cdic of the five rivers ranged from 14 4 to 4 3 with the most depleted δ13cdic in the yr and the most enriched in the hr fig 3 a the δ13cdic of each river was the lowest in summer p 0 01 fig 3a flow weighted mean δ13cdic δ13cdic f of the yr was the lowest 12 1 followed by the sr 11 6 the nr 10 2 the hr 9 4 and the gr 9 0 the δ14cdic of the five rivers ranged from 88 7 to 26 9 fig 3a which corresponded to the 14c ages of 685 ybp to modern respectively in contrast to δ13cdic the δ14cdic was the highest in summer resulting in a negative correlation between δ13cdic and the δ14cdic p 0 01 fig 3a the most depleted δ14cdic was observed in the hr and the most enriched in the sr p 0 01 the flow weighted mean δ14cdic δ14cdic f was the highest in the sr 15 8 followed by the yr 22 1 the gr 30 1 the nr 44 6 and the hr 55 7 in 2013 the riverine δ13cdoc ranged from 27 7 to 21 9 and depleted δ13cdoc was observed in summer fig 3b flow weighted mean δ13cdoc δ13cdoc f of the nr was the highest 19 6 followed by the sr 22 1 the yr 26 5 the hr 27 0 and the gr 27 2 the δ14cdoc ranged from 124 3 to 0 8 which corresponded to the 14c ages of 1000 ybp to modern respectively fig 3b the lowest δ14cdoc was observed in the gr and the nr and the highest in the hr and the sr the most enriched δ14cdoc in each river was observed in summer fig 3b flow weighted mean δ14cdoc δ14cdoc f of gr was the lowest 100 1 followed by the nr 63 2 the yr 56 3 the hr 20 2 and the sr 14 7 the δ13cpoc ranged from 30 0 to 21 2 fig 3c the δ14cpoc was higher in summer than winter ranging from 125 5 to 35 1 which corresponded to the 14c ages of 1020 ybp to modern respectively fig 3c despite the oldest poc occurring in the hr in summer relatively young poc was released during summer in general fig 3c 3 3 carbon source apportionment of doc the isosource mixing model was used to identify the main sources of doc lu et al 2014 organic carbon derived from c3 plants was a dominant source of riverine doc across the five rivers regardless of the seasons organic carbon derived from c3 plants can contribute 47 85 of riverine doc mean 70 followed by fossil oc 11 22 mean 16 and oc derived from c4 plants 2 34 mean 14 the contribution of oc derived from c3 and c4 plants to riverine doc increased to 89 in summer 4 discussion 4 1 concentrations loads and yields of riverine carbon the mean dic f of the five rivers in south korea was 9 5 and 10 4 mg l 1 for 2012 and 2013 respectively table 2 which was close to the global mean dic f of the 35 major rivers 8 6 mg l 1 ludwig et al 1998 huang et al 2012 however the dic yields of the five river basins ranged from 3 4 to 11 7 g m 2 yr 1 with the mean of 7 9 g m 2 yr 1 which were higher than the mean dic yield of the 60 major global river basins 2 6 g m 2 yr 1 gaillardet et al 1999 huang et al 2012 lithology is one of the strongest factors that can influence riverine dic and possibly also dic yield of a basin for example a large annual dic yield of 38 3 g m 2 yr 1 was observed in a carbonate dominant catchment of the south hr shin et al 2011a one of the two major tributaries of the hr which suggests that carbonate bedrocks can raise the dic yield of the hr basin downstream however the dominant bedrock composition across these river basins includes granites and granitic gneiss chough et al 2000 suggesting that factors other than lithology can raise the dic yield of the basins the dic yield of a watershed can be boosted by increased ppt and subsequently q because weathering products stored in a watershed can be released by increased water flow despite a decrease in dic due to dilution li and bush 2015 since the weathering flux is calculated by multiplying the concentration and q a sudden increase in q can raise the weathering flux during the summer overcoming the dilution effect about 38 of annual dic was released from the five river basins during summer while only 16 in winter fig 2a although riverine discharge is the largest during the summer the contribution from baseflow estimated using the what web based hydrograph analysis tool program was reported to be the smallest 50 while that can increase to 80 during the winter in the five river systems choi et al 2014 major parts of dic could be supplied by groundwater baseflow with a time lag after precipitations jung et al 2019 and thus the riverine dic loads from baseflow could be delayed to the next seasons thus the precipitation during summer increase not only the riverine dic loads during summer but also the riverine dic loads in the other seasons annual water yields i e annual q basin area of the five river basins ranged 0 5 1 0 m yr 1 two to four times larger than the global mean water yield of 0 25 m yr 1 global runoff data center http www bafg de grdc although the five largest rivers of south korea have lower water discharge than major rivers in the world water yields of the rivers are as high as other major rivers of the world text s2 and fig s1 the ratio of dic yield of each river basin to the global mean dic yield ranged from 2 1 to 4 0 which was close to that of water yield ranging from 2 3 to 4 3 suggesting that the difference of dic yields among the five river basins can be mainly explained by the hydrological difference since the annual ppt of 2012 and 2013 were 1479 and 1163 mm which was 13 larger and 11 lower than the 30 year 1981 2010 mean annual ppt of 1307 mm respectively the estimated dic yields may be close to the dic yield over a long term not overestimating or underestimating it the doc of the five rivers was relatively low 1 1 5 5 mg l 1 compared to that of the 48 global major rivers which ranged from 0 3 to 70 8 mg l 1 marwick et al 2015 the mean doc f of the five rivers was 2 0 mg l 1 which was also lower than that of the global mean of 118 rivers 5 3 mg l 1 dai et al 2012 however the doc yield 1 0 3 5 g m 2 yr 1 was similar to the global average doc yield of 1 4 g m 2 yr 1 0 1 5 7 g m 2 yr 1 due to high water yields of the five river basins ludwig et al 1996 huang et al 2012 considering that riverine doc can increase as organic carbon oc content or c n ratio of a watershed increases and that doc can be positively correlated with the proportion of wetlands in a watershed aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 alvarez cobelas et al 2012 it is not surprising to find low doc in the five rivers in south korea because the area covered by wetland is 1 and because 80 of the land area is mapped as entisols or inceptisols with low om content jeong et al 2003 furthermore areas with a slope of 30 cover 30 60 of the five river basins ji et al 2012 which can reduce the contact time between water and som and thus possibly reducing riverine doc riverine doc load was also mainly controlled by riverine discharge such that 43 of annual doc load was released during summer while only 13 in winter fig 2b other river systems in asia demonstrated that 40 90 of annual doc load was transported during the summer monsoon period indicating the strong role of hydrology on riverine doc loads under monsoon climates bird et al 2008 wang et al 2012 the poc was relatively low 0 5 2 4 mg l 1 in the five rivers compared to that of the 36 major global rivers which ranged from 0 1 to 242 mg l 1 marwick et al 2015 the mean poc f of the five rivers was 1 5 mg l 1 which was lower than that of the 35 major rivers 4 5 mg l 1 huang et al 2012 in addition the poc yields during summer in the five river basins were about 2 10 times lower than the mean poc yield 1 3 g m 2 yr 1 of 32 major rivers despite the high water yield of the five rivers ludwig et al 1996 huang et al 2012 fig 2 dams and reservoirs can increase mean hrt allowing particles to be settled down and trapped within the reservoir thus poc and subsequently poc yields can decrease the number of dams and reservoirs in south korea is estimated at approximately 18 000 including small agricultural reservoirs park et al 2005 http www kwater or kr many dams and reservoirs have been used to manage water resources especially since the 1960s kim et al 2001 http www kwater or kr which could decrease poc of the dam effluent for example the poc of the paldang reservoir which is the major reservoir for water supply for seoul was less than a quarter of poc of the inlet water kim et al 2014 the reduction of poc in the outlet was also observed in other dams e g soyang dam and chunju dam shin et al 2013 suggesting that the poc yield at the lower reach of the river can decrease as the river passes through many dams and reservoirs 4 2 δ 13c and δ 14c of riverine carbon 4 2 1 dic the mean of δ13cdic of the five rivers was 9 6 which was higher than the global mean δ13cdic of 12 5 p 0 05 and the mean of δ14cdic of the five rivers was 33 4 88 7 to 26 9 which was similar to the global mean δ14cdic of 32 749 to 179 fig 4 a marwick et al 2015 while δ13cdic ranged from 14 4 to 11 4 during summer across the five rivers that of the other seasons ranged from 10 1 to 4 3 fig 3a this suggests that the relative contribution of respiration to riverine dic increases in summer while that of carbonate weathering increases in the other seasons considering that carbonate weathering can raise the δ13c of river water fig 3a the proportion of carbonated area within a basin was the largest 8 2 in the hr basin among the five basins whereas those of the other basins were 1 2 table s2 indicating the strong role of the lithology of the basin other factors can also shift the riverine δ13cdic isotopic fractionation between gaseous co2 and dic species can increase riverine δ13cdic myrttinen et al 2012 if silicates are weathered by soil co2 assuming δ13cco2 is 23 and isotopic fractionation of dic species occurs the δ13cdic can range from 16 to 12 text s3 and fig s2 seasonal mean δ13cdic in the five rivers in summer was 12 6 which was within the range while those of the other seasons increased up to 7 8 suggesting that the contribution of silicate weathering by soil co2 to riverine dic can be higher in summer than the other seasons mineral weathering by atmospheric co2 or soil co2 derived from c4 plants can increase riverine δ13cdic but they are unlikely to be a dominant process considering that the area covered by c3 plants are dominant in south korea carbonate weathering by n s acids acid containing nitrogen or sulfur can also increase riverine δ13cdic the other sources include co2 exchange between the atmosphere and river water shin et al 2011a song et al 2020 and anthropogenic contributions such as detergent carbonates included in ingredients and agricultural liming e g application of crushed carbonates oh and raymond 2006 lee et al 2007 hossler and bauer 2013 shin et al 2015 each of these sources can increase δ13cdic and decrease δ14cdic even in basins with low coverage of carbonate substrate even though limestones cover only 1 of a basin area in the mun river in thailand the influence of carbonate on riverine dic was reported to be predominant li et al 2019 suggesting that the other anthropogenic source such as urban wastewater can be also important up to 4 9 of riverine δ13cdic has been reported in the hr and the gr lee et al 2007 shin et al 2015 up to 3 6 of riverine δ13cdic was also observed in silicate dominant catchment of the gr shin et al 2011a the shift of major sources of riverine dic in summer is also reflected by the highest δ14cdic fig 3a because the respiration of biota can produce relatively modern δ14cdic in contrast weathering of sedimentary rocks including carbonates can lower the δ14cdic because there is no detectable 14c in old 60 000 years rocks although pedogenic carbonates can contain modern 14c they tend to be formed in dry environments where annual ppt is lower than 500 mm yr 1 zamanian et al 2016 the annual ppt of south korea is 1300 mm yr 1 and thus the contribution of pedogenic carbonates to riverine dic is unlikely the δ14cdic was the lowest in the hr which could be due to the weathering of sedimentary carbonates within the hr basin 4 2 2 doc the mean δ13cdoc of the five rivers was 25 8 which was close to the mean of 55 world rivers 26 9 whereas the mean δ14cdoc of the five rivers was 60 3 which was significantly depleted than the mean of 65 world rivers 22 5 p 0 05 fig 4b the δ14cdoc was highest during summer in most rivers fig 3b suggesting that inputs of relatively young organic carbon from litter or surface soils to the rivers can increase due to high ppt and q in summer in contrast depleted δ14cdoc was observed in other seasons which could be due to the release of aged soil doc in deep soil horizons or groundwater doc during base flow barnes et al 2018 however the soils are mapped as entisols or inceptisols with relatively shallow depth suggesting that there could be other sources of old doc in the rivers the low δ14cdoc can be due to petrochemical products processed in wastewater treatment plant wwtp or applied in agricultural fields griffith et al 2009 sickman et al 2010 butman et al 2012 for example the average 14c ages of wwtp effluent doc can be as low as 2 650 ybp in the hudson river and the connecticut river griffith et al 2009 which corresponds to δ14cdoc of 187 the δ14cdoc ranged from 114 to 97 9 in wwtp effluent at lower reaches of the hr in south korea jin et al 2018 the δ14cdoc of 254 was reported from the drainage of agricultural fields sickman et al 2010 suggesting that urban and agricultural land use can lower the riverine δ14cdoc this may explain the depleted δ14cdoc in the gr and the yr fig 3 where the proportion of agricultural and urban areas are the largest among the five river basins table 1 the wwtp effluent accounted for 4 49 of river discharge in the four rivers the hr the gr the yr and the nr during the low flow period jan may oct dec in 2004 2008 moon et al 2010 the proportion increased up to 83 100 in the hr gr and yr when the discharge was the lowest moon et al 2010 the mean doc of effluents from 110 wwtps located over south korea was 5 3 mg l 1 in 2014 2015 jeong et al 2016 which was larger than the mean doc f of the five rivers 2 0 mg l 1 thus wwtp effluent could be a main source of old doc in the five rivers of south korea when the river flow is relatively low the results of isosource modeling indicated that the contribution of fossil oc to doc ranged from 11 to 22 in the rivers of south korea which was similar to the proportion of fossil oc to doc in wwtp effluent 11 25 in australia and usa griffith et al 2009 law et al 2013 however aged som is also an important source of doc which can lower δ14cdoc blair and aller 2012 thus the actual proportion of fossil oc to riverine doc could become lower than the above proportions 4 2 3 poc since the number of measurements on δ14cpoc is only about half of δ14cdoc the isotope results should be interpreted with caution nonetheless the δ14cpoc ranged from 125 5 to 35 1 in the five rivers with the mean of 46 4 which was significantly higher than that of 59 major world rivers of 204 p 0 05 suggesting that relatively young poc is released from the five rivers fig 4c marwick et al 2015 the riverine δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc of summer were higher than winter in most rivers and δ14cpoc increased significantly with poc across the five rivers r2 0 60 p 0 02 except the sr in winter possibly due to increased allochthonous oc inputs by high ppt during summer kwon et al 2002 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2013 autochthonous om inputs such as plankton or algae derived om could also be a major source of young poc in the rivers which could be increased by inputs of tn total n and tp total p released from wwtps high tn and tp 2 6 34 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 0 7 mg l 1 respectively were observed in the effluents of the four different types of wwtps cho et al 2014 which suggests that plankton or algal growth could be facilitated by nutrient supply from wwtp effluents as well as by long hrt due to many dams and reservoirs in the rivers except summer high rainfall period in general riverine δ14cdoc tends to be higher than δ14cpoc in world rivers because solubilized doc in soils tends to be younger than the poc from which it is derived o brien 1986 trumbore et al 1992 raymond and bauer 2001 marwick et al 2015 furthermore higher δ14cdoc than δ14cpoc can be observed if poc undergoes deposition resuspension in river systems whereas doc quickly exits through the rivers raymond and bauer 2001 marwick et al 2015 however δ14cdoc was lower than δ14cpoc in the five rivers during winter fig 5 possibly due to the increased contribution of doc from wwtp or agricultural petrochemicals to the rivers whereas poc inputs from wwtp is minor kwon et al 2002 lee et al 2013 kim et al 2014 5 conclusions a total of 581 gg yr 1 of riverine carbon dic doc and poc combined was released by the five largest rivers in south korea during 2012 2013 with 80 of it in the form of dic about 34 46 of total carbon was discharged throughout the rivers during summer demonstrating the role of monsoons on riverine carbon loads seasonal changes were also observed in carbon isotope ratios the 14c ages of the riverine carbon varied from modern to 1020 ybp with higher δ14cdic δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc in summer than the other seasons across the five rivers indicating the shift of the carbon sources depending on seasons modern carbon was dominantly released from the five river basins during summer monsoon regardless of carbon forms demonstrating that biological respiration and fresh inputs of organic matter increased by high temperature and precipitation in summer the riverine δ14cdic was mainly controlled by natural factors such as weathering of soils and rocks within a basin while δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc could have been influenced by anthropogenic factors such as dams and wwtps in south korea in particular during low flow season if the frequency and or intensity of precipitation increases the seasonal changes of riverine carbon sources could be amplified the impact that the changes may bring in the context of the global carbon cycle is not yet known warranting future studies credit authorship contribution statement eun ju lee conceptualization formal analysis investigation writing

4446,understanding the quantity and quality of riverine carbon is crucial to predict the changes in the global carbon cycle and to efficiently manage drinking water quality we investigated the loads and 14c ages of carbon exported by the five largest rivers in south korea using water samples collected seasonally along with daily water discharge data in 2012 2013 a total of 581 gg c was discharged by the five rivers annually releasing 7 9 1 5 and 0 6 g c m 2 yr 1 of dic doc and poc respectively from the river basins about 30 50 of annual riverine carbon loads were released during the summer monsoon period june august indicating strong effects of precipitation on the riverine carbon loads modern to old up to 1020 ybp carbon was released from the five river basins the δ14c ranged from 88 7 to 26 9 for dic 124 3 to 0 8 for doc and 125 5 to 35 1 for poc demonstrating dynamically changing sources of riverine carbon the δ14cdic δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc were the most enriched during the summer in almost all river systems indicating that relatively young carbon is exported in summer although old carbon is released in the other seasons the chemical weathering of both silicates and carbonates by co2 was a dominant process to generate riverine dic while the contribution from c3 plants was dominant for riverine doc the results suggest that both loads and ages of riverine carbon could be strongly influenced by the asian summer monsoon keywords dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc particulate organic carbon poc 14c 13c loads 1 introduction riverine carbon export is a key component of the global carbon cycle connecting terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems and can be used to determine whether a river basin acts as a carbon sink or a source the three forms of riverine carbon i e dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc account for 80 of the total riverine carbon loads and have been studied extensively ludwig et al 1998 meybeck 2003 huang et al 2012 the number of studies on particulate inorganic carbon pic is relatively small because the physical transfer of pic from lands to the oceans does not directly alter carbon sinks or sources in the global carbon cycle meybeck 2003 since riverine carbon species can influence the concentrations of pollutants by precipitation adsorption and complexation the ratio among the carbon forms can be directly linked with the fate of pollutants in rivers jaffé et al 2004 the ratio among the carbon forms is regulated by a variety of biogeochemical reactions and processes such as photosynthesis respiration sedimentation and co2 evasion meybeck 1993 raymond and bauer 2001 raymond et al 2013 concentrations of dic dic in rivers are mainly controlled by carbonic acid weathering of soils and rocks of the corresponding watershed oh and raymond 2006 shin et al 2011b while doc and poc are determined by the dynamic changes of inputs and outputs of organic matter om inputs of om include autochthonous production as well as allochthonous contributions from watersheds including soil organic matter som geologic deposits of organic materials e g coal or kerogen petsch et al 2001 longbottom and hockaday 2019 and wastewater treatment plants aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 griffith et al 2009 wei et al 2010 whereas outputs include burial of organic matter to the bottom of lakes and rivers tranvik et al 2009 and respiration followed by co2 evasion raymond et al 2013 the concentrations and loads of riverine carbon are strongly dependent on precipitation ppt and watershed hydrology riverine carbon load is calculated by multiplying carbon and discharge q thus an increase in ppt can raise the riverine carbon load even though carbon concentrations are diluted raymond and oh 2007 li and bush 2015 consequently riverine carbon export during summer monsoon can account for a large portion of annual carbon loads in asia such that 36 44 of annual doc and 71 86 of annual poc were transported by the huanghe river and the yangtze river respectively to the western bohai sea during only 2 3 summer months in 2009 wang et al 2012 furthermore anthropogenic impacts by dams and reservoirs can change hydrology by controlling inflow and releases the rivers that have many artificial dams and reservoirs differ from natural river systems in that they can have large seasonal variations of hydrological residence time hrt park et al 2009 and possibly carbon loads the increased ppt during summer monsoon can not only increase riverine carbon loads but also change the biogeochemical properties of river water by shifting the major sources of carbon wang et al 2012 dual carbon isotopes 13c and 14c have been used to determine the sources of riverine carbon raymond and bauer 2001 mayorga et al 2005 marwick et al 2015 whereas δ13c lies in a relatively narrow range from about 40 to 0 δ14c covers a wide range from 1000 to 200 in rivers and thus the dual carbon isotope analysis has merits to identify the sources of carbon compared to a single carbon isotope analysis butman et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 although studies have been conducted using the dual carbon isotope analysis for the major rivers of the world the studies examined one or two forms of carbon in general typically doc or poc butman et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 with 10 of the analyses conducted for all three forms of carbon i e dic doc and poc marwick et al 2015 dual carbon isotopes have been used for rivers in asia including the yellow river the changjiang river the mekong river and rivers in japan and taiwan kao and liu 1997 alam et al 2007 wang et al 2012 2016 martin et al 2013 however no rivers in asia have been analyzed for all three forms of carbon using dual carbon isotopes marwick et al 2015 riverine carbon with the 14c ages of modern to 10 000 ybp years before present was reported worldwide and the rivers in asia also showed similar ranges in the 14c ages marwick et al 2015 rivers in korea can share the characteristics of the rivers in asia such as changing hydrology under monsoon climates and anthropogenic perturbations of natural systems by many dams and reservoirs although many studies have been conducted for streams and a few large river systems in korea shin et al 2011a 2015 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2013 there has been no study on the annual carbon loads and the 14c ages for the major river systems in the republic of korea south korea the objectives of this study are 1 to estimate annual riverine carbon loads including dic doc and poc and 2 to examine seasonal changes of riverine carbon dynamics using dual carbon isotope analysis for the five largest rivers in south korea under asian monsoon climates here we report estimates of annual riverine carbon loads dic doc and poc and dual carbon isotope results for the five largest river systems in south korea for the first time which will deepen our understanding of river

longest river in south korea and the water flow is the slowest lee et al 2003 the mean slope of the five river basins ranged from 26 6 to 37 3 shin et al 2016 and the proportion of wetland was 3 of the total basin area table 1 due to the extreme range of flow conditions anthropogenic structures including 1 213 dams and 18 000 reservoirs have been used to manage water resources park et al 2005 http www kwater or kr thus the water chemistry and discharge of the river systems reflect not only natural but also anthropogenic settings within the basins 2 2 chemical properties and loads of riverine carbon water samples were collected on a seasonal basis from february 2012 to november 2013 at the middle of the bridge that is located on the lower reach of the five rivers to prevent the influence of tidal seawater fig 1 a total of 12 water samples were collected per river hr and gr and 10 11 water samples per river yr sr and nr in 2012 2013 all the water samples in a sampling campaign were collected within one to three days the water samples of the first two sampling campaigns feb and may 2012 were filtered using whatman glass fiber filter of 0 7 μm pore size on the site and were transported to the laboratory on ice to avoid temporal variation filtration was done in the lab after collecting all the river water samples within the two days in the other campaigns all filters were pre combusted at 400 c for 4 h about 300 ml of filtered water was refrigerated below 4 c after 100 μl of saturated hgcl2 was added to prevent microbial respiration in a pre combusted bod bottle for δ14cdic analysis about 1 l of filtered water was transferred to a polycarbonate bottle and was frozen for δ14cdoc and the residue on the filter was frozen for δ14cpoc analysis alkalinity was determined by ion balance using concentrations of cations na nh4 k mg2 ca2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 the same method has been used to estimate alkalinity cho et al 2009 2010 2012 major ions of the filtered water samples were quantified by dionex ics 1600 ion chromatography dionex sunnyvale ca usa dionex cs12a column was used to measure concentrations of cations with 20 mm methanesulfonic acid as an eluent and a dionex as14 rfic column was used to measure concentrations of anions with 1 0 mm nahco3 and 3 5 mm na2co3 as eluent solutions unfiltered water ph and temperature were measured on

reference materials environmental resource associates era colorado usa the concentrations of major ions were measured to the level of 0 01 0 1 meq l 1 depending on the ion for example the quantification limit was 0 01 meq l 1 for mg2 and so4 2 and 0 1 meq l 1 for ca2 and the maximum error of alkalinity was estimated to be about 10 riverine doc was analyzed using shimadzu toc vcph shimadzu corporation japan for filtered samples before poc analysis each filter was fumigated using concentrated hcl vapor for 6 h in a desiccator to remove inorganic carbon and dried at 80 c for 24 h hedges and stern 1984 komada et al 2008 organic carbon on the filter was combusted at 900 c by shimadzu ssm 5000a shimadzu corporation japan and the generated co2 was measured by the non dispersive infrared ndir detector of shimadzu toc vcph a set of standard materials was inserted every 15 to 20 samples the r2 of calibration curves was above 0 99 the measurement error was up to 0 05 mg c the loadest load estimator program by us geological survey runkel et al 2004 was used to quantify riverine carbon loads which used a relationship between intermittently measured loads concentration q and continuously measured daily q although other methods of load estimation could be applied e g beale s ratio estimator sickman et al 2007 we selected the loadest software which has been used extensively in many studies on riverine loads lee et al 2019 raymond and oh 2007 song et al 2020 stets et al 2014 the daily q data for each site or the nearest gauging station were downloaded from wamis for 2012 2013 the distance between the sampling site and the gaging station ranged from 0 km gr to 8 km nr there no major confluence between the points and thus we expect little change in q a log linear relationship between loads and q was used to estimate daily dic doc and poc loads that were summed to estimate annual carbon loads in 2012 2013 model 1 of loadest the calculated poc load bias exceeded 25 after a typhoon hit in the nr in 2012 and thus the poc load was estimated by the loadest model 1 for the two separate periods the period of high q mean 3 standard deviation and the period of normal q to prevent overestimation a total of 11 days of the nr was categorized as the high q period q 0 16 km3 day 1 the poc loads of the two periods were combined to provide the annual poc load 2 3 dual carbon isotope analysis dual carbon isotope 14c and 13c analysis was conducted for river water samples collected seasonally in 2013 for 14c dic analysis filtered water samples were acidified using 40 h3po4 solution to convert dic to co2 then the released co2 was extracted cryogenically in a vacuum line and sealed in a pre baked pyrex tube raymond and bauer 2001 for 14c doc analysis each filtered water sample was also acidified with 40 h3po4 solution and sparged with helium gas to remove dic then the sample was oxidized with ultrahigh purity o2 gas using a uv lamp for 4 h raymond and bauer 2001 the oxidized co2 was purified cryogenically in a vacuum line and sealed in a combusted pyrex tube for 14c poc analysis each filter was fumigated with concentrated hcl vapor dried sealed in a pre burned quartz tube with cuo and a few strands of silver and oxidized at 850 c druffel et al 1992 the generated co2 from this step was collected in a pre combusted pyrex tube in the same manner as dic and doc dual carbon isotopes δ13c and δ14c were measured at the nosams national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry facility at the woods hole oceanographic institution http www whoi edu nosams in the usa the co2 samples in the sealed pyrex tubes were converted to graphite targets using fe catalyst under 1 atm h2 at 600 c mcnichol et al 1994 the graphite target was analyzed by accelerator mass spectrometry for δ14c and δ13c was measured using the optima isotope ratio mass spectrometer the 14c pre treatment and analysis are explained in detail in a review raymond and bauer 2001 the dual carbon isotope analyses for dic and doc were conducted for the water samples collected over the four seasons while the analysis for poc for summer and winter only the isosource program was used to calculate the contribution of possible sources to riverine doc https www epa gov eco research stable isotope mixing models estimating source proportions phillips and gregg 2003 the δ13c and δ14c of three main sources c3 plant c4 plant and fossil organic carbon of previous studies cerling et al 1997 kohn 2010 marwick et al 2015 were used as the end members of the isosource mixing model 2 4 statistical data analysis statistical analysis of concentration load yield and carbon isotopes of riverine carbon was conducted using the spss statistics v20 program ibm new york usa one way analysis of variance anova test and tukey s test were used to determine the difference of concentrations loads yields and carbon isotope ratios among the rivers and seasons the t test was conducted to compare carbon isotope ratios between the five rivers and the global rivers the relationships between δ13c and δ14c of each carbon species were analyzed using linear regression 3 results 3 1 loads and yields of riverine carbon annual mean dic doc and poc of the five rivers ranged from 7 1 to 14 1 mg l 1 1 4 to 3 7 mg l 1 and 0 5 to 2 4 mg l 1 respectively that were similar to the results of previous studies on some of the rivers lee et al 2007 shin et al 2011a 2011b 2015 kim et al 2013 annual flow weighted mean dic doc and poc concentrations dic f doc f and poc f respectively ranged from 5 2 to 11 2 mg l 1 1 4 to 3 6 mg l 1 and 0 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 respectively the lower dic f than dic was due to the negative correlation between dic and river discharge q suggesting that dic was diluted by increased q although dic was higher than what dilution accounted for in contrast doc was not dependent on q p 0 05 and poc increased as q increased resulting in similar or slightly higher flow weighted mean concentrations than the simple averages a total of 601 1 and 560 1 gg c yr 1 of riverine carbon were transported by the five rivers in 2012 and 2013 corresponding to the carbon yields i e riverine carbon loads basin area of 10 3 and 9 6 g c m 2 yr 1 respectively table 2 the yr showed the largest riverine carbon yields of 17 1 g c m 2 yr 1 and the sr the lowest carbon yields of 4 7 g c m 2 yr 1 table 2 dic was the dominant form of riverine carbon accounting for 80 of the total carbon loads with 14 by doc and 6 by poc in the five rivers the proportion was calculated dividing total dic loads total doc loads and total poc loads by total carbon loads respectively table 2 the riverine carbon loads were dependent on basin size and the hr with the largest basin area contributed 49 of the total carbon loads of the five rivers the riverine carbon load in this study can be underestimated because all extreme hydrologic events were not included text s1 and table s1 however since the annual ppt during the study period was 89 113 of the annual mean ppt for 1981 2010 the results of this study can be applied for years of similar mean annual ppt furthermore this is the first study to estimate annual riverine carbon loads for dic doc and poc in the five major rivers in south korea which can be a basis for future comparison the annual ppt was 1479 and 1163 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively and 36 51 of annual ppt rained during summer in south korea korean meteorological administration 2013 2014 the riverine carbon yields of the basins ranged from 2 4 to 6 2 g m 2 season 1 during summer which corresponds to 34 46 of the annual carbon yields including dic doc and poc the contribution of summer carbon yields to the annual carbon yields were 34 45 for dic 37 50 for doc and

δ14cdic of the five rivers ranged from 88 7 to 26 9 fig 3a which corresponded to the 14c ages of 685 ybp to modern respectively in contrast to δ13cdic the δ14cdic was the highest in summer resulting in a negative correlation between δ13cdic and the δ14cdic p 0 01 fig 3a the most depleted δ14cdic was observed in the hr and the most enriched in the sr p 0 01 the flow weighted mean δ14cdic δ14cdic f

higher in summer than winter ranging from 125 5 to 35 1 which corresponded to the 14c ages of 1020 ybp to modern respectively fig 3c despite the oldest poc occurring in the hr in summer relatively young poc was released during summer in general fig 3c 3 3 carbon source apportionment of doc the isosource mixing model was used to identify the main sources of doc lu et al 2014 organic carbon derived from c3 plants was a dominant source of riverine doc across the five rivers regardless of the seasons organic carbon derived from c3 plants can contribute 47 85 of riverine doc mean 70 followed by fossil oc 11 22 mean 16 and oc derived from c4 plants 2 34 mean 14 the contribution of oc derived from c3 and c4 plants to riverine doc increased to 89 in summer 4 discussion 4 1 concentrations loads and yields of riverine carbon the mean dic f of the five rivers in south korea was 9 5 and 10 4 mg l 1 for 2012 and 2013 respectively table 2 which was close to the global mean dic f of the 35 major rivers 8 6 mg l 1 ludwig et al 1998 huang et al 2012 however the dic yields of the five river basins ranged from 3 4 to 11 7 g m 2 yr 1 with the mean of 7 9 g m 2 yr 1 which were higher than the mean dic yield of the 60 major global river basins 2 6 g m 2 yr 1 gaillardet et al 1999 huang et al 2012 lithology is one of the strongest factors that can influence riverine dic and possibly also dic yield of a basin for example a large annual dic yield of 38 3 g m 2 yr 1 was observed in a carbonate dominant catchment of the south hr shin et al 2011a one of the two major tributaries of the hr which suggests that carbonate bedrocks can raise the dic yield of the hr basin downstream however the dominant bedrock composition across these river basins includes granites and granitic gneiss chough et al 2000 suggesting that factors other than lithology can raise the dic yield of the basins the dic yield of a watershed can be boosted by increased ppt and subsequently q because weathering products stored in a watershed can be released by increased water flow despite a decrease in dic due to dilution li and bush 2015 since the weathering flux is calculated by multiplying the concentration and q a sudden increase in q can raise the weathering flux during the summer overcoming the dilution effect about 38 of annual dic was released from the five river basins during summer while only 16 in winter fig 2a although riverine discharge is the largest during the summer the contribution from baseflow estimated using the what web based hydrograph analysis tool program was reported to be the smallest 50 while that can increase to 80 during the winter in the five river systems choi et al 2014 major parts of dic could be supplied by groundwater baseflow with a time lag after precipitations jung et al 2019 and thus the riverine dic loads from baseflow could be delayed to the next seasons thus the precipitation during summer increase not only the riverine dic loads during summer but also the riverine dic loads in the other seasons annual water yields i e annual q basin area of the five river basins ranged 0 5 1 0 m yr 1 two to four times larger than the global mean water yield of 0 25 m yr 1 global runoff data center http www bafg de grdc although the five largest rivers of south korea have lower water discharge than major rivers in the world water yields of the rivers are as high as other major rivers of the world text s2 and fig s1 the ratio of dic yield of each river basin to the global mean dic yield ranged from 2 1 to 4 0 which was close to that of water yield ranging from 2 3 to 4 3 suggesting that the difference of dic yields among the five river basins can be mainly explained by the hydrological difference since the annual ppt of 2012 and 2013 were 1479 and 1163 mm which was 13 larger and 11 lower than the 30 year 1981 2010 mean annual ppt of 1307 mm respectively the estimated dic yields may be close to the dic yield over a long term not overestimating or underestimating it the doc of the five rivers was relatively low 1 1 5 5 mg l 1 compared to that of the 48 global major rivers which ranged from 0 3 to 70 8 mg l 1 marwick et al 2015 the mean doc f of the five rivers was 2 0 mg l 1 which was also lower than that of the global mean of 118 rivers 5 3 mg l 1 dai et al 2012 however the doc yield 1 0 3 5 g m 2 yr 1 was similar to the global average doc yield of 1 4 g m 2 yr 1 0 1 5 7 g m 2 yr 1 due to high water yields of the five river basins ludwig et al 1996 huang et al 2012 considering that riverine doc can increase as organic carbon oc content or c n ratio of a watershed increases and that doc can be positively correlated with the proportion of wetlands in a watershed aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 alvarez cobelas et al 2012 it is not surprising to find low doc in the five rivers in south korea because the area covered by wetland is 1 and because 80 of the land area is mapped as entisols or inceptisols with low om content jeong et al 2003 furthermore areas with a slope of 30 cover 30 60 of the five river basins ji et al 2012 which can reduce the contact time between water and som and thus possibly reducing riverine doc riverine doc load was also mainly controlled by riverine discharge such that 43 of annual doc load was released during summer while only 13 in winter fig 2b other river systems in asia demonstrated that 40 90 of annual doc load was transported during the summer monsoon period indicating the strong role of hydrology on riverine doc loads under monsoon climates bird et al 2008 wang et al 2012 the poc was relatively low 0 5 2 4 mg l 1 in the five rivers compared to that of the 36 major global rivers which ranged from 0 1 to 242 mg l 1 marwick et al 2015 the mean poc f of the five rivers was 1 5 mg l 1 which was lower than that of the 35 major rivers 4 5 mg l 1 huang et al 2012 in addition the poc yields during summer in the five river basins were about 2 10 times lower than the mean poc yield 1 3 g m 2 yr 1 of 32 major rivers despite the high water yield of the five rivers ludwig et al 1996 huang et al 2012 fig 2 dams and reservoirs can increase mean hrt allowing particles to be settled down and trapped within the reservoir thus poc and subsequently poc yields can decrease the number of dams and reservoirs in south korea is estimated at approximately 18 000 including small agricultural reservoirs park et al 2005 http www kwater or kr many dams and reservoirs have been used to manage water resources especially since the 1960s kim et al 2001 http www kwater or kr which could decrease poc of the dam effluent for example the poc of the paldang reservoir which is the major reservoir for water supply for seoul was less than a quarter of poc of the inlet water kim et al 2014 the reduction of poc in the outlet was also observed in other dams e g soyang dam and chunju dam shin et al 2013 suggesting that the poc yield at the lower reach of the river can decrease as the river passes through many dams and reservoirs 4 2 δ 13c and δ 14c of riverine carbon 4 2 1 dic the mean of δ13cdic of the five rivers was 9 6 which was higher than the global mean δ13cdic of 12 5 p 0 05 and the mean of δ14cdic of the five rivers was 33 4 88 7 to 26 9 which was similar to the global mean δ14cdic of 32 749 to 179 fig 4 a marwick et al 2015 while δ13cdic ranged from 14 4 to 11 4 during summer across the five rivers that of the other seasons ranged from 10 1 to 4 3 fig 3a this suggests that the relative contribution of respiration to riverine dic increases in summer while that of carbonate weathering increases in the other seasons considering that carbonate weathering can raise the δ13c of river water fig 3a the proportion of carbonated area within a basin was the largest 8 2 in the hr basin among the five basins whereas those of the other basins were 1 2 table s2 indicating the strong role of the lithology of the basin other factors can also shift the riverine δ13cdic isotopic fractionation between gaseous co2 and dic species can increase riverine δ13cdic myrttinen et al 2012 if silicates are weathered by soil co2 assuming δ13cco2 is 23 and isotopic fractionation of dic species occurs the δ13cdic can range from 16 to 12 text s3 and fig s2 seasonal mean δ13cdic in the five rivers in summer was 12 6 which was within the range while those of the other seasons increased up to 7 8 suggesting that the contribution of silicate weathering by soil co2 to riverine dic can be higher in summer than the other seasons mineral weathering by atmospheric co2 or soil co2 derived from c4 plants can increase riverine δ13cdic but they are unlikely to be a dominant process considering that the area covered by c3 plants are dominant in south korea carbonate weathering by n s acids acid containing nitrogen or sulfur can also increase riverine δ13cdic the other sources include co2 exchange between the atmosphere and river water shin et al 2011a song et al 2020 and anthropogenic contributions such as detergent carbonates included in ingredients and agricultural liming e g application of crushed carbonates oh and raymond 2006 lee et al 2007 hossler and bauer 2013 shin et al 2015 each of these sources can increase δ13cdic and decrease δ14cdic even in basins with low coverage of carbonate substrate even though limestones cover only 1 of a basin area in the mun river in thailand the influence of carbonate on riverine dic was reported to be predominant li et al 2019 suggesting that the other anthropogenic source such as urban wastewater can be also important up to 4 9 of riverine δ13cdic has been reported in the hr and the gr lee et al 2007 shin et al 2015 up to 3 6 of riverine δ13cdic was also observed in silicate dominant catchment of the gr shin et al 2011a the shift of major sources of riverine dic in summer is also reflected by the highest δ14cdic fig 3a because the respiration of biota can produce relatively modern δ14cdic in contrast weathering of sedimentary rocks including carbonates can lower the δ14cdic because there is no detectable 14c in old 60 000 years rocks although pedogenic carbonates can contain modern 14c they tend to be formed in dry environments where annual ppt is lower than 500 mm yr 1 zamanian et al 2016 the annual ppt of south korea is 1300 mm yr 1 and thus the contribution of pedogenic carbonates to riverine dic is unlikely the δ14cdic was the lowest in the hr which could be due to the weathering of sedimentary carbonates within the hr basin 4 2 2 doc the mean δ13cdoc of the five rivers was 25 8 which was close to the mean of 55 world rivers 26 9 whereas the mean δ14cdoc of the five rivers was 60 3 which was significantly depleted than the mean of 65 world rivers 22 5 p 0 05 fig 4b the δ14cdoc was highest during summer in most rivers fig 3b suggesting that inputs of relatively young organic carbon from litter or surface soils to the rivers can increase due to high ppt and q in summer in contrast depleted δ14cdoc was observed in other seasons which could be due to the release of aged soil doc in deep soil horizons or groundwater doc during base flow barnes et al 2018 however the soils are mapped as entisols or inceptisols with relatively shallow depth suggesting that there could be other sources of old doc in the rivers the low δ14cdoc can be due to petrochemical products processed in wastewater treatment plant wwtp or applied in agricultural fields griffith et al 2009 sickman et al 2010 butman et al 2012 for example the average 14c ages of wwtp effluent doc can be as low as 2 650 ybp in the hudson river and the connecticut river griffith et al 2009 which corresponds to δ14cdoc of 187 the δ14cdoc ranged from 114 to 97 9 in wwtp effluent at lower reaches of the hr in south korea jin et al 2018 the δ14cdoc of 254 was reported from the drainage of agricultural fields sickman et al 2010 suggesting that urban and agricultural land use can lower the riverine δ14cdoc this may explain the depleted δ14cdoc in the gr and the yr fig 3 where the proportion of agricultural and urban areas are the largest among the five river basins table 1 the wwtp effluent accounted for 4 49 of river discharge in the four rivers the hr the gr the yr and the nr during the low flow period jan may oct dec in 2004 2008 moon et al 2010 the proportion increased up to 83 100 in the hr gr and yr when the discharge was the lowest moon et al 2010 the mean doc of effluents from 110 wwtps located over south korea was 5 3 mg l 1 in 2014 2015 jeong et al 2016 which was larger than the mean doc f of the five rivers 2 0 mg l 1 thus wwtp effluent could be a main source of old doc in the five rivers of south korea when the river flow is relatively low the results of isosource modeling indicated that the contribution of fossil oc to doc ranged from 11 to 22 in the rivers of south korea which was similar to the proportion of fossil oc to doc in wwtp effluent 11 25 in australia and usa griffith et al 2009 law et al 2013 however aged som is also an important source of doc which can lower δ14cdoc blair and aller 2012 thus the actual proportion of fossil oc to riverine doc could become lower than the above proportions 4 2 3 poc since the number of measurements on δ14cpoc is only about half of δ14cdoc the isotope results should be interpreted with caution nonetheless the δ14cpoc ranged from 125 5 to 35 1 in the five rivers with the mean of 46 4 which was significantly higher than that of 59 major world rivers of 204 p 0 05 suggesting that relatively young poc is released from the five rivers fig 4c marwick et al 2015 the riverine δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc of summer were higher than winter in most rivers and δ14cpoc increased significantly with poc across the five rivers r2 0 60 p 0 02 except the sr in winter possibly due to increased allochthonous oc inputs by high ppt during summer kwon et al 2002 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2013 autochthonous om inputs such as plankton or algae derived om could also be a major source of young poc in the rivers which could be increased by inputs of tn total n and tp total p released from wwtps high tn and tp 2 6 34 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 0 7 mg l 1 respectively were observed in the effluents of the four different types of wwtps cho et al 2014 which suggests that plankton or algal growth could be facilitated by nutrient supply from wwtp effluents as well as by long hrt due to many dams and reservoirs in the rivers except summer high rainfall period in general riverine δ14cdoc tends to be higher than δ14cpoc in world rivers because solubilized doc in soils tends to be younger than the poc from which it is derived o brien 1986 trumbore et al 1992 raymond and bauer 2001 marwick et al 2015 furthermore higher δ14cdoc than δ14cpoc can be observed if poc undergoes deposition resuspension in river systems whereas doc quickly exits through the rivers raymond and bauer 2001 marwick et al 2015 however δ14cdoc was lower than δ14cpoc in the five rivers during winter fig 5 possibly due to the increased contribution of doc from wwtp or agricultural petrochemicals to the rivers whereas poc inputs from wwtp is minor kwon et al 2002 lee et al 2013 kim et al 2014 5 conclusions a total of 581 gg yr 1 of riverine carbon dic doc and poc combined was released by the five largest rivers in south korea during 2012 2013 with 80 of it in the form of dic about 34 46 of total carbon was discharged throughout the rivers during summer demonstrating the role of monsoons on riverine carbon loads seasonal changes were also observed in carbon isotope ratios the 14c ages of the riverine carbon varied from modern to 1020 ybp with higher δ14cdic δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc in summer than the other seasons across the five rivers indicating the shift of the carbon sources depending on seasons modern carbon was dominantly released from the five river basins during summer monsoon regardless of carbon forms demonstrating that biological respiration and fresh inputs of organic matter increased by high temperature and precipitation in summer the riverine δ14cdic was mainly controlled by natural factors such as weathering of soils and rocks within a basin while δ14cdoc and δ14cpoc could have been influenced by anthropogenic factors such as dams and wwtps in south korea in particular during low flow season if the frequency and or intensity of precipitation increases the seasonal changes of riverine carbon sources could be amplified the impact that the changes may bring in the context of the global carbon cycle is not yet known warranting future studies credit authorship contribution statement eun ju lee conceptualization formal analysis investigation writing

4447,fog deposition depends strongly on location and orographic setting even if the absolute amount can be small at some locations it could play a decisive role this is also true for germany in the lowlands the annual amount of fog precipitation is in the range of a few mm per year in the higher altitudes of the low mountain ranges a few hundred mm per year in this article we estimated the fog deposition based on the real fog model for germany at daily time steps and one kilometre spatial resolution for a 70 year period for the years 1949 to 2018 these results were compared with another fog deposition modelling approach station measurements and water balance modelling for different catchments in our study region comparing the results gives quite an interesting insight and outlook to the challenges to face in the future the gridded data of the daily sum of the fog deposition we made available via hydroshare repository keywords fog deposition liquid water content spatial interpolation fog modelling 1 introduction fog deposition is a part of the total precipitation that occurs in many parts of the world gultepe et al 2007 klemm et al 2012 tiedemann 2001 while it is a rare phenomenon in large parts of the world with a few millimetres per year it is commonplace in other parts the higher amounts occur mainly in mountains regions below the tree line and near the coast of the oceans it can reach values around several hundred or even thousands of mm per year and exceed the measured rain and snowfall precipitation for instance in the table mountain in south africa fog deposition exceeded 3 000 mm per year and the annual precipitation was less than 2 000 mm nagel 1956 unlike falling precipitation fog deposition is not recorded in the standard measurements of the meteorological services thus its spatial occurrence is limited to indirectly quantification as consequences the input and output of water in sites with a considerable amount of fog deposition is imbalanced so that runoff and evaporation can be higher than the falling precipitation hutley et al 1997 cameron et al 1997 zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 non rainfall water sources studied in drylands and wetlands had an important contribution to the decay of plant litter by enabling microbial activity gliksman et al 2017 jacobson et al 2015 evans et al 2020 newell et al 1985 kuehn et al 2004 and for the activity of biological crusts hill et al 2015 maestre et al 2010 non rainfall water sources can reduce drought stress and can be harvested in areas where it is economically feasible and provide additional water source in drylands wang et al 2017 in addition in areas with poor water supplies and high occurrence of fog it can be collected with fog nets to use the water as a source of drinking water schemenauer and cereceda 1994 in this article we want to focus on the fog deposition at the vegetation in germany to determine the additional water input into the water balance however the methods presented here are not specifically adapted to the study area and can be transferred to other areas investigations of fog deposition in germany began at the beginning of the 20th century when linke 1916 carried out precipitation measurements in and outside a spruce stand in the taunus and found that 66 additional precipitation was recorded in the stand due to dripping fog than outside the stand dieckmann 1931 used a fine cylindrical wire mesh which he fixed over a hellmann rain gauge to determine the fog precipitation on the mt brocken rubner 1932 carried out similar measurements in the ore mountains but used glass rods instead of wire mesh the idea of a standard measuring instrument for fog precipitation was taken up by grunow 1952 he further developed the wired mesh cylinder attachment and carried out comparative measurements throughout germany grunow 1953 1955 1958 1963 grunow and tollner 1969 it turned out that good comparative measurements of different locations were possible however the actually collected quantity of precipitation at the vegetation could not be determined satisfactorily thus the fog catcher hohenpeißenberger nebelfänger german for fog catcher that was invented at mt hohenpeißenberg described in grunow 1953 and developed for the previous mentioned studies was contrary to the previous plans not introduced across the country modern fog catchers have to deal with the same issue schemenauer and cereceda 1994 fuzzi et al 1997 wrzesinsky 2004 klemm et al 2005 and klemm and wrzesinsky 2007 determined fog precipitation using the direct eddy covariance method and while it is possible to measure the fog precipitation in a stand it is not suitable for spatial investigation as an alternative and supplement to the direct measurement of fog deposition models have been developed to determine the same katata 2014 provides a comprehensive overview of the development of fog modelling the deposition models which work with resistance analogy should be mentioned here lovett 1984 developed a model that could determine the fog deposition on numerous vegetation layers and the associated resistances as a function of wind speed droplet size distribution and liquid water content the model is a one dimensional over a homogeneous canopy which does not include the edge effect due to heterogenous environment this model was used and further developed by numerous authors such as miller et al 1993 pahl 1996 and burkard et al 2003 one variant was parameterized by katata et al 2008 with high agreement to the lovett model r2 0 928 so that the fog deposition calculated by his model only depends on the wind speed the stand height and the leaf area index lai as well as the liquid water content lwc which makes it easier to use due to the reduced amount of parameters in this article we combine the real fog method from körner et al 2020 which is refered here to as real fog part 1 for the determination of the lwc of the atmosphere at ground level with the determination of the deposition velocity from katata et al 2008 to determine the fog deposition for germany with a temporal resolution of one day as a consequence we use only station data for the meteorological input variables in our modelling and are completely independent of the extremely time consuming calculations of on the one hand numerical weather models and the resistance analogy model according to lovett 1984 on the other hand the calculations are made for the years 1949 to 2018 on hourly basis and were aggregated to daily resolution validation data are rare and unfortunately most of the records of the time series of grunow are lost plaß dülmer dwd personal communication however we use the few remaining data and additionally calculations for several mountains done by pahl 1996 and direct measured fog deposition by wrzesinsky 2004 furthermore we run the water balance model brook90 federer et al 2003 with and without the fog deposition calculated by the real fog model for several low mountain range catchments some of which had major problems in closing the water balance due to fog deposition in the past our hypothesis is therefore the following from the hourly station data of wind speed temperature and humidity as well as the lai and the vegetation height and a digital elevation model the spatial fog deposition can be derived by means of the proposed model from this a data set for fog deposition in germany for the years 1949 2018 can be created such a data set is novel in terms of spatial and temporal resolution and coverage as well as for the small amount of variables required 2 site description we conducted our study for the entire area of current germany which includes the former german democratic republic 1949 1990 before the german reunification germany lies in the cool temperate climate zone extending from the baltic and north sea coasts over the north german lowlands the low mountain range threshold to the upper rhine rift valley the alpine foothills and finally to the alps previous studies of fog deposition in germany were conducted for the erzgebirge zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 lange et al 2003 rubner 1932 the taunus linke 1916 the fichtelgebirge klemm and wrzesinsky 2007 the harz köhler et al 2015 and the black forest winkler and pahl 1993 3 material and methods 3 1 data we use meteorological station data of the german meteorological service dwd which are freely available via ftp dwd 2020 temperature and humidity data are processed as described in körner et al 2020 and interpolated with thin plate splines nychka et al 2017 wind speed data are calculated according to the logarithmic wind profile eq 2 from the measuring height which differes from station to station to 10 m uniform height table 1 gaps in meteorological data were filled according to körner et al 2018 so that they are available for the entire period considered data for the vegetation height are used from the global forest canopy height grid simard et al 2011 this is a global vegetation height model with a resolution of about 1 000 m as of 2005 a dynamic vegetation height model would be desirable for further analysis especially to take into account the forest dieback in the 1980 s the constant vegetation also gives us the possibility to consider changes or trends in the temporal course of the fog deposition independent of the vegetation and thus exclusively dependent on the meteorological conditions finally we need the lai values as model input since we set the vegetation height as constant we keep the lai constant as well for deciduous forests this assumption would be inaccurate during the winter season in contrast in coniferous forests it can be a good approximation since conifers are predominant in areas with relevant fog deposition we decided to use a constant lai of three m2 m2 obviously this is a compromise young or sparse forests may have a lower lai and for instance a dense pine forest of maybe 80 years may reach a lai of seven or even higher however the main objective of this article is to introduce the method and give an early data insight 3 2 the real fog model we carried out our grid based calculations for the study area using the model described in körner et al 2020 here we use a spatial resolution of 1x1 km2 and a temporal resolution for calculation of one hour besides the gridded vegetation height data we use hourly data of temperature und relative humidity interpolated with thin plate splines to calculate liquid water content using latitude longitude and elevation as predictors we calculated fog deposition following katata et al 2008 for a mesoscale resolution 1 p fog 0 0164 lwc c u c lai m h c with lwc c as the liquid water content of the air at canopy height kg m3 u c as wind speed at canopy height m s lai as leaf area index m2 m2 h c as canopy height m p fog as fog deposition mm s and m as unit meter for unit consistency vegetation parameters are kept constant over time as mentioned in the previous section 3 1 data the liquid water content and the wind speed both show an approximate logarithmic profile in the atmosphere near the ground which is influenced by vegetation kuroiwa 1953 kuroiwa and kinosita 1953 katata et al 2010 zhou 2006 consequently both parameters are reduced to values at canopy height depending on the actual canopy height reduced wind speed and lwc values are about half to one fourth of the interpolated values the wind speed at canopy height is calculated with the following equation 2 2 u c u 1 ln h c d c z 0 c ln h 1

of grass m and z 0 c as roughness length of the according canopy m the liquid water content at canopy height is calculated equivalent to the wind speed u is replaced by lwc accordingly since we use meteorological values of standard weather stations we use a parametrisation over grass h1 d1 and z01 and forest hc dc and z0c using the global forest height product simard et al 2011 since there is no measurement height for the lwc values we have to assume a value and we decided to use 30 m this assumption is based on measurements kuroiwa 1953 kuroiwa and kinosita 1953 and numerical calculations

natural system where fog deposition might have an impact to close the water budget the hydrologic model brook90 b90 federer et al 2003 was applied to validate the water balance this model is a lumped physically based model with a strong emphasis of the evapotranspiration processes b90 was chosen as a representative of hydrological models with an implementation of a shuttleworth wallace approach shuttleworth and wallace 1985 for net evapotranspiration it is considered to have a crucial influence on the mass fluxes of water from fog deposition net evapotranspiration estimated by the shuttleworth wallace approach is considered to be better than by the penman monteith model stannard 1993 b90 is available as an r package and was applied to 74 catchment areas in saxony germany vorobevskii et al 2020 we focus on this area because of the high fog deposition occurrence due to the low mountain ranges on the one hand and the high data availability of the validation variable the runoff on the other hand the catchment characteristics required as input are derived from a digitalized soil map at a scale 1 50 000 and a 10 m digital elevation model the land cover types were classified by a land use map at a scale 1 100 000 i e corine land cover büttner 2014 based on the identified land cover b90 standard parameters were used for vegetation parametrisation in the model the model was not calibrated because a model calibration would favour a certain data input to which it was calibrated therefor standard parameters were set independently of a calibration the daily meteorological forcing was generated on the basis of a reference dataset bernhofer et al 2019 for a period ranging from 01 01 1961 until 31 12 2015 the meteorological variables were interpolated on a 1 km grid for saxony on a daily scale pluntke et al 2019 the interpolation of average wind speed global radiation and average vapour pressure minimum and maximum temperature was based on a combination of a univariate regression interpolation plus residual interpolation by inverse distance weighting daily wind induced error corrected precipitation was interpolated by means of indicator kriging kronenberg and bernhofer 2015 the water balance validation was based on the comparison of observed with simulated runoff on a monthly scale therefore the nash sutcliff efficiency nse as well as the kling gupta efficiency kge were calculated for the model run period from 01 03 1961 until 31 12 2015 i e two month model warm up and for each respective catchment gupta et al 2009 additionally two different input datasets were considered in the simulation and analysis the first dataset are all gridded meteorological variables without fog deposition nofog and the second dataset are the same meteorological forcing except precipitation data were increased by the estimated fog deposition fog therefore the difference between the skill scores of a fog model run and a nofog run will indicate if a simulation improves by the additional precipitation input the assumption for the water balance validation would be that precipitation together with fog deposition leads to a better estimate of runoff in a catchment therefore fog deposition is treated as additional precipitation input in a hydrological system and is therefore summed up with conventional precipitation we created a data set for modelled fog deposition in daily resolution over 70 years for over 200 000 grid cells where hc is higher than 0m in germany the question arises how can these data be validated or at least their plausibility be checked typically model results are compared with measurements it is also possible to compare our model results with the model results of other authors additionally there is the idea of validating the results by means of water balance modelling we will discuss this idea in more detail in the part 4 3 water balance estimation based on brook90 at first we will discuss the possibility to compare the model results with measured data although our fog data covers germany for the last 70 years there are very few measurements in the area under investigation during the period in question that we can use as a basis for comparison grunow 1963 used the hohenpeißenberg nebefänger fog catcher on the one hand this has the disadvantage that the measured values are difficult to transfer to the vegetation and on the other hand it has high inaccuracies for example due to horizontally drifted and intercepted precipitation direct measurements of fog precipitation by the eddy covariance method only one in germany is known to the authors wrzesinsky 2004 used this method to investigate a stand at mt waldstein in the fichtelgebirge mountains in bavaria over a period of one year in order not to limit the comparison to a single measurement we have decided to use all measurements and additionally data from modelling fog deposition of sites that meet the following requirements having at least one year measurement or modelling period a site located in germany within the period of 1949 2018 and having a defined localisation a total of 16 reference values were used which originated from three different methods in addition to the above mentioned direct measurement on the waldstein from wrzesinsky 2004 five measurements from grunow 1963 and one measurement from baumgartner 1958 present the results of the hohenpeißenberger fog catcher some stations from grunow 1963 could not be used because the location was not specified exactly or the station was not in the study area or the station had no vegetation in addition to these measurements models based on lovett 1984 were used these are seven model results from pahl 1996 and two from zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 4 results and discussion in this section we summarize and discuss the results of our modelling the evaluation is initially carried out in a spatially or temporally aggregated manner throughout germany in the second part we focus on the quality and compare our results with site measurements and site modelling as well as water balance modelling on a catchment area basis 4 1 real fog results fig 1 shows that the mean annual sum of fog deposition in germany ranges between 1 5 and 2 mm for areas up to 600 m a s l there is a general trend of increase in fog deposition over time red line but this trend is not substantial the sum of the fog deposition is in the range of less than 1 of the annual measured precipitation sum mean precipitation sum in germany 750 mm year for the majority of these areas fog deposition is therefore not relevant to the water balance the values are different for areas above 600 m a s l fig 2 here it can be seen that the calculated fog deposition ranged between 60 and 120 mm year with an average of 85 mm year there is a general trend of decrease in fog deposition over time red line but this trend is not substantial as well the share of fog deposition in the measured precipitation for areas above 600 m a s l ranges from 0 no vegetation to 100 exposed forest at higher altitude percent about 13 percent of the area of germany have an altitude of above 600 m a s l these figures show that fog deposition should definitely be taken into account when determining the water balance and in other considerations like ecological impact holwerda et al 2006 ice breakage döbele 1935 or as fresh water resources klemm et al 2012 the seasonal cycle of fog deposition shows different pictures in terms of the magnitude and timing when comparing the two altitude levels fig 3 shows the seasonal cycle for areas up to 600 m a s l it can be clearly seen that the months october november december and january lead to higher fog deposition sums than the other months the reason for this is water vapour often does not reach saturation in the air during summer months and therefore hardly any fog is formed in the lower altitudes the exception here is radiation fog which can form on cloudless nights under these conditions however the wind speed is close to 0 m s which means that fog deposition rarely occurs in contrast advection fog occurs more frequently in the months of october november december and january and with a higher deposition rate because it is denser than radiation fog and it occurs with wind speeds above 0 m s thus the conditions for fog deposition are created here compared to higher altitudes these fog sums are very low fig 4 for altitudes above 600 m the annual cycle is completely different because at higher altitudes in addition to advection fog with a minor role there is also orographic fog a forced uplift on mountains that cools the air masses when the dew point is reached orographic fog forms from the condensation level onwards the liquid water content is therefore greater than 0 kg m3 unlike advection and radiative fog orographic fog does not have such a distinct annual cycle since it is superimposed by another effect the warmer the air mass the more water vapour it can absorb clausius clapeyron equation in addition the more water vapour an air mass contains the more water condenses during orographic ascent and subsequently settles on the vegetation as fog deposition thus a distinct annual fog deposition pattern develops the most yielding month is therefore also the warmest month and the month with the lowest fog deposition rates in the cold month typically july and february respectively the spatial distribution of the fog deposition rate followed a clear pattern of the altitude fig 5 it can be clearly seen that the values in the low mountain ranges increase considerably compared to the north german lowlands the maximum values of more than 3 000 mm a in the alpine region seem to be too high at first sight in the literature no comprehensive values could be found for this area it is possible that our modelling overestimates fog deposition in these areas it is also possible that the vegetation height is incorrectly parameterised however until further measurements we should not ignore the possibility that the values are realistic potentially reshaping our understanding of water budget in these catchments areas the dependence of the fog deposition on the altitude is shown in fig 6 the black dots are the values of the single 1x1 km grid cells the optical impression suggests an exponential increase of the fog deposition with the height of the terrain however fog depositions of 0 mm year are calculated for grid points where the vegetation height is 0 m according to the corresponding vegetation height model these values are therefore always on the x axis but are difficult to evaluate visually therefore the mean fog deposition by altitude level in 100 m classes was added to the figure red dots the mean increase of fog deposition with altitude is thus less steep due to the beginning timberline the mean fog deposition decreases by 2 000 m after a maximum however it should be noted that due to the small number of grid cells in the higher altitude classes as well as the low density of meteorological stations from about 1 000 m height the statements for fog deposition in these areas should be treated with caution 4 2 validation the results of the measurements and modelling are given with their characteristic values in table 2 it should be noted that only mountain stations were available for the comparison this is not an additional selection criterion rather most of the measurements and modelling took place and still take place at mountain stations due to the high occurrence of fog compared to the lowlands for some stations several references from different authors are available and in some case the measurement heights on the same mountain differed slightly the various measuring and modelling periods of the individual references were matched with respective period from our model the annual values for fog deposition given in table 2 are shown again in fig 7 for visual clarity a comparison of our real fog model with the single and thus no regression was performed measurement at mt waldstein with eddy covariance black point shows a good agreement since this measurement was used to derive the equation 1 we use it as a control against calculation mistakes nevertheless the good agreement is an indication that the values determined with real fog for wind speed and in particular liquid water content correspond well with the actual conditions on site the comparison of our modelling with the results from the lovett model pahl 1996 and zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 shows quite good agreement slope 1 04 offset 16 mm year r2 0 74 for the mean annual values the order of magnitude of the values corresponds to the station with the highest annual total brocken and the station with the lowest annual total corresponds quite well again it should be noted that the model we used katata 2008 is based on the similar deposition processes taken into account in the lovett model and comparability is therefore limited nevertheless we use these studies for comparison for the following reasons the determination of the lwc is completely different in our study compared to the previous studies if there were any systematic deviations due to these different methods they would be noticeable here the same is true albeit to a lesser extent for wind speed measured vs interpolated and for vegetation parameters extensive parameterization with resistivity analogy vs simple parameterization with lai and vegetation height as the only vegetation parameters it should also be taken into account that the reference values are valid for specific pinpoint locations while our modelling results are for a 1 1 km cells overall it is of course positive that no systematic over or underestimation can be identified and that both models are within a plausible range here the comparison of our model with the measured values from the hohenpeißenberger nebelfänger shows little agreement slope 1 12 offset 679 mm year r2 0 35 the hohenpeißenberg station should be emphasized here in the comparison period 11 mm year fog precipitation was modelled with real fog grunow 1963 measured an annual sum of 501 mm the causes for the discrepancy are likely to originate from the location of the measurements and the stand locations differed while we are modelling fog deposition at forests the fog catchers stood exposed on grassland thus the lwc and the wind speed where much higher in this measurement than in the stand and therefore more fog deposition is gained by the fogcatcher in addition the cross section of the fog catcher is significantly larger than the one of the rain gauge due to the structure of the measurement which means that considerably more precipitation is collected finally the assumption that the two methods do not measure the same meteorological value is strengthened by the comparison however the assumption cannot be confirmed with certainty as the comparison of the sample is too small overall the performance of the model is affected by different inaccuracies in the data and methods some of these uncertainties can be reduced by an extended database others relate to methodology thus the model is limited by the vegetation height model which is static and cannot represent temporal changes data on the temporal and spatial variability of the lai were also missing measurements or modelling of dynamic lai values would improve the quality of fog precipitation data the meteorologically measured values themselves are faulty for example due to device errors there are method related uncertainties in spatial interpolation which can be reduced but not avoided by an increased database when filling gaps an attempt is made to minimise the uncertainties however they cannot be avoided used empirical formulas like the one according to katata et al 2008 always have only a certain accuracy random errors balance each other out for longer periods of time meteorological data daily or monthly sums of fog deposition have a smaller relative error than the calculated hourly values systematic errors in the input data such as a specified vegetation height of 20 metres where no vegetation is present at all or vice versa respectively at the time in question accordingly lead to systematic deviations in the results nevertheless we would like to emphasise the high agreement in slope of the regression line between the measurements and calculations this leads to the assumption that the model results can be used to at least a qualitative interpretation such as spatial map of fog deposition in country scale 4 3 water balance estimation based on brook90 the water balance validation was carried out for 74 catchments which possess 2 344 subcatchments these subcatchments were divided into 42 630 unique hydrologically response unit hru b90 was applied for these hru with two different meteorological forcings fog and nofog the validation results based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge for all subcatchments are depicted in fig 8 hru results were area weighted averaged for each subcatchment the water balance validation reveals for the nofog runs satisfactory simulations for most of the catchments on a monthly scale within a period from 01 03 1961 until 31 12 2015 in the area of saxony germany this is confirmed by the kge values fig 8c which show for most catchments values higher than 0 41 this value indicates that our simulations are better than the mean observed flow knoben et al 2019 the validation based on the nse scores fig 8a is less conforming but generally also in favour of the b90 model the validation of the two model runs i e nofog fog reveals surprising results fig 8b and 8d most regions do not change green areas because no fog deposition is occurring in these subcatchments however the model performance for a large amount of subcatchments decreases unexpectedly with incorporation of fog deposition data slight yellow areas while only very few subcatchment simulations improve dark blue by the additional precipitation input these findings are more obvious considering the nse but are also dominant for the kge skill scores hence the water balance validation could not show a significant improvement of discharge simulations even the opposite was achieved the skill scores decreased with additional precipitation the main explanation for these results is seen in an incomplete evapotranspiration model normally we assume an upper limit of potential evaporation which of course can be exceeded oke 2009 but mostly is in its limits conserved averaged annual potential evaporation et0 from 1961 until 2015 is shown in fig 9 c the comparison between et0 and the b90 evapotranspiration for the fog model runs fig 9a and 9c shows in the southern mountainous regions of saxony that the upper et0 limit is already reached by the b90 simulations i e about 600 mm per year hence no further energy for the evapotranspiration process is available in these mountainous regions where we find fog deposition the evaporation process in b90 is based on the well known model by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 where evapotranspiration is described in a column additional advective energy which is transported by a horizontal or downward vertical sensible heat flux i e due to an oasis effect is not considered in b90 however negative sensible heat fluxes are not only observed in dry arid regions with oasis they are observed even in temperate and mountainous regions bernhofer et al 2013 especially in the autumn and winter months when fog occurrence is highest in germany for this reason one should expect an evaporation of 70 to 80 of fog deposition as intercepted precipitation in our case mostly no energy input neither an additional sensible heat flux nor additional wind speed are provided by the meteorological input for this process therefore only up to 10 of the additional fog deposition evaporates this can be seen in fig 9b where the maximum averaged evapotranspiration increases up to 53 mm per year consequently more than 80 of the fog deposition forms additional runoff supporting this notion the distribution of average annual water amounts of the major water components fig 10 i e precipitation prec evapotranspiration evap discharge flow over the respective subcatchments the figure reveals that most subcatchments are almost not influenced by fog deposition due to its altitude and land cover dependency the medians are not changing only a few subcatchments really face significant additional amount of precipitation by fog but in these subcatchments the b90 model mostly distributes the water into direct flow instead of evapotranspiration our results show that fog deposition needs a careful treatment in hydrological simulations furthermore our results indicate that a better evapotranspiration model is necessary and more research is required in the description of the evapotranspiration process in hydrological models to better link hydrological and atmospheric interactions finally the application of fog deposition in hydrological modelling needs to be carefully checked for the respective catchment individually 5 summary and conclusions we determined fog deposition on vegetation using the method of katata et al 2008 combined with the method of körner et al 2020 for determining liquid water content the uniqueness of the method and the dataset generated in a fine temporal resolution hourly and daily for calculation steps and aggregation respectivly and a decent spatial resolution 1 km2 for 70 years between 1949 and 2018 data which we make freely available the comparison with the unfortunately very few available measurements and models has shown that they match relatively well in the annual sum an exception is the comparison with the hohenpeißenberger nebelfänger which shows strong differences overall the comparison provides only indications as there are simply too few comparative measurements to be reliable the water balance validation by brook90 reveals that a simple addition of fog deposition to conventional precipitation is not recommended since it would most likely lead to a significant increase in discharge instead of evapotranspiration our findings suggest that negative sensible heat fluxes as additional energy input need to be considered in the evapotranspiration description altogether the presented method offers the possibility to calculate fog deposition in high spatial resolution for longer periods even in the past by using geo statistical methods and by abandoning numerical weather modelling nevertheless there is a great potential for improvement of the model results the quality of the spatial interpolation of the meteorological values can be improved by including additional measurement networks by means of a temporally dynamic land use clearings storm damage the growth of a young forest and the seasonal change of the lai can also be taken into account for the sake of simplicity and to keep the model reproducible only freely accessible data was used for this invoice for the calculation of fog deposition for a defined smaller catchment area one will certainly use local information with higher accuracy for the concerning area measurements of the lwc in the study area or modelling at sites with liquid water content measurements can help to improve the quality of the lwc in the model significantly additional local knowledge of meteorological and plant properties can improve the model results modelled daily fog deposition sums in one km² resolution are accessible via

4447,fog deposition depends strongly on location and orographic setting even if the absolute amount can be small at some locations it could play a decisive role this is also true for germany in the lowlands the annual amount of fog precipitation is in the range of a few mm per year in the higher altitudes of the low mountain ranges a few hundred mm per year in this article we estimated the fog deposition based on the real fog model for germany at daily time steps and one kilometre spatial resolution for a 70 year period for the years 1949 to 2018 these results were compared with another fog deposition modelling approach station measurements and water balance modelling for different catchments in our study region comparing the results gives quite an interesting insight and outlook to the challenges to face in the future the gridded data of the daily sum of the fog deposition we made available via hydroshare repository keywords fog deposition liquid water content spatial interpolation fog modelling 1 introduction fog deposition is a part of the total precipitation that occurs in many parts of the world gultepe et al 2007 klemm et al 2012 tiedemann 2001 while it is a rare phenomenon in large parts of the world with a few millimetres per year it is commonplace in other parts the higher amounts occur mainly in mountains regions below the tree line and near the coast of the oceans it can reach values around several hundred or even thousands of mm per year and exceed the measured rain and snowfall precipitation for instance in the table mountain in south africa fog deposition exceeded 3 000 mm per year and the annual precipitation was less than 2 000 mm nagel 1956 unlike falling precipitation fog deposition is not recorded in the standard measurements of the meteorological services thus its spatial occurrence is limited to indirectly quantification as consequences the input and output of water in sites with a considerable amount of fog deposition is imbalanced so that runoff and evaporation can be higher than the falling precipitation hutley et al 1997 cameron et al 1997 zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 non rainfall water sources studied in drylands and wetlands had an important contribution to the decay of plant litter by enabling microbial activity gliksman et al 2017 jacobson et al 2015 evans et al 2020 newell et al 1985 kuehn et al 2004 and for the activity of biological crusts hill et al 2015 maestre et al 2010 non rainfall water sources can reduce drought stress and can be harvested in areas where it is economically feasible and provide additional water source in drylands wang et al 2017 in addition in areas with poor water supplies and high occurrence of fog it can be collected with fog nets to use the water as a source of drinking water schemenauer and cereceda 1994 in this article we want to focus on the fog deposition at the vegetation in germany to determine the additional water input into the water balance however the methods presented here are not specifically adapted to the study area and can be transferred to other areas investigations of fog deposition in germany began at the beginning of the 20th century when linke 1916 carried out precipitation measurements in and outside a spruce stand in the taunus and found that 66 additional precipitation was recorded in the stand due to dripping fog than outside the stand dieckmann 1931 used a fine cylindrical wire mesh which he fixed over a hellmann rain gauge to determine the fog precipitation on the mt brocken rubner 1932 carried out similar measurements in the ore mountains but used glass rods instead of wire mesh the idea of a standard measuring instrument for fog precipitation was taken up by grunow 1952 he further developed the wired mesh cylinder attachment and carried out comparative measurements throughout germany grunow 1953 1955 1958 1963 grunow and tollner 1969 it turned out that good comparative measurements of different locations were possible however the actually collected quantity of precipitation at the vegetation could not be determined satisfactorily thus the fog catcher hohenpeißenberger nebelfänger german for fog catcher that was invented at mt hohenpeißenberg described in grunow 1953 and developed for the previous mentioned studies was contrary to the previous plans not introduced across the country modern fog catchers have to deal with the same issue schemenauer and cereceda 1994 fuzzi et al 1997 wrzesinsky 2004 klemm et al 2005 and klemm and wrzesinsky 2007 determined fog precipitation using the direct eddy covariance method and while it is possible to measure the fog precipitation in a stand it is not suitable for spatial investigation as an alternative and supplement to the direct measurement of fog deposition models have been developed to determine the same katata 2014 provides a comprehensive overview of the development of fog modelling the deposition models which work with resistance analogy should be mentioned here lovett 1984 developed a model that could determine the fog deposition on numerous vegetation layers and the associated resistances as a function of wind speed droplet size distribution and liquid water content the model is a one dimensional over a homogeneous canopy which does not include the edge effect due to heterogenous environment this model was used and further developed by numerous authors such as miller et al 1993 pahl 1996 and burkard et al 2003 one variant was parameterized by katata et al 2008 with high agreement to the lovett model r2 0 928 so that the fog deposition calculated by his model only depends on the wind speed the stand height and the leaf area index lai as well as the liquid water content lwc which makes it easier to use due to the reduced amount of parameters in this article we combine the real fog method from körner et al 2020 which is refered here to as real fog part 1 for the determination of the lwc of the atmosphere at ground level with the determination of the deposition velocity from katata et al 2008 to determine the fog deposition for germany with a temporal resolution of one day as a consequence we use only station data for the meteorological input variables in our modelling and are completely independent of the extremely time consuming calculations of on the one hand numerical weather models and the resistance analogy model according to lovett 1984 on the other hand the calculations are made for the years 1949 to 2018 on hourly basis and were aggregated to daily resolution validation data are rare and unfortunately most of the records of the time series of grunow are lost plaß dülmer dwd personal communication however we use the few remaining data and additionally calculations for several mountains done by pahl 1996 and direct measured fog deposition by wrzesinsky 2004 furthermore we run the water balance model brook90 federer et al 2003 with and without the fog deposition calculated by the real fog model for several low mountain range catchments some of which had major problems in closing the water balance due to fog deposition in the past our hypothesis is therefore the following from the hourly station data of wind speed temperature and humidity as well as the lai and the vegetation height and a digital elevation model the spatial fog deposition can be derived by means of the proposed model from this a data set for fog deposition in germany for the years 1949 2018 can be created such a data set is novel in terms of spatial and temporal resolution and coverage as well as for the small amount of variables required 2 site description we conducted our study for the entire area of current germany which includes the former german democratic republic 1949 1990 before the german reunification germany lies in the cool temperate climate zone extending from the baltic and north sea coasts over the north german lowlands the low mountain range threshold to the upper rhine rift valley the alpine foothills and finally to the alps previous studies of fog deposition in germany were conducted for the erzgebirge zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 lange et al 2003 rubner 1932 the taunus linke 1916 the fichtelgebirge klemm and wrzesinsky 2007 the harz köhler et al 2015 and the black forest winkler and pahl 1993 3 material and methods 3 1 data we use meteorological station data of the german meteorological service dwd which are freely available via ftp dwd 2020 temperature and humidity data are processed as described in körner et al 2020 and interpolated with thin plate splines nychka et al 2017 wind speed data are calculated according to the logarithmic wind profile eq 2 from the measuring height which differes from station to station to 10 m uniform height table 1 gaps in meteorological data were filled according to körner et al 2018 so that they are available for the entire period considered data for the vegetation height are used from the global forest canopy height grid simard et al 2011 this is a global vegetation height model with a resolution of about 1 000 m as of 2005 a dynamic vegetation height model would be desirable for further analysis especially to take into account the forest dieback in the 1980 s the constant vegetation also gives us the possibility to consider changes or trends in the temporal course of the fog deposition independent of the vegetation and thus exclusively dependent on the meteorological conditions finally we need the lai values as model input since we set the vegetation height as constant we keep the lai constant as well for deciduous forests this assumption would be inaccurate during the winter season in contrast in coniferous forests it can be a good approximation since conifers are predominant in areas with relevant fog deposition we decided to use a constant lai of three m2 m2 obviously this is a compromise young or sparse forests may have a lower lai and for instance a dense pine forest of maybe 80 years may reach a lai of seven or even higher however the main objective of this article is to introduce the method and give an early data insight 3 2 the real fog model we carried out our grid based calculations for the study area using the model described in körner et al 2020 here we use a spatial resolution of 1x1 km2 and a temporal resolution for calculation of one hour besides the gridded vegetation height data we use hourly data of temperature und relative humidity interpolated with thin plate splines to calculate liquid water content using latitude longitude and elevation as predictors we calculated fog deposition following katata et al 2008 for a mesoscale resolution 1 p fog 0 0164 lwc c u c lai m h c with lwc c as the liquid water content of the air at canopy height kg m3 u c as wind speed at canopy height m s lai as leaf area index m2 m2 h c as canopy height m p fog as fog deposition mm s and m as unit meter for unit consistency vegetation parameters are kept constant over time as mentioned in the previous section 3 1 data the liquid water content and the wind speed both show an approximate logarithmic profile in the atmosphere near the ground which is influenced by vegetation kuroiwa 1953 kuroiwa and kinosita 1953 katata et al 2010 zhou 2006 consequently both parameters are reduced to values at canopy height depending on the actual canopy height reduced wind speed and lwc values are about half to one fourth of the interpolated values the wind speed at canopy height is calculated with the following equation 2 2 u c u 1 ln h c d c z 0 c ln h 1 d 1 z 01 with u 1 as wind speed m s at measurement level h 1 m d 1 as zero plane displacement for grass m wmo 2003 d c a s zero plane displacement for the according canopy m z 01 as roughness length of grass m and z 0 c as roughness length of the according canopy m the liquid water content at canopy height is calculated equivalent to the wind speed u is replaced by lwc accordingly since we use meteorological values of standard weather stations we use a parametrisation over grass h1 d1 and z01 and forest hc dc and z0c using the global forest height product simard et al 2011 since there is no measurement height for the lwc values we have to assume a value and we decided to use 30 m this assumption is based on measurements kuroiwa 1953 kuroiwa and kinosita 1953 and numerical calculations zhou 2006 and was used by katata et al 2011 in a similar way the parameters are summarized in table 1 3 3 water balance validation the water balance of a catchment describes an important cycle of a natural system where fog deposition might have an impact to close the water budget the hydrologic model brook90 b90 federer et al 2003 was applied to validate the water balance this model is a lumped physically based model with a strong emphasis of the evapotranspiration processes b90 was chosen as a representative of hydrological models with an implementation of a shuttleworth wallace approach shuttleworth and wallace 1985 for net evapotranspiration it is considered to have a crucial influence on the mass fluxes of water from fog deposition net evapotranspiration estimated by the shuttleworth wallace approach is considered to be better than by the penman monteith model stannard 1993 b90 is available as an r package and was applied to 74 catchment areas in saxony germany vorobevskii et al 2020 we focus on this area because of the high fog deposition occurrence due to the low mountain ranges on the one hand and the high data availability of the validation variable the runoff on the other hand the catchment characteristics required as input are derived from a digitalized soil map at a scale 1 50 000 and a 10 m digital elevation model the land cover types were classified by a land use map at a scale 1 100 000 i e corine land cover büttner 2014 based on the identified land cover b90 standard parameters were used for vegetation parametrisation in the model the model was not calibrated because a model calibration would favour a certain data input to which it was calibrated therefor standard parameters were set independently of a calibration the daily meteorological forcing was generated on the basis of a reference dataset bernhofer et al 2019 for a period ranging from 01 01 1961 until 31 12 2015 the meteorological variables were interpolated on a 1 km grid for saxony on a daily scale pluntke et al 2019 the interpolation of average wind speed global radiation and average vapour pressure minimum and maximum temperature was based on a combination of a univariate regression interpolation plus residual interpolation by inverse distance weighting daily wind induced error corrected precipitation was interpolated by means of indicator kriging kronenberg and bernhofer 2015 the water balance validation was based on the comparison of observed with simulated runoff on a monthly scale therefore the nash sutcliff efficiency nse as well as the kling gupta efficiency kge were calculated for the model run period from 01 03 1961 until 31 12 2015 i e two month model warm up and for each respective catchment gupta et al 2009 additionally two different input datasets were considered in the simulation and analysis the first dataset are all gridded meteorological variables without fog deposition nofog and the second dataset are the same meteorological forcing except precipitation data were increased by the estimated fog deposition fog therefore the difference between the skill scores of a fog model run and a nofog run will indicate if a simulation improves by the additional precipitation input the assumption for the water balance validation would be that precipitation together with fog deposition leads to a better estimate of runoff in a catchment therefore fog deposition is treated as additional precipitation input in a hydrological system and is therefore summed up with conventional precipitation we created a data set for modelled fog deposition in daily resolution over 70 years for over 200 000 grid cells where hc is higher than 0m in germany the question arises how can these data be validated or at least their plausibility be checked typically model results are compared with measurements it is also possible to compare our model results with the model results of other authors additionally there is the idea of validating the results by means of water balance modelling we will discuss this idea in more detail in the part 4 3 water balance estimation based on brook90 at first we will discuss the possibility to compare the model results with measured data although our fog data covers germany for the last 70 years there are very few measurements in the area under investigation during the period in question that we can use as a basis for comparison grunow 1963 used the hohenpeißenberg nebefänger fog catcher on the one hand this has the disadvantage that the measured values are difficult to transfer to the vegetation and on the other hand it has high inaccuracies for example due to horizontally drifted and intercepted precipitation direct measurements of fog precipitation by the eddy covariance method only one in germany is known to the authors wrzesinsky 2004 used this method to investigate a stand at mt waldstein in the fichtelgebirge mountains in bavaria over a period of one year in order not to limit the comparison to a single measurement we have decided to use all measurements and additionally data from modelling fog deposition of sites that meet the following requirements having at least one year measurement or modelling period a site located in germany within the period of 1949 2018 and having a defined localisation a total of 16 reference values were used which originated from three different methods in addition to the above mentioned direct measurement on the waldstein from wrzesinsky 2004 five measurements from grunow 1963 and one measurement from baumgartner 1958 present the results of the hohenpeißenberger fog catcher some stations from grunow 1963 could not be used because the location was not specified exactly or the station was not in the study area or the station had no vegetation in addition to these measurements models based on lovett 1984 were used these are seven model results from pahl 1996 and two from zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 4 results and discussion in this section we summarize and discuss the results of our modelling the evaluation is initially carried out in a spatially or temporally aggregated manner throughout germany in the second part we focus on the quality and compare our results with site measurements and site modelling as well as water balance modelling on a catchment area basis 4 1 real fog results fig 1 shows that the mean annual sum of fog deposition in germany ranges between 1 5 and 2 mm for areas up to 600 m a s l there is a general trend of increase in fog deposition over time red line but this trend is not substantial the sum of the fog deposition is in the range of less than 1 of the annual measured precipitation sum mean precipitation sum in germany 750 mm year for the majority of these areas fog deposition is therefore not relevant to the water balance the values are different for areas above 600 m a s l fig 2 here it can be seen that the calculated fog deposition ranged between 60 and 120 mm year with an average of 85 mm year there is a general trend of decrease in fog deposition over time red line but this trend is not substantial as well the share of fog deposition in the measured precipitation for areas above 600 m a s l ranges from 0 no vegetation to 100 exposed forest at higher altitude percent about 13 percent of the area of germany have an altitude of above 600 m a s l these figures show that fog deposition should definitely be taken into account when determining the water balance and in other considerations like ecological impact holwerda et al 2006 ice breakage döbele 1935 or as fresh water resources klemm et al 2012 the seasonal cycle of fog deposition shows different pictures in terms of the magnitude and timing when comparing the two altitude levels fig 3 shows the seasonal cycle for areas up to 600 m a s l it can be clearly seen that the months october november december and january lead to higher fog deposition sums than the other months the reason for this is water vapour often does not reach saturation in the air during summer months and therefore hardly any fog is formed in the lower altitudes the exception here is radiation fog which can form on cloudless nights under these conditions however the wind speed is close to 0 m s which means that fog deposition rarely occurs in contrast advection fog occurs more frequently in the months of october november december and january and with a higher deposition rate because it is denser than radiation fog and it occurs with wind speeds above 0 m s thus the conditions for fog deposition are created here compared to higher altitudes these fog sums are very low fig 4 for altitudes above 600 m the annual cycle is completely different because at higher altitudes in addition to advection fog with a minor role there is also orographic fog a forced uplift on mountains that cools the air masses when the dew point is reached orographic fog forms from the condensation level onwards the liquid water content is therefore greater than 0 kg m3 unlike advection and radiative fog orographic fog does not have such a distinct annual cycle since it is superimposed by another effect the warmer the air mass the more water vapour it can absorb clausius clapeyron equation in addition the more water vapour an air mass contains the more water condenses during orographic ascent and subsequently settles on the vegetation as fog deposition thus a distinct annual fog deposition pattern develops the most yielding month is therefore also the warmest month and the month with the lowest fog deposition rates in the cold month typically july and february respectively the spatial distribution of the fog deposition rate followed a clear pattern of the altitude fig 5 it can be clearly seen that the values in the low mountain ranges increase considerably compared to the north german lowlands the maximum values of more than 3 000 mm a in the alpine region seem to be too high at first sight in the literature no comprehensive values could be found for this area it is possible that our modelling overestimates fog deposition in these areas it is also possible that the vegetation height is incorrectly parameterised however until further measurements we should not ignore the possibility that the values are realistic potentially reshaping our understanding of water budget in these catchments areas the dependence of the fog deposition on the altitude is shown in fig 6 the black dots are the values of the single 1x1 km grid cells the optical impression suggests an exponential increase of the fog deposition with the height of the terrain however fog depositions of 0 mm year are calculated for grid points where the vegetation height is 0 m according to the corresponding vegetation height model these values are therefore always on the x axis but are difficult to evaluate visually therefore the mean fog deposition by altitude level in 100 m classes was added to the figure red dots the mean increase of fog deposition with altitude is thus less steep due to the beginning timberline the mean fog deposition decreases by 2 000 m after a maximum however it should be noted that due to the small number of grid cells in the higher altitude classes as well as the low density of meteorological stations from about 1 000 m height the statements for fog deposition in these areas should be treated with caution 4 2 validation the results of the measurements and modelling are given with their characteristic values in table 2 it should be noted that only mountain stations were available for the comparison this is not an additional selection criterion rather most of the measurements and modelling took place and still take place at mountain stations due to the high occurrence of fog compared to the lowlands for some stations several references from different authors are available and in some case the measurement heights on the same mountain differed slightly the various measuring and modelling periods of the individual references were matched with respective period from our model the annual values for fog deposition given in table 2 are shown again in fig 7 for visual clarity a comparison of our real fog model with the single and thus no regression was performed measurement at mt waldstein with eddy covariance black point shows a good agreement since this measurement was used to derive the equation 1 we use it as a control against calculation mistakes nevertheless the good agreement is an indication that the values determined with real fog for wind speed and in particular liquid water content correspond well with the actual conditions on site the comparison of our modelling with the results from the lovett model pahl 1996 and zimmermann and zimmermann 2002 shows quite good agreement slope 1 04 offset 16 mm year r2 0 74 for the mean annual values the order of magnitude of the values corresponds to the station with the highest annual total brocken and the station with the lowest annual total corresponds quite well again it should be noted that the model we used katata 2008 is based on the similar deposition processes taken into account in the lovett model and comparability is therefore limited nevertheless we use these studies for comparison for the following reasons the determination of the lwc is completely different in our study compared to the previous studies if there were any systematic deviations due to these different methods they would be noticeable here the same is true albeit to a lesser extent for wind speed measured vs interpolated and for vegetation parameters extensive parameterization with resistivity analogy vs simple parameterization with lai and vegetation height as the only vegetation parameters it should also be taken into account that the reference values are valid for specific pinpoint locations while our modelling results are for a 1 1 km cells overall it is of course positive that no systematic over or underestimation can be identified and that both models are within a plausible range here the comparison of our model with the measured values from the hohenpeißenberger nebelfänger shows little agreement slope 1 12 offset 679 mm year r2 0 35 the hohenpeißenberg station should be emphasized here in the comparison period 11 mm year fog precipitation was modelled with real fog grunow 1963 measured an annual sum of 501 mm the causes for the discrepancy are likely to originate from the location of the measurements and the stand locations differed while we are modelling fog deposition at forests the fog catchers stood exposed on grassland thus the lwc and the wind speed where much higher in this measurement than in the stand and therefore more fog deposition is gained by the fogcatcher in addition the cross section of the fog catcher is significantly larger than the one of the rain gauge due to the structure of the measurement which means that considerably more precipitation is collected finally the assumption that the two methods do not measure the same meteorological value is strengthened by the comparison however the assumption cannot be confirmed with certainty as the comparison of the sample is too small overall the performance of the model is affected by different inaccuracies in the data and methods some of these uncertainties can be reduced by an extended database others relate to methodology thus the model is limited by the vegetation height model which is static and cannot represent temporal changes data on the temporal and spatial variability of the lai were also missing measurements or modelling of dynamic lai values would improve the quality of fog precipitation data the meteorologically measured values themselves are faulty for example due to device errors there are method related uncertainties in spatial interpolation which can be reduced but not avoided by an increased database when filling gaps an attempt is made to minimise the uncertainties however they cannot be avoided used empirical formulas like the one according to katata et al 2008 always have only a certain accuracy random errors balance each other out for longer periods of time meteorological data daily or monthly sums of fog deposition have a smaller relative error than the calculated hourly values systematic errors in the input data such as a specified vegetation height of 20 metres where no vegetation is present at all or vice versa respectively at the time in question accordingly lead to systematic deviations in the results nevertheless we would like to emphasise the high agreement in slope of the regression line between the measurements and calculations this leads to the assumption that the model results can be used to at least a qualitative interpretation such as spatial map of fog deposition in country scale 4 3 water balance estimation based on brook90 the water balance validation was carried out for 74 catchments which possess 2 344 subcatchments these subcatchments were divided into 42 630 unique hydrologically response unit hru b90 was applied for these hru with two different meteorological forcings fog and nofog the validation results based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge for all subcatchments are depicted in fig 8 hru results were area weighted averaged for each subcatchment the water balance validation reveals for the nofog runs satisfactory simulations for most of the catchments on a monthly scale within a period from 01 03 1961 until 31 12 2015 in the area of saxony germany this is confirmed by the kge values fig 8c which show for most catchments values higher than 0 41 this value indicates that our simulations are better than the mean observed flow knoben et al 2019 the validation based on the nse scores fig 8a is less conforming but generally also in favour of the b90 model the validation of the two model runs i e nofog fog reveals surprising results fig 8b and 8d most regions do not change green areas because no fog deposition is occurring in these subcatchments however the model performance for a large amount of subcatchments decreases unexpectedly with incorporation of fog deposition data slight yellow areas while only very few subcatchment simulations improve dark blue by the additional precipitation input these findings are more obvious considering the nse but are also dominant for the kge skill scores hence the water balance validation could not show a significant improvement of discharge simulations even the opposite was achieved the skill scores decreased with additional precipitation the main explanation for these results is seen in an incomplete evapotranspiration model normally we assume an upper limit of potential evaporation which of course can be exceeded oke 2009 but mostly is in its limits conserved averaged annual potential evaporation et0 from 1961 until 2015 is shown in fig 9 c the comparison between et0 and the b90 evapotranspiration for the fog model runs fig 9a and 9c shows in the southern mountainous regions of saxony that the upper et0 limit is already reached by the b90 simulations i e about 600 mm per year hence no further energy for the evapotranspiration process is available in these mountainous regions where we find fog deposition the evaporation process in b90 is based on the well known model by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 where evapotranspiration is described in a column additional advective energy which is transported by a horizontal or downward vertical sensible heat flux i e due to an oasis effect is not considered in b90 however negative sensible heat fluxes are not only observed in dry arid regions with oasis they are observed even in temperate and mountainous regions bernhofer et al 2013 especially in the autumn and winter months when fog occurrence is highest in germany for this reason one should expect an evaporation of 70 to 80 of fog deposition as intercepted precipitation in our case mostly no energy input neither an additional sensible heat flux nor additional wind speed are provided by the meteorological input for this process therefore only up to 10 of the additional fog deposition evaporates this can be seen in fig 9b where the maximum averaged evapotranspiration increases up to 53 mm per year consequently more than 80 of the fog deposition forms additional runoff supporting this notion the distribution of average annual water amounts of the major water components fig 10 i e precipitation prec evapotranspiration evap discharge flow over the respective subcatchments the figure reveals that most subcatchments are almost not influenced by fog deposition due to its altitude and land cover dependency the medians are not changing only a few subcatchments really face significant additional amount of precipitation by fog but in these subcatchments the b90 model mostly distributes the water into direct flow instead of evapotranspiration our results show that fog deposition needs a careful treatment in hydrological simulations furthermore our results indicate that a better evapotranspiration model is necessary and more research is required in the description of the evapotranspiration process in hydrological models to better link hydrological and atmospheric interactions finally the application of fog deposition in hydrological modelling needs to be carefully checked for the respective catchment individually 5 summary and conclusions we determined fog deposition on vegetation using the method of katata et al 2008 combined with the method of körner et al 2020 for determining liquid water content the uniqueness of the method and the dataset generated in a fine temporal resolution hourly and daily for calculation steps and aggregation respectivly and a decent spatial resolution 1 km2 for 70 years between 1949 and 2018 data which we make freely available the comparison with the unfortunately very few available measurements and models has shown that they match relatively well in the annual sum an exception is the comparison with the hohenpeißenberger nebelfänger which shows strong differences overall the comparison provides only indications as there are simply too few comparative measurements to be reliable the water balance validation by brook90 reveals that a simple addition of fog deposition to conventional precipitation is not recommended since it would most likely lead to a significant increase in discharge instead of evapotranspiration our findings suggest that negative sensible heat fluxes as additional energy input need to be considered in the evapotranspiration description altogether the presented method offers the possibility to calculate fog deposition in high spatial resolution for longer periods even in the past by using geo statistical methods and by abandoning numerical weather modelling nevertheless there is a great potential for improvement of the model results the quality of the spatial interpolation of the meteorological values can be improved by including additional measurement networks by means of a temporally dynamic land use clearings storm damage the growth of a young forest and the seasonal change of the lai can also be taken into account for the sake of simplicity and to keep the model reproducible only freely accessible data was used for this invoice for the calculation of fog deposition for a defined smaller catchment area one will certainly use local information with higher accuracy for the concerning area measurements of the lwc in the study area or modelling at sites with liquid water content measurements can help to improve the quality of the lwc in the model significantly additional local knowledge of meteorological and plant properties can improve the model results modelled daily fog deposition sums in one km² resolution are accessible via

4448,historical data on underground fluid can be valuable for detecting potential hydrological precursors although different analysis methods have been employed nonlinear dynamic fluctuations and the lack of auxiliary observations makes hydrological precursors difficult to identify in this study we investigated hydrological time series of data from six monitoring sites to identify possible precursors to the lijiang earthquake two long short term memory lstm models were developed to simulate and forecast hydrological variations with and without the use of auxiliary data the results indicate that both models are useful and valid in forecasting short term hydrological variations the lstm model developed using only historical data can provide good accuracy and validity in simulating and forecasting short term hydrological variations when no auxiliary meteorological observations are available the results show that observations made during seismically inactive periods can be better modeled than those made during active periods furthermore the exponentially weighted moving average control chart was employed as a detector to identify anomalous signals the results show that there was a false precursor in the time series from the six monitoring points wells and springs hydrological anomalies at four of the wells occurred 1 6 months before the lijiang earthquake and can be attributed to changes in tectonic stress however the anomalies at one of the other wells may be unrelated to this earthquake an anomalous signal observed at a spring could not be related to earthquakes and may have been caused by other factors this study shows that lstm models are useful in detecting possible hydrological precursor anomalies keywords time series long short term memory lstm hydrological precursors anomaly detection 1 introduction earthquake prediction is one of the leading fields in the earth sciences and earthquake precursors are considered the key to solving such problems there is a long history of searching for possible precursors in various fields such as hydrology geochemistry and seismology cicerone et al 2009 among them hydrological precursors are one of the most intriguing and anticipated types as they have clear relations to crustal stress manga and wang 2015 precursors related to groundwater level temperature spring discharge and groundwater geochemical composition have been documented ingebritsen and manga 2014 roeloffs 1988 thomas 1988 one common feature is that most of these reported precursors have not been corrected for noise from factors such as atmospheric pressure earth tides rainfall and other possible environmental factors this is one of the most criticized points in the study of hydrological precursors roeloffs 1996 wang and manga 2010 generally it is necessary to make auxiliary observations that may help to remove the influence of non tectonic factors many hydrological monitoring sites were established decades ago or lack of weather observation no auxiliary observations are available as a result it is difficult to accurately identify precursor anomalies and a lot of precious data is left out due to the lack of auxiliary observations many previous studies have documented possible precursors using conventional techniques such as trend analysis the standard deviation method and the regression analysis method yan et al 2018 such methods are quite straightforward and useful in identifying the large magnitudes of anomalous changes however many hydrological systems contain records of tectonic and non tectonic activities and show nonlinear dynamic fluctuations which makes it difficult to identify hydrological precursors by conventional statistical methods thus a new technique is needed to re examine these valuable historical data from a modern perspective data mining methods such as the decision tree method zmazek et al 2003 and artificial neural network method ann ostad ali askari et al 2016 torkar et al 2010 have been proposed for detecting possible precursor anomalies in radon gas time series but the decision tree is easy to overfit hilbert huang transform hht has been used in detecting anomalous signals in water level data chen et al 2010 however the hht method can only detect transient anomalies while the data mining method requires auxiliary data and does not consider the memory of hydrological systems in this study we employed the long short term memory algorithm lstm to detect possible hydrological anomalies recorded before the 1996 lijiang earthquake this method is widely used in deep learning and is suitable for long term time series analysis the study objectives were as follows 1 evaluating the performance of the lstm models in simulating the nonlinear changes of hydrological time series 2 study how to simulate and forecast the short term variation of hydrological time series to overcome the limitation of auxiliary observations 3 applying the lstm model to detect and identify hydrological anomalies this study shows that the lstm model can detect the possible hydrological precursors in short term by the historical data thus such method is useful in the identification of precursors especially in areas that lack of auxiliary observations to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to employ this method for detecting precursor anomalies in hydrological time series 2 geological and seismic setting the study area was located in yunnan and sichuan provinces in southwest china which is one of the most seismically active areas in china as it the location of the collision of the indian and eurasian plates it has a very complex geological structure with several major faults the northeast trending left lateral xianshuihe xiaojiang fault and the northwest trending red river fault one important fault zone the red river fault zone runs through the entire region from northwest to southeast and divides yunnan province into two parts northeastern and southwestern these two parts interact with each other under the action of the crustal plates causing tectonic stresses to be continuously accumulated and released through frequent earthquakes chen 2002 seismic activities in the study area have the characteristics of high frequency large magnitude and extensive distribution according to the earthquake catalog provided by the global seismic earthquake catalog from the usgs more than 289 earthquakes of magnitude 5 have occurred in the 20th century in yunnan province among them 13 earthquakes of m 7 have occurred in this area in yunnan province the western part of the lancangjiang fault f2 belongs to the tengchong baoshan block most of the area is widely covered by paleozoic early mesozoic sedimentary rocks and granites dong 2016 between the east of the lancangjiang fault f2 and the west of jinshajiang red river faults f1 and f3 most of the region belongs to the tethys stratigraphic region where the pre cambrian base is not exposed due to being covered by jurassic and cretaceous red sandstones wang 2017 the yangtze stratigraphic region located to the east of the jinshajiang and red river faults has many developed fold structures it is mainly covered by metamorphic volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks jiang 2016 based on the lithological units the aquifers can be divided into quaternary unconsolidated sediment aquifers fissured aquifers and karst aquifers in addition karst aquifers are dominated by devonian permian and triassic carbonates xia et al 2006 to the west of the longmenshan fault f8 in sichuan province triassic clastic rocks sandstones and limestones are the most extensive stratigraphic units the most famous geological structure in the east is the sichuan basin where aquifers can be divided into porous bedrock fissured and karst aquifers cui 2014 pore water is stored in loose quaternary deposits bedrock fissured aquifers exist in the sandstone and mudstone of the jurassic and cretaceous systems which are generally distributed along the structure karst water is generally buried deep in the basin and is stored in the limestone and dolomite of the permian and triassic system an earthquake of magnitude 7 0 100 2 e 27 3 n struck lijiang county of yunnan province on february 3 1996 and was the largest normal faulting event to occur along the western boundary of the sichuan yunnan block in the last 40 years ji et al 2017 it ruptured tens of kilometers of rupture zone and caused disastrous damage han et al 2004 the earthquake occurred in the triangular block composed of the zhongdian jianchuan zhongdian yongsheng and lijiang jiangchuan faults chen 2002 su et al 2004 showed that the lijiang jiangchuan and zhongdian yongsheng faults caused nearly east west stretching and normal dip slip of the yulong snow mountain fault triggering a large earthquake fig 1 in the precursor identification process it is a crucial step to choose monitoring sites located in possible precursor anomalous areas here we use the method proposed by dobrovolsky et al 1979 to estimate the possible region where precursors will be detectable the equation used to determine the largest anomalous area is as follows 1 d ε 10 0 433 m 2 73 ε 3 m 5 where dɛ km is the greatest distance that the precursors appeared m mw is earthquake magnitude and ɛ is strain deformation we used ɛ 10 8 as the lower limit to distinguish an earthquake strain and the strain loading by earth tides yan 2018 so dɛ was approximately 928 km moreover the anomalous radius can be further verified by the empirical relationship wang and manga 2010 2 log r 0 48 m 0 33 log e 1 4 where r km is the epicentral distance and e is the seismic energy density j m3 we assume that the precursor response is highly related to the co seismic response zhang et al 2020b and there are co seismic responses of the hydrogeologic system to earthquakes if e 0 01 j m3 according to the published global catalog of seismic energy density and hydrological responses wang and manga 2010 as a result the maximum value of r is 417 km hence four wells and two springs located in and near anomalous areas were selected to study possible hydrological precursors see fig 1 three wells xg ky tc had meteorological data available air temperature and precipitation while others only monitored subsurface fluid data all observational data were recorded daily detailed information on the wells is shown in table 1 3 method 3 1 partial autocorrelation function the partial autocorrelation function pacf is an effective tool for exploring the correlation between xt k and xt after eliminating the interference of variable xt 1 xt 2 xt k 1 shumway and stoffer 2011 it is generally used to identify the order of an autoregressive process and the number of input vectors and has been successfully employed in many machine learning and forecasting models chang et al 2015 in this study we used the pacf to explore the possible relationship between observations made at time t and at a previous time and selected input parameters for a neural network yule walker equations and cramer rules are usually used to calculate the pacf as follows tinungki 2019 3 kk d k d 4 d 1 ρ 1 ρ k 1 ρ 1 1 ρ k 2 ρ k 1 ρ k 2 1 5 d k 1 ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 2 ρ k 1 ρ k 2 ρ k 6 ρ k t 1 n k x t x t x t k x t t 1 n x t x t 2 where kk and ρ k are partial autocorrelation and autocorrelation coefficients with lag k of the sequence respectively and x t t 1 n x t n is the mean sample 3 2 wavelet coherence wavelet transforms are generally used to analyze denoise and compress signals and images as a part of data processing and analysis they include the continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt it can decompose a time series into the time frequency space with multi time resolution its advantage is the ability to obtain information on the time location and frequency of a signal wavelet coherence wtc a cwt method is a powerful tool for identifying possible relationships between two time series in the frequency space by a large common power and also reveals the lag relationship between two time series yan 2018 in this paper we use it to study the possible interference factors affecting variation in the monitoring data the monte carlo method was selected to estimate the statistical significance level of wtc allen and smith 1996 the cone of influence coi was used to evaluate the edge artifacts caused by discontinuities at the endpoint ng and chan 2012 when two signals are analyzed in time frequency space the wtc is defined as follows grinsted et al 2004 7 r 2 x y s s 1 w x y 2 s s 1 w x s s 1 w y where w is the continuous wavelet transform when it has one argument and the cross wavelet transform when it has two x and y are two time series s denotes a smoothing operator and s represents the wavelet scale in addition global coherence gc was introduced as time averaged wavelet coherence coefficients torrence and compo 1998 8 r 2 s 1 n τ 1 n r 2 s τ where τ is the location parameter in the time domain and n is the number of points in the time series 3 3 long short term memory neural network the long short term memory lstm neural network proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn it is a useful technique for capturing the nonlinear relationships between predictor and target variables it was developed to overcome the inherent problems of traditional rnns i e vanishing and exploding gradients thus lstm networks are suitable for processing and forecasting nonlinear time varying series with relatively long intervals and delays similar to a typical rnn network an lstm network is composed of three layers input hidden and output fig 2 a the hidden layer is also called the lstm layer with memory blocks and one of its cells contains a forget gate f t an input gate i t and an output gate o t to explain how the lstm network works its internal operation is illustrated in fig 2b an lstm has the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural networks and passes through the following three steps or gates to obtain the predicted values 1 forget gate the forget gate decides what information is going to be ignored from the previous cell state it is capable of reading the previous hidden state ht 1 and the current input xt the forget gate is calculated by the following equation 9 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where σ denotes a logistic sigmoidal function that outputs a number between zero and one for each number in the cell state ct 1 a value of one means that all the information is kept while a value of zero means it is all removed wf is the network matric of the forget gate and bf is a bias vector 2 input gate the input gate decides what new information is to be updated and stored in the cell state it has two synchronous processes 1 a tanh layer computes a potential update vector c t from the current input and the last hidden state 2 a sigmoid layer defines what information is used to update the cell state in the current time step then the cell state ct is updated with the above process completed the specific mathematical equations are as follows 10 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 11 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 12 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent w represents the weight matric b represents a bias vector and subscripts c and i define the tanh layer and input gate respectively 3 output gate the output gate controls what information is going to be output subsequently the new hidden layer ht is determined by the output gate and the cell state at the last time step 13 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 14 h t o t tanh c t where wo and bo represent the weight matric and bias vector of the output gate respectively 4 data analysis 4 1 data preprocessing in order to reveal any possible precursors of the lijiang earthquake hydrogeological and nearby meteorological data were collected from several wells and analyzed including data on groundwater levels radon concentration ion components electrical conductivity precipitation and temperature the lengths of the datasets were not the same due to the different establishment times of the monitoring sites and large gaps due to missing data table 2 the collected data time series were at least 764 days and at most 2226 days in length and data gaps 4 days were filled by cubic spline interpolation the interpolation process was conducted using the fillmissing and spline functions in matlab software version 2019 moreover it was difficult to obtain local weather data for ky so we used data from honghe about 34 km away for more accurate identification of precursor anomalies the time series was split into two parts seismically active sa and seismically inactive periods non sa zmazek et al 2003 the sa periods may have had seismic activities or precursory anomalies zhang et al 2020b and zmazek et al 2003 showed that the discrepancy between measured values and those predicted by machine learning is high if seismic activity has an impact on monitoring data accordingly a critical problem is to find a suitable rule for choosing the time interval between non sa and sa periods hereby an empirical formula was used to determine the interval as follows biagi et al 2000 15 log r t 0 63 m 0 15 where r km refers to the epicentral distance t days is the time interval between a possible anomaly and the subsequent earthquake m is earthquake magnitude and log represents a logarithm base 10 then the time series are divided into an sa period from t days before the earthquake to the moment of the earthquake and the rest of the data are a non sa period the earliest time of the possible precursor anomalies is shown in table 2 4 2 model development hydrological forecasting models generally use multiple variables as input features for a neural network however many studies have shown that it is feasible to train a neural network using past observed data if there are no auxiliary observations zhou et al 2017 sahoo et al 2019 in china there is a lack of auxiliary observations for many hydrological monitoring sites that were established early as a result many precious data can only be used for simple statistical analyses and anomaly identification therefore we developed lstm models in two ways to deal with time series forecasting in our study 1 using driving factors such as precipitation and air temperature and the previous hydrological time series and 2 only using the previous hydrological time series to overcome data limitations while there are no fixed proportions of the datasets used for model training and validation it is believed that the training set should comprise 50 of the total time series while the validation set should typically be 10 40 barzegar et al 2019 to ensure that the lstm could better detect possible precursor anomalies the training and validation sets did not contain data related to earthquakes based on the non sa period and previous studies zhang and fu 2000 chen 2002 therefore each dataset was divided into three sets i a training set 50 ii validation set 20 and iii prediction set 30 which also ensured that the sa period was within the interval of the prediction set table 2 the lstm model was trained from scratch using hyperparameters including the numbers of neurons and layers and the optimization and learning rates the adam optimization function which is the most commonly used function was selected ostad ali askari et al 2017 an et al 2020 subsequently we constructed the lstm model using one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was identified using a trial and error procedure by varying the number of hidden neurons from 1 to 5 with a fixed lag dependent on pacf sahoo et al 2019 for this study the learning rate was initially 0 01 and was then multiplied by a drop factor 0 1 every 2000 iterations to overcome sub optimal results or divergence the number of iteration steps in our case was defined as 6000 for efficient learning the min max normalization approach was used to scale the range of input variables to 0 1 before the training process 16 x norm x x min x max x min where x is the data and x norm x min and x max are the normalized value minimum value and maximum value respectively to obtain the final prediction the output of the network is retransformed using the normalization parameters from the training set we summarized the following key points so that other researchers can conduct similar studies in other regions 1 training set should be within 50 of the total time series and includes at least one year or hydrological year 2 methods such as pacf and wavelet analysis should be used to ensure that there is a correlation between input variables and output variables 3 to ensure that lstm could better detect possible precursor anomalies the training and validation sets do not contain data related to earthquakes based on the non sa period and previous studies 4 the lstm neural network has huge advantages over conventional neural networks and methods in dealing with nonlinear problems but it may be difficult to obtain satisfactory results for strong nonlinear time series liu et al 2019 thus if the hydrological time series is strongly nonlinear singular spectrum analysis ssa and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd can be used to decompose the sequence in the preprocessing steps the detailed process can refer to the research of an et al 2020 4 3 model performance criteria three conventional metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the developed models including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mape and the coefficient of determination r which are defined as follows 17 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 18 mape 1 n i 1 n x i x i x i 100 19 r i 1 n x i x x i x i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where xi is the observed data xi is the predicted data n is the length of the validation set and horizontal lines above a variable indicate an average value the rmse reflects the degree of standard deviation between the simulated and observed values mape is an efficient approach to measuring the accuracy of a hydrological model as a percentage and is primarily used to evaluate data anomalies for rmse and mape a value close to 0 indicates that the predictive ability of the model is satisfactory the r value reflects the linear correlation between the observations and validations and ranges from 0 no fit to 1 perfect fit 5 results 5 1 wavelet coherence wtc results selecting appropriate input variables for an lstm model is a very important step because it provides basic information about the learning system thus wtcs were employed to determine the relationships between hydrological data and potential influencing factors precipitation and air temperature for xg and ky there was a high correlation 0 8 between precipitation temperature and hydrological observations within the band between 264 and 396 days as shown in fig 3 a d although there was a slightly weaker coherence between radon concentration and temperature during the interval 16 april 1994 10 february 1995 radon concentration had strong coherence with meteorological data throughout the whole observation period in tc fig 3e and f in short hydrological and meteorological data had high correlation within the 1 year band accordingly meteorological factors can be used as one of the input variables of the neural network 5 2 partial auto correlation function results the partial autocorrelation function pacf is a typical approach to determining the number of parameters required for hydrological and water resources modeling chang et al 2015 fig 4 plots the pacf of the daily data with 95 confidence bounds blue solid line which shows that the 0th order partial autocorrelation coefficients are constant at one except for the water level at well jc the partial autocorrelation coefficients fluctuate slightly up and down on the 0 axis with increases in lag which implies that most of the time series has a stationary signal and the water level at well jc exhibits a nonstationary process for the situation of using the previous hydrological data h the historical time series h t 1 h t 2 h t p was employed to predict h t with p being the time lag the pacf showed a significant correlation with up to three days of lag time for water levels at well xg and thereafter fell within the confidence band hence p is equivalent to 3 for water levels at well xg similarly we chose p to equal 4 6 7 and 7 for monitoring data at stations ky cn df and tc respectively the correlation pattern indicates that a strong correlation exists among hydrological observations on consecutive days which indicates that forecasting time series using previous data is feasible for the case using previous hydrological and meteorological data as input variables the correlation between them was determined before training to correspond to the hydrological time series of wells xg ky and tc the input variables of precipitation p and temperature t were as follows p t 1 p t 2 p t p and t t 1 t t 2 t t p the value of p is consistent with the previous hydrological data h as a result we input the previous hydrological and meteorological data to train and validate the models of wells xg ky and tc 5 3 lstm model results and assessment based on the results of wtc and pacf lstm models were developed for two input situations 1 driving factors and the previous hydrological time series and 2 the previous hydrological time series situation 1 the predicted hydrological time series of wells xg ky and tc were constructed and compared with field observed data as shown in fig 5 the maximum rmse in the validation process was 1 which implies that the lstm models have appropriate simulation capacity the validation performances have excellent validity for hydrological forecasting with mape values approaching 0 suggesting satisfactory quality table 3 the coefficient of determination r ranges from 0 85 to 0 99 for the validation set in this study indicating that the predicted values closely match the observed values the above results indicate that the lstm model with three driving factors can be used for simulating and predicting hydrological variation situation 2 with the input variable being the time series of the previous hydrological dataset the performance of the lstm models in forecasting one day ahead hydrological variations was summarized table 4 as shown in fig 6 the lstm model shows appropriate simulation capacity and excellent validity for hydrological forecasting at wells xg ky and tc because the rmse values are 1 the mape values approach 0 and the r values approach 1 for the validation set based on the above results the lstm models perform well with the validation dataset using the previous hydrological data as the input variable implying that the lstm model with a single input is also a reliable way to forecast hydrological variations it is notable that the performances of the prediction set are inferior to those of the validation set as shown in fig 6 the predicted values deviate from the observed time series over a period of time although there are similar trends comparing the performances during the validation and prediction periods tables 3 and 4 also illustrate that the performances during the prediction period using the hydrological time series are relatively poor the mape values are up to 60 fold greater the rmse values are 1 4 times greater and most r values decrease slightly these results show that the prediction during sa is significantly worse than that during non sa periods the scatter plot of the observation vs simulation of validation and prediction of the lstm models as displayed in figs 7 and 8 reinforces the above conclusions that the lstm model has validity and reliability in simulating hydrological variation and the observations during seismically inactive periods can be better modeled than those during active periods an et al 2020 and meng et al 2019 showed that irregular oscillations and anomalous behaviors due to interference from tectonic activity can cause poor performance hence we assume that the poor prediction performances may be attributed to tectonic activity 6 discussion as seen in the previous section the good performances of the validation set in two ways show that lstm models can be used to describe short term variation in hydrological data however the poor performance with the prediction set indicates that there is interference with underground fluid in this study the exponentially weighted moving average ewma control chart was employed to detect anomalies and identify their start and end times we define the difference between the simulated and observed values as the residual error ɛt during the validation and prediction periods the ewma control chart consists of upper and lower control limits ucl and lcl respectively eqs 17 and 18 17 ewm a t λ ε t 1 λ e w m a t 1 18 u c l t l c l t μ l σ λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 2 t where the value of λ is a constant in the interval between 0 and 1 which is set as 0 15 because a lower λ can make the control chart more flexible and effective zhang et al 2020a l represents the width of the control limits which is set as 3 in this study zhang et al 2019 μ denotes the arithmetic mean and σ denotes the standard deviation the mean of the residual errors can serve as the initial ewma value namely ewma0 ɛ the control limits will converge to μ l σ λ 2 λ as t increases we identify an observation value as an anomaly when the ewma value exceeds the ucl and lcl figs 9 and 10 show the results of the ewma control chart at the monitoring sites to evaluate the reliability we compare our results with those of other studies in the supplementary information text s1 a series of possible precursor signals were identified but meteorological factors and tectonic activity are likely to cause persistent anomalies in hydrological data woith 2015 however we inferred that weather cannot explain the anomalies for the following reasons 1 peng and liu 2014 showed that there were no annual precipitation anomalies from 1991 to 2001 2 the lstm model for wells xg ky and tc accounts for weather changes to some extent but anomalies are still identified based on the above analysis it is reasonable to attribute the anomalies to tectonic activity the greatest tectonic activity during these hydrological anomalies may be related to the mw 7 0 lijiang earthquake according to the global seismic earthquake catalog from the usgs we selected all earthquakes of mw 5 within 500 km of the monitoring sites during the validation and prediction periods to identify whether the hydrological anomalies were caused by the lijiang earthquake fig 10 located on the red river fault well xg showed a rapid decrease in water level of 0 13 m between 12 december 1995 and 3 february 1996 fig 5a and 6a during this period the mw 7 0 lijiang earthquake and a mw 5 1 distant earthquake occurred however the influence of the distant earthquake was excluded because there was no anomalous change in water level before and after the earthquake hence we considered that such a decrease might be related to the lijiang earthquake as shown in fig 10 similarly the increase in electrical conductivity between 24 march and 10 may 1995 could be related to the mw 6 4 event on 6 may 1995 for the second time a strong anomaly in electrical conductivity up to 76 started about 50 days prior to the lijiang earthquake in addition an anomalous variation in temperature was identified in spring df from 3 july to 11 november 1995 but no earthquakes occurred in this period thus we speculate that the large oscillation may not be attributable to earthquakes but was caused by other factors more data and further study are needed to fully understand this phenomenon between october 1995 and february 1996 the mw 6 2 wuding earthquake and mw 7 0 lijiang earthquake occurred successively near the ky tc and jc monitoring sites the primary anomalies in radon concentration at well tc were detected in september 1995 but the ewma values started to occur between the ucl and lcl about 10 days before the lijiang earthquake which indicates that the anomalies at well tc may be unrelated to it furthermore well ky is located at the intersection of the xiaojiang and qujiang faults and well jc located at the lijiang jianchuan fault is only 95 km from the epicenter of the lijiang earthquake their ewma values began to increase rapidly about 6 months before the event according to previous studies there was compressive stress in the region of well ky which could have increased during the pre seismic period of the lijiang earthquake zhao et al 1984 hu et al 2018 shen et al 2003 also discovered that the lijiang jianchuan fault continued to have increases in dip slip movement since june 1995 which is aligned with the time when the water level in well jc began to appear to have anomalies here we consider that the anomalous water level signals in the two wells may be attributed to the lijiang earthquake we also used this approach to detect possible precursor anomalies of the ninger earthquake to demonstrate that the method is effective supplementary information text s2 at the regional tectonic scale the lijiang earthquake was located at the northern part of the northwestern yunnan rift zone this is connected to the tectonics of the right lateral red river fault guo et al 1996 the cause of the earthquake precursors is a change in rock deformation from linear to non linear while micro fractures developed from few to many and from small to large in the regional stress field before rupture wang et al 2003 thus large scale anomalies appeared in southwestern china because of tectonic activities related to the pre seismic process qiang et al 1998 reported an area of higher satellite sensed thermal infrared brightness temperature increases along the lancangjiang and red river faults 52 days prior to the lijiang earthquake due to disruptions in the crustal stress field and gases such as co2 and ch4 were emitted aboveground during the pre seismic process guo and li 1997 showed that the southwest stress generated in the seismogenic zone may increase the compression of the region near spring cn which caused changes in permeability and electrical conductivity based on regional deformation jiang and li 2003 showed that there were deformation anomalies near the epicenter after august 1995 chen 2002 concluded that there were many stress gravity and hydrological anomalies before the lijiang earthquake in short it is possible that the stress changes near the epicenter were conducted along adjacent faults and sub blocks which caused a large number of anomalous phenomena during the pre seismic process of the lijiang earthquake 7 conclusions in this study possible precursors associated with the 1996 lijiang earthquake were detected using an lstm model and ewma control chart two lstm models one with three input variables previously observed values air temperature and precipitation and another with one input variable previously observed values were developed to simulate and forecast the hydrological variations at six monitoring sites to overcome the lack of auxiliary observations the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the results demonstrate that the lstm model is an effective tool for forecasting nonlinear hydrological time series and the lstm model with historical data is a reliable way to forecast hydrological variations if there is a lack of observation data 2 the lstm models imply that tectonic activity which is one of the factors influencing subsurface fluid might lead to low model performance our models also infer that the anomalies at six monitoring sites are unrelated to meteorological changes 3 based on previous studies and ewma control chart we further deduce that the anomalous behaviors at the four monitoring sites xg ky jc and cn can be attributed to changes in tectonic stress before the 1996 lijiang earthquake and spring df may have been disturbed by other factors from july to november 1995 this study provides a new tool for identifying possible precursor anomalies and overcoming data limitations in future

4448,historical data on underground fluid can be valuable for detecting potential hydrological precursors although different analysis methods have been employed nonlinear dynamic fluctuations and the lack of auxiliary observations makes hydrological precursors difficult to identify in this study we investigated hydrological time series of data from six monitoring sites to identify possible precursors to the lijiang earthquake two long short term memory lstm models were developed to simulate and forecast hydrological variations with and without the use of auxiliary data the results indicate that both models are useful and valid in forecasting short term hydrological variations the lstm model developed using only historical data can provide good accuracy and validity in simulating and forecasting short term hydrological variations when no auxiliary meteorological observations are available the results show that observations made during seismically inactive periods can be better modeled than those made during active periods furthermore the exponentially weighted moving average control chart was employed as a detector to identify anomalous signals the results show that there was a false precursor in the time series from the six monitoring points wells and springs hydrological anomalies at four of the wells occurred 1 6 months before the lijiang earthquake and can be attributed to changes in tectonic stress however the anomalies at one of the other wells may be unrelated to this earthquake an anomalous signal observed at a spring could not be related to earthquakes and may have been caused by other factors this study shows that lstm models are useful in detecting possible hydrological precursor anomalies keywords time series long short term memory lstm hydrological precursors anomaly detection 1 introduction earthquake prediction is one of the leading fields in the earth sciences and earthquake precursors are considered the key to solving such problems there is a long history of searching for possible precursors in various fields such as hydrology geochemistry and seismology cicerone et al 2009 among them hydrological precursors are one of the most intriguing and anticipated types as they have clear relations to crustal stress manga and wang 2015 precursors related to groundwater level temperature spring discharge and groundwater geochemical composition have been documented ingebritsen and manga 2014 roeloffs 1988 thomas 1988 one common feature is that most of these reported precursors have not been corrected for noise from factors such as atmospheric pressure earth tides rainfall and other possible environmental factors this is one of the most criticized points in the study of hydrological precursors roeloffs 1996 wang and manga 2010 generally it is necessary to make auxiliary observations that may help to remove the influence of non tectonic factors many hydrological monitoring sites were established decades ago or lack of weather observation no auxiliary observations are available as a result it is difficult to accurately identify precursor anomalies and a lot of precious data is left out due to the lack of auxiliary observations many previous studies have documented possible precursors using conventional techniques such as trend analysis the standard deviation method and the regression analysis method yan et al 2018 such methods are quite straightforward and useful in identifying the large magnitudes of anomalous changes however many hydrological systems contain records of tectonic and non tectonic activities and show nonlinear dynamic fluctuations which makes it difficult to identify hydrological precursors by conventional statistical methods thus a new technique is needed to re examine these valuable historical data from a modern perspective data mining methods such as the decision tree method zmazek et al 2003 and artificial neural network method ann ostad ali askari et al 2016 torkar et al 2010 have been proposed for detecting possible precursor anomalies in radon gas time series but the decision tree is easy to overfit hilbert huang transform hht has been used in detecting anomalous signals in water level data chen et al 2010 however the hht method can only detect transient anomalies while the data mining method requires auxiliary data and does not consider the memory of hydrological systems in this study we employed the long short term memory algorithm lstm to detect possible hydrological anomalies recorded before the 1996 lijiang earthquake this method is widely used in deep learning and is suitable for long term time series analysis the study objectives were as follows 1 evaluating the performance of the lstm models in simulating the nonlinear changes of hydrological time series 2 study how to simulate and forecast the short term variation of hydrological time series to overcome the limitation of auxiliary observations 3 applying the lstm model to detect and identify hydrological anomalies this study shows that the lstm model can detect the possible hydrological precursors in short term by the historical data thus such method is useful in the identification of precursors especially in areas that lack of auxiliary observations to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to employ this method for detecting precursor anomalies in hydrological time series 2 geological and seismic setting the study area was located in yunnan and sichuan provinces in southwest china which is one of the most seismically active areas in china as it the location of the collision of the indian and eurasian plates it has a very complex geological structure with several major faults the northeast trending left lateral xianshuihe xiaojiang fault and the northwest trending red river fault one important fault zone the red river fault zone runs through the entire region from northwest to southeast and divides yunnan province into two parts northeastern and southwestern these two parts interact with each other under the action of the crustal plates causing tectonic stresses to be continuously accumulated and released through frequent earthquakes chen 2002 seismic activities in the study area have the characteristics of high frequency large magnitude and extensive distribution according to the earthquake catalog provided by the global seismic earthquake catalog from the usgs more than 289 earthquakes of magnitude 5 have occurred in the 20th century in yunnan province among them 13 earthquakes of m 7 have occurred in this area in yunnan province the western part of the lancangjiang fault f2 belongs to the tengchong baoshan block most of the area is widely covered by paleozoic early mesozoic sedimentary rocks and granites dong 2016 between the east of the lancangjiang fault f2 and the west of jinshajiang red river faults f1 and f3 most of the region belongs to the tethys stratigraphic region where the pre cambrian base is not exposed due to being covered by jurassic and cretaceous red sandstones wang 2017 the yangtze stratigraphic region located to the east of the jinshajiang and red river faults has many developed fold structures it is mainly covered by metamorphic volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks jiang 2016 based on the lithological units the aquifers can be divided into quaternary unconsolidated sediment aquifers fissured aquifers and karst aquifers in addition karst aquifers are dominated by devonian permian and triassic carbonates xia et al 2006 to the west of the longmenshan fault f8 in sichuan province triassic clastic rocks sandstones and limestones are the most extensive stratigraphic units the most famous geological structure in the east is the sichuan basin where aquifers can be divided into porous bedrock fissured and karst aquifers cui 2014 pore water is stored in loose quaternary deposits bedrock fissured aquifers exist in the sandstone and mudstone of the jurassic and cretaceous systems which are generally distributed along the structure karst water is generally buried deep in the basin and is stored in the limestone and dolomite of the permian and triassic system an earthquake of magnitude 7 0 100 2 e 27 3 n struck lijiang county of yunnan province on february 3 1996 and was the largest normal faulting event to occur along the western boundary of the sichuan yunnan block in the last 40 years ji et al 2017 it ruptured tens of kilometers of rupture zone and caused disastrous damage han et al 2004 the earthquake occurred in the triangular block composed of the zhongdian jianchuan zhongdian yongsheng and lijiang jiangchuan faults chen 2002 su et al 2004 showed that the lijiang jiangchuan and zhongdian yongsheng faults caused nearly east west stretching and normal dip slip of the yulong snow mountain fault triggering a large earthquake fig 1 in the precursor identification process it is a crucial step to choose monitoring sites located in possible precursor anomalous areas here we use the method proposed by dobrovolsky et al 1979 to estimate the possible region where precursors will be detectable the equation used to determine the largest anomalous area is as follows 1 d ε 10 0 433 m 2 73 ε 3 m 5 where dɛ km is the greatest distance that the precursors appeared m mw is earthquake magnitude and ɛ is strain deformation we used ɛ 10 8 as the lower limit to distinguish an earthquake strain and the strain loading by earth tides yan 2018 so dɛ was approximately 928 km moreover the anomalous radius can be further verified by the empirical relationship wang and manga 2010 2 log r 0 48 m 0 33 log e 1 4 where r km is the epicentral distance and e is the seismic energy density j m3 we assume that the precursor response is highly related to the co seismic response zhang et al 2020b and there are co seismic responses of the hydrogeologic system to earthquakes if e 0 01 j m3 according to the published global catalog of seismic energy density and hydrological responses wang and manga 2010 as a result the maximum value of r is 417 km hence four wells and two springs located in and near anomalous areas were selected to study possible hydrological precursors see fig 1 three wells xg ky tc had meteorological data available air temperature and precipitation while others only monitored subsurface fluid data all observational data were recorded daily detailed information on the wells is shown in table 1 3 method 3 1 partial autocorrelation function the partial autocorrelation function pacf is an effective tool for exploring the correlation between xt k and xt after eliminating the interference of variable xt 1 xt 2 xt k 1 shumway and stoffer 2011 it is generally used to identify the order of an autoregressive process and the number of input vectors and has been successfully employed in many machine learning and forecasting models chang et al 2015 in this study we used the pacf to explore the possible relationship between observations made at time t and at a previous time and selected input parameters for a neural network yule walker equations and cramer rules are usually used to calculate the pacf as follows tinungki 2019 3 kk d k d 4 d 1 ρ 1 ρ k 1 ρ 1 1 ρ k 2 ρ k 1 ρ k 2 1 5 d k 1 ρ 1 ρ 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 2 ρ k 1 ρ k 2 ρ k 6 ρ k t 1 n k x t x t x t k x t t 1 n x t x t 2 where kk and ρ k are partial autocorrelation and autocorrelation coefficients with lag k of the sequence respectively and x t t 1 n x t n is the mean sample 3 2 wavelet coherence wavelet transforms are generally used to analyze denoise and compress signals and images as a part of data processing and analysis they include the continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt it can decompose a time series into the time frequency space with multi time resolution its advantage is the ability to obtain information on the time location and frequency of a signal wavelet coherence wtc a cwt method is a powerful tool for identifying possible relationships between two time series in the frequency space by a large common power and also reveals the lag relationship between two time series yan 2018 in this paper we use it to study the possible interference factors affecting variation in the monitoring data the monte carlo method was selected to estimate the statistical significance level of wtc allen and smith 1996 the cone of influence coi was used to evaluate the edge artifacts caused by discontinuities at the endpoint ng and chan 2012 when two signals are analyzed in time frequency space the wtc is defined as follows grinsted et al 2004 7 r 2 x y s s 1 w x y 2 s s 1 w x s s 1 w y where w is the continuous wavelet transform when it has one argument and the cross wavelet transform when it has two x and y are two time series s denotes a smoothing operator and s represents the wavelet scale in addition global coherence gc was introduced as time averaged wavelet coherence coefficients torrence and compo 1998 8 r 2 s 1 n τ 1 n r 2 s τ where τ is the location parameter in the time domain and n is the number of points in the time series 3 3 long short term memory neural network the long short term memory lstm neural network proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn it is a useful technique for capturing the nonlinear relationships between predictor and target variables it was developed to overcome the inherent problems of traditional rnns i e vanishing and exploding gradients thus lstm networks are suitable for processing and forecasting nonlinear time varying series with relatively long intervals and delays similar to a typical rnn network an lstm network is composed of three layers input hidden and output fig 2 a the hidden layer is also called the lstm layer with memory blocks and one of its cells contains a forget gate f t an input gate i t and an output gate o t to explain how the lstm network works its internal operation is illustrated in fig 2b an lstm has the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural networks and passes through the following three steps or gates to obtain the predicted values 1 forget gate the forget gate decides what information is going to be ignored from the previous cell state it is capable of reading the previous hidden state ht 1 and the current input xt the forget gate is calculated by the following equation 9 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where σ denotes a logistic sigmoidal function that outputs a number between zero and one for each number in the cell state ct 1 a value of one means that all the information is kept while a value of zero means it is all removed wf is the network matric of the forget gate and bf is a bias vector 2 input gate the input gate decides what new information is to be updated and stored in the cell state it has two synchronous processes 1 a tanh layer computes a potential update vector c t from the current input and the last hidden state 2 a sigmoid layer defines what information is used to update the cell state in the current time step then the cell state ct is updated with the above process completed the specific mathematical equations are as follows 10 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 11 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 12 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent w represents the weight matric b represents a bias vector and subscripts c and i define the tanh layer and input gate respectively 3 output gate the output gate controls what information is going to be output subsequently the new hidden layer ht is determined by the output gate and the cell state at the last time step 13 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 14 h t o t tanh c t where wo and bo represent the weight matric and bias vector of the output gate respectively 4 data analysis 4 1 data preprocessing in order to reveal any possible precursors of the lijiang earthquake hydrogeological and nearby meteorological data were collected from several wells and analyzed including data on groundwater levels radon concentration ion components electrical conductivity precipitation and temperature the lengths of the datasets were not the same due to the different establishment times of the monitoring sites and large gaps due to missing data table 2 the collected data time series were at least 764 days and at most 2226 days in length and data gaps 4 days were filled by cubic spline interpolation the interpolation process was conducted using the fillmissing and spline functions in matlab software version 2019 moreover it was difficult to obtain local weather data for ky so we used data from honghe about 34 km away for more accurate identification of precursor anomalies the time series was split into two parts seismically active sa and seismically inactive periods non sa zmazek et al 2003 the sa periods may have had seismic activities or precursory anomalies zhang et al 2020b and zmazek et al 2003 showed that the discrepancy between measured values and those predicted by machine learning is high if seismic activity has an impact on monitoring data accordingly a critical problem is to find a suitable rule for choosing the time interval between non sa and sa periods hereby an empirical formula was used to determine the interval as follows biagi et al 2000 15 log r t 0 63 m 0 15 where r km refers to the epicentral distance t days is the time interval between a possible anomaly and the subsequent earthquake m is earthquake magnitude and log represents a logarithm base 10 then the time series are divided into an sa period from t days before the earthquake to the moment of the earthquake and the rest of the data are a non sa period the earliest time of the possible precursor anomalies is shown in table 2 4 2 model development hydrological forecasting models generally use multiple variables as input features for a neural network however many studies have shown that it is feasible to train a neural network using past observed data if there are no auxiliary observations zhou et al 2017 sahoo et al 2019 in china there is a lack of auxiliary observations for many hydrological monitoring sites that were established early as a result many precious data can only be used for simple statistical analyses and anomaly identification therefore we developed lstm models in two ways to deal with time series forecasting in our study 1 using driving factors such as precipitation and air temperature and the previous hydrological time series and 2 only using the previous hydrological time series to overcome data limitations while there are no fixed proportions of the datasets used for model training and validation it is believed that the training set should comprise 50 of the total time series while the validation set should typically be 10 40 barzegar et al 2019 to ensure that the lstm could better detect possible precursor anomalies the training and validation sets did not contain data related to earthquakes based on the non sa period and previous studies zhang and fu 2000 chen 2002 therefore each dataset was divided into three sets i a training set 50 ii validation set 20 and iii prediction set 30 which also ensured that the sa period was within the interval of the prediction set table 2 the lstm model was trained from scratch using hyperparameters including the numbers of neurons and layers and the optimization and learning rates the adam optimization function which is the most commonly used function was selected ostad ali askari et al 2017 an et al 2020 subsequently we constructed the lstm model using one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was identified using a trial and error procedure by varying the number of hidden neurons from 1 to 5 with a fixed lag dependent on pacf sahoo et al 2019 for this study the learning rate was initially 0 01 and was then multiplied by a drop factor 0 1 every 2000 iterations to overcome sub optimal results or divergence the number of iteration steps in our case was defined as 6000 for efficient learning the min max normalization approach was used to scale the range of input variables to 0 1 before the training process 16 x norm x x min x max x min where x is the data and x norm x min and x max are the normalized value minimum value and maximum value respectively to obtain the final prediction the output of the network is retransformed using the normalization parameters from the training set we summarized the following key points so that other researchers can conduct similar studies in other regions 1 training set should be within 50 of the total time series and includes at least one year or hydrological year 2 methods such as pacf and wavelet analysis should be used to ensure that there is a correlation between input variables and output variables 3 to ensure that lstm could better detect possible precursor anomalies the training and validation sets do not contain data related to earthquakes based on the non sa period and previous studies 4 the lstm neural network has huge advantages over conventional neural networks and methods in dealing with nonlinear problems but it may be difficult to obtain satisfactory results for strong nonlinear time series liu et al 2019 thus if the hydrological time series is strongly nonlinear singular spectrum analysis ssa and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd can be used to decompose the sequence in the preprocessing steps the detailed process can refer to the research of an et al 2020 4 3 model performance criteria three conventional metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the developed models including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mape and the coefficient of determination r which are defined as follows 17 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 18 mape 1 n i 1 n x i x i x i 100 19 r i 1 n x i x x i x i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where xi is the observed data xi is the predicted data n is the length of the validation set and horizontal lines above a variable indicate an average value the rmse reflects the degree of standard deviation between the simulated and observed values mape is an efficient approach to measuring the accuracy of a hydrological model as a percentage and is primarily used to evaluate data anomalies for rmse and mape a value close to 0 indicates that the predictive ability of the model is satisfactory the r value reflects the linear correlation between the observations and validations and ranges from 0 no fit to 1 perfect fit 5 results 5 1 wavelet coherence wtc results selecting appropriate input variables for an lstm model is a very important step because it provides basic information about the learning system thus wtcs were employed to determine the relationships between hydrological data and potential influencing factors precipitation and air temperature for xg and ky there was a high correlation 0 8 between precipitation temperature and hydrological observations within the band between 264 and 396 days as shown in fig 3 a d although there was a slightly weaker coherence between radon concentration and temperature during the interval 16 april 1994 10 february 1995 radon concentration had strong coherence with meteorological data throughout the whole observation period in tc fig 3e and f in short hydrological and meteorological data had high correlation within the 1 year band accordingly meteorological factors can be used as one of the input variables of the neural network 5 2 partial auto correlation function results the partial autocorrelation function pacf is a typical approach to determining the number of parameters required for hydrological and water resources modeling chang et al 2015 fig 4 plots the pacf of the daily data with 95 confidence bounds blue solid line which shows that the 0th order partial autocorrelation coefficients are constant at one except for the water level at well jc the partial autocorrelation coefficients fluctuate slightly up and down on the 0 axis with increases in lag which implies that most of the time series has a stationary signal and the water level at well jc exhibits a nonstationary process for the situation of using the previous hydrological data h the historical time series h t 1 h t 2 h t p was employed to predict h t with p being the time lag the pacf showed a significant correlation with up to three days of lag time for water levels at well xg and thereafter fell within the confidence band hence p is equivalent to 3 for water levels at well xg similarly we chose p to equal 4 6 7 and 7 for monitoring data at stations ky cn df and tc respectively the correlation pattern indicates that a strong correlation exists among hydrological observations on consecutive days which indicates that forecasting time series using previous data is feasible for the case using previous hydrological and meteorological data as input variables the correlation between them was determined before training to correspond to the hydrological time series of wells xg ky and tc the input variables of precipitation p and temperature t were as follows p t 1 p t 2 p t p and t t 1 t t 2 t t p the value of p is consistent with the previous hydrological data h as a result we input the previous hydrological and meteorological data to train and validate the models of wells xg ky and tc 5 3 lstm model results and assessment based on the results of wtc and pacf lstm models were developed for two input situations 1 driving factors and the previous hydrological time series and 2 the previous hydrological time series situation 1 the predicted hydrological time series of wells xg ky and tc were constructed and compared with field observed data as shown in fig 5 the maximum rmse in the validation process was 1 which implies that the lstm models have appropriate simulation capacity the validation performances have excellent validity for hydrological forecasting with mape values approaching 0 suggesting satisfactory quality table 3 the coefficient of determination r ranges from 0 85 to 0 99 for the validation set in this study indicating that the predicted values closely match the observed values the above results indicate that the lstm model with three driving factors can be used for simulating and predicting hydrological variation situation 2 with the input variable being the time series of the previous hydrological dataset the performance of the lstm models in forecasting one day ahead hydrological variations was summarized table 4 as shown in fig 6 the lstm model shows appropriate simulation capacity and excellent validity for hydrological forecasting at wells xg ky and tc because the rmse values are 1 the mape values approach 0 and the r values approach 1 for the validation set based on the above results the lstm models perform well with the validation dataset using the previous hydrological data as the input variable implying that the lstm model with a single input is also a reliable way to forecast hydrological variations it is notable that the performances of the prediction set are inferior to those of the validation set as shown in fig 6 the predicted values deviate from the observed time series over a period of time although there are similar trends comparing the performances during the validation and prediction periods tables 3 and 4 also illustrate that the performances during the prediction period using the hydrological time series are relatively poor the mape values are up to 60 fold greater the rmse values are 1 4 times greater and most r values decrease slightly these results show that the prediction during sa is significantly worse than that during non sa periods the scatter plot of the observation vs simulation of validation and prediction of the lstm models as displayed in figs 7 and 8 reinforces the above conclusions that the lstm model has validity and reliability in simulating hydrological variation and the observations during seismically inactive periods can be better modeled than those during active periods an et al 2020 and meng et al 2019 showed that irregular oscillations and anomalous behaviors due to interference from tectonic activity can cause poor performance hence we assume that the poor prediction performances may be attributed to tectonic activity 6 discussion as seen in the previous section the good performances of the validation set in two ways show that lstm models can be used to describe short term variation in hydrological data however the poor performance with the prediction set indicates that there is interference with underground fluid in this study the exponentially weighted moving average ewma control chart was employed to detect anomalies and identify their start and end times we define the difference between the simulated and observed values as the residual error ɛt during the validation and prediction periods the ewma control chart consists of upper and lower control limits ucl and lcl respectively eqs 17 and 18 17 ewm a t λ ε t 1 λ e w m a t 1 18 u c l t l c l t μ l σ λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 2 t where the value of λ is a constant in the interval between 0 and 1 which is set as 0 15 because a lower λ can make the control chart more flexible and effective zhang et al 2020a l represents the width of the control limits which is set as 3 in this study zhang et al 2019 μ denotes the arithmetic mean and σ denotes the standard deviation the mean of the residual errors can serve as the initial ewma value namely ewma0 ɛ the control limits will converge to μ l σ λ 2 λ as t increases we identify an observation value as an anomaly when the ewma value exceeds the ucl and lcl figs 9 and 10 show the results of the ewma control chart at the monitoring sites to evaluate the reliability we compare our results with those of other studies in the supplementary information text s1 a series of possible precursor signals were identified but meteorological factors and tectonic activity are likely to cause persistent anomalies in hydrological data woith 2015 however we inferred that weather cannot explain the anomalies for the following reasons 1 peng and liu 2014 showed that there were no annual precipitation anomalies from 1991 to 2001 2 the lstm model for wells xg ky and tc accounts for weather changes to some extent but anomalies are still identified based on the above analysis it is reasonable to attribute the anomalies to tectonic activity the greatest tectonic activity during these hydrological anomalies may be related to the mw 7 0 lijiang earthquake according to the global seismic earthquake catalog from the usgs we selected all earthquakes of mw 5 within 500 km of the monitoring sites during the validation and prediction periods to identify whether the hydrological anomalies were caused by the lijiang earthquake fig 10 located on the red river fault well xg showed a rapid decrease in water level of 0 13 m between 12 december 1995 and 3 february 1996 fig 5a and 6a during this period the mw 7 0 lijiang earthquake and a mw 5 1 distant earthquake occurred however the influence of the distant earthquake was excluded because there was no anomalous change in water level before and after the earthquake hence we considered that such a decrease might be related to the lijiang earthquake as shown in fig 10 similarly the increase in electrical conductivity between 24 march and 10 may 1995 could be related to the mw 6 4 event on 6 may 1995 for the second time a strong anomaly in electrical conductivity up to 76 started about 50 days prior to the lijiang earthquake in addition an anomalous variation in temperature was identified in spring df from 3 july to 11 november 1995 but no earthquakes occurred in this period thus we speculate that the large oscillation may not be attributable to earthquakes but was caused by other factors more data and further study are needed to fully understand this phenomenon between october 1995 and february 1996 the mw 6 2 wuding earthquake and mw 7 0 lijiang earthquake occurred successively near the ky tc and jc monitoring sites the primary anomalies in radon concentration at well tc were detected in september 1995 but the ewma values started to occur between the ucl and lcl about 10 days before the lijiang earthquake which indicates that the anomalies at well tc may be unrelated to it furthermore well ky is located at the intersection of the xiaojiang and qujiang faults and well jc located at the lijiang jianchuan fault is only 95 km from the epicenter of the lijiang earthquake their ewma values began to increase rapidly about 6 months before the event according to previous studies there was compressive stress in the region of well ky which could have increased during the pre seismic period of the lijiang earthquake zhao et al 1984 hu et al 2018 shen et al 2003 also discovered that the lijiang jianchuan fault continued to have increases in dip slip movement since june 1995 which is aligned with the time when the water level in well jc began to appear to have anomalies here we consider that the anomalous water level signals in the two wells may be attributed to the lijiang earthquake we also used this approach to detect possible precursor anomalies of the ninger earthquake to demonstrate that the method is effective supplementary information text s2 at the regional tectonic scale the lijiang earthquake was located at the northern part of the northwestern yunnan rift zone this is connected to the tectonics of the right lateral red river fault guo et al 1996 the cause of the earthquake precursors is a change in rock deformation from linear to non linear while micro fractures developed from few to many and from small to large in the regional stress field before rupture wang et al 2003 thus large scale anomalies appeared in southwestern china because of tectonic activities related to the pre seismic process qiang et al 1998 reported an area of higher satellite sensed thermal infrared brightness temperature increases along the lancangjiang and red river faults 52 days prior to the lijiang earthquake due to disruptions in the crustal stress field and gases such as co2 and ch4 were emitted aboveground during the pre seismic process guo and li 1997 showed that the southwest stress generated in the seismogenic zone may increase the compression of the region near spring cn which caused changes in permeability and electrical conductivity based on regional deformation jiang and li 2003 showed that there were deformation anomalies near the epicenter after august 1995 chen 2002 concluded that there were many stress gravity and hydrological anomalies before the lijiang earthquake in short it is possible that the stress changes near the epicenter were conducted along adjacent faults and sub blocks which caused a large number of anomalous phenomena during the pre seismic process of the lijiang earthquake 7 conclusions in this study possible precursors associated with the 1996 lijiang earthquake were detected using an lstm model and ewma control chart two lstm models one with three input variables previously observed values air temperature and precipitation and another with one input variable previously observed values were developed to simulate and forecast the hydrological variations at six monitoring sites to overcome the lack of auxiliary observations the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the results demonstrate that the lstm model is an effective tool for forecasting nonlinear hydrological time series and the lstm model with historical data is a reliable way to forecast hydrological variations if there is a lack of observation data 2 the lstm models imply that tectonic activity which is one of the factors influencing subsurface fluid might lead to low model performance our models also infer that the anomalies at six monitoring sites are unrelated to meteorological changes 3 based on previous studies and ewma control chart we further deduce that the anomalous behaviors at the four monitoring sites xg ky jc and cn can be attributed to changes in tectonic stress before the 1996 lijiang earthquake and spring df may have been disturbed by other factors from july to november 1995 this study provides a new tool for identifying possible precursor anomalies and overcoming data limitations in future

4449,during a 6 week period in november and december 2015 a series of atlantic storms swept across the republic of ireland roi causing widespread pluvial and fluvial flooding flooding was particularly severe in the west and midlands with rainfall up to 200 above normal in many regions making it the wettest winter ever recorded while the infrastructural damage and subsequent costs associated with flood events have and continue to receive widespread attention far less coverage is given to the associated adverse human health effects this is particularly significant in the roi which is characterised by the highest crude incidence rates of verotoxigenic e coli vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis in europe accordingly weekly spatially referenced infection incidence from july 2015 to june 2016 were employed in concurrence with weekly time series of cumulative antecedent rainfall surface water discharge and groundwater level and high resolution flood risk mapping an ensemble of statistical and time series analyses were used to quantify the influence of flood hydrometeorology on the incidence of confirmed infections seasonal decomposition excluding seasonal patterns and long term trends identified a high residual infection peak during april 2016 with space timing scanning used to identify the location size and temporal extent of clustering excess cases of vtec enteritis were geographically associated with the midlands while cryptosporidiosis clusters were widespread generalised linear modelling of infection locations show that areas with a surface water body exhibited significantly higher incidence rates for both vtec or 1 225 p 0 001 and cryptosporidiosis or 1 363 p 0 001 arima models show a clear association between rainfall surface water discharge groundwater levels and infection incidence with lagged associations from 16 to 20 weeks particularly strong thus indicating a link between infection peaks april 2016 and the flood event which began approximately 18 weeks earlier all three hydrometeorological variables were associated with the increase in cryptosporidiosis during april 2016 while only surface water discharge was associated with

relationship between the winter flood event of 2015 16 and the incidence of confirmed vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis in ireland via a retrospective ecological study comprising an ensemble of geo statistical techniques it is important to note that while several boil water notices were issued during the flood period affecting approximately 23 000 people due to specific concerns around drinking water quality and its potential impact on public health national directorate for fire and emergency management 2016 no significant confirmed outbreaks of waterborne infection were officially reported to the irish health service executive hse during or immediately after the event 2 methods 2 1 the 2015 2016 flood event in the republic of ireland 2 1 1 meteorological characterisation winter 2015 16

country and exceeding 300 in southern regions likewise both january and february 2016 were particularly wet being ranked as the 9th wettest january and february recorded in the roi 2 1 2 hydrological characterisation three primary flood periods have been identified during the period 12th november 2015 to 5th january 2016 corresponding with the occurrence of the three main storm events fig 2 flood

by the national cidr peer review committee cidr is an information system developed to manage surveillance of infectious diseases in ireland using standard case definitions for all notifiable diseases as per the infectious diseases amendment regulations 2020 s i no 53 of 2020 datasets comprised all confirmed cases of sporadic i e non outbreak verotoxigenic e coli vtec enteritis reported by regional departments of public health between 1st january 2013 and 31st december 2017 vtec cases prior to january 2013 were not used due to geographically divergent testing and reporting protocols the cryptosporidiosis dataset included all confirmed cases notified from 1st january 2008 to 31st december 2017 cases occurring prior to january 2008 were not integrated due to a significant outbreak which took place in april 2007 thus representing a likely source of bias specific genotyping information for samples from cryptosporidiosis cases was not available and therefore not included for the current analyses all individual case notifications for both infections were geographically linked to the centroid of a central statistics office cso small area sa the smallest administrative delineation currently employed in the republic of ireland for national census reporting 2011 n 18 488 two main periods were identified for the current study the non flood period corresponding to the total duration of both infection datasets 2013 2018 for vtec 2 755 cases and 2008 2017 for cryptosporidiosis 4 509 cases the flood period corresponding to the period between 1st july 2015 and 1st july 2016 this timeframe was selected to comprise a complete hydrological year and delineated by the maximum life expectancy of the longest lived pathogen cryptosporidium spp case numbers of vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis occurring during the flood period were 577 and 607 respectively figs 3 and 4 2 3 spatiotemporal analysis of vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis 2 3 1 seasonal decomposition seasonal decomposition of confirmed cases of infection were undertaken at both weekly and monthly resolutions using seasonal trend decomposition stl with the loess locally estimated scatterplot smoothing method to decompose the incidence rate of infection yv into seasonal variation sv overall trend over time tv and residuals rv an additive stl model was employed due to the relatively consistent annual trend associated with both infections over time for the purposes of the current study i e examining a specific event and time period particular focus was given to the residual series of both infections i e seasonal signal extraction weekly decompositions were undertaken using the forecast package in r studio v 4 0 on total datasets for both infections 2013 2018 for vtec 2008 2018 for cryptosporidiosis and extracted for the flood period from july 2015 to july 2016 2 3 2 space time scanning space time scanning was carried out on the entire study period i e non flood period and extracted for the flood period to detect temporally specific clusters of infection defined by significantly higher numbers of observed cases than expected within specified temporal and spatial windows analyses are based on the null hypothesis that cases are randomly distributed over space and time with scanning conducted at sa scale using satscan v9 6 kulldorf and information management services inc ma usa kulldorff 1999 based on previous optimisation for the roi boudou et al 2020 a discrete poisson model was selected considering the high spatial resolution i e 18 488 sas and likely low case numbers per sa similarly a maximum of 10 of the population at risk par was employed with a maximum cluster radius of 50 km a minimum threshold of 10 cases was employed to ensure that only significant infection clusters were identified i e avoid small household clusters data were aggregated at the monthly scale with a maximum cluster duration of 3 months thus accounting for seasonal trends of infection 2 4 generalised linear modelling generalised linear modelling was used to assess the link between dichotomised presence absence spatially specific sa level occurrence of infection and mapped

imported to arcgis 10 7 with sa centroids used to geographically attribute anonymised spatially referenced case data resulting in an anonymised dataset of confirmed infections linked to geographically explicit flood risk flood extent and surface water attributes generalised linear modelling with a binary link function was applied to calculate probabilistic odds ratios or analyses were performed using r studio v 4 0 for flood and non flood periods 2 5 hydrometeorological indicators time series analyses were undertaken using three hydrometeorological variables extracted from the shannon river basin cumulative rainfall river discharge surface water and groundwater level the shannon river basin was selected as a representative area due to its central location and geographical significance 15 695 km2 covering approximately 22 of the country the river basin was significantly affected by flooding during the 2015 2016 event national directorate for fire and emergency management 2016 and is considered a hotspot for both vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis boudou et al 2020 a distinction was made between the lower and upper shannon sub basins to allow for spatial hydrodynamic variation supplementary materials for each sub basin hydrometeorological data were extracted as follows daily cumulative rainfall from met éireann synoptic stations daily mean discharge cubic metres per second from opw gauging stations daily groundwater level meters from the environment protection agency epa of ireland the groundwater levels extracted from the epa stations were rescaled 0 10 to ensure homogeneity measurement station gauge selection was undertaken based on dataset length and completeness proximity of discharge and groundwater gauging stations to appropriately capture hydrodynamic patterns i e interactions synoptic stations were selected via k nearest neighbour to gauging stations surface water and groundwater two synoptic stations were used for the lower catchment the discharge station being closer to the gurteen station co tipperary while the groundwater station is closer to the mullingar station co westmeath the mean between these two stations was used to characterize rainfall in the lower catchment 2 6 time series analyses based on weekly time series fig 5 time series analyses were conducted to identify lagged association s between antecedent hydrometeorology and infection incidence analyses were carried out on the summed trend and residuals of both vtec and cryptosporidiosis obtained from seasonal decomposition section 2 4 as the primary objective was to identify and elucidate atypical infection excess national infection data were used based on the hypothesis that hydrometeorological means recorded within the shannon catchment can be used as indicators for country wide infection incidence a range of 1 to 24 weeks was employed to assess minimum and maximum lags periods according to the maximum environmental survival of both pathogens estimated to be up to 24 weeks in a 15 c environment for cryptosporidium spp alum et al 2014 arima modelling was used to assess the weight of weekly lagged hydrometeorological time series on infection incidence during the flood period via back casting differencing order 1 was performed on all time series to ensure stationarity similarly environmental time series were seasonally adjusted the final order parameters used for analysis p d q were arima 0 1 1 obtained via optimisation diagnostics repeated iterations were performed on infection time series trend and residuals from july 2015 to july 2016 using stepped lags from 1 to 24 weeks of the three environmental time series for both lower and upper shannon sub basins the ljung box test a statistical test used for examining time series autocorrelation was used to indicate significance between hydrometeorological parameters and infection with p 0 05 used to confirm the magnitude of autocorrelation 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of infection during 2015 2016 3 1 1 seasonal decomposition seasonal decomposition identified specific seasonal patterns for both infections fig 6 vtec infection exhibits high incidence during mid late summer peaking in july with a secondary peak in september while cryptosporidiosis is highest during spring march to may peaking in april both infections displayed a general cumulative trend increase over their respective study periods notably both infections exhibited a marked residual i e seasonal trend excluded peak during april 2016 accounting for 23 observed residual cases for vtec and 57 observed residual cases for cryptosporidiosis other secondary residual peaks were identified particularly during june july 2016 for vtec enteritis 3 1 2 space time scanning space time scanning of vtec cases identified three significant rr 1 p 0 05 clusters 83 cases in total during the flood period all of which intersected 25 35 with the shannon catchment area the two largest clusters 40 and 29 cases were identified east and south west of limerick city respectively and occurred between april and june 2016 fig 7 a third cluster was observed further north co cavan during september 2015 14 cases eight significant space time clusters of cryptosporidiosis were identified during the flood period accounting for 238 cases fig 7 the spatial distribution of these clusters was relatively widespread across the country with 4 clusters intersecting the shannon basin the temporal distribution of clusters were from march to may 2016 for clusters 1 2 3 and 7 south midlands and south and from april to june 2016 for clusters 4 5 6 and 8 north midlands and north 3 2 flood exposure and infection a significant association was found between the spatial extent of the 2015 2016 flood event and the occurrence of infection during both study periods during the non flood period approximately 39 of vtec cases or 1 487 p 0 001 and 44 of cryptosporidiosis cases or 1 792 p 0 001 occurred within the spatial boundary of the 2015 2016 flood extent tables 1 2 and 3 similarly during the flood period the sa units situated within the flood extent were more likely to report 1 case of vtec 40 of total cases or 1 355 p 0 001 or cryptosporidiosis 40 of total cases or 1 574 p 0 001 table 3 analyses indicate that both infections occur significantly more frequently within areas prone to the risk of fluvial flooding for example from 2008 to 2018 a case of cryptosporidiosis was approximately 13 p 0 001 more likely to occur in an sa characterized by a high probability of fluvial flooding 10 year flood return period table 3 similarly during the flood period vtec enteritis occurred more frequently within areas classified under the medium fluvial risk scenario 100 year flood return period or 1 094 p 0 025 table 3 results show no association between coastal surge flood risk areas and the incidence of either infection p 0 05 table 2 for the non flood period while a significant negative association was found with cryptosporidiosis during the flood period table 3 a strong statistical relationship was found between infection incidence and the presence of a surface water body lake or river 25 4 of vtec cases or 1 225 p 0 001 and 30 9 of cryptosporidiosis cases or 1 739 p 0 001 occurred within sas comprising a surface water body during the non flood period tables 1 2 3 a similarly significant association albeit slightly weaker was observed for the flood period vtec cases 24 8 or 1 225 p 0 001 cryptosporidiosis cases 29 3 or 1 363 p 0 001 tables 2 3 3 3 flood hydrometeorology results of optimised arima models for vtec enteritis indicate relatively similar responses between both sub basins highlighting two significant primary associational periods i e lags ljung box p value 0 05 from weeks 12 to 14 and 17 to 19 in red respectively fig 8 higher levels of association were observed in the lower shannon basin with maximum p values calculated for surface water discharge significantly higher than those obtained for rainfall and groundwater level within both sub basins maximum associations found for each variable were rainfall week 12 p 0 062 upper shannon and week 13 p value 0 071 lower shannon surface water week 18 p 0 072 upper shannon and week 19 p 0 105 lower shannon groundwater level week 12 p 0 061 upper shannon p 0 06 lower shannon likewise two specific periods of association were found between antecedent hydrometeorological variables and the occurrence of excess cryptosporidiosis cases namely from weeks 8 to 10 and weeks 16 to 21 fig 9 levels of association were higher in the upper shannon max p value 0 577 than the lower shannon max p value 0 371 and significantly higher than those found for vtec enteritis the best fit weekly lags found by calculating the p values of ljung box tests appear identical between both sub basins as follows rainfall week 19 p 0 274 lower shannon p 0 522 upper shannon surface water week 18 p 0 371 lower shannon p 0 577 upper shannon groundwater level week 18 p 0 395 lower shannon p 0 424 upper shannon 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal distribution of vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis seasonal decomposition of both infections provided strong evidence of two atypical peaks i e residual infections during april 2016 followed by a secondary peak during june july 2016 among vtec infections only vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis are characterized by two differing seasonal patterns in ireland both accurately captured by the seasonal variations from fig 5 human cases of cryptosporidiosis typically peak during late spring march to may temporally concurring with agricultural cycles e g calving and lambing seasons manure spreading callaghan et al 2009 cacciò and chalmers 2016 a secondary peak is observed in september reflective of national and international travel and children returning to school pollock et al 2009 conversely the highest incidence rates of vtec annually occur during late summer and early autumn due to irish dietary patterns increased consumption of meat products livestock grazing and international travel lal et al 2012 óhaiseadha et al 2017 accordingly the atypical timing of the identified excess vtec peak in concurrence with the residual synchronicity between both infections represents a strong indicator of an impacting external factor such as a relatively large spatially diffuse outbreak overlooked by standard surveillance measures or a temporally specific societal or environmental event reingold 1998 an investigation of social and traditional media leads the authors to hypothesise that the winter 2015 16 flooding event was the likely source of these synchronous residuals which were not observed at any other point within the total 5 10 year dataset space time scanning identified 10 spatiotemporally distinct clusters that temporally overlapped april 2016 with the occurrence of an overlooked infection cluster or outbreak adjudged extremely unlikely the spatial distribution of identified clusters indicates that cryptosporidiosis cases were nationally widespread while all three vtec clusters intersected with the shannon river basin rural areas in the irish midlands including the shannon river basin have previously been identified as a hotspot for both infections hpsc a 2019 hpsc b 2019 due to high livestock densities and reliance on private unregulated groundwater supplies cso 2016 in addition to the predominance of karstified limestone bedrocks money et al 2010 hpsc 2019 the presence of unseasonal vtec clusters within this region adds weight to the likely relationship between flooding and infection incidence i e waterborne exposure as opposed to foodborne or travel related exposures which are less frequently encountered during spring during the 2015 2016 flood event a large part of the shannon river basin including a majority of agricultural land was identified as one of the worst affected areas of the country o hara et al 2019 4 1 1 generalised linear modelling during both event and non event study periods a systematic association was found between the spatial extent of the winter 2015 2016 floods and the incidence of both infections this finding in concurrence with a significant positive relationship between measured surface water discharge and the incidence of both infections figs 8 and 9 suggests that fluvial flooding played a role in infection transmission fluvial flooding has previously been identified as a transmission route for acute gastrointestinal illness for example a recent study from germany gertler et al 2015 revealed that an unexplained outbreak in the city of halle was related to unusually high concentrations of c hominis oocysts in the saale river approximately two months after a major flood event likewise qadri et al 2005 have shown that enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec was a major source of acute gastroenteritis during a flood period in bangladesh while nguyen huynh et al 2019 reported the presence of pathogenic e coli and rotavirus a in fluvial floodwaters in the vietnamese mekong delta significantly stronger associations were found between cryptosporidiosis and i the 2015 2016 flood extent both periods ii the presence of surface water bodies both periods and iii fluvial flood risk scenarios non event period only this was somewhat unexpected as previous studies have shown that vtec enteritis is more typically related to waterborne transmission in ireland o dwyer et al 2016 óhaiseadha et al 2017 in addition to being associated with higher crude incidence rates particularly in rural areas boudou et al 2020 nonetheless findings suggest that cryptosporidiosis was more likely to occur in flood prone areas and areas with surface water bodies than vtec enteritis during non event periods table 1 a previous irish study by graczyk et al 2004 reported that c parvum oocysts were present among zebra mussels sampled across the entire shannon river drainage area with the high prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in water sources likely associated with enhanced oocyst resilience in the aquatic environment medema and schijven 2001 cryptosporidium oocysts have been shown to survive for up to 24 weeks outside a mammalian host alum et al 2014 with vtec surviving for approximately 6 to 12 weeks lothigius et al 2010 conversely the stronger link between the occurrence of vtec enteritis and fluvial risk scenarios during the event period 2015 2016 indicates that vtec enteritis and thus environmental conveyance of vtec was more significantly influenced by surface water during flood periods which was confirmed via time series analyses and is discussed below levels of association found for the fluvial flood risk probability scenarios during the non event period were lower than those for the 2015 2016 flood extent suggesting that the low probability fluvial flood risk scenario based on a 1000 year return period might have been under estimated highlighting the unusual intensity of the 2015 2016 flood event i e 1000 year flood return period both infections exhibited significantly lower incidence rates in areas characterised by coastal flood risk with significant negative associations found for cryptosporidiosis during the non event period table 2 elson et al 2018 have recently reported that residing in a coastal region is not a risk factor for vtec in england while óhaiseadha et al 2017 have noted that lower cattle septic tank and private well densities in coastal areas likely explain the absence of association in these regions i e lower pathogen concentrations on the ground surface and in the subsurface a recent review by andrade et al 2018 reports that to date no published studies have provided proof of groundwater contamination with enteric pathogens in concurrence with coastal surges notably associations between the incidence of both infections and measured flood extent was marginally weaker during the flood period the authors consider that this likely represents a change in social healthy behaviours recent irish studies mcdowell et al 2020 musacchio et al 2021 reports that private well owners from primarily rural areas experiencing or observing flooding in the vicinity of their domestic water source frequently change their drinking source and switch to bottled water during or immediately after these events with lavallee et al 2020 reporting similar findings among rural residents of ontario thus the authors hypothesize that the slightly decreased ors from non flood to the flood period are due to source switching driven by the perception of environmental risk including visible flooding in the vicinity of their domestic water source 4 1 2 time series analysis time series analyses revealed systematic significant positive associations ljung box p values 0 05 between the summed trend and residuals for both vtec and cryptosporidiosis and all three hydrometeorological variables findings point to differing temporal responses between both infections highlighting the mechanistic complexity of flood events as they pertain to acute gastrointestinal infections extreme rainfall has been identified as one of the primary environmental factors associated with occurrences of gastroenteritis via increased spatial and or velocity environmental transport of pathogens by overland flows or resuspension from sediments levy et al 2016 latchmore et al 2020 for example uejio et al 2017 identified precipitation as a key factor underscoring the high incidence of acute gastrointestinal infections among young residents of areas relying on untreated groundwater systems while jagai et al 2009 have shown rainfall is a key parameter prompting seasonal patterns of cryptosporidiosis globally a recent case study from canada showed that higher e coli concentrations were found in surface water during recharging groundwater months in winter due to a higher pathogen transport capacity during wet conditions dwivedi et al 2016 however to date few studies have assessed the link between groundwater level and gastroenteric infections with none having looked at this association during or after a significant flood event andrade et al 2018 arima models suggest significantly longer lagged effects for both cryptosporidiosis and vtec enteritis than presented in previous studies for example bimal et al 2017 report that the risk of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis within an urban population supplied by the same drinking water system was significantly higher in the 4 6 week period after the occurrence of a heavy rainfall event and particularly after dry periods similarly galway et al 2015 demonstrated a link between total precipitation mean stream flow and agi incidence within a 4 5 week period in british columbia canada in the current study two distinct associational periods were identified between the incidence of vtec enteritis and antecedent hydrometeorology namely from weeks 12 13 rainfall and groundwater level and weeks 18 19 surface water this would seem to confirm findings obtained from glms i e significant association with medium probability fluvial flood risk scenario indicating that vtec enteritis was more significantly influenced by surface water discharges during flood periods considering the incubation period for vtec enteritis 1 2 weeks karmali et al 2010 and the timing of the flood event peak registered approximately 12 16 weeks from april 2016 a link was therefore likely present between river flows measured in early 2016 i e maximum intensity of the flood event and the unusual and unseasonal number of vtec cases during april 2016 the authors consider that this strongly suggests an indirect mechanism of contamination and subsequent as this lag exceeds the maximum environmental survival capacity of vtec 6 12 weeks as such the response between event associated stream flows and the incidence of vtec enteritis may have arisen via mobilisation of faecal materials deposited after the flood event on flood saturated land i e high runoff coefficients by overland flow the association between secondary vtec peaks during june july 2016 and groundwater levels suggests that increased overland flows due to subsoil saturation likely resulted in relatively rapid contamination of groundwater sources via direct source ingress and or preferential flow i e concurrent high rainfall and subsoil saturation combined to result in two distinct periods of increased pathogen mobilisation pathogen concentration and subsequently human health risk hynds et al 2014 williams et al 2016 the temporality of the flood event must also to be considered to appropriately elucidate the unexpected magnitude length of the identified lags while the peak of the flood event was recorded in late december early january 2016 the surface water flood extent successively increased and decreased up until april may 2016 o hara et al 2019 likewise the associated decrease of groundwater levels is much longer than surface water as such naughton et al 2018 observed a persistent groundwater flooding in a karst area of ireland with exceptional high levels equivalent to the historical records of 2009 2010 for a duration of approximatively six months after the peak of the river flow in december 2015 this assessment suggest existing risk conditions of groundwater contamination up to several months after the peak and might explain the long duration of the lags found by the time series analysis nagels et al 2002 have previously shown that pathogenic e coli concentrations in a pastoral agricultural stream followed stream flow peaks recorded during a recent flood event similarly gartner et al 2015 established a link between severe flooding and cryptosporidiosis incidence peaks approximately 10 weeks after the flood event therefore suggesting longer lags between hydrometeorology and infection after flooding moreover due to the timing and atypical duration of the winter 2015 16 event and subsequent delays in the release of over wintered animals onto saturated grazing land callaghan et al 2009 pathogen survival mobilisation and transmission may be further extended wilcox colwell 2005 carlton et al 2014 and multiple lag periods identified findings indicate an association between all three hydrometeorological variables and the residual cryptosporidiosis peak during april 2016 with all three occurring during one distinct associational period namely weeks 15 to 19 while a spike in association with rainfall was noted during week 9 strongest associations were obtained during weeks 18 groundwater rainfall and 19 surface water and thus notably longer than those identified for vtec enteritis for both groundwater level and precipitation volume this longer response may be explained by the longer survival capacity of cryptosporidium spp in the environment up to 24 weeks alum et al 2014 with cryptosporidium spp also significantly more persistent in subsurface environments than e coli bouchier 1998 based upon the identification of one primary associational period with approximately 1 4 weeks of incubation associated with cryptosporidiosis shirley et al 2012 the effective association likely occurred from 12 to 16 weeks prior to the april peak and was thus associated with hydrometeorological features during december 2015 january 2016 i e potentially more direct less complex influence of the flood event on transmission the current study sought to investigate the link between the 2015 2016 flood event and unexpected high number of cases of both infections residuals peaks presented findings show strong evidence of a link between the incidence of excess infection and both the timing and geographical scale of the flood event however due to the complexity of both studied systems extreme floods and environmentally acquired infection it is difficult to provide conclusive proof of this association and the mechanisms involved accordingly the authors strongly recommend that further research is needed to confirm and quantify this relationship with a multi disciplinary approach including epidemiology hydrology hydrogeology and meteorology required real time event based sampling of private drinking sources and flood waters during and for several weeks after flooding is particularly warranted to improve current understanding of the drivers and associated mechanisms and interactions involved in infection exposure and transmission likewise further investigations are required to explore the apparently stronger relationship between cryptosporidiosis and hydrometeorological features in comparison to vtec presented in the current study the current study identified several specific rural areas as hot spots for both infections during and immediately after the studied flood event the high incidence rate of both pathogens within these areas has historically been associated with a high reliance on both individual water supplies i e unregulated private wells and domestic wastewater treatment systems i e septic tanks óhaiseadha et al 2017 based on the stated aims of the current study i e identification of quantitative lagged associations between infection and flood related hydrodynamics these potential drivers of infection were not examined however the authors strongly recommend that future studies based on delineated catchment areas and or specific localised flood events triggering waterborne infections seek to include and identify spatial temporal drivers including both environmental i e geology topography etc and anthropogenic i e private wells septic tank density land use etc variables for analyses these findings may be used to improve understanding of the association between flooding and infection permitting development of evidence based climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in vulnerable regions finally additional hydrometeorological variables and more specifically temperature directly influencing the survival capacity of both pathogens and hydrological setting i e bedrock type groundwater flooding should also be included for future analyses 5 conclusions several associations between the winter 2015 2016 flood event in the republic of ireland and atypical synchronous peaks of sporadic cryptosporidiosis and vtec enteritis approximately 2 4 months accounting for infection incubation period post event were identified time series analysis revealed link between hydrometeorology and infections and two notable lag periods one of which was significantly longer than expected pointing to indirect contamination mechanisms and subsequent pathogen exposure shorter term responses indicate more direct waterborne transmission of pathogens and particularly cryptosporidium spp due to higher environmental resilience thus both direct and indirect causes effect transport transmission mechanisms were likely associated with the flood event with more rapid direct mechanisms occurring due to mobilisation of faecal materials deposited before or during the event while indirect mechanisms likely comprise deposition of faecal materials on saturated land weeks after flood recession accordingly the incidence of potentially waterborne infections within a flood context should be closely monitored several months post event and particularly in flood prone areas in view of the high susceptibility of these regions as found in the current study likewise environmental monitoring i e surface water and groundwater sampling campaigns are required to fully understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of both pathogens and their associated infections during and after flood events a multidisciplinary approach combining hydrology meteorology hydrogeology and epidemiology is required to address the complex nexus between extreme weather events waterborne pathogens and human health as such the multidisciplinary and multi modal methodology developed for the current study could be applied to similar events and for other geographic locations funding information this study has been

4449,during a 6 week period in november and december 2015 a series of atlantic storms swept across the republic of ireland roi causing widespread pluvial and fluvial flooding flooding was particularly severe in the west and midlands with rainfall up to 200 above normal in many regions making it the wettest winter ever recorded while the infrastructural damage and subsequent costs associated with flood events have and continue to receive widespread attention far less coverage is given to the associated adverse human health effects this is particularly significant in the roi which is characterised by the highest crude incidence rates of verotoxigenic e coli vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis in europe accordingly weekly spatially referenced infection incidence from july 2015 to june 2016 were employed in concurrence with weekly time series of cumulative antecedent rainfall surface water discharge and groundwater level and high resolution flood risk mapping an ensemble of statistical and time series analyses were used to quantify the influence of flood hydrometeorology on the incidence of confirmed infections seasonal decomposition excluding seasonal patterns and long term trends identified a high residual infection peak during april 2016 with space timing scanning used to identify the location size and temporal extent of clustering excess cases of vtec enteritis were geographically associated with the midlands while cryptosporidiosis clusters were widespread generalised linear modelling of infection locations show that areas with a surface water body exhibited significantly higher incidence rates for both vtec or 1 225 p 0 001 and cryptosporidiosis or 1 363 p 0 001 arima models show a clear association between rainfall surface water discharge groundwater levels and infection incidence with lagged associations from 16 to 20 weeks particularly strong thus indicating a link between infection peaks april 2016 and the flood event which began approximately 18 weeks earlier all three hydrometeorological variables were associated with the increase in cryptosporidiosis during april 2016 while only surface water discharge was associated with

country and exceeding 300 in southern regions likewise both january and february 2016 were particularly wet being ranked as the 9th wettest january and february recorded in the roi 2 1 2 hydrological characterisation three primary flood periods have been identified during the period 12th november 2015 to 5th january 2016 corresponding with the occurrence of the three main storm events fig 2 flood

departments of public health between 1st january 2013 and 31st december 2017 vtec cases prior to january 2013 were not used due to geographically divergent testing and reporting protocols the cryptosporidiosis dataset included all confirmed cases notified from 1st january 2008 to 31st december 2017 cases occurring prior to january 2008 were not integrated due to a significant outbreak

using r studio v 4 0 for flood and non flood periods 2 5 hydrometeorological indicators time series analyses were undertaken using three hydrometeorological variables extracted from the shannon river basin cumulative rainfall river discharge surface water and groundwater level the shannon river basin was selected as a representative area due to its central location and geographical significance 15 695 km2 covering approximately 22 of the country the river basin was significantly affected by flooding during the 2015 2016 event national directorate for fire and emergency management 2016 and is considered a hotspot for both vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis boudou et al 2020 a distinction was made between the lower and upper shannon sub basins to allow for spatial hydrodynamic variation supplementary materials for each sub basin hydrometeorological data were extracted as follows daily cumulative rainfall from met éireann synoptic stations daily mean discharge cubic metres per second from opw gauging stations daily groundwater level meters from the environment protection agency epa of ireland the groundwater levels extracted from the epa stations were rescaled 0 10 to ensure homogeneity measurement station gauge selection was undertaken based on dataset length and completeness proximity of discharge and groundwater gauging stations to appropriately capture hydrodynamic patterns i e interactions synoptic stations were selected via k nearest neighbour to gauging stations surface water and groundwater two synoptic stations were used for the lower catchment the discharge station being closer to the gurteen station co tipperary while the groundwater station is closer to the mullingar station co westmeath the mean between these two stations was used to characterize rainfall in the lower catchment 2 6 time series analyses based on weekly time series fig 5 time series analyses were conducted to identify lagged association s between antecedent hydrometeorology and infection incidence analyses were carried out on the summed trend and residuals of both vtec and cryptosporidiosis obtained from seasonal decomposition section 2 4 as the primary objective was to identify and elucidate atypical infection excess national infection data were used based on the hypothesis that hydrometeorological means recorded within the shannon catchment can be used as indicators for country wide infection incidence a range of 1 to 24 weeks was employed to assess minimum and maximum lags periods according to the maximum environmental survival of both pathogens estimated to be up to 24 weeks in a 15 c environment for cryptosporidium spp alum et al 2014 arima modelling was used to assess the weight of weekly lagged hydrometeorological time series on infection incidence during the flood period via back casting differencing order 1 was performed on all time series to ensure stationarity similarly environmental time series were seasonally adjusted the final order parameters used for analysis p d q were arima 0 1 1 obtained via optimisation diagnostics repeated iterations were performed on infection time series trend and residuals from july 2015 to july 2016 using stepped lags from 1 to 24 weeks of the three environmental time series for both lower and upper shannon sub basins the ljung box test a statistical test used for examining time series autocorrelation was used to indicate significance between hydrometeorological parameters and infection with p 0 05 used to confirm the magnitude of autocorrelation 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of infection during 2015 2016 3 1 1 seasonal decomposition seasonal decomposition identified specific seasonal patterns for both infections fig 6 vtec infection exhibits high incidence during mid late summer peaking in july with a secondary peak in september while cryptosporidiosis is highest during spring march to may peaking in april both infections displayed a general cumulative trend increase over their respective study periods notably both infections exhibited a marked residual i e seasonal trend excluded peak during april 2016 accounting for 23 observed residual cases for vtec and 57 observed residual cases for cryptosporidiosis other secondary residual peaks were identified particularly during june july 2016 for vtec enteritis 3 1 2 space time scanning space time scanning of vtec cases identified three significant rr 1 p 0 05 clusters 83 cases in total during the flood period all of which intersected 25 35 with the shannon catchment area the two largest clusters 40 and 29 cases were identified east and south west of limerick city respectively and occurred between april and june 2016 fig 7 a third cluster was observed further north co cavan during september 2015 14 cases eight significant space time clusters of cryptosporidiosis were identified during the flood period accounting for 238 cases fig 7 the spatial distribution of these clusters was relatively widespread across the country with 4 clusters intersecting the shannon basin the temporal distribution of clusters were from march to may 2016 for clusters 1 2 3 and 7 south midlands and south and from april to june 2016 for clusters 4 5 6 and 8 north midlands and north 3 2 flood exposure and infection a significant association was found between the spatial extent of the 2015 2016 flood event and the occurrence of infection during both study periods during the non flood period approximately 39 of vtec cases or 1 487 p 0 001 and 44 of cryptosporidiosis cases or 1 792 p 0 001 occurred within the spatial boundary of the 2015 2016 flood extent tables 1 2 and 3 similarly during the flood period the sa units situated within the flood extent were more likely to report 1 case of vtec 40 of total cases or 1 355 p 0 001 or cryptosporidiosis 40 of total cases or 1 574 p 0 001 table 3 analyses indicate that both infections occur significantly more frequently within areas prone to the risk of fluvial flooding for example from 2008 to 2018 a case of cryptosporidiosis was approximately 13 p 0 001 more likely to occur in an sa characterized by a high probability of fluvial flooding 10 year flood return period table 3 similarly during the flood period vtec enteritis occurred more frequently within areas classified under the medium fluvial risk scenario 100 year flood return period or 1 094 p 0 025 table 3 results show no association between coastal surge flood risk areas and the incidence of either infection p 0 05 table 2 for the non flood period while a significant negative association was found with cryptosporidiosis during the flood period table 3 a strong statistical relationship was found between infection incidence and the presence of a surface water body lake or river 25 4 of vtec cases or 1 225 p 0 001 and 30 9 of cryptosporidiosis cases or 1 739 p 0 001 occurred within sas comprising a surface water body during the non flood period tables 1 2 3 a similarly significant association albeit slightly weaker was observed for the flood period vtec cases 24 8 or 1 225 p 0 001 cryptosporidiosis cases 29 3 or 1 363 p 0 001 tables 2 3 3 3 flood hydrometeorology results of optimised arima models for vtec enteritis indicate relatively similar responses between both sub basins highlighting two significant primary associational periods i e lags ljung box p value 0 05 from weeks 12 to 14 and 17 to 19 in red respectively fig 8 higher levels of association were observed in the lower shannon basin with maximum p values calculated for surface water discharge significantly higher than those obtained for rainfall and groundwater level within both sub basins maximum associations found for each variable were rainfall week 12 p 0 062 upper shannon and week 13 p value 0 071 lower shannon surface water week 18 p 0 072 upper shannon and week 19 p 0 105 lower shannon groundwater level week 12 p 0 061 upper shannon p 0 06 lower shannon likewise two specific periods of association were found between antecedent hydrometeorological variables and the occurrence of excess cryptosporidiosis cases namely from weeks 8 to 10 and weeks 16 to 21 fig 9 levels of association were higher in the upper shannon max p value 0 577 than the lower shannon max p value 0 371 and significantly higher than those found for vtec enteritis the best fit weekly lags found by calculating the p values of ljung box tests appear identical between both sub basins as follows rainfall week 19 p 0 274 lower shannon p 0 522 upper shannon surface water week 18 p 0 371 lower shannon p 0 577 upper shannon groundwater level week 18 p 0 395 lower shannon p 0 424 upper shannon 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal distribution of vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis seasonal decomposition of both infections provided strong evidence of two atypical peaks i e residual infections during april 2016 followed by a secondary peak during june july 2016 among vtec infections only vtec enteritis and cryptosporidiosis are characterized by two differing seasonal patterns in ireland both accurately captured by the seasonal variations from fig 5 human cases of cryptosporidiosis typically peak during late spring march to may temporally concurring with agricultural cycles e g calving and lambing seasons manure spreading callaghan et al 2009 cacciò and chalmers 2016 a secondary peak is observed in september reflective of national and international travel and children returning to school pollock et al 2009 conversely the highest incidence rates of vtec annually occur during late summer and early autumn due to irish dietary patterns increased consumption of meat products livestock grazing and international travel lal et al 2012 óhaiseadha et al 2017 accordingly the atypical timing of the identified excess vtec peak in concurrence with the residual synchronicity between both infections represents a strong indicator of an impacting external factor such as a relatively large spatially diffuse outbreak overlooked by standard surveillance measures or a temporally specific societal or environmental event reingold 1998 an investigation of social and traditional media leads the authors to hypothesise that the winter 2015 16 flooding event was the likely source of these synchronous residuals which were not observed at any other point within the total 5 10 year dataset space time scanning identified 10 spatiotemporally distinct clusters that temporally overlapped april 2016 with the occurrence of an overlooked infection cluster or outbreak adjudged extremely unlikely the spatial distribution of identified clusters indicates that cryptosporidiosis cases were nationally widespread while all three vtec clusters intersected with the shannon river basin rural areas in the irish midlands including the shannon river basin have previously been identified as a hotspot for both infections hpsc a 2019 hpsc b 2019 due to high livestock densities and reliance on private unregulated groundwater supplies cso 2016 in addition to the predominance of karstified limestone bedrocks money et al 2010 hpsc 2019 the presence of unseasonal vtec clusters within this region adds weight to the likely relationship between flooding and infection incidence i e waterborne exposure as opposed to foodborne or travel related exposures which are less frequently encountered during spring during the 2015 2016 flood event a large part of the shannon river basin including a majority of agricultural land was identified as one of the worst affected areas of the country o hara et al 2019 4 1 1 generalised linear modelling during both event and non event study periods a systematic association was found between the spatial extent of the winter 2015 2016 floods and the incidence of both infections this finding in concurrence with a significant positive relationship between measured surface water discharge and the incidence of both infections figs 8 and 9 suggests that fluvial flooding played a role in infection transmission fluvial flooding has previously been identified as a transmission route for acute gastrointestinal illness for example a recent study from germany gertler et al 2015 revealed that an unexplained outbreak in the city of halle was related to unusually high concentrations of c hominis oocysts in the saale river approximately two months after a major flood event likewise qadri et al 2005 have shown that enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec was a major source of acute gastroenteritis during a flood period in bangladesh while nguyen huynh et al 2019 reported the presence of pathogenic e coli and rotavirus a in fluvial floodwaters in the vietnamese mekong delta significantly stronger associations were found between cryptosporidiosis and i the 2015 2016 flood extent both periods ii the presence of surface water bodies both periods and iii fluvial flood risk scenarios non event period only this was somewhat unexpected as previous studies have shown that vtec enteritis is more typically related to waterborne transmission in ireland o dwyer et al 2016 óhaiseadha et al 2017 in addition to being associated with higher crude incidence rates particularly in rural areas boudou et al 2020 nonetheless findings suggest that cryptosporidiosis was more likely to occur in flood prone areas and areas with surface water bodies than vtec enteritis during non event periods table 1 a previous irish study by graczyk et al 2004 reported that c parvum oocysts were present among zebra mussels sampled across the entire shannon river drainage area with the high prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in water sources likely associated with enhanced oocyst resilience in the aquatic environment medema and schijven 2001 cryptosporidium oocysts have been shown to survive for up to 24 weeks outside a mammalian host alum et al 2014 with vtec surviving for approximately 6 to 12 weeks lothigius et al 2010 conversely the stronger link between the occurrence of vtec enteritis and fluvial risk scenarios during the event period 2015 2016 indicates that vtec enteritis and thus environmental conveyance of vtec was more significantly influenced by surface water during flood periods which was confirmed via time series analyses and is discussed below levels of association found for the fluvial flood risk probability scenarios during the non event period were lower than those for the 2015 2016 flood extent suggesting that the low probability fluvial flood risk scenario based on a 1000 year return period might have been under estimated highlighting the unusual intensity of the 2015 2016 flood event i e 1000 year flood return period both infections exhibited significantly lower incidence rates in areas characterised by coastal flood risk with significant negative associations found for cryptosporidiosis during the non event period table 2 elson et al 2018 have recently reported that residing in a coastal region is not a risk factor for vtec in england while óhaiseadha et al 2017 have noted that lower cattle septic tank and private well densities in coastal areas likely explain the absence of association in these regions i e lower pathogen concentrations on the ground surface and in the subsurface a recent review by andrade et al 2018 reports that to date no published studies have provided proof of groundwater contamination with enteric pathogens in concurrence with coastal surges notably associations between the incidence of both infections and measured flood extent was marginally weaker during the flood period the authors consider that this likely represents a change in social healthy behaviours recent irish studies mcdowell et al 2020 musacchio et al 2021 reports that private well owners from primarily rural areas experiencing or observing flooding in the vicinity of their domestic water source frequently change their drinking source and switch to bottled water during or immediately after these events with lavallee et al 2020 reporting similar findings among rural residents of ontario thus the authors hypothesize that the slightly decreased ors from non flood to the flood period are due to source switching driven by the perception of environmental risk including visible flooding in the vicinity of their domestic water source 4 1 2 time series analysis time series analyses revealed systematic significant positive associations ljung box p values 0 05 between the summed trend and residuals for both vtec and cryptosporidiosis and all three hydrometeorological variables findings point to differing temporal responses between both infections highlighting the mechanistic complexity of flood events as they pertain to acute gastrointestinal infections extreme rainfall has been identified as one of the primary environmental factors associated with occurrences of gastroenteritis via increased spatial and or velocity environmental transport of pathogens by overland flows or resuspension from sediments levy et al 2016 latchmore et al 2020 for example uejio et al 2017 identified precipitation as a key factor underscoring the high incidence of acute gastrointestinal infections among young residents of areas relying on untreated groundwater systems while jagai et al 2009 have shown rainfall is a key parameter prompting seasonal patterns of cryptosporidiosis globally a recent case study from canada showed that higher e coli concentrations were found in surface water during recharging groundwater months in winter due to a higher pathogen transport capacity during wet conditions dwivedi et al 2016 however to date few studies have assessed the link between groundwater level and gastroenteric infections with none having looked at this association during or after a significant flood event andrade et al 2018 arima models suggest significantly longer lagged effects for both cryptosporidiosis and vtec enteritis than presented in previous studies for example bimal et al 2017 report that the risk of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis within an urban population supplied by the same drinking water system was significantly higher in the 4 6 week period after the occurrence of a heavy rainfall event and particularly after dry periods similarly galway et al 2015 demonstrated a link between total precipitation mean stream flow and agi incidence within a 4 5 week period in british columbia canada in the current study two distinct associational periods were identified between the incidence of vtec enteritis and antecedent hydrometeorology namely from weeks 12 13 rainfall and groundwater level and weeks 18 19 surface water this would seem to confirm findings obtained from glms i e significant association with medium probability fluvial flood risk scenario indicating that vtec enteritis was more significantly influenced by surface water discharges during flood periods considering the incubation period for vtec enteritis 1 2 weeks karmali et al 2010 and the timing of the flood event peak registered approximately 12 16 weeks from april 2016 a link was therefore likely present between river flows measured in early 2016 i e maximum intensity of the flood event and the unusual and unseasonal number of vtec cases during april 2016 the authors consider that this strongly suggests an indirect mechanism of contamination and subsequent as this lag exceeds the maximum environmental survival capacity of vtec 6 12 weeks as such the response between event associated stream flows and the incidence of vtec enteritis may have arisen via mobilisation of faecal materials deposited after the flood event on flood saturated land i e high runoff coefficients by overland flow the association between secondary vtec peaks during june july 2016 and groundwater levels suggests that increased overland flows due to subsoil saturation likely resulted in relatively rapid contamination of groundwater sources via direct source ingress and or preferential flow i e concurrent high rainfall and subsoil saturation combined to result in two distinct periods of increased pathogen mobilisation pathogen concentration and subsequently human health risk hynds et al 2014 williams et al 2016 the temporality of the flood event must also to be considered to appropriately elucidate the unexpected magnitude length of the identified lags while the peak of the flood event was recorded in late december early january 2016 the surface water flood extent successively increased and decreased up until april may 2016 o hara et al 2019 likewise the associated decrease of groundwater levels is much longer than surface water as such naughton et al 2018 observed a persistent groundwater flooding in a karst area of ireland with exceptional high levels equivalent to the historical records of 2009 2010 for a duration of approximatively six months after the peak of the river flow in december 2015 this assessment suggest existing risk conditions of groundwater contamination up to several months after the peak and might explain the long duration of the lags found by the time series analysis nagels et al 2002 have previously shown that pathogenic e coli concentrations in a pastoral agricultural stream followed stream flow peaks recorded during a recent flood event similarly gartner et al 2015 established a link between severe flooding and cryptosporidiosis incidence peaks approximately 10 weeks after the flood event therefore suggesting longer lags between hydrometeorology and infection after flooding moreover due to the timing and atypical duration of the winter 2015 16 event and subsequent delays in the release of over wintered animals onto saturated grazing land callaghan et al 2009 pathogen survival mobilisation and transmission may be further extended wilcox colwell 2005 carlton et al 2014 and multiple lag periods identified findings indicate an association between all three hydrometeorological variables and the residual cryptosporidiosis peak during april 2016 with all three occurring during one distinct associational period namely weeks 15 to 19 while a spike in association with rainfall was noted during week 9 strongest associations were obtained during weeks 18 groundwater rainfall and 19 surface water and thus notably longer than those identified for vtec enteritis for both groundwater level and precipitation volume this longer response may be explained by the longer survival capacity of cryptosporidium spp in the environment up to 24 weeks alum et al 2014 with cryptosporidium spp also significantly more persistent in subsurface environments than e coli bouchier 1998 based upon the identification of one primary associational period with approximately 1 4 weeks of incubation associated with cryptosporidiosis shirley et al 2012 the effective association likely occurred from 12 to 16 weeks prior to the april peak and was thus associated with hydrometeorological features during december 2015 january 2016 i e potentially more direct less complex influence of the flood event on transmission the current study sought to investigate the link between the 2015 2016 flood event and unexpected high number of cases of both infections residuals peaks presented findings show strong evidence of a link between the incidence of excess infection and both the timing and geographical scale of the flood event however due to the complexity of both studied systems extreme floods and environmentally acquired infection it is difficult to provide conclusive proof of this association and the mechanisms involved accordingly the authors strongly recommend that further research is needed to confirm and quantify this relationship with a multi disciplinary approach including epidemiology hydrology hydrogeology and meteorology required real time event based sampling of private drinking sources and flood waters during and for several weeks after flooding is particularly warranted to improve current understanding of the drivers and associated mechanisms and interactions involved in infection exposure and transmission likewise further investigations are required to explore the apparently stronger relationship between cryptosporidiosis and hydrometeorological features in comparison to vtec presented in the current study the current study identified several specific rural areas as hot spots for both infections during and immediately after the studied flood event the high incidence rate of both pathogens within these areas has historically been associated with a high reliance on both individual water supplies i e unregulated private wells and domestic wastewater treatment systems i e septic tanks óhaiseadha et al 2017 based on the stated aims of the current study i e identification of quantitative lagged associations between infection and flood related hydrodynamics these potential drivers of infection were not examined however the authors strongly recommend that future studies based on delineated catchment areas and or specific localised flood events triggering waterborne infections seek to include and identify spatial temporal drivers including both environmental i e geology topography etc and anthropogenic i e private wells septic tank density land use etc variables for analyses these findings may be used to improve understanding of the association between flooding and infection permitting development of evidence based climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in vulnerable regions finally additional hydrometeorological variables and more specifically temperature directly influencing the survival capacity of both pathogens and hydrological setting i e bedrock type groundwater flooding should also be included for future analyses 5 conclusions several associations between the winter 2015 2016 flood event in the republic of ireland and atypical synchronous peaks of sporadic cryptosporidiosis and vtec enteritis approximately 2 4 months accounting for infection incubation period post event were identified time series analysis revealed link between hydrometeorology and infections and two notable lag periods one of which was significantly longer than expected pointing to indirect contamination mechanisms and subsequent pathogen exposure shorter term responses indicate more direct waterborne transmission of pathogens and particularly cryptosporidium spp due to higher environmental resilience thus both direct and indirect causes effect transport transmission mechanisms were likely associated with the flood event with more rapid direct mechanisms occurring due to mobilisation of faecal materials deposited before or during the event while indirect mechanisms likely comprise deposition of faecal materials on saturated land weeks after flood recession accordingly the incidence of potentially waterborne infections within a flood context should be closely monitored several months post event and particularly in flood prone areas in view of the high susceptibility of these regions as found in the current study likewise environmental monitoring i e surface water and groundwater sampling campaigns are required to fully understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of both pathogens and their associated infections during and after flood events a multidisciplinary approach combining hydrology meteorology hydrogeology and epidemiology is required to address the complex nexus between extreme weather events waterborne pathogens and human health as such the multidisciplinary and multi modal methodology developed for the current study could be applied to similar events and for other geographic locations funding information this study has been
