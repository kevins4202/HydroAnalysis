19130,trivalent copper complexes are active intermediates in aquatic redox reactions that involve copper ions or structural copper but their reactivity and selectivity toward pollutants remain unknown we characterized copper iii periodate a representative trivalent copper compound with phenol and several antibiotics as model contaminants the results show that cu iii is highly reactive to phenol degradation near complete degradation was achieved after 10 min at a molar ratio of 3 1 cu iii phenol common alcohols including methanol and 2 propanol showed ph dependent reactivity for cu iii in contrast to aquo trivalent copper ions that react rapidly with tert butanol cu iii showed limited reactivity toward tert butanol a mechanistic investigation showed that the degradation was caused by direct oxidation by cu iii and that no hydroxyl radicals were involved common water components such as chloride ions did not influence the reaction which suggests that the use of cu iii may help mitigate the generation of chlorinated products as a one electron oxidant cu iii showed high reactivity to degrade electron rich compounds the concentrations of sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine 100 μg l were reduced to 1 8 7 5 and 42 5 ng l respectively after 2 min of reaction with 10 μm cu iii these results demonstrate a novel and highly efficient oxidant for selective removal

selective than oh the former radical is highly reactive toward nucleophiles such as cl and br ball and edwards 1956 feng et al 2018a the generation of halogenated byproducts is possibly a concern in the so 4 mediated aops when elevated levels of halide ions are present anbar and neta 1967 anipsitakis et al 2005 pignatello et al 2006 chemical oxidation processes that rely on high valence metals such as fe vi e0 2 2 v sharma 2002 2007 and mn vii 1 68 v hu et al 2010 have been investigated intensively for water purification soil remediation and odor control unlike highly reactive radicals that decompose rapidly due to self combination and scavenging chemical oxidants are comparatively stable and thus have greater mobility unlike common aops chemical oxidation does not require catalyst addition and external energy assistance and can thus be implemented more conveniently particularly in applications for in situ remediation high valence metals are generally more selective than oh which reacts with many compounds at near diffusion controlled rates anbar and neta 1967 buxton et al 1988 feng et al 2018b for instance the variation in the reaction rates of fe vi and mn vii with different organic compounds can be several orders of magnitude sharma 2002 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 in addition to fe vi and mn vii trivalent copper complexes have recently emerged as active species and have attracted wide attention from environmental scientists due to their involvement in aops that involve copper such as copper iron bimetallic oxide activated persulfates feng et al 2016 lei et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 cu2 or cu activated hydrogen peroxide johnson et al 1985 1988 lee et al 2013 pham et al 2013 or persulfate ogibin et al 1977 and cu2 activated molecular oxygen feng et al

potassium bis biureto cuprate iii brown and weser 1980 have been reported the involvement of trivalent copper in aops has yet to be experimentally identified the absence of direct evidence for trivalent copper formation as intermediates is likely due to its strong oxidizing capability particularly in its solid form the redox potential of the cu3 cu2 couple is reported to be 1 7 v and that of cu iii cu ii solid is 2 3 v popova and aksenova 2003 which is slightly greater even than that of fe vi fe iii 2 2 v 1 cu 2 oh cu 3 oh as suggested by its great reduction potential cu iii can likely serve as a strong oxidant identical to fe vi in this study we for the first time used cu iii as an oxidant to remove a variety of contaminants from water because the properties of cu iii remain unknown we investigated the factors that may influence its reactivity during such evaluations we used phenol as a target contaminant because of its well known reactions with common radical and nonradical species to characterize the selectivity of cu iii we studied the degradation of structurally diverse sets of organic compounds to evaluate the practical applicability of cu iii we investigated the removal of several antibiotics using cu iii at a level allowable for drinking water in this article cu3 and cu iii represent aquo and periodate complexed trivalent copper respectively

solutions the properties of the contaminants selected are presented in table s1 2 2 synthesis and characterization of copper iii periodate copper iii periodate was synthesized by using potassium persulfate to oxidize copper ii ions in the presence of sodium periodate balikungeri et al 1977 in a typical procedure copper ii sulfate pentahydrate 1 56 g sodium periodate 2 67 g and potassium hydroxide 8 02 g were added to a 250 ml round bottom flask containing 100 ml of ultrapure water after dissolution the solution was refluxed for 30 min and cooled to ambient temperature the resulting mixture was filtered with a glass fritted funnel and the filtrate was cooled in an ice bath to eliminate potassium sulfate the mixture obtained was filtered again with the glass funnel a sodium nitrate solution 5 m was then added dropwise to the filtrate until crystals began to form and the system was allowed to stand for 12 h to completely precipitate the crystals the resulting dark brown crystals were collected by suction filtration washed with ultrapure water to remove the remaining potassium hydroxide and dried in a lyophilizer for 12 h the composition of the prepared sample was investigated using x ray powder diffraction and the spectrum was recorded on a d8 advance x ray powder diffractometer bruker axs gmbh karlsruhe germany cu kα1 2 x rays were used as the radiation source at 40 kv and 40 ma the valent state of copper was studied with an escalab 250xi x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo scientific waltham ma usa al kα x ray was the radiation source and the

optical emission spectrometry optima 2100 dv perkinelmer after dissolving a known amount of copper iii periodate in 4 m h2so4 mccann et al 2016 2 3 experimental procedures unless otherwise specified all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 c 1 c in 250 ml glass beakers under magnetic stirring a stock solution of phenol 10 g l was prepared by dissolving an exact amount of phenol in ultrapure water in a typical procedure a water solution 100 ml with buffers 5 mm at a specific ph was transferred to the glass beaker and spiked with the phenol stock solution the copper iii periodate synthesized was then added to the resulting phenol solution to initiate degradation reactions aliquots 1 ml were withdrawn from each reactor with syringes at predetermined time intervals filtered with polytetrafluoroethylene membranes 0 22 μm millipore darmstadt germany and transferred to 2 ml lc vials macherey nagel düren germany for phenol analysis sodium borohydride solution 10 μl 1 m ph 12 5 was immediately spiked into the vials to prevent further degradation of phenol the effectiveness of various quenching agents was evaluated and sodium borohydride was found to be the most efficient at complete inhibition of degradation fig s1 however due to the strong reducing effect of sodium borohydride on nitrobenzene and the selected antibiotics this reductant was used only for the degradation of phenol in the cases of other contaminants sodium sulfite was used instead to quench degradation all degradation experiments were performed in triplicate the data obtained were averaged and the corresponding standard deviation was presented the possible degradation of the selected target pollutants by orthoperiodic acid io 6 5 in the synthesized copper iii complex was investigated by examining the oxidizing effect of sodium para periodate h2na3io6 the details are given in note s1 to investigate the possible reactions of cu iii with chloride ions or bicarbonate ions the consumption of cu iii with and without chloride ions bicarbonate ions was studied the quantification of cu iii was based on the adsorption of cu iii periodate complexes at 425 nm detailed procedures are listed in note s2 when the degradation of low concentrations of antibiotics 100 μg l by copper iii periodate was investigated the procedures were the same as those given above for phenol degradation except that the samples withdrawn were immediately quenched and no filtration was conducted 2 4 chemical analysis the concentration of phenol was analyzed with a waters aquity ultra performance lc uplc system

vis spectrometer wolf laboratories pocklington uk the ph was adjusted with 2 m naoh or h2so4 and was analyzed with an orion 2 star benchtop ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of copper iii periodate consistent with the report of balikungeri et al 1977 the synthesized copper iii complex was a dark brown powder inset fig 1 a to further confirm its composition the powder was characterized with x ray powder diffraction as shown most of the peaks could be exclusively indexed to a known compound of sodium potassium copper iii hydrogen iodate hydrate kna4h2cu io6 2 12h2o pdf 82 0480 fig 1a on the basis of the composition stoichiometry of this compound the copper iii content was estimated to be 9 53 however this value was higher than the measured copper iii content 7 2 likely because of the coexistence of copper free impurities as revealed by the presence of some unassigned x ray diffraction peaks fig 1a the x ray photoelectron spectrum shows binding energies of 934 4 ev and 954 3 ev for cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 fig 1b respectively in addition satellites were present at the high binding energy side of the cu 2p3 2 942 4 ev and cu 2p1 2 962 3 ev main peaks these x ray photoelectron parameters are consistent with those of previously reported copper iii complexes such as cu bi 2 brown and weser 1980 the uv vis spectrum of copper iii salt exhibits a distinct peak at around 425 nm whereas the distinct peak of cu2 ions in the non uv area was around 805 nm inset fig 1c and io 4 ions showed no obvious adsorption at wavelengths higher than 400 nm therefore the adsorption peak at around 425 nm was the characteristic peak of cu iii metal iodine oxygen stretches are presented in the wavenumber range of 400 800 cm 1 in the ft ir spectrum of copper iii periodate fig 1d which can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of the copper iii complex mccann et al 2016 meanwhile the strong peak at 3200 cm 1 suggests that noticeable amounts of water were present in the sample which is consistent with the composition of copper iii periodate kna4h2cu io6 2 12h2o 3 2 effects of cu iii doses ph values temperature and periodate ions periodate a strong oxidant was present in the synthesized copper iii complex before studying the reactivity of cu iii we investigated the potential oxidation of contaminants by sodium para periodate h2na3io6 note s1 however no degradation of the selected contaminants by io 6 5 5 mm was observed fig s2 meanwhile recent results from chen et al 2015 suggested that cu2 ions can directly oxidize certain antibiotics such as benzylpenicillin we therefore studied the possible oxidation of the selected contaminants by cu2 the results show that cu2 at a concentration of 0 5 mm had no oxidizing effect on the tested compounds after 20 min of reaction to evaluate the reactivity of cu iii the degradation of phenol was studied in the presence of various doses of cu iii fig 2 a as the oxidant dose increased from 0 05 to 0 3 mm the degradation of phenol accelerated its overall degradation rate increased from around 69 100 the ph value of the phenol solution was observed to have a complicated effect on the reactivity of cu iii fig 2b particularly during the initial reaction stage 0 5 min kinetic investigation showed that the degradation of phenol at the reaction stage from 0 to 5 min followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s3 the corresponding pseudo first order kinetics obtained showed pronounced differences and are thus used to reflect the effects of ph fig s3 in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 the greatest pseudo first order rate constant 1 85 0 08 min 1 was achieved with ph 4 5 which suggests that ph 4 5 was the optimum condition for oxidation by cu iii in the ph range of 5 5 9 0 an increase in the rate constant was observed as the ph increased fig 2b and fig s3 these effects were further shown in the degradation of tert butanol by cu iii fig s4 despite the difference in the rate constants the overall degradation of phenol varied only slightly in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 fig 2b these results suggest that copper iii has reactivity for pollutant degradation in a wide effective ph range temperature is an important parameter in aqueous reactions and its effect on the reactivity of cu iii was thus investigated the results show that the degradation of phenol by cu iii was promoted as the reaction temperature was enhanced from 25 c to 40 c fig 2c 2 h 5 io 6 h 4 io 6 h k 5 1 10 4 3 h 4 io 6 h 3 io 6 2 h k 4 9 10 9 4 h 3 io 6 2 h 2 io 6 3 h k 2 5 10 12 5 h 4 io 6 io 4 2 h 2 o k 29 6 cu hio 6 2 5 4 h 2 o cu h 3 io 6 2 4 oh 7 cu h 3 io 6 2 cuh 3 io 6 h 3 io 6 2 8 cuh 3 io 6 4 h 2 o cu oh 4 h 2 io 6 3 5 h 9 cuh 3 io 6 c 6 h 5 oh c 6 h 5 o products cu 2 periodate in water solution involves multiple equilibria eqs 2 5 byadagi et al 2013 and its existing form depends on the ph of the solution according to the equilibrium equations periodate mainly exits as h 3 io 6 2 under the basic conditions investigated in this study meanwhile cu iii periodate were proposed to exist in different forms under basic conditions eqs 6 8 lister 1953 diperiodatocuprate iii cu hio 6 2 5 monoperiodatocuprate iii cuh 3 io 6 and tetrahydroxocuprate iii cu oh 4 the equilibrium constant for the generation of tetrahydroxocuprate iii is 8 0 10 11 eq 8 so its presence in this study can be ruled out therefore diperiodatocuprate iii and monoperiodatocuprate iii may have both been responsible for the degradation of phenol under basic conditions to further clarify the contributions of these species we investigated the effect of io 6 5 fig 2d shows that the degradation of phenol was obviously decreased as the concentration of io 6 5 increased this retarding effect suggests that an equilibrium was reached between diperiodatocuprate iii and monoperiodatocuprate iii and that monoperiodatocuprate iii was the dominant active species eqs 7 and 9 phenol has a pka value of around 9 9 table s1 with the increase of the surrounding ph value from 5 to 9 the proportion of the deprotonated form of phenol phenolate was increased because cuh 3 io 6 was positively charged it might more readily attack the negatively charged phenolate c 6 h 5 o than phenol c6h5oh which explains the enhanced degradation when the ph was increased from 5 to 9 fig 2b 3 3 identification of major active species previous studies showed that cu3 and its hydrolyzed form cu oh 2 may decompose to form oh eqs 10 and 11 feng et al 2017c meyerstein 1971 ulanski and von sonntag 2000 similar decomposition of cu iii might also occur to generate oh which assisted the degradation of phenol to evaluate this hypothesis we conduced scavenging tests with various alcohols alcohols including methanol and 2 propanol were reported to have ph dependent reactivity toward cu3 meyerstein 1971 movius 1973 for instance the rate constant between methanol and cu3 was measured at 4 9 1 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 5 whereas the rate decreased to less than 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 4 meyerstein 1971 at ph 3 0 both methanol and 2 propanol exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the reactivity of cu iii the degradation of phenol decreased from nearly 100 to around 36 and 31 in the presence of methanol and 2 propanol respectively corresponding to inhibitory ratios of 64 and 69 fig 3 a respectively with the increase in the ph to 7 0 and 9 0 the adverse effects of these two alcohols were greatly reduced fig 3b and c previous results showed that cu3 reacts with tert butanol 1 0 4 107 m 1 s 1 pham et al 2013 more rapidly than with methanol 1 106 m 1 s 1 meyerstein 1971 and tert butanol was thus expected to have a more pronounced inhibitory effect however tert butanol did not obviously influence the degradation of phenol at ph 3 0 fig 3a and 7 0 fig 3b and only a slight inhibitory effect from tert butanol was observed at ph 9 0 fig 3c to further clarify these findings we investigated the degradation of tert butanol by cu iii fig s4a shows that less than 20 degradation of the tert butanol 0 1 mm was achieved under identical conditions the degradation rate of phenol was near 100 fig 2b these results suggest that cu iii and cu3 had quite different reactivity toward tert butanol and that cu3 did not likely contribute to the degradation of phenol in addition the presenting form of cu3 was regulated by the proteolytic equilibria in eq 12 johnson et al 1985 cu oh 2 has a pk a value of 3 7 and cu oh 2 has a pk a of 4 8 johnson et al 1985 although the pk a for cu3 remains unknown the value is expected to be lower than 2 5 asmus et al 1978 ulanski and von sonntag 2000 hydroxide ligand was proposed to have a stabilizing effect on cu3 and cu oh 2 and cu oh 2 both had weaker oxidizing capabilities than cu3 meyerstein 1971 however increased degradation occurred as the ph value increased from 5 5 to 9 0 which consistently demonstrates that cu3 was not involved in the equilibrium of cu iii 10 cu 3 cu 2 oh h 11 cu oh 2 cu 2 oh 12 cu 3 cu oh 2 cu oh 2 cu oh 3 to further characterize the role of oh we used nitrobenzene as a chemical probe and investigated its degradation with copper iii periodate nitrobenzene reacts rapidly with oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and is thus suitable for oh detection however less than 5 of the nitrobenzene was degraded under the ph conditions investigated fig 3d compared with the more than 90 degradation rate of phenol fig 2c this removal of nitrobenzene could be considered negligible therefore the involvement of oh in the degradation of the contaminant by cu iii could be ignored meanwhile the negligible degradation of nitrobenzene also indicates that copper iii periodate is almost incapable of oxidizing this compound the absence of oh was consistent with the mechanism that monoperiodatocuprate iii was the major active species 3 4 effects of ionic strength and common water constituents ionic strength is an important parameter in aqueous chemistry and may influence the reactivity of cu iii stumm and morgan 2012 thus experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of ionic strength provided by na2so4 however no obvious effect from na2so4 100 mm was observed fig 4 a which suggests that the ionic strength had a negligible effect on the reactivity of copper iii periodate chloride ions cl are ubiquitous in aqueous environments because of their rapid reaction with radicals particularly so 4 a one electron oxidant the accumulation of chlorinated byproducts in aops is a concern when high levels of cl are present anipsitakis et al 2005 feng et al 2017a 2018c to evaluate the practical applicability of cu iii we investigated the effect of cl the results show that the degradation of phenol was not affected by cl with concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mm fig 4b like so 4 cu iii is also probably a one electron oxidant jose and tuwar 2007 the oxidation of cl by cu iii was expected to produce cl in the presence of excess cl the cl produced was converted to cl 2 cl 2 rapidly degrades phenol at a rate constant of 2 5 108 m 1 s 1 and the involvement of cl was expected to promote phenol degradation therefore the lack of influence from cl suggests that the reaction rate between cl and cu iii was quite limited which was further supported by the absence of obvious influence from cl on the decomposition of cu iii cl cu iii 1000 fig s5 these results are consistent with our previous report that pollutants including sulfadiazine and methylene blue can be rapidly degraded by cu3 mediated oxidation in the presence of elevated levels of cl feng et al 2017c because the cl content in surface water is generally in the range of 0 09 0 14 mm feng et al 2017b the presence of cl should not be a concern when cu iii is used to purify surface water bicarbonate ions hco 3 are also an important component of the water environment hco 3 has a pk a value of around 6 37 czapski et al 1999 so the bicarbonate ions in the buffered condition ph 7 0 existed mainly as hco 3 upon reacting with a one electron oxidant such as so 4 hco 3 can be oxidized to co 3 co 3 has a standard reduction potential of 1 59 v huang and mabury 2000 and is capable of rapid oxidation of phenol 4 9 106 m 1 s 1 chen et al 1975 fig 4c shows that hco 3 at concentrations of up to 10 mm had no obvious influence on the degradation of phenol to further clarify the effect of hco 3 we compared the decomposition of cu iii with and without hco 3 the results show that the presence of hco 3 10 mm hco 3 cu iii 1000 had no obvious effect fig s5 these observations suggest that the reaction between cu iii and hco 3 if occurs should be very slow 3 5 selectivity and applications of cu iii the release of micropollutants into aqueous environments from various sources such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products presents a great challenge schwarzenbach et al 2006 to evaluate the applicability of cu iii we evaluated the reactivity of cu iii toward representative contaminants from these sources fig 5 according to the us environmental protection agency the maximum contaminant level mcl of copper ions in drinking water is 1 3 mg l 20 μm therefore a low dose of cu iii 15 μm 0 95 mg l was used to study its reactivity to various micropollutants cu iii rapidly degraded phenols including phenol and bisphenol a and antibiotics including sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine fig 5a which suggests the potential of using cu iii to remove these compounds meanwhile the degradation of chloramphenicol atrazine and benzoic acid was comparatively slow the strong selectivity of cu iii was further evidenced by the effect of contaminants on its decomposition cu iii decomposed much more rapidly with bisphenol a than with benzoic acid fig s6 in addition nitrobenzene can hardly be degraded by cu iii fig 3d by comparing the structures of these compounds table s1 it can be concluded that the compounds that consist of a hydroxyl or amino group connected directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group were readily degraded by cu iii both hydroxyl and amino groups are electron rich moieties and their rapid degradation by cu iii is consistent with previous reports that cu iii is a one electron oxidant jose and tuwar 2007 antibiotics as emerging micropollutants are usually present in environmental matrices in low concentrations usually several hundred nanograms per liter to dozens of micrograms per liter watkinson et al 2007 although various techniques such as aops and adsorption have shown effectiveness in the removal of these compounds either the contaminant levels tested in these studies have low environmental relevance or a removal rate near 100 can hardly be achieved ahmed et al 2017 to further demonstrate the effectiveness of cu iii we studied its reactivity in the removal of several antibiotics at an environmentally relevant concentration 100 μg l the results show that the levels of three selected compounds sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine were reduced to 1 8 7 5 and 42 5 ng l respectively after only 2 min of reaction with cu iii 10 μm 0 64 mg l these results demonstrate the great effectiveness of using cu iii to remove antibiotics 4 conclusions in this study we propose a novel oxidation method in which cu iii copper iii periodate is used to remove contaminants from aqueous solutions the core active species was found to be cu iii periodate complexes e g monoperiodatocuprate iii at ph 9 0 which oxidized contaminants mainly via electron transfer cu iii showed great selectivity toward common pollutants and was particularly reactive in the removal of electron rich contaminants such as phenols and antibiotics that contain amino groups these findings suggest a highly efficient strategy to selectively remove these contaminants from aqueous solutions without generating toxic chlorinated byproducts the iodine in periodate exists in the oxidation state of 7 and in an oxidation system there is scarcely possibility for the iodine to be reduced to iodide ions i that may lead to the generation of iodinated intermediates in this study we only demonstrated the influencing factors and some properties of cu iii future efforts are needed to investigate the kinetics and measure the reaction constants between cu iii and contaminants with diverse structures in addition copper complexes are closely involved in many biological redox reactions and are potentially attractive antitumor drugs marzano et al 2009 the strong oxidizing capability and high selectivity of cu iii also suggest its applications in the design of efficient copper based metallodrugs notes the authors declare no competing financial interest

19130,trivalent copper complexes are active intermediates in aquatic redox reactions that involve copper ions or structural copper but their reactivity and selectivity toward pollutants remain unknown we characterized copper iii periodate a representative trivalent copper compound with phenol and several antibiotics as model contaminants the results show that cu iii is highly reactive to phenol degradation near complete degradation was achieved after 10 min at a molar ratio of 3 1 cu iii phenol common alcohols including methanol and 2 propanol showed ph dependent reactivity for cu iii in contrast to aquo trivalent copper ions that react rapidly with tert butanol cu iii showed limited reactivity toward tert butanol a mechanistic investigation showed that the degradation was caused by direct oxidation by cu iii and that no hydroxyl radicals were involved common water components such as chloride ions did not influence the reaction which suggests that the use of cu iii may help mitigate the generation of chlorinated products as a one electron oxidant cu iii showed high reactivity to degrade electron rich compounds the concentrations of sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine 100 μg l were reduced to 1 8 7 5 and 42 5 ng l respectively after 2 min of reaction with 10 μm cu iii these results demonstrate a novel and highly efficient oxidant for selective removal of ubiquitous micropollutants from water bodies graphical abstract image 1 keywords trivalent copper cu3 cupryl species copper iii periodate selective oxidation antibiotics 1 introduction advanced

selective than oh the former radical is highly reactive toward nucleophiles such as cl and br ball and edwards 1956 feng et al 2018a the generation of halogenated byproducts is possibly a concern in

2017c lee et al 2016 although cu3 can be generated by radiolysis of cu2 solution eq 1 k 3 2 3 5 108 m 1 s 1 cohen et al 1990 meyerstein 1971 ulanski and von sonntag 2000 and cu iii complexes such as potassium bis biureto cuprate iii brown and weser 1980 have been reported the involvement of trivalent copper in aops has yet to be experimentally identified the absence of direct evidence for trivalent copper formation as intermediates is likely due to its strong oxidizing capability particularly in its solid form the redox potential of the cu3 cu2 couple is reported to be 1 7 v and that of cu iii cu ii solid is 2 3 v popova and aksenova 2003 which is slightly greater even than that of fe vi fe iii 2 2 v 1 cu 2 oh cu 3 oh as suggested by its great reduction potential cu iii can likely serve as a strong oxidant identical to fe vi in this study we for the first time used cu iii as an oxidant to remove a variety of contaminants from water because the properties of cu iii remain unknown we investigated the factors that may influence its reactivity during such evaluations we used phenol as a target contaminant because of its well known reactions with common radical and nonradical species to characterize the selectivity of cu iii we studied the degradation of structurally diverse sets of organic compounds to evaluate the practical applicability of cu iii we investigated the removal of several antibiotics using cu iii at a level allowable for drinking water in this article cu3 and cu iii represent aquo and periodate complexed trivalent copper respectively

solutions the properties of the contaminants selected are presented in table s1 2 2 synthesis and characterization of copper iii periodate copper iii periodate was synthesized by using potassium persulfate to oxidize copper ii ions in the presence of sodium periodate balikungeri et al 1977 in a typical procedure copper ii sulfate pentahydrate 1 56 g sodium periodate 2 67 g and potassium hydroxide 8 02 g were added to a 250 ml round bottom flask containing 100 ml of ultrapure water after dissolution the solution was refluxed for 30 min and cooled to ambient temperature the resulting mixture was filtered with a glass fritted funnel and the filtrate was cooled in an ice bath to eliminate potassium sulfate the mixture obtained was filtered again with the glass funnel a sodium nitrate solution 5 m was then added dropwise to the filtrate until crystals began to form and the system was allowed to stand for 12 h to completely precipitate the crystals the resulting dark brown crystals were collected by suction filtration washed with ultrapure water to remove the remaining potassium hydroxide and dried in a lyophilizer for 12 h the composition of the prepared sample was

optical emission spectrometry optima 2100 dv perkinelmer after dissolving a known amount of copper iii periodate in 4 m h2so4 mccann et al 2016 2 3 experimental procedures unless otherwise specified all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 c 1 c in 250 ml glass beakers under magnetic stirring a stock solution of phenol 10 g l was prepared by dissolving an exact amount of phenol in ultrapure water in a typical procedure a water solution 100 ml with buffers 5 mm at a specific ph was transferred to the glass beaker and spiked with the phenol stock solution the copper iii periodate synthesized was then added to the resulting phenol solution to initiate degradation reactions aliquots 1 ml were withdrawn from each reactor with syringes at predetermined time intervals filtered with polytetrafluoroethylene membranes 0 22 μm millipore darmstadt germany and transferred to 2 ml lc vials macherey nagel düren germany for phenol analysis sodium borohydride solution 10 μl 1 m ph 12 5 was immediately spiked into the vials to prevent further degradation of phenol the effectiveness of various quenching agents was evaluated and sodium borohydride was found to be the most efficient at complete inhibition of degradation fig s1 however due to the strong reducing effect of sodium borohydride on nitrobenzene and the selected antibiotics this reductant was used only for the degradation of phenol in the cases of other contaminants sodium sulfite was used instead to quench degradation all degradation experiments were performed in triplicate the data obtained were averaged and the corresponding standard deviation was presented the possible degradation of the selected target pollutants by orthoperiodic acid io 6 5 in the synthesized copper iii complex was investigated by examining the oxidizing effect of sodium para periodate h2na3io6 the details are given in note s1 to investigate the possible reactions of cu iii with chloride ions or bicarbonate ions the consumption of cu iii with and without chloride ions bicarbonate ions was studied the quantification of cu iii was based on the adsorption of cu iii periodate complexes at 425 nm detailed procedures are listed in note s2 when the degradation of low concentrations of antibiotics 100 μg l by copper iii periodate was investigated the procedures were the same as those given above for phenol degradation except that the samples withdrawn were immediately quenched and no filtration was conducted 2 4 chemical analysis the concentration of phenol was analyzed with a waters aquity ultra performance lc uplc system

vis spectrometer wolf laboratories pocklington uk the ph was adjusted with 2 m naoh or h2so4 and was analyzed with an orion 2 star benchtop ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of copper iii periodate consistent with the report of balikungeri et al 1977 the synthesized copper iii complex was a dark brown powder inset fig 1 a to further confirm its composition the powder was characterized with x ray powder diffraction as shown most of the peaks could be exclusively indexed to a known compound of sodium potassium copper iii hydrogen iodate hydrate kna4h2cu io6 2 12h2o pdf 82 0480 fig 1a on the basis of the composition stoichiometry of this compound the copper iii content was estimated to be 9 53 however this value was higher than the measured copper iii content 7 2 likely because of the coexistence of copper free impurities as revealed by the presence of some unassigned x ray diffraction peaks fig 1a the x ray photoelectron spectrum shows binding energies of 934 4 ev and 954 3 ev for cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 fig 1b respectively in addition satellites were present at the high binding energy side of the cu 2p3 2 942 4 ev and cu 2p1 2 962 3 ev main peaks these x ray photoelectron parameters are consistent with those of previously reported copper iii complexes such as cu bi 2 brown and weser 1980 the uv vis spectrum of copper iii salt exhibits a distinct peak at around 425 nm whereas the distinct peak of cu2 ions in the non uv area was around 805 nm inset fig 1c and io 4 ions showed no obvious adsorption at wavelengths higher than 400 nm therefore the adsorption peak at around 425 nm was the characteristic peak of cu iii metal iodine oxygen stretches are presented in the wavenumber range of 400 800 cm 1 in the ft ir spectrum of copper iii periodate fig 1d which can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of the copper iii complex mccann et al 2016 meanwhile the strong peak at 3200 cm 1 suggests that noticeable amounts of water were present in the sample which is consistent with the composition of copper iii periodate kna4h2cu io6 2 12h2o 3 2 effects of cu iii doses ph values temperature and periodate ions periodate a strong oxidant was present in the synthesized copper iii complex before studying the reactivity of cu iii we investigated the potential oxidation of contaminants by sodium para periodate h2na3io6 note s1 however no degradation of the selected contaminants by io 6 5 5 mm was observed fig s2 meanwhile recent results from chen et al 2015 suggested that cu2 ions can directly oxidize certain antibiotics such as benzylpenicillin we therefore studied the possible oxidation of the selected contaminants by cu2 the results show that cu2 at a concentration of 0 5 mm had no oxidizing effect on the tested compounds after 20 min of reaction to evaluate the reactivity of cu iii the degradation of phenol was studied in the presence of various doses of cu iii fig 2 a as the oxidant dose increased from 0 05 to 0 3 mm the degradation of phenol accelerated its overall degradation rate increased from around 69 100 the ph value of the phenol solution was observed to have a complicated effect on the reactivity of cu iii fig 2b particularly during the initial reaction stage 0 5 min kinetic investigation showed that the degradation of phenol at the reaction stage from 0 to 5 min followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s3 the corresponding pseudo first order kinetics obtained showed pronounced differences and are thus used to reflect the effects of ph fig s3 in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 the greatest pseudo first order rate constant 1 85 0 08 min 1 was achieved with ph 4 5 which suggests that ph 4 5 was the optimum condition for oxidation by cu iii in the ph range of 5 5 9 0 an increase in the rate constant was observed as the ph increased fig 2b and fig s3 these effects were further shown in the degradation of tert butanol by cu iii fig s4 despite the difference in the rate constants the overall degradation of phenol varied only slightly in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 fig 2b these results suggest that copper iii has reactivity for pollutant degradation in a wide effective ph range temperature is an important parameter in aqueous reactions and its effect on the reactivity of cu iii was thus investigated the results show that the degradation of phenol by cu iii was promoted as the reaction temperature was enhanced from 25 c to 40 c fig 2c 2 h 5 io 6 h 4 io 6 h k 5 1 10 4 3 h 4 io 6 h 3 io 6 2 h k 4 9 10 9 4 h 3 io 6 2 h 2 io 6 3 h k 2 5 10 12 5 h 4 io 6 io 4 2 h 2 o k 29 6 cu hio 6 2 5 4 h 2 o cu h 3 io 6 2 4 oh 7 cu h 3 io 6 2 cuh 3 io 6 h 3 io 6 2 8 cuh 3 io 6 4 h 2 o cu oh 4 h 2 io 6 3 5 h 9 cuh 3 io 6 c 6 h 5 oh c 6 h 5 o products cu 2 periodate in water solution involves multiple equilibria eqs 2 5 byadagi et al 2013 and its existing form depends on the ph of the solution according to the equilibrium equations periodate mainly exits as h 3 io 6 2 under the basic conditions investigated in this study meanwhile cu iii periodate were proposed to exist in different forms under basic conditions eqs 6 8 lister 1953 diperiodatocuprate iii cu hio 6 2 5 monoperiodatocuprate iii cuh 3 io 6 and tetrahydroxocuprate iii cu oh 4 the equilibrium constant for the generation of tetrahydroxocuprate iii is 8 0 10 11 eq 8 so its presence in this study can be ruled out therefore diperiodatocuprate iii and monoperiodatocuprate iii may have both been responsible for the degradation of phenol under basic conditions to further clarify the contributions of these species we investigated the effect of io 6 5 fig 2d shows that the degradation of phenol was obviously decreased as the concentration of io 6 5 increased this retarding effect suggests that an equilibrium was reached between diperiodatocuprate iii and monoperiodatocuprate iii and that monoperiodatocuprate iii was the dominant active species eqs 7 and 9 phenol has a pka value of around 9 9 table s1 with the increase of the surrounding ph value from 5 to 9 the proportion of the deprotonated form of phenol phenolate was increased because cuh 3 io 6 was positively charged it might more readily attack the negatively charged phenolate c 6 h 5 o than phenol c6h5oh which explains the enhanced degradation when the ph was increased from 5 to 9 fig 2b 3 3 identification of major active species previous studies showed that cu3 and its hydrolyzed form cu oh 2 may decompose to form oh eqs 10 and 11 feng et al 2017c meyerstein 1971 ulanski and von sonntag 2000 similar decomposition of cu iii might also occur to generate oh which assisted the degradation of phenol to evaluate this hypothesis we conduced scavenging tests with various alcohols alcohols including methanol and 2 propanol were reported to have ph dependent reactivity toward cu3 meyerstein 1971 movius 1973 for instance the rate constant between methanol and cu3 was measured at 4 9 1 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 5 whereas the rate decreased to less than 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 4 meyerstein 1971 at ph 3 0 both methanol and 2 propanol exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the reactivity of cu iii the degradation of phenol decreased from nearly 100 to around 36 and 31 in the presence of methanol and 2 propanol respectively corresponding to inhibitory ratios of 64 and 69 fig 3 a respectively with the increase in the ph to 7 0 and 9 0 the adverse effects of these two alcohols were greatly reduced fig 3b and c previous results showed that cu3 reacts with tert butanol 1 0 4 107 m 1 s 1 pham et al 2013 more rapidly than with methanol 1 106 m 1 s 1 meyerstein 1971 and tert butanol was thus expected to have a more pronounced inhibitory effect however tert butanol did not obviously influence the degradation of phenol at ph 3 0 fig 3a and 7 0 fig 3b and only a slight inhibitory effect from tert butanol was observed at ph 9 0 fig 3c to further clarify these findings we investigated the degradation of tert butanol by cu iii fig s4a shows that less than 20 degradation of the tert butanol 0 1 mm was achieved under identical conditions the degradation rate of phenol was near 100 fig 2b these results suggest that cu iii and cu3 had quite different reactivity toward tert butanol and that cu3 did not likely contribute to the degradation of phenol in addition the presenting form of cu3 was regulated by the proteolytic equilibria in eq 12 johnson et al 1985 cu oh 2 has a pk a value of 3 7 and cu oh 2 has a pk a of 4 8 johnson et al 1985 although the pk a for cu3 remains unknown the value is expected to be lower than 2 5 asmus et al 1978 ulanski and von sonntag 2000 hydroxide ligand was proposed to have a stabilizing effect on cu3 and cu oh 2 and cu oh 2 both had weaker oxidizing capabilities than cu3 meyerstein 1971 however increased degradation occurred as the ph value increased from 5 5 to 9 0 which consistently demonstrates that cu3 was not involved in the equilibrium of cu iii 10 cu 3 cu 2 oh h 11 cu oh 2 cu 2 oh 12 cu 3 cu oh 2 cu oh 2 cu oh 3 to further characterize the role of oh we used nitrobenzene as a chemical probe and investigated its degradation with copper iii periodate nitrobenzene reacts rapidly with oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and is thus suitable for oh detection however less than 5 of the nitrobenzene was degraded under the ph conditions investigated fig 3d compared with the more than 90 degradation rate of phenol fig 2c this removal of nitrobenzene could be considered negligible therefore the involvement of oh in the degradation of the contaminant by cu iii could be ignored meanwhile the negligible degradation of nitrobenzene also indicates that copper iii periodate is almost incapable of oxidizing this compound the absence of oh was consistent with the mechanism that monoperiodatocuprate iii was the major active species 3 4 effects of ionic strength and common water constituents ionic strength is an important parameter in aqueous chemistry and may influence the reactivity of cu iii stumm and morgan 2012 thus experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of ionic strength provided by na2so4 however no obvious effect from na2so4 100 mm was observed fig 4 a which suggests that the ionic strength had a negligible effect on the reactivity of copper iii periodate chloride ions cl are ubiquitous in aqueous environments because of their rapid reaction with radicals particularly so 4 a one electron oxidant the accumulation of chlorinated byproducts in aops is a concern when high levels of cl are present anipsitakis et al 2005 feng et al 2017a 2018c to evaluate the practical applicability of cu iii we investigated the effect of cl the results show that the degradation of phenol was not affected by cl with concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mm fig 4b like so 4 cu iii is also probably a one electron oxidant jose and tuwar 2007 the oxidation of cl by cu iii was expected to produce cl in the presence of excess cl the cl produced was converted to cl 2 cl 2 rapidly degrades phenol at a rate constant of 2 5 108 m 1 s 1 and the involvement of cl was expected to promote phenol degradation therefore the lack of influence from cl suggests that the reaction rate between cl and cu iii was quite limited which was further supported by the absence of obvious influence from cl on the decomposition of cu iii cl cu iii 1000 fig s5 these results are consistent with our previous report that pollutants including sulfadiazine and methylene blue can be rapidly degraded by cu3 mediated oxidation in the presence of elevated levels of cl feng et al 2017c because the cl content in surface water is generally in the range of 0 09 0 14 mm feng et al 2017b the presence of cl should not be a concern when cu iii is used to purify surface water bicarbonate ions hco 3 are also an important component of the water environment hco 3 has a pk a value of around 6 37 czapski et al 1999 so the bicarbonate ions in the buffered condition ph 7 0 existed mainly as hco 3 upon reacting with a one electron oxidant such as so 4 hco 3 can be oxidized to co 3 co 3 has a standard reduction potential of 1 59 v huang and mabury 2000 and is capable of rapid oxidation of phenol 4 9 106 m 1 s 1 chen et al 1975 fig 4c shows that hco 3 at concentrations of up to 10 mm had no obvious influence on the degradation of phenol to further clarify the effect of hco 3 we compared the decomposition of cu iii with and without hco 3 the results show that the presence of hco 3 10 mm hco 3 cu iii 1000 had no obvious effect fig s5 these observations suggest that the reaction between cu iii and hco 3 if occurs should be very slow 3 5 selectivity and applications of cu iii the release of micropollutants into aqueous environments from various sources such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products presents a great challenge schwarzenbach et al 2006 to evaluate the applicability of cu iii we evaluated the reactivity of cu iii toward representative contaminants from these sources fig 5 according to the us environmental protection agency the maximum contaminant level mcl of copper ions in drinking water is 1 3 mg l 20 μm therefore a low dose of cu iii 15 μm 0 95 mg l was used to study its reactivity to various micropollutants cu iii rapidly degraded phenols including phenol and bisphenol a and antibiotics including sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine fig 5a which suggests the potential of using cu iii to remove these compounds meanwhile the degradation of chloramphenicol atrazine and benzoic acid was comparatively slow the strong selectivity of cu iii was further evidenced by the effect of contaminants on its decomposition cu iii decomposed much more rapidly with bisphenol a than with benzoic acid fig s6 in addition nitrobenzene can hardly be degraded by cu iii fig 3d by comparing the structures of these compounds table s1 it can be concluded that the compounds that consist of a hydroxyl or amino group connected directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group were readily degraded by cu iii both hydroxyl and amino groups are electron rich moieties and their rapid degradation by cu iii is consistent with previous reports that cu iii is a one electron oxidant jose and tuwar 2007 antibiotics as emerging micropollutants are usually present in environmental matrices in low concentrations usually several hundred nanograms per liter to dozens of micrograms per liter watkinson et al 2007 although various techniques such as aops and adsorption have shown effectiveness in the removal of these compounds either the contaminant levels tested in these studies have low environmental relevance or a removal rate near 100 can hardly be achieved ahmed et al 2017 to further demonstrate the effectiveness of cu iii we studied its reactivity in the removal of several antibiotics at an environmentally relevant concentration 100 μg l the results show that the levels of three selected compounds sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine were reduced to 1 8 7 5 and 42 5 ng l respectively after only 2 min of reaction with cu iii 10 μm 0 64 mg l these results demonstrate the great effectiveness of using cu iii to remove antibiotics 4 conclusions in this study we propose a novel oxidation method in which cu iii copper iii periodate is used to remove contaminants from aqueous solutions the core active species was found to be cu iii periodate complexes e g monoperiodatocuprate iii at ph 9 0 which oxidized contaminants mainly via electron transfer cu iii showed great selectivity toward common pollutants and was particularly reactive in the removal of electron rich contaminants such as phenols and antibiotics that contain amino groups these findings suggest a highly efficient strategy to selectively remove these contaminants from aqueous solutions without generating toxic chlorinated byproducts the iodine in periodate exists in the oxidation state of 7 and in an oxidation system there is scarcely possibility for the iodine to be reduced to iodide ions i that may lead to the generation of iodinated intermediates in this study we only demonstrated the influencing factors and some properties of cu iii future efforts are needed to investigate the kinetics and measure the reaction constants between cu iii and contaminants with diverse structures in addition copper complexes are closely involved in many biological redox reactions and are potentially attractive antitumor drugs marzano et al 2009 the strong oxidizing capability and high selectivity of cu iii also suggest its applications in the design of efficient copper based metallodrugs notes the authors declare no competing financial interest

to provide evidence based information on how stressors and ecologically important environmental factors interact and drive ecological processes and microbial biomass the ml technique of decision trees using the j48 algorithm was applied to build models from a data set of 342 samples collected over three seasons at 24 sites within the catchments of five gravel bed rivers in north central slovenia catchment scale land use data and reach scale environmental features indicating the hz morphology and physical and chemical characteristics of water were used as predictive variables while respiration r and microbial respiratory electron transport system activity etsa were used as response variables indicating ecological processes and total protein content tpc indicating microbial biomass separate models were built for two hz depths 5 15 cm and 20 40 cm the models with r as a response variable have the highest predictive performance 67 89 showing that r is a good indicator of complex environmental gradients the etsa and tpc models were less accurate 42 67 but still provide valuable ecological information the best model show that temperature when combined with selected water quality elements is an important predictor of r at depth of 5 15 cm the etsa and tpc models show the combined effects of temperature catchment land use and selected water quality elements on both response variables overall this study provides new knowledge on how ecological processes occurring in the hz respond to catchment and reach scale variables and provides evidence based information

is critical to assess the response of ecosystem processes to stressors if their effects on the ecosystem services that provide benefits to humans are to be properly understood von schiller et al 2017 consequently there is an increasing number of experimental studies examining the relationships between stressors and their effects on aquatic ecosystem functioning matthaei et al 2010 ferreira and

features such as river channel morphology water quality and biomass or the composition of biological communities whereas ecosystem functioning describes those processes that regulate energy and matter flux in an ecosystem sandin and solimini 2009 biologically driven ecosystem processes include organic matter decomposition nutrient cycling metabolism and pollutant and community dynamics von schiller et al 2017 although the eu water framework directive eu 2000 defines ecological status as an expression of the quality of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems associated with surface waters there remains a greater scientific understanding of the structural characteristics of freshwater ecosystems there has been much less progress made towards developing and standardizing methods that measure ecosystem functioning or that incorporate them into a river ecological status assessment palmer and febria 2012 one of the advantages of functional measures or indicators is that they can

exceed their natural ranges and hence act as stressors and their impact on selected ecological indicators in the hz were investigated by induction of decision trees three types of ecological indicators were used as response variables respiration oxygen consumption measured in situ r respiratory potential measured as respiratory electron transport system activity at 15 c etsa and total protein content tpc as a proxy for microbial biomass these indicators are relatively simple to measure have been well studied in aquatic ecosystems and are sensitive indicators of ecosystem stress e g hill et al 2000 franken et al 2001 simčič et al 2015 to encompass spatial and temporal variability data was collected over three seasons spring summer winter five catchments and at two hz depths the objectives of this paper are to a evaluate the sensitivity of ecological indicators to multiple stressors occurring together with naturally fluctuating environmental factors and b identify the interactions between multiple stressors and environmental factors to find the best predictors of the measured ecological indicators both by using ml tools 2 methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in five pre alpine catchments gradaščica kamniška bistrica kokra selška sora and tržiška bistrica located in north central slovenia in se europe fig 1 the catchment areas range from 146 km2 to 539 km2 with rivers from 27 to 34 km in length the elevation of study sites ranges from 262 to 490 m a s l in area with predominant carbonate and or silicate geology e g upper triassic limestone and dolomite tufa sandstones conglomerate clay and marls komac 2005 mean annual precipitation ranges from 1100 to 2200 mm and the mean annual discharges are from 2 9 to 8 8 m3 s 1 slovenian environmental agency the dominant land use in all five catchments is natural mixed coniferous and deciduous forest a moderate increase of agricultural including arable land and grasslands and urban land use including towns residential areas industrial zones is observed longitudinally the rivers are partially channelized especially in urban areas instream weirs i e low head dams and embankments are also present which are used to moderate flow prevent flooding in most agricultural areas riparian zone is dominated by willow alder and species typical of the region while in urban areas embankments prevent the development of a riparian strip 2 2 data collection land use data were extracted from the polygon database of the slovenian ministry for the agriculture forestry and food the proportion of land use types forest agricultural urban was determined for the contributing part of the catchment upstream of each sampling site and for the 250 m impact zone adjacent to the studied river segment the samples were collected at 24 autumn and winter 2013 and 9 spring 2014 locations within five experimental catchments to encompass the variability in adjacent land use pressures reach scale environmental features and ecological responses samples were takenat riffle mesohabitats of the river where the hz is rarely studied but are of great ecological importance for biota and extend over large parts of the streambed storey et al 2003 at each sampling site three spatial replicates were selected within the river channel in order to take into the account the reach scale variability in the data the data were gathered at two depths 5 15 and 20 40 cm in order to observe differences in ecological processes biomass amount along a vertical gradient which is an important controlling factor of ecological processes in the hz storey et al 2003 during the spring the number of sampling sites was lower due to high water levels that prevented sampling as specific locations respiration at depth of 20 40 cm was measured only in spring resulting in 27 data records at each site and at each depth the water temperature conductivity ph and oxygen levels were measured in triplicate using field probes wtw multi 3430 set while water samples were collected for laboratory analysis once in the laboratory alkalinity was measured using gran titrations ion chromatography metrohm 761 compact

determined using the non purgeable organic carbon npoc method analytic jena multi c n 3100 sediment samples for in situ r etsa and tpc measurements at hz depth of 5 15 cm were obtained using a pvc sampling tube 30 cm width 60 cm high sediment from the bottom of the sampling tube was collected after removing the surface layer and sieved through a 5 mm mesh sieve part of the sample was used for in situ r and part was used for etsa and tpc measurements sediment samples from a depth of 20 40 cm were obtained using the bou rouch method bou and rouch 1967 where a perforated pipe 5 mm apertures

analyses are described in detail in mori et al 2017 and debeljak et al 2017 2 3 database and data pre processing the data used to build the models were composed of predictors i e environmental variables and response variables indicating ecological processes and microbial biomass the majority of ecologically relevant environmental parameters were included in the study as predictors some of these parameters either exceed or fall below typical values for this region and were indicated as stressors typical ranges for this region were obtained by including measurements only from pristine i e forested locations where anthropogenic pressures such as agricultural or urban land use pollution and geomorphological pressures were not present prior to analyses manual data discretization of the measured response variables was performed for this purpose new discrete valued attributes i e low med and high were used to replace the measured numeric response attributes the discretization was performed differently for each dataset separately for each sampling depht and for each target response variable r etsa and tpc this was done to ensure equal representation of the three classes in the dataset additionally to data discretization automatic attribute selection techniques included in weka witten et al 2011 were employed in order to improve the modelling accuracy these techniques discard irrelevant or redundant attributes from a given dataset the first technique applied was information gain attribute ranking hall and holmes 2003 which evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the information gain with respect to the class however this method does not take into account attribute interaction another technique used for evaluating subsets of attributes rather than individual attributes is the correlation based feature selection cfs hall 1999 the cfs algorithm takes into account the usefulness of individual attributes for predicting class and the level of inter correlation among them the method values subsets that correlate highly with class value and have low correlation with each other 2 4 decision trees decision trees are hierarchical structures composed of three types of nodes a root internal nodes and leaves connected by branches the root is the starting node situated at the top of the decision tree and together with the internal nodes contain tests on the input attributes the leaves terminal nodes contain the predictions of the target class values decision trees are interpreted in terms of if then rules gal et al 2013 in this study decision trees were built using j48 algorithm which is java s re implementation of the c4 5 algorithm quinlan 1993 incorporated into the machine learning package weka witten et al 2011 the j48 algorithm repeatedly partitions the original dataset into subsets as homogeneously as possible in terms of number of examples with respect to the target variable its most important tasks involve finding the optimal splitting values of the measured attributes and the most accurate prediction of the target pruning was applied to cope with decision tree complexity and avoid overfitting pruning improves the transparency of the induced trees by reducing their size as well as enhancing the classification accuracy by eliminating errors resulting from noisy data bratko 1989 during tree construction forward pruning by implementing the minimum number of instances criterion was applied according to this criterion every leaf should contain a minimum number of examples otherwise no branching is allowed decision trees learn from using a training data set the quality of the constructed model i e the accuracy of prediction or predictive performance is expressed as a percentage of correctly classified instances cci for the purpose of generalization and model re usability e g application in other similar catchments different validation procedures were applied first automatic cross validation cv was used where the original dataset was randomly partitioned into a chosen number of folds n 10 during each turn a fold was used for testing while the remaining 9 folds were used for training the final error was given as the average error from all the generated models next manual validation was applied by splitting the original dataset into five subsets based on the experimental catchments the aim was to investigate whether the selection of particular catchments for training the decision tree models improves their predictive performance in turn each data subset samples collected within the catchment was used for testing while the remaining data set samples collected within the remaining four catchments was used for training the model 3 results 3 1 hyporheic zone environmental conditions and microbial respiration and biomass spatial analysis revealed that within the study area the proportion of agricultural and urban land use in the buffer zone was up to 0 84 and 0 93 respectively while at certain sites native forest was completely absent table 1 with the exception of ntot water chemistry parameters were outside of their natural ranges while temperature and ph were within typical ranges for this area considering native forests overgrown with no anthropogenic influence similarly fs and fom both indicate clogging and individual sediment fractions exceeded reference values while pom was below the normal range at some sites respiration rates r ranged from values close to zero to 1 2 and from 0 4 to 3 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 at 5 15 cm and 20 40 cm respectively table 2 etsa at 5 15 cm was from 0 0 to 2 8 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 and from 0 0 to 3 3 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 at 20 40 cm tpc ranged from 20 9 to 468 9 and from 87 2 to 1693 2 μg protein g dwsed 1 for the two depths respectively simple regression plots show a significant increase in r etsa and tpc with temperature at both measured depth ranges respiration measured at 5 15 cm showed the strongest dependence on temperature r2 0 62 fig 2 a significant but weak relationship was observed between catchment urban land use and r at 5 15 cm etsa and tpc but not with r at 20 40 cm the strongest dependence of etsa on proportion of urban land use was observed at 5 15 cm and of etsa and tpc at 20 40 cm a significant and very weak r2 0 2 relationship was between ammonium and all three response variables r etsa tpc at both depths 3 2 predictive performances of decision tree models when a stratified 10 fold cross validation cv was applied to the whole data set the models were relatively highly predictive cci above 50 table 3 the explanatory power of the decision trees was the highest for the model using r as response variable and data from the depth 5 15 cm the model based on data from the 20 40 cm hz layer and r performed much worse most likely due to a lack of data the predictive performances of models using data from both depths and etsa and tpc were satisfactory cci 50 a modest variation in the models predictive performance was observed using an array of models built by dividing the data set into training four catchments and testing one catchment subsets table 3 3 3 response of ecological indicators and environmental factors multiple stressors interactions decision tree models demonstrated that at 5 15 cm temperature at a threshold of 9 3 c is the most important factor affecting the intensity of riverbed respiration fig 3 a the model also shows that below 6 2 c there is no interaction with other stressor or environmental variables at temperatures between 6 2 and 9 3 c the presence of sulphate 6 5 mg l 1 leads to low rates of r at temperatures above 9 3 c dissolved nitrite no2 potassium k calcium ca2 and sulphate so4 3 are important variables determining moderate to high r rates the decision tree for the hz layer at 20 40 cm and r were less accurate 38 cci but still provide valuable information regarding the importance of sediment composition and hydraulic conductivity for respiration fig 3b models using etsa as the response variable reveal the importance of temperature in interaction with land use and water chemistry fig 4 a at depths of 5 15 cm the combination of temperature 9 3 c and either ca2 content 62 5 mg l 1 or the interaction of ca2 62 5 mg l 1 and ntot 0 93 mg l 1 resulted in a high etsa 0 6 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 alternatively the interaction of temperature 9 3 c and low urban land use in the catchment 0 02 results in low etsa 0 3 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 at 20 40 cm the best model using etsa shows the importance of forest within the catchment area fig 4b when native forests covered 0 79 of the catchment etsa was low 0 2 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 however etsa was also low when forest covered 0 79 this was observed when temperatures were extremely low 5 6 c higher than 5 6 c and in interaction with land use or higher than 12 c and in interaction with land use and sulphate concentrations the model for 5 15 cm depth using tpc as response variable fig 5 a shows that increased ammonium nh4 concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 resulted in a high microbial biomass tpc on the other hand nh4 concentration 0 1 mg l 1 with doc 4 8 mg l 1 and a low urban land use 0 04 in the catchment resulted in a low tpc the model exhibited much more complex interactions between predictors when using data from 20 to 40 cm depth fig 5b for instance when urban land use in the catchment was 0 03 and proportion of forest in the 250 m buffer zone was 0 03 the level of microbial biomass was the highest during winter the interaction of catchment urban land use 0 03 buffer zone urban land use 0 60 and nh4 concentrations 0 06 mg l 1 was linked with low level of biomass interestingly at lower levels of nh4 in the presence of agricultural land in the catchment 0 15 biomass was still low during summer low biomass was shaped by the interaction of catchment urban land use 0 03 buffer zone urban land use 0 60 and high ca2 concentrations 60 5 mg l 1 4 discussion this study provides new information on the ranges of hyporhec respiration rates and productivity measured as microbial biomass across several pre alpine catchments under a gradient of anthropogenic pressures the decision tree models improved understanding of the causal relationship between multiple stressors and environmental factors on one side and hyporheic microbial metabolism and biomass on the other side they also provided the threshold values of specific environmental factors below above which we can expect an increase or decrease of respiration potential respiration and microbial biomass within the hz when developing models we considered measured variables of different types land use temperature water chemistry and sediment structure by applying attribute selection techniques all irrelevant or redundant variables having no or very little impact on the selected response variable were automatically removed the temperature land use and water chemistry including elevated concentrations of sulphate so4 2 nitrite no2 ammonium nh4 potassium k calcium ca2 and or dissolved organic carbon doc were recognized as the most important factors for hz microbial respiration r etsa and biomass tpc 4 1 decision tree model development and validation a comparison of the models built by a dividing the data set into training and testing subsets based on catchment units train test method and b a stratified 10 fold cross validation cv shows that the generated models performed well only a modest variation in the predictive performances of the models was observed when using data from different catchments as the testing data sets in aquatic ecology the most widely used approach to evaluate decision tree models is to employ the 10 fold cross validation dakou et al 2007 gal et al 2013 however when working with larger data sets from several catchments it is important to test whether the catchment as a random variable affects the modelling results this study demonstrates the important effect of catchment selection on the model performance and show that predictive performance can be improved by combining data from different catchments to form larger data sets when applying cv to the whole data set the models that predict etsa and tpc using data from 20 to 40 cm depth performed slightly better than models using data from the 5 15 cm depth this suggests that there must be some additional environmental factors or stressors influencing the measured indicators at 5 15 cm depth such as surface flow velocity shear stress permeability and hydraulic conductivity hydrological parameters are important drivers of hz processes boulton et al 1998 and should be included in the models in the future to obtain better predictions despite the high complexity and heterogeneity of the data the models proved accurate for all three response variables and depths the only exception was when predicting r at a depth of 20 40 cm where the data set was smaller due to lack of data in general complex ecological data sets from spatially and temporally dynamic environments with hierarchical organization and the catchment as a major unit are difficult to analyse using standard statistical methods where assumptions such as homoscedasticity independent and normally distributed residuals no multicollinearity etc have to be fulfilled downes et al 2002 on the other hand ml tools allow for working with noisy data sets from complex and dynamic domains gal et al 2013 the best models were built using r as a response variable respiration is a good functional indicator of natural dynamics doering et al 2011 and anthropogenic stress e g eutrophication hill et al 2000 janssens et al 2001 since r directly depends on temperature and nutrient availability it represents an immediate response of microbial community to actual short term environmental conditions simčič et al 2015 the models with the least predictive power are those that use tpc as a response variable tpc indicates biomass of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances proteins in the samples and is therefore a structural indicator of long term ecosystem condition franken et al 2001 the models that use etsa were slightly better etsa measures overall enzymatic activity maximum reaction rate of respiratory electron transport system at standard temperature and without substrate limitation and is a reflection of environmental conditions on longer term equilibrium of etsa is attained after a few days in the altered environment simčič et al 2015 this study finds that for the hz in gravel bed rivers more accurate models can be built using response variables that reflect ecosystem function r etsa rather than structure tpc up to now the high potential of functional indicators for detecting anthropogenic impacts has been emphasised many times sandin and solimini 2009 palmer and febria 2012 von schiller et al 2017 this models can be used for modelling respiration potential respiration and protein content within the hz of other subalpine catchments as long as they share similar characteristics to those of the 5 experimental catchments comparable proportion of land use and similar ranges of environmental factors based on the measured environmental parameters in any such catchment the magnitude of respiration and microbial biomass can be determined also the models can be used to predict changes in magnitude of respiration and biomass in a case some environmental factor changes as long as its value stays within the initial range of values used for building the models in this study 4 2 between stressor and stressor ecological indicators linkages this study finds that water temperature is an important predictor of functional indicators r etsa but is irrelevant for predicting structural indicator tpc response this was shown also with simple regression plots where relationships between the temperature and response variables were significant but strength of correlation was weaker for tpc indicating that the temperature influences microbial biomass in complex interactions with other environmental factors in general an increasing temperature accelerates chemical reactions and enhances biological processes such as metabolic rate microbial growth and activity davidson and janssens 2006 mora gomez et al 2016 based on previous studies simčič and mori 2007 mori et al 2017 debeljak et al 2017 it is expected that temperature will be an important predictor of r but not for etsa which reflects environmental conditions on longer term and that the effects of temperature decreases with depth hester et al 2009 according to hill et al 2000 there is a significant relationship between sediment r and temperature and several chemical variables they emphasised the different extent to which temperature influences r in water bodies they concluded that the temperature r relationship is not simple causality and that more complex models and further research is necessary for making solid predictions some of the reasons for this are that the temperature effects on microbial activity is resource dependent and that microbial communities are functionally adapted or acclimated to in situ temperature hall et al 2010 an important finding is that the causal relationship between temperature and r depends on temperature range when water temperatures are extremely low a simple temperature r relationship is observed while at higher temperatures complex interactions between temperature and dissolved ions influences the intensity of r this suggests that when environmental temperatures are extremely low they act as the only limiting factor however when the water temperature is considered optimal i e 10 30 c e g mora gomez et al 2016 microbial community respiration rates responds also to changes in the water chemistry such as nitrite potassium calcium and sulphate concentrations in a case of sulphate it seems that it is connected with decreased respiration at two thresholds i e 6 5 and 17 3 mg l 1 depending on temperature at low temperatures medium r occurs but when sulphate concentration exceeds the threshold r is low similarly at optimal water temperatures high r occurs but when concentrations exceed the threshold r is of medium values this indicates the importance of temperature when looking at the influence of sulphate on hyporheic respiration in contrast to previous studies e g mori et al 2017 this study showed the importance of temperatures also for etsa the models for 5 15 cm depth shows that the temperature was the most important predictor for etsa large temperature ranges and structurally similar habitats used in this study are most probably the reason for this similarly as for r interactions with water chemistry parameters were important for the model but catchment urban land use was additional important predictor for etsa at 5 15 cm land use modifies in stream factors controlling river metabolism through increased nutrient sediment and pollutant runoff from agricultural and urban sources ponsatí et al 2015 these impacts are confounded with catchment natural characteristics climate geology soil vegetation type that also alter in stream abiotic properties allan 2004 a single river study indicated significant relationship between etsa and nutrients no3 but not temperature influence while the impact of land use was not studied simčič and mori 2007 presence of forest in the catchment was the most important predictor for the model based on data the depths of 20 40 cm which was more complex than the one for the depth of 5 15 cm together with less forest in the catchment the temperature and sulphate were important for the predicting etsa rates wherever natural forest is removed from the riparian zone and whole catchment streams and rivers are usually warmer during summer and primary production usually increases due to the lack of shadow allan 2004 this consequently leads to increased hz nutrient input and increased microbial activity here similarly to the model with r at 5 15 cm sulphate in combination with land use supressed or induced etsa rates depending on water temperature these results show the importance of anthropogenic sulphate inputs for river metabolism that can act either as an inhibitor or as stimulator of metabolism for models predicting microbial biomass estimated using tpc a combination of nh4 doc and catchment urban land use was important for depth of 5 15 cm clearly nutrients such as nh4 or doc can act as stimulator of tpc when exceed a certain threshold or inhibitors when nutrients are below certain level especially when in interaction with presence of low proportion of urban land use in the catchment similar to etsa at 20 40 cm land use when combined season nh4 ca2 were the main predictor that influences tpc at 20 40 cm depth a study of hendricks 1996 partly reflects the patterns from this study they demonstrated a significant impact of season depth and zone upwelling downwelling for microbial biomass in the hyporheic zone they also found inconsistent pattern in microbial response to increased doc that was linked with the season 5 conclusions this study contributes new knowledge about catchment scale patterns and drivers influencing respiration and microbial biomass in the hyporheic zone decision trees based on data from five gravel bed rivers confirmed the important role that temperature and nutrient inputs from anthropogenic activities have on hyporheic processes and structure and provided new information on the importance of land use and the interactions between stressors and environmental factors on microbial activity and biomass as demonstrated the selection of measure either functional or structural and sampling depth is important for explaining the causal relationship between environment and biological responses in general temperature alone or in interaction with other stressors indicating point or diffuse pollution is one the most important predictors of functional measures respiration and respiratory electron transport system activity when looking at structural measure i e microbial biomass the catchment land use and the nutrients are critical a highly relevant finding is that for the study area an individual stressor such as sulphate or nitrite can act as a stimulator or inhibitor of biological processes when exceeding certain threshold values moreover when combined with other environmental variables and stressors it can have the same impact even if it falls below the defined threshold value however larger data sets over larger geographical ranges are needed to confirm these patterns these findings demonstrate that it is important to consider interactions between stressors when developing management plans for freshwater ecosystems and that climate change will have more pronounced effect on ecosystem functioning then structure by accelerating biological processes due to increased temperatures declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19131,integrity of freshwater surface and groundwater ecosystems and their ecological and qualitative status greatly depends on ecological processes taking place in streambed sediments overgrown by biofilm in the hyporheic zone hz little is known about the interactions and effects of multiple stressors on biologically driven processes in the hz in this study machine learning ml tools were used to provide evidence based information on how stressors and ecologically important environmental factors interact and drive ecological processes and microbial biomass the ml technique of decision trees using the j48 algorithm was applied to build models from a data set of 342 samples collected over three seasons at 24 sites within the catchments of five gravel bed rivers in north central slovenia catchment scale land use data and reach scale environmental features indicating the hz morphology and physical and chemical characteristics of water were used as predictive variables while respiration r and microbial respiratory electron transport system activity etsa were used as response variables indicating ecological processes and total protein content tpc indicating microbial biomass separate models were built for two hz depths 5 15 cm and 20 40 cm the models with r as a response variable have the highest predictive performance 67 89 showing that r is a good indicator of complex environmental gradients the etsa and tpc models were less accurate 42 67 but still provide valuable ecological information the best model show that temperature when combined with selected water quality elements is an important predictor of r at depth of 5 15 cm the etsa and tpc models show the combined effects of temperature catchment land use and selected water quality elements on both response variables overall this study provides new knowledge on how ecological processes occurring in the hz respond to catchment and reach scale variables and provides evidence based information about complex interactions between temperature catchment land use and water quality these interactions are highly dependent on the selection of the response variable i e each response variable is influenced by a specific combination of predictive environmental variables graphical abstract image 1 keywords machine learning ecosystem processes water quality stressors freshwater biofilm hyporheic zone 1 introduction freshwaters are affected by a diversified array of anthropogenic stressors that often interact and are at the same time directly or indirectly linked to biological responses interacting stressors can have combined effects the same additive greater synergistic or smaller antagonistic than the sum of their individual effects piggott et al 2015 understanding the effects of single stressors multiple stressors and their interactions is a precondition for effective catchment management and river rehabilitation or restoration palmer et al 2005 pavlin et al 2011 moreover it is critical to assess the response of ecosystem processes to stressors if their effects on the ecosystem services that provide benefits to humans are to be properly understood von schiller et al 2017 consequently there is an increasing number of experimental studies examining the relationships between stressors and their effects on aquatic ecosystem functioning matthaei et al 2010 ferreira and chauvet 2011 ponsatí et al 2016 moreover several conceptual models and analytical frameworks looking at the impact of multiple stressors on surface and groundwater ecosystems have been developed jackson et al 2016 feld et al 2016 kaandorp et al 2018 stressors affect both the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems vinebrooke et al 2004 ecosystem structure is characterized by physical features such as river channel morphology water quality and biomass or the composition of biological communities whereas ecosystem functioning describes those processes that regulate energy and matter flux in an ecosystem sandin and solimini 2009 biologically driven ecosystem processes include organic matter decomposition nutrient cycling metabolism and pollutant and community dynamics von schiller et al 2017 although the eu water framework directive eu 2000 defines ecological status as an expression of the quality of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems associated with surface waters there remains a greater scientific understanding of the structural characteristics of freshwater ecosystems there has been much less progress made towards developing and standardizing methods that measure ecosystem functioning or that incorporate them into a river ecological status assessment palmer and febria 2012 one of the advantages of functional measures or indicators is that they can be translated directly into the concept of ecosystem services von schiller et al 2017 many important ecosystem processes in running waters takes place in the hyporheic zone hz i e the transition zone between surface and groundwater orghidan 1959 krause et al 2017 here active regions of carbon flux occur together with the mixing of ground and surface water boulton et al 1998 battin et al 2009 this hydrologically highly dynamic and biologically sensitive system is a suitable environment for implementing functional indicator framework to identify impacts new stressors in the catchments and a reduction in ecosystem services such as reduced self purification processes sediment respiration oxygen consumption r is frequently used to measure the response of the hz ecosystem function to natural conditions and anthropogenic pressures hill et al 2000 hadwen et al 2010 doering et al 2011 other functional parameters include microbial metabolic activity assays such as fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis fda potential denitrification enzyme activity dea substrate induced respiration sir extracellular phosphatase activity epa and respiratory electron transport system activity etsa simčič and mori 2007 aristi et al 2015 ponsati et al 2016 various studies have shown the sensitivity of these parameters to temperature hill et al 2000 doering et al 2011 nutrients hill et al 2000 pollution gradient aristi et al 2015 hydro morphological features simčič and mori 2007 nogaro et al 2013 land use debeljak et al 2017 and newly emerging pollutants ponsati et al 2016 since multiple stressors and naturally fluctuating environmental factors simultaneously influence most ecosystems their consequences are often unpredictable especially when based on single stressor mathaei et al 2010 to date only a few studies have investigated the response of functional variables on the combined effects of selected stressors such as temperature and nutrients ferreira and chauvet 2011 rosa et al 2013 or nutrient enrichment the amount of fine sediment and water abstraction matthaei et al 2010 in a recent review nõges et al 2017 concluded that despite an extensive basic knowledge of aquatic ecology only a few studies actually provide measurable evidence on multi stress effects and most models either represent a single water body or are based on a single survey nowadays new tools and approaches of data processing exist that can help to explain some of the phenomena discussed above for example machine learning ml methods have the ability to discover complex patterns in data sets and allow in depth analyses gal et al 2013 decision tree induction quinlan 1986 is a ml approach that allows the user to apply recursive data partitioning techniques to construct automatically a model decision tree for predicting variables with nominal values the advantage of decision tree methods compared to statistical methods is that they are nonparametric methods i e do make no assumption about the distribution of the dependent variable and have a higher interpretative power than majority of the statistical methods gal et al 2013 decision trees have been successfully applied in predicting

carried out in five pre alpine catchments gradaščica kamniška bistrica kokra selška sora and tržiška bistrica located in north central slovenia in se europe fig 1 the catchment areas range from 146 km2 to 539 km2 with rivers from 27 to 34 km in length the elevation of study sites ranges from 262 to 490 m a s l in area with predominant carbonate and or silicate geology e g upper triassic

land use including towns residential areas industrial zones is observed longitudinally the rivers are partially channelized especially in urban areas instream weirs i e low head dams and embankments are also present which are used to moderate flow prevent flooding in most agricultural areas riparian zone is dominated by willow alder and species typical of the region while in urban areas embankments prevent the development of a riparian strip 2 2 data collection land use data were extracted from the polygon database of the slovenian ministry for the agriculture forestry and food the proportion of land use types forest agricultural urban was determined for the contributing part of the catchment upstream of each sampling site and for the 250 m impact zone adjacent to the studied river segment the samples were collected at 24 autumn and winter 2013 and 9 spring 2014 locations within five experimental catchments to encompass the variability in adjacent land use pressures reach scale environmental features and ecological responses samples were takenat riffle mesohabitats of the river where the hz is rarely studied but are of great ecological importance for biota and extend over large parts of the streambed storey et al 2003 at each sampling site three spatial replicates were selected within the river channel in order to take into the account the reach scale variability in the data the data were gathered at two depths 5 15 and 20 40 cm in order to observe differences in ecological processes biomass amount along a vertical gradient which is an important controlling factor of ecological processes in the hz storey et al 2003 during the spring the number of sampling sites was lower due to high water levels that prevented sampling as specific locations respiration

sampling tube 30 cm width 60 cm high sediment from the bottom of the sampling tube was collected after removing the surface layer and sieved through a 5 mm mesh sieve part of the sample was used for in situ r and part was used for etsa and tpc measurements sediment samples from a depth of 20 40 cm were obtained using the bou rouch method bou and rouch 1967 where a perforated pipe 5 mm apertures

analyses are described in detail in mori et al 2017 and debeljak et al 2017 2 3 database and data pre processing the data used to build the models were composed of predictors i e environmental variables and response variables indicating ecological processes and microbial biomass the majority of ecologically relevant environmental parameters were included in the study as predictors some of these parameters either exceed or fall below typical values for this region and were indicated as stressors typical ranges for this region were obtained by including measurements only from pristine i e forested locations where anthropogenic pressures such as agricultural or urban land use pollution and geomorphological pressures were not present prior to analyses manual data discretization of the measured response variables was performed for this purpose new discrete valued attributes i e low med and high were used to replace the measured numeric response attributes the discretization was performed differently for each dataset separately for each sampling depht and for each target response variable r etsa and tpc this was done to ensure equal representation of the three classes in the dataset additionally to data discretization automatic attribute selection techniques included in weka witten et al 2011 were employed in order to improve the modelling accuracy these techniques discard irrelevant or redundant attributes from a given dataset the first technique applied was information gain attribute ranking hall and holmes 2003 which evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the information gain with respect to the class however this method does not take into account attribute interaction another technique used for evaluating subsets of attributes rather than individual attributes is the correlation based feature selection cfs hall 1999 the cfs algorithm takes into account the usefulness of individual attributes for predicting class and the level of inter correlation among them the method values subsets that correlate highly with class value and have low correlation with each other 2 4 decision trees decision trees are hierarchical structures composed of three types of nodes a root internal nodes and leaves connected by branches the root is the starting node situated at the top of the decision tree and together with the internal nodes contain tests on the input attributes the leaves terminal nodes contain the predictions of the target class values decision trees are interpreted in terms of if then rules gal et al 2013 in this study decision trees were built using j48 algorithm which is java s re implementation of the c4 5 algorithm quinlan 1993 incorporated into the machine learning package weka witten et al 2011 the j48 algorithm repeatedly partitions the original dataset into subsets as homogeneously as possible in terms of number of examples with respect to the target variable its most important tasks involve finding the optimal splitting values of the measured attributes and the most accurate prediction of the target pruning was applied to cope with decision tree complexity and avoid overfitting pruning improves the transparency of the induced trees by reducing their size as well as enhancing the classification accuracy by eliminating errors resulting from noisy data bratko 1989 during tree construction forward pruning by implementing the minimum number of instances criterion was applied according to this criterion every leaf should contain a minimum number of examples otherwise no branching is allowed decision trees learn from using a training data set the quality of the constructed model i e the accuracy of prediction or predictive performance is expressed as a percentage of correctly classified instances cci for the purpose of generalization and model re usability e g application in other similar catchments different validation procedures were applied first automatic cross validation cv was used where the original dataset was randomly partitioned into a chosen number of folds n 10 during each turn a fold was used for testing while the remaining 9 folds were used for training the final error was given as the average error from all the generated models next manual validation was applied by splitting the original dataset into five subsets based on the experimental catchments the aim was to investigate whether the selection of particular catchments for training the decision tree models improves their predictive performance in turn each data subset samples collected within the catchment was used for testing while the remaining data set samples collected within the remaining four catchments was used for training the model 3 results 3 1 hyporheic zone environmental conditions and microbial respiration and biomass spatial analysis revealed that within the study area the proportion of agricultural and urban land use in the buffer zone was up to 0 84 and 0 93 respectively while at certain sites native forest was completely absent table 1 with the exception of ntot water chemistry parameters were outside of their natural ranges while temperature and ph were within typical ranges for this area considering native forests overgrown with no anthropogenic influence similarly fs and fom both indicate clogging and individual sediment fractions exceeded reference values while pom was below the normal range at some sites respiration rates r ranged from values close to zero to 1 2 and from 0 4 to 3 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 at 5 15 cm and 20 40 cm respectively table 2 etsa at 5 15 cm was from 0 0 to 2 8 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 and from 0 0 to 3 3 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 at 20 40 cm tpc ranged from 20 9 to 468 9 and from 87 2 to 1693 2 μg protein g dwsed 1 for the two depths respectively simple regression plots show a significant increase in r etsa and tpc with temperature at both measured depth ranges respiration measured at 5 15 cm showed the strongest dependence on temperature r2 0 62 fig 2 a significant but weak relationship was observed between catchment urban land use and r at 5 15 cm etsa and tpc but not with r at 20 40 cm the strongest dependence of etsa on proportion of urban land use was observed at 5 15 cm and of etsa and tpc at 20 40 cm a significant and very weak r2 0 2 relationship was between ammonium and all three response variables r etsa tpc at both depths 3 2 predictive performances of decision tree models when a stratified 10 fold cross validation cv was applied to the whole data set the models were relatively highly predictive cci above 50 table 3 the explanatory power of the decision trees was the highest for the model using r as response variable and data from the depth 5 15 cm the model based on data from the 20 40 cm hz layer and r performed much worse most likely due to a lack of data the predictive performances of models using data from both depths and etsa and tpc were satisfactory cci 50 a modest variation in the models predictive performance was observed using an array of models built by dividing the data set into training four catchments and testing one catchment subsets table 3 3 3 response of ecological indicators and environmental factors multiple stressors interactions decision tree models demonstrated that at 5 15 cm temperature at a threshold of 9 3 c is the most important factor affecting the intensity of riverbed respiration fig 3 a the model also shows that below 6 2 c there is no interaction with other stressor or environmental variables at temperatures between 6 2 and 9 3 c the presence of sulphate 6 5 mg l 1 leads to low rates of r at temperatures above 9 3 c dissolved nitrite no2 potassium k calcium ca2 and sulphate so4 3 are important variables determining moderate to high r rates the decision tree for the hz layer at 20 40 cm and r were less accurate 38 cci but still provide valuable information regarding the importance of sediment composition and hydraulic conductivity for respiration fig 3b models using etsa as the response variable reveal the importance of temperature in interaction with land use and water chemistry fig 4 a at depths of 5 15 cm the combination of temperature 9 3 c and either ca2 content 62 5 mg l 1 or the interaction of ca2 62 5 mg l 1 and ntot 0 93 mg l 1 resulted in a high etsa 0 6 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 alternatively the interaction of temperature 9 3 c and low urban land use in the catchment 0 02 results in low etsa 0 3 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 at 20 40 cm the best model using etsa shows the importance of forest within the catchment area fig 4b when native forests covered 0 79 of the catchment etsa was low 0 2 μl o2 g dwsed 1 h 1 however etsa was also low when forest covered 0 79 this was observed when temperatures were extremely low 5 6 c higher than 5 6 c and in interaction with land use or higher than 12 c and in interaction with land use and sulphate concentrations the model for 5 15 cm depth using tpc as response variable fig 5 a shows that increased ammonium nh4 concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 resulted in a high microbial biomass tpc on the other hand nh4 concentration 0 1 mg l 1 with doc 4 8 mg l 1 and a low urban land use 0 04 in the catchment resulted in a low tpc the model exhibited much more complex interactions between predictors when using data from 20 to 40 cm depth fig 5b for instance when urban land use in the catchment was 0 03 and proportion of forest in the 250 m buffer zone was 0 03 the level of microbial biomass was the highest during winter the interaction of catchment urban land use 0 03 buffer zone urban land use 0 60 and nh4 concentrations 0 06 mg l 1 was linked with low level of biomass interestingly at lower levels of nh4 in the presence of agricultural land in the catchment 0 15 biomass was still low during summer low biomass was shaped by the interaction of catchment urban land use 0 03 buffer zone urban land use 0 60 and high ca2 concentrations 60 5 mg l 1 4 discussion this study provides new information on the ranges of hyporhec respiration rates and productivity measured as microbial biomass across several pre alpine catchments under a gradient of anthropogenic pressures the decision tree models improved understanding of the causal relationship between multiple stressors and environmental factors on one side and hyporheic microbial metabolism and biomass on the other side they also provided the threshold values of specific environmental factors below above which we can expect an increase or decrease of respiration potential respiration and microbial biomass within the hz when developing models we considered measured variables of different types land use temperature water chemistry and sediment structure by applying attribute selection techniques all irrelevant or redundant variables having no or very little impact on the selected response variable were automatically removed the temperature land use and water chemistry including elevated concentrations of sulphate so4 2 nitrite no2 ammonium nh4 potassium k calcium ca2 and or dissolved organic carbon doc were recognized as the most important factors for hz microbial respiration r etsa and biomass tpc 4 1 decision tree model development and validation a comparison of the models built by a dividing the data set into training and testing subsets based on catchment units train test method and b a stratified 10 fold cross validation cv shows that the generated models performed well only a modest variation in the predictive performances of the models was observed when using data from different catchments as the testing data sets in aquatic ecology the most widely used approach to evaluate decision tree models is to employ the 10 fold cross validation dakou et al 2007 gal et al 2013 however when working with larger data sets from several catchments it is important to test whether the catchment as a random variable affects the modelling results this study demonstrates the important effect of catchment selection on the model performance and show that predictive performance can be improved by combining data from different catchments to form larger data sets when applying cv to the whole data set the models that predict etsa and tpc using data from 20 to 40 cm depth performed slightly better than models using data from the 5 15 cm depth this suggests that there must be some additional environmental factors or stressors influencing the measured indicators at 5 15 cm depth such as surface flow velocity shear stress permeability and hydraulic conductivity hydrological parameters are important drivers of hz processes boulton et al 1998 and should be included in the models in the future to obtain better predictions despite the high complexity and heterogeneity of the data the models proved accurate for all three response variables and depths the only exception was when predicting r at a depth of 20 40 cm where the data set was smaller due to lack of data in general complex ecological data sets from spatially and temporally dynamic environments with hierarchical organization and the catchment as a major unit are difficult to analyse using standard statistical methods where assumptions such as homoscedasticity independent and normally distributed residuals no multicollinearity etc have to be fulfilled downes et al 2002 on the other hand ml tools allow for working with noisy data sets from complex and dynamic domains gal et al 2013 the best models were built using r as a response variable respiration is a good functional indicator of natural dynamics doering et al 2011 and anthropogenic stress e g eutrophication hill et al 2000 janssens et al 2001 since r directly depends on temperature and nutrient availability it represents an immediate response of microbial community to actual short term environmental conditions simčič et al 2015 the models with the least predictive power are those that use tpc as a response variable tpc indicates biomass of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances proteins in the samples and is therefore a structural indicator of long term ecosystem condition franken et al 2001 the models that use etsa were slightly better etsa measures overall enzymatic activity maximum reaction rate of respiratory electron transport system at standard temperature and without substrate limitation and is a reflection of environmental conditions on longer term equilibrium of etsa is attained after a few days in the altered environment simčič et al 2015 this study finds that for the hz in gravel bed rivers more accurate models can be built using response variables that reflect ecosystem function r etsa rather than structure tpc up to now the high potential of functional indicators for detecting anthropogenic impacts has been emphasised many times sandin and solimini 2009 palmer and febria 2012 von schiller et al 2017 this models can be used for modelling respiration potential respiration and protein content within the hz of other subalpine catchments as long as they share similar characteristics to those of the 5 experimental catchments comparable proportion of land use and similar ranges of environmental factors based on the measured environmental parameters in any such catchment the magnitude of respiration and microbial biomass can be determined also the models can be used to predict changes in magnitude of respiration and biomass in a case some environmental factor changes as long as its value stays within the initial range of values used for building the models in this study 4 2 between stressor and stressor ecological indicators linkages this study finds that water temperature is an important predictor of functional indicators r etsa but is irrelevant for predicting structural indicator tpc response this was shown also with simple regression plots where relationships between the temperature and response variables were significant but strength of correlation was weaker for tpc indicating that the temperature influences microbial biomass in complex interactions with other environmental factors in general an increasing temperature accelerates chemical reactions and enhances biological processes such as metabolic rate microbial growth and activity davidson and janssens 2006 mora gomez et al 2016 based on previous studies simčič and mori 2007 mori et al 2017 debeljak et al 2017 it is expected that temperature will be an important predictor of r but not for etsa which reflects environmental conditions on longer term and that the effects of temperature decreases with depth hester et al 2009 according to hill et al 2000 there is a significant relationship between sediment r and temperature and several chemical variables they emphasised the different extent to which temperature influences r in water bodies they concluded that the temperature r relationship is not simple causality and that more complex models and further research is necessary for making solid predictions some of the reasons for this are that the temperature effects on microbial activity is resource dependent and that microbial communities are functionally adapted or acclimated to in situ temperature hall et al 2010 an important finding is that the causal relationship between temperature and r depends on temperature range when water temperatures are extremely low a simple temperature r relationship is observed while at higher temperatures complex interactions between temperature and dissolved ions influences the intensity of r this suggests that when environmental temperatures are extremely low they act as the only limiting factor however when the water temperature is considered optimal i e 10 30 c e g mora gomez et al 2016 microbial community respiration rates responds also to changes in the water chemistry such as nitrite potassium calcium and sulphate concentrations in a case of sulphate it seems that it is connected with decreased respiration at two thresholds i e 6 5 and 17 3 mg l 1 depending on temperature at low temperatures medium r occurs but when sulphate concentration exceeds the threshold r is low similarly at optimal water temperatures high r occurs but when concentrations exceed the threshold r is of medium values this indicates the importance of temperature when looking at the influence of sulphate on hyporheic respiration in contrast to previous studies e g mori et al 2017 this study showed the importance of temperatures also for etsa the models for 5 15 cm depth shows that the temperature was the most important predictor for etsa large temperature ranges and structurally similar habitats used in this study are most probably the reason for this similarly as for r interactions with water chemistry parameters were important for the model but catchment urban land use was additional important predictor for etsa at 5 15 cm land use modifies in stream factors controlling river metabolism through increased nutrient sediment and pollutant runoff from agricultural and urban sources ponsatí et al 2015 these impacts are confounded with catchment natural characteristics climate geology soil vegetation type that also alter in stream abiotic properties allan 2004 a single river study indicated significant relationship between etsa and nutrients no3 but not temperature influence while the impact of land use was not studied simčič and mori 2007 presence of forest in the catchment was the most important predictor for the model based on data the depths of 20 40 cm which was more complex than the one for the depth of 5 15 cm together with less forest in the catchment the temperature and sulphate were important for the predicting etsa rates wherever natural forest is removed from the riparian zone and whole catchment streams and rivers are usually warmer during summer and primary production usually increases due to the lack of shadow allan 2004 this consequently leads to increased hz nutrient input and increased microbial activity here similarly to the model with r at 5 15 cm sulphate in combination with land use supressed or induced etsa rates depending on water temperature these results show the importance of anthropogenic sulphate inputs for river metabolism that can act either as an inhibitor or as stimulator of metabolism for models predicting microbial biomass estimated using tpc a combination of nh4 doc and catchment urban land use was important for depth of 5 15 cm clearly nutrients such as nh4 or doc can act as stimulator of tpc when exceed a certain threshold or inhibitors when nutrients are below certain level especially when in interaction with presence of low proportion of urban land use in the catchment similar to etsa at 20 40 cm land use when combined season nh4 ca2 were the main predictor that influences tpc at 20 40 cm depth a study of hendricks 1996 partly reflects the patterns from this study they demonstrated a significant impact of season depth and zone upwelling downwelling for microbial biomass in the hyporheic zone they also found inconsistent pattern in microbial response to increased doc that was linked with the season 5 conclusions this study contributes new knowledge about catchment scale patterns and drivers influencing respiration and microbial biomass in the hyporheic zone decision trees based on data from five gravel bed rivers confirmed the important role that temperature and nutrient inputs from anthropogenic activities have on hyporheic processes and structure and provided new information on the importance of land use and the interactions between stressors and environmental factors on microbial activity and biomass as demonstrated the selection of measure either functional or structural and sampling depth is important for explaining the causal relationship between environment and biological responses in general temperature alone or in interaction with other stressors indicating point or diffuse pollution is one the most important predictors of functional measures respiration and respiratory electron transport system activity when looking at structural measure i e microbial biomass the catchment land use and the nutrients are critical a highly relevant finding is that for the study area an individual stressor such as sulphate or nitrite can act as a stimulator or inhibitor of biological processes when exceeding certain threshold values moreover when combined with other environmental variables and stressors it can have the same impact even if it falls below the defined threshold value however larger data sets over larger geographical ranges are needed to confirm these patterns these findings demonstrate that it is important to consider interactions between stressors when developing management plans for freshwater ecosystems and that climate change will have more pronounced effect on ecosystem functioning then structure by accelerating biological processes due to increased temperatures declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

the following gradient pattern i 98 b 0 49 min ii from 49 to 52 min b decreased linearly from 98 to 0 iii from 52 to 55 min b increased linearly from 0 to 98 and iv from 55 to 60 min the mobile phase returned to initial composition the ctc mass spectrometers were performed in positive electron spray ionization esi mode and the mass spectrums were operated in full scan mode over a mass range from 50 to 1200 m z 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhancement effect of algae on the photodegradation of ctc the ctc photodegradation in the absence and presence of chlorella vulgaris as well as the corresponding dark controls was performed to demonstrate the effect of algae on the photolysis of ctc as shown in fig 1 a in the dark no obvious reduction of ctc concentrations less than 3 was observed both in the absence and presence of algae indicating both of ctc hydrolysis and algae adsorption played a negligible role in the ctc degradation in the absence of algae ctc degraded by 48 after 60 min of irradiation with the rate constant k obs control of 0 0123 min 1 in comparison ctc was found to be degraded with rate constant k obs algae of 0 0246 min 1 in the presence of algae 2 0 109 cells l 1 which was almost 2 times higher than k obs control thus algae significantly accelerated the photodegradation of ctc furthermore rate of ctc photodegradation increased with algae concentration increasing as shown in fig 1 b the rate constant of ctc photodegradation increased from 0 0158 min 1 to 0 0246 min 1 with algae concentration increasing from 2 0 107 cells l 1 to 2 0 109 cells l 1 algae solution containing eoms algae cell chlorophyll and enzyme might induce indirect photolysis of some compounds as photosensitizer qu et al 2012 zepp and schlotzhauer 1983 luo et al 2015 thus the enhancement of ctc photodegradation may be due to the indirect photolysis induced by those photosensitizers for higher concentration of algae higher amounts of photosensitizer were generated by algae deng et al 2008 zuo and jones 1997 and the higher amounts of photosensitizer may result in faster ctc photodegradation to further investigate which substance in algae solution was the dominant photosensitizer in the enhancement of ctc photodegradation a series of irradiation experiments were conducted with addition of algae obtained by different preparation approaches chlorophyll chlorophyll ab mixture 2 mg l 1 was employed to explore the role of chlorophyll in the accelerating effects of algae on ctc photolysis as shown in fig 2 slight acceleration about 3 was observed for the rate of ctc photodegradation with addition of chlorophyll indicating that indirect photolysis sensitized by chlorophyll could be ignored previous studies have shown that chlorophyll catalyzed bap photodegradation mainly due to high generation of 1o2 luo et al 2015 but for ctc photolysis examined here the insignificant enhancement might be due to the low reaction rate constant of ctc with 1o2 i e 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 castillo et al 2007 enzyme freezing thawing method can sacrifice algae with the activities of enzymes maintaining while heat killing can sacrifice algae as well as inactivate the enzyme in algae surface mukerji and morris 1996 thus two different preparation approaches of algae cells heat killing and freezing thawing were used to investigate the role of enzymes in the enhancement effect of ctc photodegradation luo et al 2015 and the results were shown in fig 2 there was no significant difference observed in the rate constant of ctc photodegradation with addition of heat killing algae and freezing thawing algae this result indicated that algae enzymes were not critical in the acceleration of ctc photodegradation eoms with the addition of eoms 2 0 8 0 mg l 1 into the pure water the photolysis rate of ctc was 1 5 2 3 times higher than that of control and the rate constants raised steadily with the increase of eoms concentration the accelerating effect of ctc photolysis in presence of algae dominantly resulted from the indirect photolysis sensitized by eoms the photosensitizing properties of eoms extracted from one blue green algae microcystis aeruginosa and two green algae chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus meyen were further compared it was found that the enhancement effects of eoms extracted from green algae on ctc photolysis was stronger than blue green algae indicating that there were some differences in photosensitizing properties of eoms extracted from different algae the details were shown in supplementary material figure s2 in addition it was reported that algogenic eoms mainly composed of protein like and humic like components qu et al 2012 the composition is similar to natural organic matter which could act as photosensitizers to generate reactive species under simulated sunlight irradiation tenorio et al 2017 the differences in photosensitizing properties between algogenic eoms and natural organic matter were further studied it was found lower suv254 and higher e2 e3 than that of humic acid illustrating lower molecular weight and aromaticity of algogenic eoms than humic acid the higher concentrations of reactive species were expected given higher yields of reactive species for dom with lower molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017 the details were shown in supplementary material table s3 3 2 contribution of possible reactive species generated from eoms to ctc photolysis to distinguish the key reactive species in the indirect photolysis sensitized by eoms selective reactive species quenching experiments were conducted isopropanol nan3 and sorbic acid were selected to be the quenchers for oh 1o2 and 3eoms carlos et al 2012 ryan et al 2011 respectively as shown in fig 3 there was no obvious suppression of ctc photolysis with addition of isopropanol and nan3 indicating little contribution of oh and 1o2 to the ctc photolysis while addition of sorbic acid led to a significant decrease of ctc loss rate suggesting that 3eoms played a dominant role in the accelerating effects of ctc photolysis this was further supported by the observation that the photolysis rate constant increased with deoxygenation of eoms solution as a quencher of 3eoms the removal of oxygen increased the steady state concentration of 3eoms in the system mcneill and canonica 2016 ryan et al 2011 on the other hand removal of oxygen decreased the generation rate of 1o2 the unexpected slight enhancement of ctc degradation further demonstrated that 1o2 was negligible in the indirect photodegradation of ctc induced by eoms the rate constants of ctc direct photolysis in eoms solution were corrected by screening factors s and the screening factors shown in supplementary material table s2 for the experimental solutions were calculated by eq s3 contributions of major reactive species generated from eoms to ctc photolysis were calculated by eq s4 and s5 as shown in fig 4 reaction of ctc and 3eoms is dominant process with the contribution 90 to the ctc indirect photolysis induced by eoms while the contribution of 1o2 was minor in addition as concentration of eoms increasing from 2 mg l 1 to 8 mg l 1 the contribution of reaction between ctc and 3eoms to total photolysis rate increased from 30 73 to 56 03 thus 3eoms play a dominant role in photodegradation of ctc given that there might be higher concentrations of 3eoms due to accumulation of eoms in aqueous solution containing algae the steady state concentrations of 3eoms 3eoms ss were estimated by eq s6 and s7 using the tmp probe compound k 3 d o m t m p 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 1995 mcneill and canonica 2016 porras et al 2014 results were shown in fig 4 inset 3eoms ss were in the range of 10 14 10 13 m consistent with triplet state nom 3dom in surface water environments 10 14 10 12 m maizel and remucal 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 notably with the increase of eoms concentration the increasing 3eoms ss resulted in the increasingly higher contribution of 3eoms to total photolysis the rate constant for reaction of ctc with 3eoms was further calculated to be 3 17 109 m 1s 1 by eq s8 this magnitude was higher than that of rate constant of reaction between ctc and 1o2 i e 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 this result further confirmed the dominant role of 3eoms in photodegradation of ctc in aqueous solution containing algae 3 3 products and pathways of ctc photodegradation in the presence of algogenic eoms the products of ctc photodegradation were detected with 20 min irradiation of simulated sunlight as shown in fig 5 and supplementary material s4 the tentatively identified photoproducts in milli q water w o eoms were m z 462 and 444 while in eoms solution the tentatively identified photoproducts were m z 462 444 510 494 477 460 464 435 and 149 and those photoproducts were not detected in the control sample of eoms the details were shown in supplementary material table s4 figure s3 and figure s4 and more photoproducts were detected in presence of eoms which could be attributed to the reaction of ctc with 3eom the tentatively identified m z 444 and m z 462 were important photoproducts both in absence and presence of eoms which resulted from the de chlorination of ctc and deamination of ctc chen et al 2012 eichhon and aga 2004 respectively the tentatively identified photoproduct m z 510 was determined to be an ctc skeleton with two hydroxyl groups and the m z 494 comprised of an ctc skeleton with only one hydroxyl group this pathway was also reported by chen et al 2012 notably the tentatively identified photoproducts m z 464 435 477 and 460 were only detected in presence of eoms the m z 464 and m z 435 could be formed by consecutive loss of n methyl group from ctc via reaction with 3eom due to the low bond energy of nc li and hu 2016 the photoproducts m z 477 might arise from h abstraction of phenolic hydroxyl in ctc by the attack of 3eom eichhon and aga 2004 mcneill and canonica 2016 therefore the pathway of ctc photodegradation changed in presence of eoms via direct reaction with 3eom this result verified that the amidogen phenolic hydroxyl in ctc was susceptible to triplet state eoms based on the photoproducts electron transfer was an important process in the reaction of 3eoms with ctc the details of structure of photo products was shown in supplementary material table s4 3 4 photosensitive mechanism of algogenic eoms in ctc photolysis the schematic for mechanism of the degradation of ctc in eoms solution under simulated sunlight was proposed based on the findings discussed above see fig 6 for the proposed route of direct photolysis processes ctc was excited to a singlet excited state when absorbed light which then became triplet excited state by intersystem crosses followed by the generation of products or the reaction with dissolved oxygen returning to the ground state this route was confirmed by the experimental finding that the rate of photolysis increased with the removal of dissolved oxygen was in accordance with the previous report chen et al 2012 for indirect photolysis processes induced by eoms there were two important possible degradation pathways firstly eoms were excited to a triplet state i e 3eoms when absorbed sunlight then 3eoms could react directly with ctc via oxidizing reaction by electron transfer or energy transfer this electron transfer process was supported by that amidogen phenolic hydroxyl in ctc was susceptible to 3eoms based on the products of ctc photodegradation in eoms solutions the energy transfer from 3eoms to ctc directly brought ctc to a triplet excited state i e 3ctc this process was only possible if the energy of 3eoms is higher than that of 3ctc ryan et al 2011 the triplet energy of the 3eoms is higher than triplet energy of 3ctc based on the observation that 3eoms can be quenched by sorbic acid a quencher of triplet excited state with triplet energy 250 kj mol 1 grebel et al 2011 but 3ctc cannot thus such energy transfer process of 3eoms to ctc is possible in addition the result of photoproducts verified that the amidogen phenolic hydroxyl in ctc was susceptible to triplet state eoms based on the photoproducts thus electron transfer was also a possible process in the reaction of 3eoms with ctc as the algogenic eoms accumulating in surface waters the role of excited triplet state species 3eoms in photolysis behaviors of some emerging contaminants cannot be ignored even with a low algae density in surface waters in addition the reaction of 3eoms with contaminants was expected to change the ecotoxicity of photo products in surface waters further work will need to be performed to evaluate the change of ecotoxicity in presence of algogenic eoms 4 conclusions 1 algae could significantly accelerate the rate of ctc photolysis the rate constant increased from 0 0158 min 1 to 0 0246 min 1 with increasing algae concentration 2 107 2 109 cells l 1 2 eoms was found to be the major photosensitizer in algae solution and the rate of ctc photodegradation increased from 0 0188 min 1 to 0 0386 min 1 with increasing concentration of eoms toc 2 8 mg l 1 3 the reaction of ctc and 3eoms was dominant process with the contribution 93 to the ctc indirect photolysis while the contribution of 1o2 was minor 7 furthermore with the eoms increasing from 2 0 mg l 1 to 8 0 mg l 1 the observed steady state concentrations of 1o2 and 3eoms were estimated both to be in the 10 14 10 13 m range the reaction of 3eoms with ctc was the dominant process in the overall ctc photolysis with the second order rate constant 3 17 109 m 1s 1 4 the products of the photolysis indicated that there is a corresponding change for the photoproducts and degradation pathway in presence of eoms the amidogen and phenolic hydroxyl in ctc were susceptible to triplet state eoms based on the photoproducts acknowledge we gratefully acknowledge funding from beijing natural science

hydrocarbons and anilines compounds zepp and schlotzhauer 1983 zhang et al 2012 observed that the algae induced the indirect photolysis of norfloxacin and wang et al 2007 reported that algae accelerated the photodegradation rate of aniline by improving the generation of reactive species however algae solution contains a variety of substances and the role of these substances in the photo reactivity of algae is not fully explored with regard to the photo reactivity of algae the coexisting algae cells extracellular organic matters eoms chlorophyll and enzymes have been suggested to be the active substances acting as photosensitizers to trigger indirect photolysis of compounds under irradiation it was reported that eoms were comprised of polysaccharides proteins and humic like substances qu et al 2012 thus eoms may be a kind of photosensitizers to induce indirect photolysis of compounds this statement was supported by the observation that eoms of algae could produce excited

chen et al 2012 the influence of nom on ctc photolysis is fully investigated and it was reported recently that dissolved organic matter from poultry litter enhanced ctc photodegradation via 3dom and

about influence of algae on ctc photodegradation remains blank the objectives of this study are to reveal the role of algae chlorella vulgaris in ctc photolysis and explore the photosensitive mechanisms firstly the photosensitizing effect of chlorella vulgaris on ctc photodegradation under different condition was studied by separating composition of chlorella vulgaris solution into algae cell eoms chlorophyll and enzyme to distinguish the active substance accelerating the ctc photodegradation secondly the possible reactive species were confirmed by quenching methods and their steady state concentrations were measured using probe compounds based on this contributions of reactive species to ctc photodegradation were calculated in particular the difference of ctc photoproducts in

returned to initial composition the ctc mass spectrometers were performed in positive electron spray ionization esi mode and the mass spectrums were operated in full scan mode over a mass range from 50 to 1200 m z 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhancement effect of algae on the photodegradation of ctc the ctc photodegradation in the absence and presence of chlorella vulgaris as well as the corresponding dark controls was performed to demonstrate the effect of algae on the photolysis of ctc as shown in fig 1 a in the dark no obvious reduction of ctc concentrations less than 3 was observed both in the absence and presence of algae indicating both of ctc hydrolysis and algae adsorption played a negligible role in the ctc degradation in the absence of algae ctc degraded by 48 after 60 min of irradiation with the rate constant k obs control of 0 0123 min 1 in comparison ctc was found to be degraded with rate constant k obs algae of 0 0246 min 1 in the presence of algae 2 0 109 cells l 1 which was almost 2 times higher than k obs control thus algae significantly accelerated the photodegradation of ctc furthermore rate of ctc photodegradation increased with algae concentration increasing as shown in fig 1 b the rate constant of ctc photodegradation increased from 0 0158 min 1 to 0 0246 min 1 with algae concentration increasing from 2 0 107 cells l 1 to 2 0 109 cells l 1 algae solution containing eoms algae cell chlorophyll and enzyme might induce indirect photolysis of some compounds as photosensitizer qu et al 2012 zepp and schlotzhauer 1983 luo et al 2015 thus the enhancement of ctc photodegradation may be due to the indirect photolysis induced by those photosensitizers for higher concentration of algae higher amounts of photosensitizer were generated by algae deng et al 2008 zuo and jones 1997 and the higher amounts of photosensitizer may result in faster ctc photodegradation to further investigate which substance in algae solution was the dominant photosensitizer in the enhancement of ctc photodegradation a series of irradiation experiments were conducted with addition of algae obtained by different preparation approaches chlorophyll chlorophyll ab mixture 2 mg l 1 was employed to explore the role of chlorophyll in the accelerating effects of algae on ctc photolysis as shown in fig 2 slight acceleration about 3 was observed for the rate of ctc photodegradation with addition of chlorophyll indicating that indirect photolysis sensitized by chlorophyll could be ignored previous studies have shown that chlorophyll catalyzed bap photodegradation mainly due to high generation of 1o2 luo et al 2015 but for ctc photolysis examined here the insignificant enhancement might be due to the low reaction rate constant of ctc with 1o2 i e 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 castillo et al 2007 enzyme freezing thawing method can sacrifice algae with the activities of enzymes maintaining while heat killing can sacrifice algae as well as inactivate the enzyme in algae surface mukerji and morris 1996 thus two different preparation approaches of algae cells heat killing and freezing thawing were used to investigate the role of enzymes in the enhancement effect of ctc photodegradation luo et al 2015 and the results were shown in fig 2 there was no significant difference observed in the rate constant of ctc photodegradation with addition of heat killing algae and freezing thawing algae this result indicated that algae enzymes were not critical in the acceleration of ctc photodegradation eoms with the addition of eoms 2 0 8 0 mg l 1 into the pure water the photolysis rate of ctc was 1 5 2 3 times higher than that of control and the rate constants raised steadily with the increase of eoms concentration the accelerating effect of ctc photolysis in presence of algae dominantly resulted from the indirect photolysis sensitized by eoms the photosensitizing properties of eoms extracted from one blue green algae microcystis aeruginosa and two green algae chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus meyen were further compared it was found that the enhancement effects of eoms extracted from green algae on ctc photolysis was stronger than blue green algae indicating that there were some differences in photosensitizing properties of eoms extracted from different algae the details were shown in supplementary material figure s2 in addition it was reported that algogenic eoms mainly composed of protein like and humic like components qu et al 2012 the composition is similar to natural organic matter which could act as photosensitizers to generate reactive species under simulated sunlight irradiation tenorio et al 2017 the differences in photosensitizing properties between algogenic eoms and natural organic matter were further studied it was found lower suv254 and higher e2 e3 than that of humic acid illustrating lower molecular weight and aromaticity of algogenic eoms than humic acid the higher concentrations of reactive species were expected given higher yields of reactive species for dom with lower molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017 the details were shown in supplementary material table s3 3 2 contribution of possible reactive species generated from eoms to ctc photolysis to distinguish the key reactive species in the indirect photolysis sensitized by eoms selective reactive species quenching experiments were conducted isopropanol nan3 and sorbic acid were selected to be the quenchers for oh 1o2 and 3eoms carlos et al 2012 ryan et al 2011 respectively as shown in fig 3 there was no obvious suppression of ctc photolysis with addition of isopropanol and nan3 indicating little contribution of oh and 1o2 to the ctc photolysis while addition of sorbic acid led to a significant decrease of ctc loss rate suggesting that 3eoms played a dominant role in the accelerating effects of ctc photolysis this was further supported by the observation that the photolysis rate constant increased with deoxygenation of eoms solution as a quencher of 3eoms the removal of oxygen increased the steady state concentration of 3eoms in the system mcneill and canonica 2016 ryan et al 2011 on the other hand removal of oxygen decreased the generation rate of 1o2 the unexpected slight enhancement of ctc degradation further demonstrated that 1o2 was negligible in the indirect photodegradation of ctc induced by eoms the rate constants of ctc direct photolysis in eoms solution were corrected by screening factors s and the screening factors shown in supplementary material table s2 for the experimental solutions were calculated by eq s3 contributions of major reactive species generated from eoms to ctc photolysis were calculated by eq s4 and s5 as shown in fig 4 reaction of ctc and 3eoms is dominant process with the contribution 90 to the ctc indirect photolysis induced by eoms while the contribution of 1o2 was minor in addition as concentration of eoms increasing from 2 mg l 1 to 8 mg l 1 the contribution of reaction between ctc and 3eoms to total photolysis rate increased from 30 73 to 56 03 thus 3eoms play a dominant role in photodegradation of ctc given that there might be higher concentrations of 3eoms due to accumulation of eoms in aqueous solution containing algae the steady state concentrations of 3eoms 3eoms ss were estimated by eq s6 and s7 using the tmp probe compound k 3 d o m t m p 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 1995 mcneill and canonica 2016 porras et al 2014 results were shown in fig 4 inset 3eoms ss were in the range of 10 14 10 13 m consistent with triplet state nom 3dom in surface water environments 10 14 10 12 m maizel and remucal 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 notably with the increase of eoms concentration the increasing 3eoms ss resulted in the increasingly higher contribution of 3eoms to total photolysis the rate constant for reaction of ctc with 3eoms was further calculated to be 3 17 109 m 1s 1 by eq s8 this magnitude was higher than that of rate constant of reaction between ctc and 1o2 i e 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 this result further confirmed the dominant role of 3eoms in photodegradation of ctc in aqueous solution containing algae 3 3 products and pathways of ctc photodegradation in the presence of algogenic eoms the products of ctc photodegradation were detected with 20 min irradiation of simulated sunlight as shown in fig 5 and supplementary material s4 the tentatively identified photoproducts in milli q water w o eoms were m z 462 and 444 while in eoms solution the tentatively identified photoproducts were m z 462 444 510 494 477 460 464 435 and 149 and those photoproducts were not detected in the control sample of eoms the details were shown in supplementary material table s4 figure s3 and figure s4 and more photoproducts were detected in presence of eoms which could be attributed to the reaction of ctc with 3eom the tentatively identified m z 444 and m z 462 were important photoproducts both in absence and presence of eoms which resulted from the de chlorination of ctc and deamination of ctc chen et al 2012 eichhon and aga 2004 respectively the tentatively identified photoproduct m z 510 was determined to be an ctc skeleton with two hydroxyl groups and the m z 494 comprised of an ctc skeleton with only one hydroxyl group this pathway was also reported by chen et al 2012 notably the tentatively identified photoproducts m z 464 435 477 and 460 were only detected in presence of eoms the m z 464 and m z 435 could be formed by consecutive loss of n methyl group from ctc via reaction with 3eom due to the low bond energy of nc li and hu 2016 the photoproducts m z 477 might arise from h abstraction of phenolic hydroxyl in ctc by the attack of 3eom eichhon and aga 2004 mcneill and canonica 2016 therefore the pathway of ctc photodegradation changed in presence of eoms via direct reaction with 3eom this result verified that the amidogen phenolic hydroxyl in ctc was susceptible to triplet state eoms based on the photoproducts electron transfer was an important process in the reaction of 3eoms with ctc the details of structure of photo products was shown in supplementary material table s4 3 4 photosensitive mechanism of algogenic eoms in ctc photolysis the schematic for mechanism of the degradation of ctc in eoms solution under simulated sunlight was proposed based on the findings discussed above see fig 6 for the proposed route of direct photolysis processes ctc was excited to a singlet excited state when absorbed light which then became triplet excited state by intersystem crosses followed by the generation of products or the reaction with dissolved oxygen returning to the ground state this route was confirmed by the experimental finding that the rate of photolysis increased with the removal of dissolved oxygen was in accordance with the previous report chen et al 2012 for indirect photolysis processes induced by eoms there were two important possible degradation pathways firstly eoms were excited to a triplet state i e 3eoms when absorbed sunlight then 3eoms could react directly with ctc via oxidizing reaction by electron transfer or energy transfer this electron transfer process was supported by that amidogen phenolic hydroxyl in ctc was susceptible to 3eoms based on the products of ctc photodegradation in eoms solutions the energy transfer from 3eoms to ctc directly brought ctc to a triplet excited state i e 3ctc this process was only possible if the energy of 3eoms is higher than that of 3ctc ryan et al 2011 the triplet energy of the 3eoms is higher than triplet energy of 3ctc based on the observation that 3eoms can be quenched by sorbic acid a quencher of triplet excited state with triplet energy 250 kj mol 1 grebel et al 2011 but 3ctc cannot thus such energy transfer process of 3eoms to ctc is possible in addition the result of photoproducts verified that the amidogen phenolic hydroxyl in ctc was susceptible to triplet state eoms based on the photoproducts thus electron transfer was also a possible process in the reaction of 3eoms with ctc as the algogenic eoms accumulating in surface waters the role of excited triplet state species 3eoms in photolysis behaviors of some emerging contaminants cannot be ignored even with a low algae density in surface waters in addition the reaction of 3eoms with contaminants was expected to change the ecotoxicity of photo products in surface waters further work will need to be performed to evaluate the change of ecotoxicity in presence of algogenic eoms 4 conclusions 1 algae could significantly accelerate the rate of ctc photolysis the rate constant increased from 0 0158 min 1 to 0 0246 min 1 with increasing algae concentration 2 107 2 109 cells l 1 2 eoms was found to be the major photosensitizer in algae solution and the rate of ctc photodegradation increased from 0 0188 min 1 to 0 0386 min 1 with increasing concentration of eoms toc 2 8 mg l 1 3 the reaction of ctc and 3eoms was dominant process with the contribution 93 to the ctc indirect photolysis while the contribution of 1o2 was minor 7 furthermore with the eoms increasing from 2 0 mg l 1 to 8 0 mg l 1 the observed steady state concentrations of 1o2 and 3eoms were estimated both to be in the 10 14 10 13 m range the reaction of 3eoms with ctc was the dominant process in the overall ctc photolysis with the second order rate constant 3 17 109 m 1s 1 4 the products of the photolysis indicated that there is a corresponding change for the photoproducts and degradation pathway in presence of eoms the amidogen and phenolic hydroxyl in ctc were susceptible to triplet state eoms based on the photoproducts acknowledge we gratefully acknowledge funding from beijing natural science

19133,superoxide ion o2 is one of the short lived reactive oxygen species ros formed in aquatic environments the reactions of o2 with the model dissolved organic matter dom were studied using a chemiluminescent analysis method under relevant environmental conditions the reaction of o2 with dom produced reduced dom dom by fast one electron transfer in the initial stage this process resulted an initial loss in the o2 decay kinetics dom is unstable which will continue react with o2 generating h2o2 to complete a catalytic dismutation cycle based on analyzing the observed pseudo first order o2 decay rates k pseudo the quasi steady state concentration of dom is found to be equal to the initial loss of o2 thus the rate constant for dom with ho2 o2 is derived to be 1 1 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 in the temperature range of 7 8 41 4 c meanwhile the apparent rate constant for dom with o2 in a flow cell during a short time 2 25 s is measured as 1 5 3 3 103 mc 1 s 1 in the temperature range of 8 2 38 6 c these temperature dependent o2 reaction rate constants present an apparent activation energy of 19 6 2 9 kj molc 1 for dom while that of dom 12 5 3 5 kj mol 1 is lower for the pseudo first order decay rate of o2 the catalyzed dismutation by metal components ranges from 13 to 23 the contribution by aromatic ketones of dom is estimated to be 10 13 by using nabh4 reduction method the residual contribution might mainly occur at the quinone like groups which contributed 64 77 to the total dismutation the ph effects on the apparent catalytic rate constants dominate the reaction of o2 with dom the present work suggests that dom is an important sink for o2 in aquatic environments furthermore we proposed that the reaction of o2 with dom could be a potential source of dom in natural water graphical abstract image 1 keywords superoxide radical ion dissolved organic matters kinetic studies reaction mechanism 1 introduction the superoxide radical ion o2 is one of the most important reactive oxygen species ros formed in aquatic environments under solar irradiation hayyan et al 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 waggoner et al 2017 o2 is considered both a radical and anion hayyan et al 2016 in sunlit surface waters o2 is primarily formed via the reaction of dissolved oxygen with electron donors zhou et al 2017 which are produced via intramolecular electron transfers within the excited states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom baxter and carey 1983 zhang et al 2012 the formation of o2 via one electron transfer from electron donors to singlet oxygen 1o2 was also reported in the literature saito et al 1981 1983 theoretically 1o2 can be more susceptible to one electron transfer with electron donors than the ground state of oxygen due to the lower reduction potential additionally o2 may also be introduced into the water column via metabolic processes in phytoplankton and bacteria diaz et al 2013 kim et al 2000 the superoxide ion undergoes protonation to its conjugate acid hydroperoxyl radical ho2 which has a pka of 4 8 zafiriou 1990 1 o2 h ho2 pka 4 8 furthermore ho2 reacts with itself and o2 to yield hydrogen peroxide and oxygen via second order disproportionation reactions rose and waite 2005 sheng et al 2014 2 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 k 2 8 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 3 ho 2 o 2 ho 2 o 2 k 3 9 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 4 ho 2 h h 2 o 2 p k a 11 6 thus the overall apparent rate of superoxide dismutation incorporating the decay of both ho2 and o2 varies with ph values transition metal ions such as fe fujii et al 2008 rose and waite 2006 mn and cu and their organic complexes can rapidly react with o2 leading to a catalytic cycle for o2 decay with reaction rate constants from 105 to 109 m 1 s 1 rose and waite 2005 voelker et al 2000 as following equations 5 m n 1 o2 mn o2 6 mn o2 2h m n 1 h2o2 previous studies wuttig et al 2013 have demonstrated that metal catalytic dismutation contributes to 62 88 of o2 decay in the ocean surface the products of superoxide decomposition are h2o2 and o2 photochemically produced o2 is thought to be a major pathway for h2o2 formation in natural water cooper and zika 1983 miller et al 2009 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural water system niu et al 2016 and consists of a mixture of biological and chemical decomposition products of algae bacteria plants and animal residues chen et al 2002 del vecchio and blough 2004 garg et al 2015 the pseudo first order decay rates of o2 in the natural water have been investigated by several groups goldstone and voelker 2000 reported that dom containing nonmetallic redox cycling components possibly via quinone functionalities is capable of catalyzing o2 dismutation they also found that o2 pseudo first order rates k pseudo have a significant correlation r 2 0 73 with the optical absorbance of dom at 300 nm fujii and otani 2017 recently found that dom aromaticity correlated with o2 decay kinetics although dom plays an important role in the decomposition of o2 in natural water the detailed mechanism on the reaction between o2 and dom are not fully understood the redox reactive moieties present in such molecules are considered to be responsible for nonmetal catalyzed o2 disproportionation which are agreed with many research groups fujii and otani 2017 garg et al 2011 this assumption includes both the oxidation of o2 to o2 and the reduction of o2 to h2o2 as typically described below 7 o 2 tot dom rm o 2 dom k 7 8 o 2 tot dom 2 h h 2 o 2 dom rm k 8 in these reactions the symbol of o2 tot represents the quantity of o2 and ho2 domrm and dom represent the redox moieties and one electron reduced in dom molecule respectively and k 7 and k 8 are reaction rate constants for oxidative and reductive o2 decay the reduction potentials of dom 0 18 0 61 v aeschbacher et al 2010 2012 are between the one electron reduction potential of o2 and o2 e 0 o2 o2 0 18 v e 0 o2 h2o2 0 91 v sheng et al 2014 therefore o2 can both oxidize dom and reduce dom as shown in equations 7 and 8 this reaction is apparent because the actual reacting species may involve quinone hydroquinone and semiquinone radicals one electron cycle dismutation of o2 is the major pathway since 2 electron reductions 104 m 1 s 1 ashnagar et al 1984 bielski et al 1985 garg et al 2007 presents significantly lower rate constants than one electron cycle 108 109 m 1 s 1 shkarina et al 2001 the investigation of bimolecular reaction rate constants k 7 and k 8 are necessary secondly o2 can rapidly react with both quinone and hydroquinone to yield the corresponding radicals eyer 1991 scott et al 1998 zhang et al 2014 despite the similarities between the redox behavior of dom and quinonyl compounds the mechanisms and kinetics parameters of the reactions of dom and o2 may be different from those of quinones because of the extended network of potentially conjugated aromatic structures in dom del vecchio and blough 2004 these unique structures can possibly cause dom to delocalize electrons and stabilize free radicals in addition quinone like moieties comprise a relatively small proportion of the total composition of dom for instance the dom presented low electron accepting capacities eac i e quinones ranges from 490 to 1960 μmole g 1 aeschbacher et al 2010 which is roughly equivalent of 290 980 μmol g 1 of quinones concentration aromatic ketones can also react with o2 as reducible groups gibian et al 1979 consequently the contribution of aromatic ketones and quinone like groups in dom to the reactions with o2 still remains unclear therefore quantifying the reaction rate constants and contributions of each dom component to the reaction with o2 is important for understanding the role of dom in the decay process of o2 the purpose of this study is to explore the detailed reaction kinetic of dom and o2 suwannee river fulvic acid srfa was selected as a model dom the present study used a competitive chemiluminescent method to determine the apparent catalytic rate constants between o2 with dom through measuring the decay rates of excessive o2 in the varying concentrations of dom the second order reaction rate constants of dom with ho o2 were also examined particularly the contribution of ketones moieties on the total dismutation of o2 was quantified based on the attenuation of the pseudo first order o2 decay rates in the presence of nabh4 reduced dom which can reduce the aromatic ketones to alcohol lower rate constants with o2 102 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 the reaction rate constants of dom are similar with model quinones compounds suggests that o2 catalytic dismutation mainly occur at the quinone like groups this information is valuable for understanding the transformation and fate of o2 in sunlit surface waters and we hope this attempt will be useful in filling existing knowledge gaps concerning important details of dom reaction with o2 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals reagent solutions were

used to produce the superoxide ions had been described in the literature mcdowell et al 1983 in brief the standard o2 stock solutions were generated from the photolysis of oxygen saturated solutions containing 41 0 mm acetone 12 0 m ethanol 15 0 μm dtpa and 1 0 mm borate buffer the ph of o2 stock solution was adjusted to 11 0 by 0 1 m naoh solutions fujii et al 2006 hansard et al 2010 at this ph condition 99 9 of superoxide ions were existed in the form of o2 the concentration of o2 after 1 min of irradiation 254 nm was immediately determined by measuring the absorbance at 240 nm using the ocean optics spectrophotometer system with 1 0 cm path length cuvette the molar extinction coefficient of o2 at 240 nm is 2350 m 1 cm 1 rose et al 2008 in every run freshly prepared non irradiated o2 stock solution was used additional acetone and ethanol clearly affect dissolved organic carbon of the reaction solution but this added doc does not affect the results since acetone and ethanol are not reactive with o2 the issues of photochemical generation of o2 are discussed in text s1 of the supporting information si 2 3 detection of o2 concentrations in aqueous solutions the o2 concentrations were measured using a chemiluminescent method that has been previously described akutsu et al 1995 hansard et al 2011 rusak et al 2011 the method was carried out using a flow injection analysis fia system waterville analytical usa each sample reaction solution typically containing 40 90 nm o2 was prepared by adding of 70 0 μl o2 stock solution concentrations were about 0 03 0 07 mm to a 50 ml

measurement of the observed pseudo first order decay rates of o2 kpseudo in dom solutions in this experiment o2 was spiked into varied concentrations of dom solutions to observe its decay behaviors the experimental flow chart in scheme 1 of the si as described in section 2 4 1 the overall kinetic reactivity of o2 design was based on the previous established equation heller and croot 2010b which included the pseudo first order of o2 reactions with organic matter and the second order self dismutation rate 9 d o 2 dt 2 k d o 2 tot 2 k pseudo o 2 tot where k d is the second order uncatalyzed dismutation rate constant of o2 and reactions with organic matter is described by the pseudo first order rate k pseudo the analytical solution to eq 9 was given by a previous literature heller and croot 2010a 10 o 2 t k pseudo k pseudo o 2 0 2 k d e k pseudo t 2 k d where o2 0 is the initial concentration of o2 the k pseudo are obtained by fitting the decay curves of o2 at various dom concentrations fig 1 a shows that the decay rates of o2 increased from 0 0032 to 0 043 s 1 with the increasing dom concentrations ranging from 0 016 to 0 32 mmc at ph of 7 these results agree with previous reported values with using the same equation for o2 loss rate for example garg et al 2011 measured the pseudo first order reaction rate of 6 6 10 3 s 1 for 1 mg l 1 srfa at ph of 8 1 which was similar with our values 5 6 10 3 s 1 1 mg l 1 srfa at ph of 7 the k d in our work was measured to be 1 2 0 2 105 m 1 s 1 at ph of 7 which was lower than theoretical value 5 105 m 1 s 1 calculated by k d 5 1012 h m 1 s 1 3 1 2 determination of dom concentration produced by the initial fast attenuation of o2 in the catalytic dismutation the decay curves of o2 in dom solutions were fitted by equation 10 fig 1a however the o2 concentration extrapolated back to time zero was lower than the initial o2 concentration actually added into dom solutions 50 1 nm the initial attenuation of o2 1 3 13 2 nm also increased with the increasing dom concentrations 0 016 0 32 mmc and a linear relationship was observed fig 1b in additional within different concentrations of spiked o2 25 85 nm and the fixed dom concentration the initial drop of o2 is constant of about 6 nm and independent with initial concentrations of o2 fig 2 it suggested that o2 was excessive in the initial reaction if the overall o2 dismutation was governed by a uniform catalytic cycle with dom all these fittings should be extrapolated back to the same initial o2 at time 0 as actually added which was clearly contradicted with our results as shown in fig s6 in the si the fitting curves with the fixed initial o2 were obviously not suitable for modeling the o2 decay behaviors especially at higher dom concentrations therefore we can conclude that the initial loss of o2 is caused by a much faster initial reaction although the apparent concentration of dom 0 041 0 32 mmc were greatly higher than the initial input of o2 50 nm o2 was still excessive at the initial stage as illustrated in fig 2 to explain this phenomenon it is apparent that not all components of dom were involved in the reactions with o2 only the active function groups the redox moiety domrm in the dom could promote the catalyzed dismutation of o2 then domrm were converted to dom by a rapid charge transfer with o2 furthermore the initial attenuation of o2 was applied to quantity the dom concentrations under our experimental conditions as fig 1b demonstrated the molecular ratio of dom to dom was the slope of line which was approximately 4 4 0 3 10 5 m mc fig 1a demonstrated that the real time o2 concentrations were always greater than the attenuation of o2 in fig 1a this phenomenon supported our assumptions that the missing initial o2 was consumed by the faster initial reaction 7 further generating dom which was accounted for only a small portion of the total dom therefore we concluded that the quasi steady state concentration of dom was equal to the initial attenuation concentration of o2 the dom concentrations obtained in our experiments are based on the assumption that dom are all produced upon the reaction with o2 and it is not initially present in the raw dom solutions 3 2 determination the reaction rate constants of o2 with dom as discussed in above section the quasi dom concentration is equal to the initial loss of o2 in the pseudo first decay of o2 on the observed time scale domrm is continually created by reaction 8 and then consumed again by reaction 7 to maintain dynamic equilibrium in this case the formation rate of dom eq 7 is equal to its decay rate eq 8 to keep a constant steady concentration of dom as shown in equation 11 d o 2 tot dt 2 k d o 2 tot 2 k 7 dom rm o 2 tot k 8 dom o 2 tot it can be converted to eq 12 12 d o 2 tot dt 2 k d o 2 tot 2 2 k 8 dom o 2 tot thus the k pseudo in the presence of different dom concentration was regarded as the results from the reaction of dom and ho2 o2 it could be expressed by the following equation 13 k pseudo 2 k 8 dom ss where dom ss was the steady state concentration of dom determined by measuring the initial attenuation of o2 the slope of linear fitting in a plot of the change in k pseudo versus the dom ss concentration gave the k 8 of 1 6 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 at ph of 7 22 c it should be noted that the catalytic cycle reactions with single first order loss may also contribute to k pseudo herein k 8 may be underestimated the similar results for the molecular ratio of dom to dom 4 7 0 2 10 5 m mc and k 8 1 4 0 3 106 m 1 s 1 were also obtained by the addition of 85 nm o2 in the buffer solutions fig s7 of the si furthermore the effects of inorganic ions phosphate chloride and sulfate ions and dtpa were examined via the addition of different anion concentrations to the o2 solutions no correlation was observed between the k pseudo value and the ion concentrations phosphate chloride and sulfate ions and dtpa fig s8 of the si 3 3 measurement of the apparent reaction rate constants between o2 and dom although the bimolecular reaction rate constant of dom with o2 has been obtained the reaction rate of domrm with o2 k 7 remain unclear since the domrm is unknown therefore we have tried to characterize the total apparent catalytic rate constants of o2 with dom k cat via mcla competition kinetics as described in section 2 4 2 in this experiments mcla reagent solutions containing varying concentrations of dom 0 0 24 mmc were further employed as chemiluminescent reagents the experimental setup was shown in scheme 2 of the si this experimental setup is different from the classic setup for o2 chemiluminescent measurement in fig 1 they reacted with the o2 solution 40 1 nm in a flow cell in front of the pmt since the reaction of mcla with o2 in an aqueous buffer solution generated a chemiluminescent signal which was linear with the concentration of o2 akutsu et al 1995 14 mcla o 2 2 h omcla co 2 h v k 14 2 40 0 24 10 5 m 1 s 1 the presence of dom in mcla reagents could quench the o2 chemiluminescent signals due to the competitive reaction of dom hence the fraction of o2 reacting with mcla could be given by the ratio of the reaction with mcla which could be represented by the intensity of chemiluminescent signal in the flow cell over the total rate of disappearance of o2 15 intensity x intensity 0 o 2 mcla k 14 o 2 mcla k 14 o 2 dom k cat the chemiluminescent signals counts decreased with increasing srfa concentrations with addition of same concentrations of o2 as shown in fig 3 a the decreases of chemiluminescent signal were proportional to the dom concentrations to minimize the experimental errors the highest chemiluminescent signals at the time points of 18 0 s were applied to calculate the apparent catalytic rate constant k cat the o2 competition can be analyzed to give the following expression as illustrated in eq 16 16 intensity 0 intensity x 1 k cat dom k 14 mcla where intensity 0 and intensity x are the chemiluminescent intensities of the o2 reaction with only mcla and mixers of mcla and varied concentrations of dom dom and mcla are the concentrations of dom and mcla respectively therefore the plot of intensity 0 intensity x as a function of dom resulted in a straight line with a slope equal to k cat mcla k 14 as shown in fig 3b based on the established rate constant for the o2 reaction with mcla k 14 2 4 105 m 1 s 1 the apparent catalytic rate constant of o2 with dom k cat was derived as 2 1 0 1 103 mc 1 s 1 temperature of 20 1 c the reaction of dom with o2 can be described as a catalytic reaction as reported by goldstone and voelker 2000 where k cat has been employed 17 k 7 dom rm k 8 dom dom k cat dom not domrm refers to k cat since the total concentrations of domrm remains unknown in the initial stage of dom mixing with o2 domrm decreased meanwhile dom increased until the equilibrium of k 7 domrm to k 8 dom has been established herein the apparent catalytic rate constant k cat for the o2 reaction with dom could rapidly change in the initial stage and steady in the latter it should be noted that these competitive reactions occurred in the flow cell the residence time of regent is 2 25 s therefore the k cat obtained in this study represented the average value of k cat in the initial 2 25 s reaction of dom with o2 the rationality of this method had been discussed in text s7 of the si where similar results 1 8 2 2 103 mc 1 s 1 were obtained in different initial o2 concentrations 40 150 nm fig s9 in the si this competitive method also relies on the assumption that dom does not affect the chemiluminescent sensitivity of mcla the reaction of dom with o2 doesn t produce any chemiluminescent signal under our experimental condition however it could not exclude the possibility of dom reaction with the intermediates of mcla to affect the chemiluminescent sensitivity of mcla 3 4 contribution of each dom component to the k pseudo of o2 3 4 1 the apparent reaction rate constants of o2 with phenols and quinones in this section model compounds were used to explore the roles of dom moieties in the catalytic decay of o2 table 1 shows the apparent o2 reaction rate constants for several model compounds at a neutral ph ph 7 and room temperature 20 c by using the method as described in section 2 4 2 the higher values k q 0 06 3 8 107 m 1 s 1 for the four quinones benzoquinone hydroquinone naphthoquinone and plumbagin while phenols have lower rate constants k phoh 0 13 2 1 103 m 1 s 1 the phenolic content in 0 041 mmc srfa is about 0 13 μm described in text s6 of the si using these values of phenols the decay rates of o2 contributed from phenolic moieties of 0 041 mmc srfa were estimated to be 0 2 3 10 4 s 1 which was far less than the pseudo first order decay rates of o2 by srfa 5 6 10 3 s 1 these results implied that the contribution of the dom phenolic moieties to the reaction with o2 was minor 3 4 2 the reaction rate constants of o2 with semi quinones radicals the reaction rate constants of o2 with semi quinones radicals k q are shown in table 1 which was determined by using the same kinetic model of dom described in section 3 1 as shown in fig s11 of the si the initial loss of o2 is equal to the semi quinone radicals concentrations which is formed from the rapid electron transfer between quinone and o2 the reaction rate constants of o2 with semi quinone radicals could be obtained from the slope of linear fitting between semi quinones radicals versus k pseudo fig s11b in the si our observed apparent bimolecular rate constants k q table 1 for certain semiquinones q and ho2 o2 varied from 0 4 to 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 were similar with dom k 8 of 1 6 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 these high k q values supported the assumption that quinones may serve as major redox moieties in the reactions of dom with o2 thus we speculated that the reactions of ho2 o2 with dom mainly occur at the quinone like moieties of the dom 3 4 3 the contribution of each dom components on the o2 pseudo first order decay rates the k pseudo of o2 in the presence of dom was combined using the following equation and including all the experimental parameters 18 k pseudo k metal m 2 k 8 dom 19 2 k 8 dom 2 k quinone quinone 2 k ketone ketone where the metal reactions k metal included all the trace metal complexes in dom cu fe mn etc the contribution of quinone and ketone moieties on the o2 decay was expressed as equation 19 the role of each dom component in the reaction of dom was explored by the addition of dtpa or comparing with nabh4 reduced dom solutions the measured k pseudo values in the presence and absence of dtpa and with and without the nabh4 reduction are shown in table s1 of the si the dom concentrations used in this study ranged from 0 041 to 0 16 mmc which are close to environmentally relevant conditions kortelainen 1993 stedmon et al 2000 the fraction of the observed o2 decay rate due to reactions with the metal components ranged from 13 to 23 and the contributions of the ketone moieties were within 10 13 reactions with the quinone moieties were considered the major o2 decay pathway and accounted for 64 77 of the o2 attenuation the details of each component contribution to the o2 decay are shown in fig s12 of the si 3 5 temperature dependence of the reaction rate constants of o2 with dom the kinetics of the apparent catalytic reactions between o2 and dom were further measured in the temperature range of 8 41 c at ph of 7 the measured temperature dependent reaction rate constants are linearly related to the free energy change espenson 1995 which can be expressed as the following 20 ln k e a r t ln a where e a is the apparent activation energy kj mol 1 under a thermodynamic equilibrium assumption between the reactants and the transition states the entropy of activation δs can be calculated from the following expression minakata et al 2011 21 a e k b t h e x p δ s r where k b is boltzmann s constant h is planck s constant and r is the gas constant the temperature dependent rate constants for o2 with mcla were determined via competition kinetics with ferricytochrome in the temperature range 281 309 k since the activation energy of ferricytochrome with o2 has been previously determined as 33 2 kj mol 1 butler et al 1982 detailed information of the competition reactions of mcla with ferricytochrome are described in text s8 of the si the temperature dependent rate constants for the reaction with o2 k cat and k 8 are shown in table s2 of the si the apparent catalytic rate constants for o2 with srfa were ranged from 1 5 to 3 3 103 mc 1 s 1 8 2 38 6 c the results for the second order rate constants for ho2 o2 with srfa varied from 1 1 to 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 7 8 41 4 c using the slopes of the curves in fig 4 the activation energies were determined to be 19 6 2 9 kj molc 1 and 12 5 3 5 kj mol 1 for srfa and srfa respectively table 2 shows the transition state entropies δs for the o2 reaction with srfa and srfa which were 29 2 0 7 cal k 1 molc 1 and 22 1 0 8 cal k 1 mol 1 at 300 k respectively the activation energy and arrhenius parameters allowed the considering the effect of temperature on superoxide ion decay rates for example in estimating the quenching rates of o2 by dom in the tropic oceans that annual average temperature e g 30 c would be significantly higher than that of locations at high latitudes 3 6 consideration of the ph effects on the reaction rate constant of o2 with dom as mentioned above o2 underwent protonation to ho2 which has a pka of 4 8 therefore the o2 reaction with srfa in solution involved ho2 reactions with srfa 22 2 h 2 o 2 srfa h 2 o 2 o 2 k 22 23 2 ho 2 srfa h 2 o 2 o 2 k 23 the apparent catalytic rate constants k 22 and k 23 of ho2 o2 with srfa were determined via competition kinetics using mcla at different ph values this competition consumption equation involved two o2 reactions for dom and mcla the chemiluminescent signal was used at the same time points once the signal was received at the flow cell where no appreciable self dismutation occurred the ph dependent reaction rate constants for mcla and ho2 o2 are reported in the literature akutsu et al 1995 the rate law of reaction between total o2 tot and dom was 24 d o 2 tot dt k 22 o 2 dom k 23 ho 2 dom equation 24 could be rewritten as akutsu et al 1995 25 d o 2 tot dt k 22 dom o 2 tot k a k a h k 23 dom o 2 tot h k a h therefore the apparent catalytic rate constants k cat was connected with the above two apparent reaction rate constants and the dissociation constant of ho2 o2 and expressed as following 26 k cat srfa k 22 k a k a h k 23 h k a h k 23 k 22 10 ph 4 8 1 10 ph 4 8 by fitting the experimentally measured k cat values into equations using origin 8 5 software the second order rate constants k 22 2 02 0 2 103 mc 1 s 1 and k 23 6 9 0 5 102 mc 1 s 1 were determined at 20 c the theoretical curves very well described the experimental values r 2 0 98 as displayed in fig 5 for srfa the reaction with o2 dominated the overall reaction at ph 4 5 and the contribution of k 22 was much larger than that of k 23 the contribution of k 23 was less than 2 at ph 6 in natural water the ph values are in the range of 6 8 gregor et al 1997 in this ph range our work results suggest that the o2 reaction with srfa dominates without considering metal catalytic dismutation in addition the chemistry acid base of substrates also influence the ph dependence rate constants by protonation or dissociation as bielski et al 1985 reported the pka of dom is typically in the range of 2 5 leenheer et al 1995 which indicates that dissociation products of dom qh q2 dominate in waters at ph of 7 timko et al 2015 4 conclusions the chemiluminescent analysis suggested that dom is an effective catalyst for o2 disproportionation via redox cycling of dom dom the apparent catalytic rate constants for dom with o2 were measured 1 5 3 3 103 mc 1 s 1 in the temperature range from 8 2 to 38 6 c with an apparent activation energy of 19 6 2 9 kj molc 1 at ph of 7 0 while the rate constants for dom with ho2 o2 were also determined to be 1 1 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 in the temperature range from 7 8 to 41 4 c with an apparent activation energy of 12 5 3 5 kj mol 1 at ph of 7 0 the quinone like groups of dom made major contribution of o2 catalytic dismutation accounted for 64 77 based on the steady state concentration of o2 o2 ss in seawaters 10 11 10 10 m voelker et al 2000 we could estimate the formation rates of dom using the results obtained in the present study the formation rates of dom was equal to its decay rates to maintain a steady state concentration as following equation 27 f d o m k 7 o 2 ss dom rm k 8 o 2 ss dom s s the average concentration of dom in seawaters was 2 6 80 μmc guo et al 1995 stedmon et al 2000 therefore steady state dom ss 10 10 10 9 m could be estimated by molecular ratio of dom to dom 4 4 0 3 10 5 m mc determined in our work thus the formation rates of dom were calculated to be 10 12 10 14 m s 1 in surface waters derived from the reaction of dom with o2 however dom could also be generated from the molecular charge transfer under solar irradiation golanoski et al 2012 sharpless and blough 2014 zhang et al 2012 further investigation is needed to elucidate the reactivity

19133,superoxide ion o2 is one of the short lived reactive oxygen species ros formed in aquatic environments the reactions of o2 with the model dissolved organic matter dom were studied using a chemiluminescent analysis method under relevant environmental conditions the reaction of o2 with dom produced reduced dom dom by fast one electron transfer in the initial stage this process resulted an initial loss in the o2 decay kinetics dom is unstable which will continue react with o2 generating h2o2 to complete a catalytic dismutation cycle based on analyzing the observed pseudo first order o2 decay rates k pseudo the quasi steady state concentration of dom is found to be equal to the initial loss of o2 thus the rate constant for dom with ho2 o2 is derived to be 1 1 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 in the temperature range of 7 8 41 4 c meanwhile the apparent rate constant for dom with o2 in a flow cell during a short time 2 25 s is measured as 1 5 3 3 103 mc 1 s 1 in the temperature range of 8 2 38 6 c these temperature dependent o2 reaction rate constants present an apparent activation energy of 19 6 2 9 kj molc 1 for dom while that of dom 12 5 3 5 kj mol 1 is lower for the pseudo first order decay rate of o2 the catalyzed dismutation by metal components ranges from 13 to 23 the contribution by aromatic ketones of dom is estimated to be 10 13 by using nabh4 reduction method the residual contribution might mainly occur at the quinone like groups which contributed 64 77 to the total dismutation the ph effects on the apparent catalytic rate constants dominate the reaction of o2 with dom the present work suggests that dom is an important sink for o2 in aquatic environments furthermore we proposed that the reaction of o2 with dom could be a potential source of dom in natural water graphical abstract image 1 keywords superoxide radical ion dissolved organic matters kinetic studies reaction mechanism 1 introduction the superoxide radical ion o2 is one of the most important reactive oxygen species ros formed in aquatic environments under solar irradiation hayyan et al 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 waggoner et al 2017 o2 is considered both a radical and anion hayyan et al 2016 in sunlit surface waters o2 is primarily formed via the reaction of dissolved oxygen with electron donors zhou et al 2017 which are produced via intramolecular electron transfers within the excited states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom baxter and carey 1983 zhang et al 2012 the formation of o2 via one electron transfer from electron donors to singlet oxygen 1o2 was also reported in the literature saito et al 1981 1983 theoretically 1o2 can be more susceptible to one electron transfer with electron donors than the ground state of oxygen due to the lower reduction potential additionally o2 may also be introduced into the water column via metabolic processes in phytoplankton and bacteria diaz et al 2013 kim et al 2000 the superoxide ion undergoes protonation to its conjugate acid hydroperoxyl radical ho2 which has a pka of 4 8 zafiriou 1990 1 o2 h ho2 pka 4 8 furthermore ho2 reacts with itself and o2 to yield hydrogen peroxide and oxygen via second order disproportionation reactions rose and waite 2005 sheng et al 2014 2 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 k 2 8 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 3 ho 2 o 2 ho 2 o 2 k 3 9 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 4 ho 2 h h 2 o 2 p k a 11 6 thus the overall apparent rate of superoxide dismutation incorporating the decay of both ho2 and o2 varies with ph values transition metal ions such as fe fujii et al 2008 rose and waite 2006 mn and cu and their organic complexes can rapidly react with o2 leading to a catalytic cycle for o2 decay with reaction rate constants from 105 to 109 m 1 s 1 rose and waite 2005 voelker et al 2000 as following equations 5 m n 1 o2 mn o2 6 mn o2 2h m n 1 h2o2 previous studies wuttig et al 2013 have demonstrated that metal catalytic dismutation contributes to 62 88 of o2 decay in the ocean surface the products of superoxide decomposition are h2o2 and o2 photochemically produced o2 is thought to be a major pathway for h2o2 formation in natural water cooper and zika 1983 miller et al 2009 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural water system niu et al 2016 and consists of a mixture of biological and chemical decomposition products of algae bacteria plants and animal residues chen et al 2002 del vecchio and blough 2004 garg et al 2015 the pseudo first order decay rates of o2 in the natural water have been investigated by several groups goldstone and voelker 2000 reported that dom containing nonmetallic redox cycling components possibly via quinone functionalities is capable of catalyzing o2 dismutation they also found that o2 pseudo first order rates k pseudo have a significant correlation r 2 0 73 with the optical absorbance of dom at 300 nm fujii and otani 2017 recently found that dom aromaticity correlated with o2 decay kinetics although dom plays an important role in the decomposition of o2 in natural water the detailed mechanism on the reaction between o2 and dom are not fully understood the redox reactive moieties present in such molecules are considered to be responsible for nonmetal catalyzed o2 disproportionation which are agreed with many research groups fujii and otani 2017 garg et al 2011 this assumption includes both the oxidation of o2 to o2 and the reduction of o2 to h2o2 as typically described below 7 o 2 tot dom rm o 2 dom k 7 8 o 2 tot dom 2 h h 2 o 2 dom rm k 8 in these reactions the symbol of o2 tot represents the quantity of o2 and ho2 domrm and dom represent the redox moieties and one electron reduced in dom molecule respectively and k 7 and k 8 are reaction rate constants for oxidative and reductive o2 decay the reduction potentials of dom 0 18 0 61 v aeschbacher et al 2010 2012 are between the one electron reduction potential of o2 and o2 e 0 o2 o2 0 18 v e 0 o2 h2o2 0 91 v sheng et al 2014 therefore o2 can both oxidize dom and reduce dom as shown in equations 7 and 8 this reaction is apparent because the actual reacting species may involve quinone hydroquinone and semiquinone radicals one electron cycle dismutation of o2 is the major pathway since 2 electron reductions 104 m 1 s 1 ashnagar et al 1984 bielski et al 1985 garg et al 2007 presents significantly lower rate constants than one electron cycle 108 109 m 1 s 1 shkarina et al 2001 the investigation of bimolecular reaction rate constants k 7 and k 8 are necessary secondly o2 can rapidly react with both quinone and hydroquinone to yield the corresponding radicals eyer 1991 scott et al 1998 zhang et al 2014 despite the similarities between the redox behavior of dom and quinonyl compounds the mechanisms and kinetics parameters of the reactions of dom and o2 may be different from those of quinones because of the extended network of potentially conjugated aromatic structures in dom del vecchio and blough 2004 these unique structures can possibly cause dom to delocalize electrons and stabilize free radicals in addition quinone like moieties comprise a relatively small proportion of the total composition of dom for instance the dom presented low electron accepting capacities eac i e quinones ranges from 490 to 1960 μmole g 1 aeschbacher et al 2010 which is roughly equivalent of 290 980 μmol g 1 of quinones concentration aromatic ketones can also react with o2 as reducible groups gibian et al 1979 consequently the contribution of aromatic ketones and quinone like groups in dom to the reactions with o2 still remains unclear therefore quantifying the reaction rate constants and contributions of each dom component to the reaction with o2 is important for understanding the role of dom in the decay process of o2 the purpose of this study is to explore the detailed reaction kinetic of dom and o2 suwannee river fulvic acid srfa was selected as a model dom the present study used a competitive chemiluminescent method to determine the apparent catalytic rate constants between o2 with dom through measuring the decay rates of excessive o2 in the varying concentrations of dom the second order reaction rate constants of dom with ho o2 were also examined particularly the contribution of ketones moieties on the total dismutation of o2 was quantified based on the attenuation of the pseudo first order o2 decay rates in the presence of nabh4 reduced dom which can reduce the aromatic ketones to alcohol lower rate constants with o2 102 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 the reaction rate constants of dom are similar with model quinones compounds suggests that o2 catalytic dismutation mainly occur at the quinone like groups this information is valuable for understanding the transformation and fate of o2 in sunlit surface waters and we hope this attempt will be useful in filling existing knowledge gaps concerning important details of dom reaction with o2 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals reagent solutions were

were adjusted in the range of 4 5 8 0 using phosphate buffer ph 6 0 to 8 0 and sodium acetate ph from 4 5 to 5 5 in the presence of 1 0 μm dtpa the o2 standard curves at varied ph values were also performed before the each experiment the schematic diagram of the workflow are provided in scheme 2 of the si all the test solutions were carried in a water jacketed beaker which was kept circulating by a liquid thermostatic bath 2 5 h2o2 measurement nabh4 reduction and phenolic content determination the determination of h2o2 concentration and reduction of srfa by nabh4 are provided in text s4 and text s5 in the si the phenolic content of srfa was determined by folin ciocalteu method text s6 of the si 3 results and discussions 3 1 determination the reaction rate constants of o2 with dom 3 1 1 measurement of the observed pseudo first order decay rates of o2 kpseudo in dom solutions in this experiment o2 was spiked into varied concentrations of dom solutions to observe its decay behaviors the experimental flow chart in scheme 1 of the si as described in section 2 4 1 the overall kinetic reactivity of o2 design was based on the previous established equation heller and croot 2010b which included the pseudo first order of o2 reactions with organic matter and the second order self dismutation rate 9 d o 2 dt 2 k d o 2 tot 2 k pseudo o 2 tot where k d is the second order uncatalyzed dismutation rate constant of o2 and reactions with organic matter is described by the pseudo first order rate k pseudo the analytical solution to eq 9 was given by a previous literature heller and croot 2010a 10 o 2 t k pseudo k pseudo o 2 0 2 k d e k pseudo t 2 k d where o2 0 is the initial concentration of o2 the k pseudo are obtained by fitting the decay curves of o2 at various dom concentrations fig 1 a shows that the decay rates of o2 increased from 0 0032 to 0 043 s 1 with the increasing dom concentrations ranging from 0 016 to 0 32 mmc at ph of 7 these results agree with previous reported values with using the same equation for o2 loss rate for example garg et al 2011 measured the pseudo first order reaction rate of 6 6 10 3 s 1 for 1 mg l 1 srfa at ph of 8 1 which was similar with our values 5 6 10 3 s 1 1 mg l 1 srfa at ph of 7 the k d in our work was measured to be 1 2 0 2 105 m 1 s 1 at ph of 7 which was lower than theoretical value 5 105 m 1 s 1 calculated by k d 5 1012 h m 1 s 1 3 1 2 determination of dom concentration produced by the initial fast attenuation of o2 in the catalytic dismutation the decay curves of o2 in dom solutions were fitted by equation 10 fig 1a however the o2 concentration extrapolated back to time zero was lower than the initial o2 concentration actually added into dom solutions 50 1 nm the initial attenuation of o2 1 3 13 2 nm also increased with the increasing dom concentrations 0 016 0 32 mmc and a linear relationship was observed fig 1b in additional within different concentrations of spiked o2 25 85 nm and the fixed dom concentration the initial drop of o2 is constant of about 6 nm and independent with initial concentrations of o2 fig 2 it suggested that o2 was excessive in the initial reaction if the overall o2 dismutation was governed by a uniform catalytic cycle with dom all these fittings should be extrapolated back to the same initial o2 at time 0 as actually added which was clearly contradicted with our results as shown in fig s6 in the si the fitting curves with the fixed initial o2 were obviously not suitable for modeling the o2 decay behaviors especially at higher dom concentrations therefore we can conclude that the initial loss of o2 is caused by a much faster initial reaction although the apparent concentration of dom 0 041 0 32 mmc were greatly higher than the initial input of o2 50 nm o2 was still excessive at the initial stage as illustrated in fig 2 to explain this phenomenon it is apparent that not all components of dom were involved in the reactions with o2 only the active function groups the redox moiety domrm in the dom could promote the catalyzed dismutation of o2 then domrm were converted to dom by a rapid charge transfer with o2 furthermore the initial attenuation of o2 was applied to quantity the dom concentrations under our experimental conditions as fig 1b demonstrated the molecular ratio of dom to dom was the slope of line which was approximately 4 4 0 3 10 5 m mc fig 1a demonstrated that the real time o2 concentrations were always greater than the attenuation of o2 in fig 1a this phenomenon supported our assumptions that the missing initial o2 was consumed by the faster initial reaction 7 further generating dom which was accounted for only a small portion of the total dom therefore we concluded that the quasi steady state concentration of dom was equal to the initial attenuation concentration of o2 the dom concentrations obtained in our experiments are based on the assumption that dom are all produced upon the reaction with o2 and it is not initially present in the raw dom solutions 3 2 determination the reaction rate constants of o2 with dom as discussed in above section the quasi dom concentration is equal to the initial loss of o2 in the pseudo first decay of o2 on the observed time scale domrm is continually created by reaction 8 and then consumed again by reaction 7 to maintain dynamic equilibrium in this case the formation rate of dom eq 7 is equal to its decay rate eq 8 to keep a constant steady concentration of dom as shown in equation 11 d o 2 tot dt 2 k d o 2 tot 2 k 7 dom rm o 2 tot k 8 dom o 2 tot it can be converted to eq 12 12 d o 2 tot dt 2 k d o 2 tot 2 2 k 8 dom o 2 tot thus the k pseudo in the presence of different dom concentration was regarded as the results from the reaction of dom and ho2 o2 it could be expressed by the following equation 13 k pseudo 2 k 8 dom ss where dom ss was the steady state concentration of dom determined by measuring the initial attenuation of o2 the slope of linear fitting in a plot of the change in k pseudo versus the dom ss concentration gave the k 8 of 1 6 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 at ph of 7 22 c it should be noted that the catalytic cycle reactions with single first order loss may also contribute to k pseudo herein k 8 may be underestimated the similar results for the molecular ratio of dom to dom 4 7 0 2 10 5 m mc and k 8 1 4 0 3 106 m 1 s 1 were also obtained by the addition of 85 nm o2 in the buffer solutions fig s7 of the si furthermore the effects of inorganic ions phosphate chloride and sulfate ions and dtpa were examined via the addition of different anion concentrations to the o2 solutions no correlation was observed between the k pseudo value and the ion concentrations phosphate chloride and sulfate ions and dtpa fig s8 of the si 3 3 measurement of the apparent reaction rate constants between o2 and dom although the bimolecular reaction rate constant of dom with o2 has been obtained the reaction rate of domrm with o2 k 7 remain unclear since the domrm is unknown therefore we have tried to characterize the total apparent catalytic rate constants of o2 with dom k cat via mcla competition kinetics as described in section 2 4 2 in this experiments mcla reagent solutions containing varying concentrations of dom 0 0 24 mmc were further employed as chemiluminescent reagents the experimental setup was shown in scheme 2 of the si this experimental setup is different from the classic setup for o2 chemiluminescent measurement in fig 1 they reacted with the o2 solution 40 1 nm in a flow cell in front of the pmt since the reaction of mcla with o2 in an aqueous buffer solution generated a chemiluminescent signal which was linear with the concentration of o2 akutsu et al 1995 14 mcla o 2 2 h omcla co 2 h v k 14 2 40 0 24 10 5 m 1 s 1 the presence of dom in mcla reagents could quench the o2 chemiluminescent signals due to the competitive reaction of dom hence the fraction of o2 reacting with mcla could be given by the ratio of the reaction with mcla which could be represented by the intensity of chemiluminescent signal in the flow cell over the total rate of disappearance of o2 15 intensity x intensity 0 o 2 mcla k 14 o 2 mcla k 14 o 2 dom k cat the chemiluminescent signals counts decreased with increasing srfa concentrations with addition of same concentrations of o2 as shown in fig 3 a the decreases of chemiluminescent signal were proportional to the dom concentrations to minimize the experimental errors the highest chemiluminescent signals at the time points of 18 0 s were applied to calculate the apparent catalytic rate constant k cat the o2 competition can be analyzed to give the following expression as illustrated in eq 16 16 intensity 0 intensity x 1 k cat dom k 14 mcla where intensity 0 and intensity x are the chemiluminescent intensities of the o2 reaction with only mcla and mixers of mcla and varied concentrations of dom dom and mcla are the concentrations of dom and mcla respectively therefore the plot of intensity 0 intensity x as a function of dom resulted in a straight line with a slope equal to k cat mcla k 14 as shown in fig 3b based on the established rate constant for the o2 reaction with mcla k 14 2 4 105 m 1 s 1 the apparent catalytic rate constant of o2 with dom k cat was derived as 2 1 0 1 103 mc 1 s 1 temperature of 20 1 c the reaction of dom with o2 can be described as a catalytic reaction as reported by goldstone and voelker 2000 where k cat has been employed 17 k 7 dom rm k 8 dom dom k cat dom not domrm refers to k cat since the total concentrations of domrm remains unknown in the initial stage of dom mixing with o2 domrm decreased meanwhile dom increased until the equilibrium of k 7 domrm to k 8 dom has been established herein the apparent catalytic rate constant k cat for the o2 reaction with dom could rapidly change in the initial stage and steady in the latter it should be noted that these competitive reactions occurred in the flow cell the residence time of regent is 2 25 s therefore the k cat obtained in this study represented the average value of k cat in the initial 2 25 s reaction of dom with o2 the rationality of this method had been discussed in text s7 of the si where similar results 1 8 2 2 103 mc 1 s 1 were obtained in different initial o2 concentrations 40 150 nm fig s9 in the si this competitive method also relies on the assumption that dom does not affect the chemiluminescent sensitivity of mcla the reaction of dom with o2 doesn t produce any chemiluminescent signal under our experimental condition however it could not exclude the possibility of dom reaction with the intermediates of mcla to affect the chemiluminescent sensitivity of mcla 3 4 contribution of each dom component to the k pseudo of o2 3 4 1 the apparent reaction rate constants of o2 with phenols and quinones in this section model compounds were used to explore the roles of dom moieties in the catalytic decay of o2 table 1 shows the apparent o2 reaction rate constants for several model compounds at a neutral ph ph 7 and room temperature 20 c by using the method as described in section 2 4 2 the higher values k q 0 06 3 8 107 m 1 s 1 for the four quinones benzoquinone hydroquinone naphthoquinone and plumbagin while phenols have lower rate constants k phoh 0 13 2 1 103 m 1 s 1 the phenolic content in 0 041 mmc srfa is about 0 13 μm described in text s6 of the si using these values of phenols the decay rates of o2 contributed from phenolic moieties of 0 041 mmc srfa were estimated to be 0 2 3 10 4 s 1 which was far less than the pseudo first order decay rates of o2 by srfa 5 6 10 3 s 1 these results implied that the contribution of the dom phenolic moieties to the reaction with o2 was minor 3 4 2 the reaction rate constants of o2 with semi quinones radicals the reaction rate constants of o2 with semi quinones radicals k q are shown in table 1 which was determined by using the same kinetic model of dom described in section 3 1 as shown in fig s11 of the si the initial loss of o2 is equal to the semi quinone radicals concentrations which is formed from the rapid electron transfer between quinone and o2 the reaction rate constants of o2 with semi quinone radicals could be obtained from the slope of linear fitting between semi quinones radicals versus k pseudo fig s11b in the si our observed apparent bimolecular rate constants k q table 1 for certain semiquinones q and ho2 o2 varied from 0 4 to 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 were similar with dom k 8 of 1 6 0 2 106 m 1 s 1 these high k q values supported the assumption that quinones may serve as major redox moieties in the reactions of dom with o2 thus we speculated that the reactions of ho2 o2 with dom mainly occur at the quinone like moieties of the dom 3 4 3 the contribution of each dom components on the o2 pseudo first order decay rates the k pseudo of o2 in the presence of dom was combined using the following equation and including all the experimental parameters 18 k pseudo k metal m 2 k 8 dom 19 2 k 8 dom 2 k quinone quinone 2 k ketone ketone where the metal reactions k metal included all the trace metal complexes in dom cu fe mn etc the contribution of quinone and ketone moieties on the o2 decay was expressed as equation 19 the role of each dom component in the reaction of dom was explored by the addition of dtpa or comparing with nabh4 reduced dom solutions the measured k pseudo values in the presence and absence of dtpa and with and without the nabh4 reduction are shown in table s1 of the si the dom concentrations used in this study ranged from 0 041 to 0 16 mmc which are close to environmentally relevant conditions kortelainen 1993 stedmon et al 2000 the fraction of the observed o2 decay rate due to reactions with the metal components ranged from 13 to 23 and the contributions of the ketone moieties were within 10 13 reactions with the quinone moieties were considered the major o2 decay pathway and accounted for 64 77 of the o2 attenuation the details of each component contribution to the o2 decay are shown in fig s12 of the si 3 5 temperature dependence of the reaction rate constants of o2 with dom the kinetics of the apparent catalytic reactions between o2 and dom were further measured in the temperature range of 8 41 c at ph of 7 the measured temperature dependent reaction rate constants are linearly related to the free energy change espenson 1995 which can be expressed as the following 20 ln k e a r t ln a where e a is the apparent activation energy kj mol 1 under a thermodynamic equilibrium assumption between the reactants and the transition states the entropy of activation δs can be calculated from the following expression minakata et al 2011 21 a e k b t h e x p δ s r where k b is boltzmann s constant h is planck s constant and r is the gas constant the temperature dependent rate constants for o2 with mcla were determined via competition kinetics with ferricytochrome in the temperature range 281 309 k since the activation energy of ferricytochrome with o2 has been previously determined as 33 2 kj mol 1 butler et al 1982 detailed information of the competition reactions of mcla with ferricytochrome are described in text s8 of the si the temperature dependent rate constants for the reaction with o2 k cat and k 8 are shown in table s2 of the si the apparent catalytic rate constants for o2 with srfa were ranged from 1 5 to 3 3 103 mc 1 s 1 8 2 38 6 c the results for the second order rate constants for ho2 o2 with srfa varied from 1 1 to 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 7 8 41 4 c using the slopes of the curves in fig 4 the activation energies were determined to be 19 6 2 9 kj molc 1 and 12 5 3 5 kj mol 1 for srfa and srfa respectively table 2 shows the transition state entropies δs for the o2 reaction with srfa and srfa which were 29 2 0 7 cal k 1 molc 1 and 22 1 0 8 cal k 1 mol 1 at 300 k respectively the activation energy and arrhenius parameters allowed the considering the effect of temperature on superoxide ion decay rates for example in estimating the quenching rates of o2 by dom in the tropic oceans that annual average temperature e g 30 c would be significantly higher than that of locations at high latitudes 3 6 consideration of the ph effects on the reaction rate constant of o2 with dom as mentioned above o2 underwent protonation to ho2 which has a pka of 4 8 therefore the o2 reaction with srfa in solution involved ho2 reactions with srfa 22 2 h 2 o 2 srfa h 2 o 2 o 2 k 22 23 2 ho 2 srfa h 2 o 2 o 2 k 23 the apparent catalytic rate constants k 22 and k 23 of ho2 o2 with srfa were determined via competition kinetics using mcla at different ph values this competition consumption equation involved two o2 reactions for dom and mcla the chemiluminescent signal was used at the same time points once the signal was received at the flow cell where no appreciable self dismutation occurred the ph dependent reaction rate constants for mcla and ho2 o2 are reported in the literature akutsu et al 1995 the rate law of reaction between total o2 tot and dom was 24 d o 2 tot dt k 22 o 2 dom k 23 ho 2 dom equation 24 could be rewritten as akutsu et al 1995 25 d o 2 tot dt k 22 dom o 2 tot k a k a h k 23 dom o 2 tot h k a h therefore the apparent catalytic rate constants k cat was connected with the above two apparent reaction rate constants and the dissociation constant of ho2 o2 and expressed as following 26 k cat srfa k 22 k a k a h k 23 h k a h k 23 k 22 10 ph 4 8 1 10 ph 4 8 by fitting the experimentally measured k cat values into equations using origin 8 5 software the second order rate constants k 22 2 02 0 2 103 mc 1 s 1 and k 23 6 9 0 5 102 mc 1 s 1 were determined at 20 c the theoretical curves very well described the experimental values r 2 0 98 as displayed in fig 5 for srfa the reaction with o2 dominated the overall reaction at ph 4 5 and the contribution of k 22 was much larger than that of k 23 the contribution of k 23 was less than 2 at ph 6 in natural water the ph values are in the range of 6 8 gregor et al 1997 in this ph range our work results suggest that the o2 reaction with srfa dominates without considering metal catalytic dismutation in addition the chemistry acid base of substrates also influence the ph dependence rate constants by protonation or dissociation as bielski et al 1985 reported the pka of dom is typically in the range of 2 5 leenheer et al 1995 which indicates that dissociation products of dom qh q2 dominate in waters at ph of 7 timko et al 2015 4 conclusions the chemiluminescent analysis suggested that dom is an effective catalyst for o2 disproportionation via redox cycling of dom dom the apparent catalytic rate constants for dom with o2 were measured 1 5 3 3 103 mc 1 s 1 in the temperature range from 8 2 to 38 6 c with an apparent activation energy of 19 6 2 9 kj molc 1 at ph of 7 0 while the rate constants for dom with ho2 o2 were also determined to be 1 1 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 in the temperature range from 7 8 to 41 4 c with an apparent activation energy of 12 5 3 5 kj mol 1 at ph of 7 0 the quinone like groups of dom made major contribution of o2 catalytic dismutation accounted for 64 77 based on the steady state concentration of o2 o2 ss in seawaters 10 11 10 10 m voelker et al 2000 we could estimate the formation rates of dom using the results obtained in the present study the formation rates of dom was equal to its decay rates to maintain a steady state concentration as following equation 27 f d o m k 7 o 2 ss dom rm k 8 o 2 ss dom s s the average concentration of dom in seawaters was 2 6 80 μmc guo et al 1995 stedmon et al 2000 therefore steady state dom ss 10 10 10 9 m could be estimated by molecular ratio of dom to dom 4 4 0 3 10 5 m mc determined in our work thus the formation rates of dom were calculated to be 10 12 10 14 m s 1 in surface waters derived from the reaction of dom with o2 however dom could also be generated from the molecular charge transfer under solar irradiation golanoski et al 2012 sharpless and blough 2014 zhang et al 2012 further investigation is needed to elucidate the reactivity

19134,isolating dissolved organic matter dom is a preliminary step that improves the accuracy of its characterization in this study dom in brackish water was clearly separated and evaluated by multiple characterization analyses the sample was divided into three fractions by preparative high performance liquid chromatography preparative hplc according to molecular size the homogeneity of each fraction was estimated by analytical size exclusion chromatography sec and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms and liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of each fraction py gc ms revealed that fraction 1 consisted of evenly distributed organic matter in order polysaccharides proteins polyhydroxy aromatics lignins and lipids however fraction 2 was primarily composed of dominant lipids and low portion of proteins and fraction 3 was composed predominantly of lignins and lipids the lc ocd results showed that fractions 1 and 2 had similar organic carbon oc compositions a humic substance ca 37 building blocks ca 10 and neutrals ca 37 whereas

introduction membrane filtration is used for desalination wastewater treatment and other industrial separation processes cho et al 1999 kim et al 2009 krauth and staab 1993 zularisam et al 2006 one common obstacle in these processes is membrane fouling due to the complex combination of various types of foulants i e organic matter ions colloids and microorganisms chang et al 2001 meng et al 2009 wang et al 2009 among the various foulant types dissolved organic matter dom in feed water causes severe problems during the filtration process fan et al 2001 tang et al 2010 because dom is closely related to both organic and bio fouling development amy 2008 fan et al 2001 gur reznik et al 2008 however it is hard to estimate its influence on membrane fouling due to the physicochemical heterogeneity of dom nebbioso and piccolo 2013 in practice although operated under the same dom concentrations and operating conditions membrane filtration shows different fouling growth tendencies according to the biodegradability of the organic matters present park et al 2017b 2018 understanding the influence of organic matter characteristics on fouling flux decline and membrane performance is an important area of research as such studies have identified the factors driving fouling and methods to mitigate adverse membrane impacts cho et al 2000 lee et al 2004 various analytical methods such as ultraviolet uv absorbance fluorescence spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography sec fourier transform infrared ftir liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms have been widely used to identify organic matter functionality molecular size distribution and origin conte et al 2007 huber et al 2011a kennedy et al 2005 leenheer et al 2004 however the inherent heterogeneity of dom presents a challenge when identifying specific dom features because heterogeneity results in lower analytical sensitivity and accuracy thus to evaluate the influences from target dom properties homogeneity must be obtained according to the analytical purpose several dom separating protocols have been reported to enhance dom homogeneity for surface water and wastewater chon et al 2017 ma et al 2001 maurice et al 2002 xad 8 4 resin solid phase extraction spe and preparative hplc are commonly used chon et al 2017 lombardi

characterization and provided valuable insight into molecular weight dependent characteristics chon et al 2017 wu et al 2003 dom characterization in brackish water is difficult due to high salt and low organic matter concentrations some studies have characterized dom in high salt concentration solutions but most of these suggest characterizing dom in bulk solution jeong et al 2013 song et al 2012 tang et al 2016 this level of understanding is insufficient to ascertain the precise dom characteristics from saline water and thus its influence on membrane fouling in this study we used preparative hplc to obtain detailed characteristics of dom in brackish water the principle objective of this study was to characterize dom in brackish water to better understand its influence on membrane fouling we aimed to 1 reduce the relative salinity total mass of ions total mass of doc and increase organic matter concentration in brackish water through filtration and evaporation

for dom separation the experimental procedure is illustrated in fig 1 in panel 1 the two pretreatment steps were designed to isolate dom in brackish water by reducing salt and concentrating organic matter in panel 2 the fractionating step separated the dom into three fractions through preparative lc finally in panel 3 the dom was characterized via lc ocd and py gc ms to determine the fouling potential of each fraction with corresponding filtration performance because of low dom concentrations in brackish water it is necessary to concentrate samples however because salt concentration increases during the dom concentrating step salt removal from brackish water is necessary once salt is considered in concentration process it could encounter crystallization problem somewhere on the analysis process that results in severe analytic problem as a desalting method a nanofiltration nf membrane ne2540 90 toray chemical corp japan was used to remove ionic compounds and increase dom concentration nf membranes show relatively low ion rejection and high organic matter rejection performance cho et al 1999 the filtration system was operated in concentration mode by discarding the

membrane surface area was 36 cm2 6 cm 6 cm the operating conditions were controlled by a gear pump system ew 74013 25 cole parmer usa under 0 17 m s crossflow velocity at 5 bar before filtration the nf membranes were pre treated by soaking in distilled water for at least 24 h and compressed by distilled water filtration the fractionated sample solutions were processed with di water and sodium chloride in order to compare the fouling potentials at the same doc concentration and conductivity 3 results and discussion 3 1 desalting and concentrating the brackish water combining the nf system and evaporation decreased the total amount of ions and increased the doc concentration relevant information e g ph conductivity and volume is summarized in table 1 the initial conductivity of the brackish water sample was 26 7 ms cm with 1 9 mg c l of doc concentration at the end of the nf system circulation mode the doc concentration increased about 30 fold from 1 9 mg c l to 60 mg c l while the total volume decreased 70 fold 120 l 1 8 l indicating 47 3 dom recovery possible explanations for the filtration recovery rate include 1 accumulated organic matter in the membrane module and 2 leakage loss during filtration one study of organic matter recovery reported that over 20 of organic matter was deposited on the inside walls of the system during direct membrane filtration and the recovery rate from the concentrate was limited to approximately 45 lateef et al 2013 the filtered water showed a conductivity increase compared to the raw brackish water however this difference was derived from the decrease in water volume not an increase in total ion content the total mass of ions decreased from 2050 g 42 g while the total doc mass remained 108 mg thus the filtration process successfully decreased the relative salinity from 9 0 to 0 39 representing a change in mass of ions per mass of doc the evaporator concentrated water volume 12 fold 1 8 l 0 15 l resulting in 313 mg c l doc concentration and corresponding to 47 4 dom recovery and 0 16 relative salinity after finishing the concentration step ions precipitated in the sample because the water removal process induced excess saturation conditions from this result the low dom recovery rate can be interpreted as the co precipitation of salt and dom a similar co precipitation phenomena was previously reported where the co precipitation of dom with calcium carbonate caused a decrease in doc concentration leenheer and reddy 2008 the variation in ion composition was measured using ic to identify the influence of the filtration and evaporation processes fig 2 nf substantially decreased almost 99 the monovalent ions e g na k and cl in brackish water through concentration resulting in divalent e g mg2 ca2 and so4 2 dominant water calcium and sulfate ion removal was observed after the ic evaporation process resulting in 24 0 calcium and 21 8 sulfate ion removal this might be attributed to the influence of calcium sulfate precipitation during evaporation that could lead to the co precipitation of calcium sulfate and dom as discussed previously dom fluorescence characteristics in raw and concentrated samples were measured by 3d fluorescence spectroscopy fig 3 the raw brackish water showed two clear peaks in 3d feem which imply humic a and fulvic b acid like substances after concentration 3d feem detected both humic and fulvic acid like substance peaks represented by clear high intensity peak points the molecular size distribution of both samples was estimated by sec fig 4 the chromatogram of the raw brackish water contains one clear peak around 1000 s with another relatively low and broad peak around 900 s in contrast the concentrated brackish water consisted of three distinct peaks corresponding to retention times of 900 1 000 and 1150 s the presence of new peaks in the excitation emission matrix eem and sec demonstrated that the proposed concentrating process concentrated the dom from saline water without removing dom components during the process dom loss prevention was restricted however the dom component in the concentrated brackish water was well preserved which was verified by the presence of fluorescence peaks in the spectra and presence of molecular weight peaks 3 2 fractionating organic matter using preparative high performance liquid chromatography hplc the injected organic matter was divided into three fractions according to molecular size through a preparative hplc system fig 5 is the preparative hplc chromatogram for the concentrated brackish water containing 313 mg c l of carbon source the chromatogram shows two noticeable peaks at 11 min and 19 min a small intensity ambiguous peak was detected close to 25 min this was considered to be a stretched and overlapped region from peak 2 next peak fractionation was performed based on the peak positions the doc concentration of the peaks was measured directly after fractionation the fractions corresponding to peaks 1 2 and 3 had doc concentrations of 11 9 37 3 and 3 4 mg c l respectively the fractions were re analyzed by analytical hplc to confirm the homogeneity of the fractionated dom the homogeneity of each fraction was validated using the size distribution of organic matter and polydispersity ρ for the raw brackish water and three fractions raw brackish water 2 99 fraction 1 1 20 fraction 2 1 76 and fraction 3 1 69 as shown in fig 6 s1 and table 2 clearly separated chromatograms are visible with enhanced homogeneity demonstrating high homogeneity among the fractions from the concentrated brackish water in terms of organic matter size in addition to the molecular size distribution the eem analysis produced the organic matter compositions of the fractions shown in fig 7 the spectrum for fraction 1 contained a a broad marine humic acid like substance peak and a high intensity fulvic acid like substance peaks in comparison fraction 2 showed clearly separated b fulvic acid like substance peaks and c high intensity humic acid like substance peaks fraction 3 had a clear a marine humic acid like peak and b fulvic acid like peak indicating comparable fluorescence properties with fraction 1 although different molecular weights this assessment supports the hypothesis that dom fractionation could be performed using prep hplc resulting in high homogeneity and fractions with unique characteristics 3 3 characterizing the organic matter fractions of brackish water pyrolysis breaks organic matters down into small fragments that are detectable molecules by gc ms the fragments are identified as specific molecules matching with ms library based on the molecular weight from the analytical results py gc ms technique provides a qualitative organic matter characteristics in terms of molecular building blocks sillanpää 2014 the pyrolyzed organic matter compositions of the fractions are illustrated in fig 8 fraction 1 was comprised of various organic matter components 25 6 ps 23 8 pr 19 8 pha 15 3 lg and 15 5 lp fraction 2 contained 17 5 pr and 71 8 lp as the dominant organic contents with lesser amounts of other components 2 4 ps 0 4 pha and 7 9 lg fraction 3 was comprised of two large organic matter components lg and lp having 38 8 and 38 5 of the total respectively residuals for fraction 3 included other organics in lower proportions 4 0 ps 6 7 pr and 11 4 pha overall the ps and pr distribution follows the hplc retention time higher proportions are found for those eluting first the relatively high amount of ps in fraction 1 suggests that the organic matter originated from microbial products such as microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps chon et al 2017 kennedy et al 2005 which have the potential to cause membrane biofouling in the presence of microorganisms demneh et al 2011 because pr and lp are molecular compounds consisting of microorganism cellular structures the substantial amounts of pr and lp in fraction 2 indicate the influence of microorganism debris originating from aquatic organisms or even human activity meng et al 2008 moreover the highest proportion of lp demonstrated hydrophobic properties in the eem with an intense fluorescence peak in the humic acid like region gallo et al 2000 fraction 3 showed the highest influence of plants among the fractions mainly originating from the lg content based on phenolic compounds simoneit et al 1993 partitioning the oc from the lc ocd fractionation into fractions provides insight into the characteristics sources and fouling potential of dom chen et al 2016 huber et al 2011a liu et al 2010 as shown in fig 9 the fractionated dom has varying proportions of oc there is a high percentage of biopolymers in fraction 1 compared to the others in good agreement with the presence of large amounts of biopolymeric components e g polysaccharides and polyhydroxy aromatics analyzed in pyrolysis humic substances and building blocks have been considered humic substance like materials huber et al 2011b and their proportion indicates that fractions 1 and 2 primarily originated from humic substances and building blocks at 58 and 59 respectively in contrast fraction 3 showed a relatively low percentage of humic substance like materials 38 lmw neutrals were found a relatively high proportion in fraction 3 which is comprised of slightly ionized lmw aromatic materials huber et al 2011a this is consistent with the detected organic matter peaks in fig 7 and in accordance with the presence of humic and fulvic peaks in all fractions and an intense peak from aromatic protein like substances in fraction 3 further investigating humics and aromaticity we compared the aromaticity and molecularity of the fractions using a humic substance diagram hs diagram fig s2 in general all fractions had relatively low mean molecular weight below 550 g mol showing different aromaticity ranked in the order fraction 3 2 36 l mg m fraction 2 1 64 l mg m fraction 1 1 57 l mg m in addition the suva value followed the same order fraction 3 2 94 l mg cm fraction 2 2 32 l mg cm fraction 1 1 57 l mg cm these results imply that it is possible to provide characterized fouling origins for water resources based on dom fractionation 3 4 comparison declining flux according to each fraction membrane performance was studied by comparing the declining flux under a 3 mg c l feed concentration and 13 ms cm electroconductivity with respect to the concentration factor cf fig 10 each fraction showed different declining flux behavior ranked in the order fraction 2 fraction 1 fraction 3 fractions 1 and 3 showed similar declining flux behavior that reached 53 2 and 56 1 of the initial flux at cf 3 however fraction 2 showed the highest decline in flux compared to the others reaching 44 6 of the initial flux at cf 3 the result can be attributed to the hydrophobic interaction between lipids organic matters in fraction 2 from py gc ms results fig 8 showing a synergistic reaction between them dereli et al 2015 boyle gotla 2016 reported that the presence of both proteins and lipids accelerated fouling rates attributed to the formation of protein lipid complexes caused by their reactive hydrophobic properties in addition the effect of hydrophobic interactions between protein and lipids can result in aggregation through bilayer assembly between protein and lipid polar headgroup structures boggs et al 1981 de planque and killian 2003 the deposition of foulant on the membrane was confirmed through the variation in zeta potential in table 3 the virgin membrane shows a high negative zeta potential 21 0 mv the decrease in the negative zeta potential after filtration of each fraction indicates dom deposition on the membrane surface xu et al 2006 commonly the variation in zeta potential is proportional to the degree of membrane fouling however the zeta potential ranking was different than declining flux ranking in membrane performance this was due to dom characteristics on the membrane surface which had a high proportion of hydrophobic or hydrophilic dom components which could cause a negative decrease in zeta potential compared to neutral dom components cho et al 1998 this demonstrates that fractions 1 and 2 had substantial surface charge decreases due to the deposition of hydrophobic organic matter i e humic material yuan and zydney 2000 in addition relatively less variation in zeta potential was measured in fraction 3 due to the high content of lmw neutrals the removal of surface charge was illustrated by the reduction in ir peaks for the carboxyl groups indicating that the decrease in surface charge was caused by the coverage of negatively charged functional groups fig s3 4 conclusions we characterized the dom in brackish water to better understand organic fouling mechanisms this study proposed that the procedure to characterize dom in brackish water and fouling potential could be determined according to the characteristics the conclusion we obtained are summarized as follows nf and evaporation processes increased the dom concentration of brackish water while reducing the ion concentration which enhanced detection for more precise analysis and enabled dom separation using preparative hplc three fractionated dom were characterized via py gc ms revealed distinct differences in organic matter compositions for each fraction a high content of polysaccharides 25 6 was measured in fraction 1 meanwhile fraction 2 contained high level of lipids 71 8 and fraction 3 contained both lignins 38 8 and lipids 39 2 the oc distribution revealed similar oc compositions in fractions 1 and 2 with a high proportion of humic matter 58 and 59 respectively with the presence of biopolymeric oc 8 and 1 respectively however lmw neutral comprised 62 of fraction 3 without biopolymeric oc distinct dom characteristics resulted in different declining fluxes 53 2 for fraction 1 44 6 for fraction 2 and 56 4 for fraction 3 in membrane performance and different surface characteristics even with the same level of doc and operating conditions acknowledgements this work was supported by the korea agency for

19134,isolating dissolved organic matter dom is a preliminary step that improves the accuracy of its characterization in this study dom in brackish water was clearly separated and evaluated by multiple characterization analyses the sample was divided into three fractions by preparative high performance liquid chromatography preparative hplc according to molecular size the homogeneity of

introduction membrane filtration is used for desalination wastewater treatment and other industrial separation processes cho et al 1999 kim et al 2009 krauth and staab 1993 zularisam et al 2006 one common obstacle in these processes is membrane fouling due to the complex combination of various types of foulants i e organic matter ions colloids and microorganisms chang et al 2001 meng et al 2009 wang et al 2009 among the various foulant types dissolved organic matter dom in feed water causes severe problems during the filtration process fan et al 2001 tang et al 2010 because dom is closely related to both organic and bio fouling development amy 2008 fan et al 2001 gur reznik et al 2008 however it is hard to estimate its influence on membrane fouling due to the physicochemical heterogeneity of dom nebbioso and piccolo 2013 in practice although operated under the same dom concentrations and operating conditions membrane filtration shows different fouling growth tendencies according to the biodegradability of the organic matters present park et al 2017b 2018 understanding the influence of organic matter characteristics on fouling flux decline and membrane performance is an important area of research as such studies have identified the factors driving fouling and methods to mitigate adverse membrane impacts cho et al 2000 lee et al 2004 various analytical methods such as ultraviolet uv absorbance fluorescence spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography sec fourier transform infrared ftir liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms have been widely used to identify organic matter functionality molecular size distribution and origin conte et al 2007 huber et al 2011a kennedy et al 2005 leenheer et al 2004 however the inherent heterogeneity of dom presents a challenge when identifying specific dom features because heterogeneity results in lower analytical sensitivity and accuracy thus to evaluate the influences from target dom properties homogeneity must be obtained according to the analytical purpose several dom separating protocols have been reported to enhance dom homogeneity for surface water and wastewater chon et al 2017 ma et al 2001 maurice et al 2002 xad 8 4 resin solid phase extraction spe and preparative hplc are commonly used chon et al 2017 lombardi and jardim 1999 ma et al 2001 maurice et al 2002 parlanti et al 2002 rubinstein 1979 xad resin and spe methods are appropriate for isolating hydrophobic dom fractions but these methods require several pretreatment steps before sample loading croué 2004 lee et al 2004 preparative hplc fractionates dom in the order of molecular size and a large volume of dom fractions can be collected without pretreatment steps such as resin cleaning egeberg and alberts 2003 park et al 2017a peuravuori and pihlaja 2004 previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of preparative hplc for dom characterization and provided valuable insight into molecular weight dependent characteristics chon et al 2017 wu et al 2003 dom characterization in brackish water is difficult due to high salt and low organic matter concentrations some studies have characterized dom in high salt concentration solutions but most of these suggest characterizing dom in bulk solution jeong et al 2013 song et al 2012 tang et al 2016 this level of understanding is insufficient to ascertain the precise dom characteristics from saline water and thus its influence on membrane fouling in this study we used preparative hplc to obtain detailed characteristics of dom in brackish water the principle objective of this study was to characterize dom in brackish water to better understand its influence on membrane fouling we aimed to 1 reduce the relative salinity total mass of ions total mass of doc and increase organic matter concentration in brackish water through filtration and evaporation processes 2 accurately characterize dom in brackish water by increasing the dom homogeneity with the pretreatment developed in this study and 3 evaluate differences between the membrane fouling

equipped with a dionex ionpac cs12a for cation analysis for the analysis deionized di water and 6 mm methane sulfonic acid were used as mobile phases for anion and cation analysis 2 2 pretreatments for dom separation the experimental procedure is illustrated in fig 1 in panel 1 the two pretreatment steps were designed to isolate dom in brackish water by reducing salt and concentrating organic matter in panel 2 the fractionating step separated the dom into three fractions through preparative lc finally in panel 3 the dom was characterized via lc ocd and py gc ms to determine the fouling potential of each fraction with corresponding filtration performance because of low dom concentrations in brackish water it is necessary to concentrate samples however because salt concentration increases during the dom concentrating step salt removal from brackish water is necessary once salt is considered in concentration process it could encounter crystallization problem somewhere on the analysis process that results in severe analytic problem as a desalting method a nanofiltration nf membrane ne2540 90 toray chemical corp japan was used to remove ionic compounds and increase dom concentration nf membranes show relatively low ion rejection and high organic matter rejection performance cho et al 1999 the filtration system was operated in concentration mode by discarding the permeate simultaneously di water filled the feed tank continuously to reduce the salt concentration and prevent a decline in the permeate flux from the increased salt concentration finally the concentrated water was further concentrated using an evaporation process a rotary evaporator n 1200a eyela japan removed water from the desalted water under vacuum conditions at 38 c the final concentrated sample was filtered again using a 0 45 μm microfilter and stored at 4 c until further analysis 2 3 organic matter fractionation the concentrated sample was fractionated by preparative

et al 2003a rodríguez et al 2014 the fluorescence peaks were defined at the maximum intensity of the excitation emission wavelength pairs corresponding to the described groups to account for inherent rayleigh and raman scattering the fluorescence of a blank di water sample was subtracted from the fluorescence spectra obtained from the dom samples baker 2001 chen et al 2003b all feems in this

the homogeneity of each fraction was validated using the size distribution of organic matter and polydispersity ρ for the raw brackish water and three fractions raw brackish water 2 99 fraction 1 1 20 fraction 2 1 76 and fraction 3 1 69 as shown in fig 6 s1 and table 2 clearly separated chromatograms are visible with enhanced homogeneity demonstrating high homogeneity among the fractions from the concentrated brackish water in terms of organic matter size in addition to the molecular size distribution the eem analysis produced the organic matter compositions of the fractions shown in fig 7 the spectrum for fraction 1 contained a a broad marine humic acid like substance peak and a high intensity fulvic acid like substance peaks in comparison fraction 2 showed clearly separated b fulvic acid like substance peaks and c high intensity humic acid like substance peaks fraction 3 had a clear a marine humic acid like peak and b fulvic acid like peak indicating comparable fluorescence properties with fraction 1 although different molecular weights this assessment supports the hypothesis that dom fractionation could be performed using prep hplc resulting in high homogeneity and fractions with unique characteristics 3 3 characterizing the organic matter fractions of brackish water pyrolysis breaks organic matters down into small fragments that are detectable molecules by gc ms the fragments are identified as specific molecules matching with ms library based on the molecular weight from the analytical results py gc ms technique provides a qualitative organic matter characteristics in terms of molecular building blocks sillanpää 2014 the pyrolyzed organic matter compositions of the fractions are illustrated in fig 8 fraction 1 was comprised of various organic matter components 25 6 ps 23 8 pr 19 8 pha 15 3 lg and 15 5 lp fraction 2 contained 17 5 pr and 71 8 lp as the dominant organic contents with lesser amounts of other components 2 4 ps 0 4 pha and 7 9 lg fraction 3 was comprised of two large organic matter components lg and lp having 38 8 and 38 5 of the total respectively residuals for fraction 3 included other organics in lower proportions 4 0 ps 6 7 pr and 11 4 pha overall the ps and pr distribution follows the hplc retention time higher proportions are found for those eluting first the relatively high amount of ps in fraction 1 suggests that the organic matter originated from microbial products such as microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps chon et al 2017 kennedy et al 2005 which have the potential to cause membrane biofouling in the presence of microorganisms demneh et al 2011 because pr and lp are molecular compounds consisting of microorganism cellular structures the substantial amounts of pr and lp in fraction 2 indicate the influence of microorganism debris originating from aquatic organisms or even human activity meng et al 2008 moreover the highest proportion of lp demonstrated hydrophobic properties in the eem with an intense fluorescence peak in the humic acid like region gallo et al 2000 fraction 3 showed the highest influence of plants among the fractions mainly originating from the lg content based on phenolic compounds simoneit et al 1993 partitioning the oc from the lc ocd fractionation into fractions provides insight into the characteristics sources and fouling potential of dom chen et al 2016 huber et al 2011a liu et al 2010 as shown in fig 9 the fractionated dom has varying proportions of oc there is a high percentage of biopolymers in fraction 1 compared to the others in good agreement with the presence of large amounts of biopolymeric components e g polysaccharides and polyhydroxy aromatics analyzed in pyrolysis humic substances and building blocks have been considered humic substance like materials huber et al 2011b and their proportion indicates that fractions 1 and 2 primarily originated from humic substances and building blocks at 58 and 59 respectively in contrast fraction 3 showed a relatively low percentage of humic substance like materials 38 lmw neutrals were found a relatively high proportion in fraction 3 which is comprised of slightly ionized lmw aromatic materials huber et al 2011a this is consistent with the detected organic matter peaks in fig 7 and in accordance with the presence of humic and fulvic peaks in all fractions and an intense peak from aromatic protein like substances in fraction 3 further investigating humics and aromaticity we compared the aromaticity and molecularity of the fractions using a humic substance diagram hs diagram fig s2 in general all fractions had relatively low mean molecular weight below 550 g mol showing different aromaticity ranked in the order fraction 3 2 36 l mg m fraction 2 1 64 l mg m fraction 1 1 57 l mg m in addition the suva value followed the same order fraction 3 2 94 l mg cm fraction 2 2 32 l mg cm fraction 1 1 57 l mg cm these results imply that it is possible to provide characterized fouling origins for water resources based on dom fractionation 3 4 comparison declining flux according to each fraction membrane performance was studied by comparing the declining flux under a 3 mg c l feed concentration and 13 ms cm electroconductivity with respect to the concentration factor cf fig 10 each fraction showed different declining flux behavior ranked in the order fraction 2 fraction 1 fraction 3 fractions 1 and 3 showed similar declining flux behavior that reached 53 2 and 56 1 of the initial flux at cf 3 however fraction 2 showed the highest decline in flux compared to the others reaching 44 6 of the initial flux at cf 3 the result can be attributed to the hydrophobic interaction between lipids organic matters in fraction 2 from py gc ms results fig 8 showing a synergistic reaction between them dereli et al 2015 boyle gotla 2016 reported that the presence of both proteins and lipids accelerated fouling rates attributed to the formation of protein lipid complexes caused by their reactive hydrophobic properties in addition the effect of hydrophobic interactions between protein and lipids can result in aggregation through bilayer assembly between protein and lipid polar headgroup structures boggs et al 1981 de planque and killian 2003 the deposition of foulant on the membrane was confirmed through the variation in zeta potential in table 3 the virgin membrane shows a high negative zeta potential 21 0 mv the decrease in the negative zeta potential after filtration of each fraction indicates dom deposition on the membrane surface xu et al 2006 commonly the variation in zeta potential is proportional to the degree of membrane fouling however the zeta potential ranking was different than declining flux ranking in membrane performance this was due to dom characteristics on the membrane surface which had a high proportion of hydrophobic or hydrophilic dom components which could cause a negative decrease in zeta potential compared to neutral dom components cho et al 1998 this demonstrates that fractions 1 and 2 had substantial surface charge decreases due to the deposition of hydrophobic organic matter i e humic material yuan and zydney 2000 in addition relatively less variation in zeta potential was measured in fraction 3 due to the high content of lmw neutrals the removal of surface charge was illustrated by the reduction in ir peaks for the carboxyl groups indicating that the decrease in surface charge was caused by the coverage of negatively charged functional groups fig s3 4 conclusions we characterized the dom in brackish water to better understand organic fouling mechanisms this study proposed that the procedure to characterize dom in brackish water and fouling potential could be determined according to the characteristics the conclusion we obtained are summarized as follows nf and evaporation processes increased the dom concentration of brackish water while reducing the ion concentration which enhanced detection for more precise analysis and enabled dom separation using preparative hplc three fractionated dom were characterized via py gc ms revealed distinct differences in organic matter compositions for each fraction a high content of polysaccharides 25 6 was measured in fraction 1 meanwhile fraction 2 contained high level of lipids 71 8 and fraction 3 contained both lignins 38 8 and lipids 39 2 the oc distribution revealed similar oc compositions in fractions 1 and 2 with a high proportion of humic matter 58 and 59 respectively with the presence of biopolymeric oc 8 and 1 respectively however lmw neutral comprised 62 of fraction 3 without biopolymeric oc distinct dom characteristics resulted in different declining fluxes 53 2 for fraction 1 44 6 for fraction 2 and 56 4 for fraction 3 in membrane performance and different surface characteristics even with the same level of doc and operating conditions acknowledgements this work was supported by the korea agency for
