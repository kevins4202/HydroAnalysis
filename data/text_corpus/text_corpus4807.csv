24035,the amount and extent of coastal flooding caused by hurricanes can be sensitive to the timing or speed of the storm for storms moving parallel to the coast the hazards can be stretched over a larger area hurricane matthew was a powerful storm that impacted the southeastern u s during october 2016 moving mostly parallel to the coastline from florida through north carolina in this study three sources for atmospheric forcing are considered for a simulation of matthew s water levels which are validated against extensive observations and then the storm s effects are explored on this long coastline it is hypothesized that the spatial variability of matthew s effects on total water levels is partly due to the surge interacting nonlinearly with tides by changing the time of occurrence of the storm differences in storm surge are observed in different regions due to the storm coinciding with other periods in the tidal cycles these differences are found to be as large as 1 m and comparable to the tidal amplitude a change in forward speed of the storm also should alter its associated flooding due to differences in the duration over which the storm impacts the coastal waters with respect to the forward speed the present study contributes to established results by considering the scenario of a shore parallel hurricane a faster storm caused an increase in peak water levels along the coast but a decrease in the overall volume of inundation on the other hand a slower storm pushed more water into the estuaries and bays and flooded a larger section of the coast implications for short term forecasting and long term design studies for storms moving parallel to long coastlines are discussed herein keywords adcirc swan inundation hindcasting hsofs mesh owi wind fields 1 introduction matthew was a tropical cyclone that reached category 5 hurricane status on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale during 2016 matthew affected about 1900 km of coastline in the united states caused 34 direct deaths and forced evacuations by 3 million people stewart 2017 between 1900 utc 06 october when the storm was located offshore of miami florida and 0600 utc 09 october when it was located offshore of cape hatteras north carolina matthew remained close to the coast and moved along a shore parallel track fig 1 with a relatively slow forward speed of 5 to 7 m s observations indicate large variations in peak water levels all along the u s atlantic coast and we hypothesize that this was caused by the storm s slower forward speed and shore parallel track which allowed it to interact with different stages in the tidal cycle at different locations and over several days several studies have examined the interactions between tides and surge in the 1950s proudman developed theoretical solutions for the propagation of an externally forced tide and surge into an estuary of uniform section proudman 1955 1957 and also identified the tendency of peak surge to most often occur on high tides which was later confirmed prandle and wolf 1978 rossiter 1961 tides and surge can also interact nonlinearly thus causing the water levels to be even higher or lower than their individual contributions would suggest due to feedbacks through bottom friction shallow water effects and advection wolf 1978 nonlinear parameterization of bottom stress was found to the primary contributor to nonlinear tide surge interactions along the queensland coast of australia tang et al 1996 on the east coast of canada and northeastern united states bernier and thompson 2007 and along the fujian coast zhang et al 2010 along the southeast coast of the united states coriolis acceleration was found to be a significant contributing factor to these perturbations feng et al 2016 valle levinson et al 2013 the magnitude of these interactions can be large reaching as high as 70 of the tidal amplitudes rego and li 2010 along the louisiana texas coast during hurricane rita and 74 cm idier et al 2012 for storms in the english channel the tide surge nonlinearities were also large with a mean absolute value of 60 of the tide magnitude lin et al 2012 for synthetic surge events in new york harbor and at least 15 20 for idealized cyclone tracks and straight coastlines representing the west coast of india poulose et al 2017 it can be challenging to include these nonlinear interactions in surge predictions flood risk studies typically represent the hurricane climate by using the joint probability method jpm with synthetic storms to determine the flooding at various return periods the effect of tides can be a crucial factor in these studies for studies looking at smaller regions with small and in phase tidal amplitudes tides were introduced as a constant addition to the jpm integral error term niedoroda et al 2010 other studies included tides into the jpm analysis by randomly adding tidal heights to the surge response blanton et al 2012 ho and myers 1975 u s army corps of engineers 2018b however these additions do not incorporate the often large effect of the nonlinear interactions between the surge and tides the present study quantifies these interactions along the entire u s southeast coast during matthew including their variation from the continental shelf into the estuaries the representation of coastal floodplains is larger than in previous studies and can allow the flooding from the shore parallel storm to interact with multiple phases of the tides the effects of storm parameters like size landfall location wind speeds and direction of approach on surge have also been studied previously irish et al 2008 sebastian et al 2014 weisburg and zheng 2006 the effect of storm forward speed can vary the surge can be greater for a faster storm e g for a standard hurricane on a representative shelf jelesnianski 1972 along the louisiana texas shelf for hurricane rita increasing the forward speed of the storm caused higher surges but smaller total flooded volumes rego and li 2009 but the surge and inundation areas can also be greater for a slower storm e g for the estuaries of north carolina peng et al 2004 and for the dutch coast berg 2013 for the charleston harbor in south carolina although a slower storm can produce larger inundation areas whether or not it can produce larger surge depends on the faster storm s speed and the distance of the track from the harbor peng et al 2006 while these studies have identified the vulnerability of the coastline to hurricane storm surge under different scenarios they considered small regions or idealized coastlines and storms that moved perpendicular to the coastline the present study uses hurricane matthew s track along the coast from florida to north carolina to examine how the forward speed of a shore parallel storm affects the surge and inundation along a complex estuarine coastline and coastal floodplain this study uses the coupled adcirc swan model which has proven to be accurate in flood predictions in many coastal systems dietrich et al 2018 hope et al 2013 suh et al 2015 the model utilizes an unstructured finite element mesh developed for surge and tide predictions for the u s atlantic and gulf coasts riverside technology and aecom 2015 the unstructured mesh can represent a large domain while using sufficient resolution to represent the complex shoreline this combination allows for comprehensive validation and scenario testing the goals of this study are to better understand the influence of storm timing and forward speed on flooding for a shore parallel storm in a large domain the goals are addressed by a validating model predictions of winds and water levels during matthew on a mesh with floodplain coverage over a large extent b quantifying the contributions of nonlinear interactions to the total water levels and c quantifying the differences in flooding due to differences in the storm s forward speed and time relative to the tidal cycle 2 hurricane matthew 2 1 synoptic history matthew began as a tropical wave off the west coast of africa on 23 september 2016 stewart 2017 and by 1200 utc 28 september measurements indicated a tropical storm formation about 27 km west northwest of barbados moving into the caribbean sea matthew attained hurricane status on 1800 utc 29 september about 300 km northeast of curaçao matthew then turned west southwest and intensified to an estimated peak intensity of 75 m s category 5 on 0000 utc 1 october over the next few days the storm weakened to a category 4 status as it moved northward and made landfall with peak wind speeds of 66 m s over haiti 1100 utc 4 october and 59 m s over cuba 0000 utc 5 october by 1200 utc 6 october the storm brought hurricane force winds and flooding rains to most of the central and northwestern bahamas with a peak wind speed of 64 m s the category 4 hurricane made landfall near west end grand bahama island around 0000 utc 7 october stewart 2017 a broad eastward moving mid latitude trough located over the central united states then caused matthew to turn toward the north northwest stewart 2017 and impact much of the southeastern u s fig 1 the storm weakened to a category 3 hurricane around 0600 utc 7 october about 64 km east of vero beach florida and to a category 2 hurricane by 0000 utc 8 october about 92 km east northeast of jacksonville beach florida as the storm moved northward its wind field expanded causing hurricane force wind gusts across the coastal regions of southeastern georgia and southern south carolina the mid latitude trough then caused the storm to weaken to a category 1 status stewart 2017 moving nearly parallel to the coast of south carolina matthew made landfall around 1500 utc 8 october just south of mcclellanville south carolina the center of the hurricane then traveled offshore of the coast of south carolina and remained just offshore of the coast of north carolina through 9 october contributions from matthew s tropical moisture the ongoing extratropical transition and an increasing pressure gradient from an approaching cold front caused sustained hurricane force winds over the outer banks and significant sound side storm surge flooding during the early hours of 9 october matthew lost its tropical characteristics by 1200 utc 9 october as it moved away from the u s stewart 2017 2 2 extensive observations along u s east coast matthew s effects on surface pressures and wind speeds offshore and nearshore waves and coastal water levels are well described by observational data along the southeastern u s coast from florida through north carolina fig 1 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the u s geological survey usgs and other agencies collected information at hundreds of buoys permanent and rapidly deployed gauges and stations and real time sensors along the storm s path surface pressures were observed at 283 locations wind speeds and directions were observed at 66 locations and significant wave heights were observed at 16 locations table 1 time series observations at buoys and stations operated by the noaa national data buoy center ndbc and the noaa national ocean service nos show how the peak 10 minute averaged wind speeds evolved during the course of the storm wave parameters were also observed at many of these same locations these winds and waves caused setup and storm surge along the southeastern u s coastline nos and usgs permanent and rapidly deployed gauges collected observations time series of water levels at 501 locations and 612 high water marks hwms were identified within the model extent for the analyses herein observations were omitted that did not operate during the storm peak or that showed elevated water levels after the storm due to freshwater run off or wave run up thus leaving 289 time series and 464 hwms to describe storm surge table 1 these observations are used to validate our predictive models for winds and storm surge 3 methods predictions of waves and storm surge are sensitive to the atmospheric conditions used as forcing to the model simulations in this study we evaluate forcings from three sources a vortex model based on storm parameters like the track forward speed and isotach radii and two data assimilated products available after the storm then the most accurate atmospheric forcing is used for a detailed hindcast of matthew s effects on water levels throughout the southeastern u s via comparison with extensive observations this study uses the depth averaged barotropic version of adcirc because the strong surface stresses during storms causes the water column to be well mixed in shallow nearshore and coastal regions this hindcast is then used as the basis for studies of the nonlinear interactions between tides and surge and of the effects of storm timing and forward speed in this section details are provided about the three sources for surface pressure and wind fields that were evaluated for hindcasts of matthew as well as the input settings for the coupled adcirc swan model 3 1 surface pressure and wind fields hydrodynamic predictions are analyzed with three sources of atmospheric forcing a parameterized vortex model based on storm parameters from the national hurricane center nhc and two data assimilated products for all three sources the surface pressures and wind velocities are developed either by the parametric model or by interpolation from the data assimilated products at the computational points in the model domain adcirc accounts for canopy cover and applies a surface roughness reduction factor increases to full marine winds as overland regions are inundated kerr et al 2013 3 1 1 parametric vortex model it is common to use parametric vortex models to represent storm wind fields based on limited input information hu et al 2012 2015 xie et al 2006 these models assume a hyperbolic radial pressure field that depends on the ambient and cyclone central surface pressures the radius to maximum winds and the hurricane shape parameter holland 1980 schloemer 1954 several parametric vortex models have been used within adcirc to generate wind and pressure fields in forecasting applications dietrich et al 2013a mattocks and forbes 2008 mattocks et al 2006 the most complete is the generalized asymmetric holland model gahm which has been shown to be a better representation than earlier versions gao et al 2017 and to compare well with observation based analysis products and full physics numerical models cyriac et al 2018 dietrich et al 2018 in this study gahm is used with the nhc best track storm parameters for matthew stewart 2017 to generate surface pressures and wind speeds at every computational point in the adcirc domain unlike the two atmospheric forcings described below gahm is not data assimilated and only represents the vortex with no far field meteorological representation 3 1 2 data assimilated atmospheric products surface pressure and wind velocities from weatherflow inc wf were developed using the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 which can simulate weather processes at synoptic scales down to large eddy simulations at microscales during matthew 52 stations measured sustained wind speeds greater than 22 m s with 32 stations measuring gusts of at least 33 m s these observations were assimilated into fields of surface pressures and wind velocities these fields cover a period from 2000 utc 06 october 2016 until 2000 utc 09 october 2016 at 10 min intervals the fields cover from latitude 24 15 n to 38 67 n and from longitude 83 55 w to 72 02 w with square elements of 96 12 arc seconds approximately 3 km north south by 3 km east west the surface pressures and wind velocities are interpolated in space and time to the adcirc computational points within the wf domain fig 2 the second source for data assimilated products was oceanweather inc owi whose fields are based on observations from anemometers airborne and land based doppler radar airborne stepped frequency microwave radiometer buoys ships aircraft coastal stations and satellite measurements bunya et al 2010 for matthew the tropical pbl troppbl model cardone et al 1994 thompson and cardone 1996 was applied in the core during the entire storm with hand analysis overlay from 2100 utc 06 october 2016 until 1500 utc 09 october 2016 to better represent the interaction of the storm with the coast the resultant wind and pressure fields are then subject to manual kinematic analysis using the ioka system to add features that are not well resolved by the troppbl model as well as in situ satellite and aircraft data into the final fields these fields represent 30 min sustained wind velocities at a reference height of 10 m above the ground sea level with consideration to marine exposure lagrangian based interpolation is then used to produce fields at 15 min intervals for use as atmospheric forcing to hydrodynamic models the surface pressure and wind fields are represented with a lower resolution basin grid and a higher resolution region grid fig 2 the basin grid covers from latitude 5 n to 42 n and from longitude 99 w to 55 w with a spatial resolution of 0 25 whereas the higher resolution region field covers from latitude 15 n to 40 n and from longitude 82 w to 68 w with a spatial resolution of 0 05 both covering a period from 0000 utc 01 october 2016 until 0000 utc 11 october 2016 at 15 min intervals 3 2 coupled models for nearshore waves and circulation the storm induced waves and circulation during matthew must be predicted by models that can represent their interactions over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales including coastal flooding into overland regions we use the coupled swan adcirc models dietrich et al 2012 2011b which have been validated extensively for flooding during tropical cyclones bhaskaran et al 2013 dietrich et al 2018 hope et al 2013 suh et al 2015 the unstructured mesh version of swan uses a sweeping gauss seidel method to propagate efficiently the wave action density booij et al 1999 zijlema 2010 the action balance equation is used to incorporate source sink terms for nearshore wave physics such as triad nonlinear interactions bottom friction and depth limited breaking in addition to deep water physics of quadruplet nonlinear interactions and whitecapping the simulations in this study use swan version 41 01 with a time step of 600 s the spectral space is discretized using 36 directional bins with directional resolution of 10 and 40 frequency bins with a logarithmic resolution over the range 0 031 to 1 42 hz this logarithmic discretization of frequencies is based on the ratio of δf f 0 1 for the discrete interaction approximation of the quadruplet interactions hasselmann et al 1985 this spectral discretization and other physical and numerical settings are the same as used in previous hindcast studies by the authors dietrich et al 2011a 2013b to prevent excessive directional turning or frequency shifting at a single vertex due to steep gradients in bathymetry or ambient currents the spectral velocities in swan are limited using a cfl restriction dietrich et al 2013b with an upper limit of 0 25 adcirc uses the continuous galerkin finite element method to solve the shallow water equations on unstructured meshes dawson et al 2006 kolar et al 1994 luettich and westerink 2004 luettich et al 1992 westerink et al 2008 water levels are calculated using the generalized wave continuity equation gwce which is a combined and differentiated form of the continuity and momentum equations kinnmark 1986 whereas depth averaged current velocities are determined from the vertically integrated momentum equations for the simulations in this study adcirc version 52 30 13 is used in explicit mode with the lumped mass matrix form of the gwce tanaka et al 2011 the bottom drag is applied using a depth dependent quadratic friction law with a drag coefficient set by the manning s n value specified for every vertex luettich and westerink 2004 luettich et al 1992 these manning s n values are also used by swan to compute roughness lengths based on the updated adcirc water levels at each mesh vertex bretschneider et al 1986 dietrich et al 2011a madsen et al 1988 the minimum bathymetric height and friction surface velocity required for wetting are 0 10 m and 0 01 m s respectively the spatially constant horizontal eddy viscosity for the momentum equations was set to 50 m2s 1 and an adcirc time step of 1 s was used the wind drag coefficients on the water surface are calculated using the garratt formulation garratt 1977 westerink et al 2008 with an upper limit of c d 0 002 similar to previous studies dietrich et al 2012 2011a the advective transport terms were enabled to account for nonlinear interactions between surge and tides the unstructured mesh spectral wave model swan and the shallow water circulation model adcirc were integrated into a coupled swan adcirc model so they share the same computational cores and the same unstructured mesh dietrich et al 2012 2011b adcirc interpolates the wind velocities and computes water levels and velocities and then supplies them to swan which uses them in its computations for evolution of spectral action density at the end of each swan time step wave radiation stresses and their gradients are computed by swan and then passed on to adcirc which applies them as surface stresses in its momentum equations the coupling interval is taken to be the same as the swan time step of 10 min 3 3 unstructured mesh to describe the southeast u s coast this study uses the hurricane surge on demand forecasting system hsofs mesh which provides coverage of nearshore regions and coastal floodplains along the entire u s coast from texas through maine riverside technology and aecom 2015 the widespread coverage of the hsofs mesh is possible because its local mesh resolution is typically coarser than meshes for specific coastal regions the mesh has an average resolution of 500 m along the coast with some areas decreasing to a resolution of 150 m at most locations the mesh extends inland to a smoothed version of the 10 m topographic contour fig 3 it has a total of 1 813 443 vertices and 3 564 104 elements two primary data sources were used to provide bathymetry topography the usgs 1 9 arc second national elevation dataset ned digital elevation model dem u s geological survey 2018a supplied overland topography and the noaa east coast 2012 ec2012 tidal constituent database mesh szpilka et al 2016 supplied bathymetry the mesh has been validated for 10 major tropical and extra tropical storms covering a spectrum of landfalls across the u s coast including isabel katrina ike and sandy riverside technology and aecom 2015 the hsofs mesh is ideal for this study because its widespread coverage includes the nearshore regions and floodplains impacted by matthew along the southeast u s coast 3 4 adjustments for water level processes on longer time scales to represent baroclinic and longer term processes water levels were adjusted a priori to account for local sea level rise and intra annual mean sea surface variability these adjustments are provided as a spatially varying offset surface and are thus an improvement over the spatially constant adjustments used in previous studies e g bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2018 2011a they provide a correction to the mean water levels before the storm without the expense of running a three dimensional baroclinic model from the open ocean into the floodplains the ground elevations in the hsofs mesh are referenced to local mean sea level based on the national tidal data epoch from 1983 through 2001 and thus the sea level must be adjusted to conditions during matthew in 2016 sea level trends were computed at 29 noaa tidal stations extending from florida through maine using relationships provided by the noaa center for operational and oceanographic products and services co ops national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2018a for a 15 year period from 2001 to 2016 to account for local increases in mean sea level relative to the datum used by the hsofs mesh this increase ranges from 3 to 5 cm for much of florida through south carolina but increases to 7 to 8 cm in northeast north carolina and virginia fig 4 the water levels were also adjusted to account for steric effects due to thermal expansion of the ocean waters antonov et al 2005 levitus et al 2000 willis et al 2004 and baroclinic interactions with the gulf stream ezer et al 2013 using the regional long term sea level station data at the time of landfall bunya et al 2010 for matthew the steric adjustment resulted in a maximum water level increase of about 19 cm along the georgia coast but decreases to about 10 cm to the south in florida and to the north in north carolina and virginia fig 4 the total vertical reference level adjustment at each station was calculated as the sum of the local sea level rise and steric increase this increase was then applied as an offset surface which varies spatially along the coast and transitions offshore to zero this offset surface was provided to adcirc at the start of the simulation using a 1 day ramp and is implemented as a pseudo barometric pressure term in adcirc asher et al 2019 4 model validation hindcasts of matthew were simulated with swan adcirc and atmospheric forcing from the three sources gahm wf and owi to establish the ambient water level condition prior to the storm the tides were spun up in a 15 day simulation from 0000 utc 17 september to 0000 utc 02 october then the storm was simulated over a 9 day period from 0000 utc 02 october to 0000 utc 11 october 4 1 atmospheric forcings 4 1 1 evolution of surface pressures and wind speeds the observed and predicted surface pressures and wind speeds are compared at selected locations ranging from florida through north carolina fig 5 and throughout the storm s evolution figs 6 7 surface pressures are analyzed as pressure deficits where an ambient pressure of 1013 25 hpa is subtracted from observed and predicted pressures on 0800 utc 07 october when the storm was located offshore of melbourne florida fig 6 first row north northeasterly winds were observed at the ndbc station trdf1 at trident pier florida with a maximum wind speed of 22 9 m s and a pressure deficit of about 40 hpa fig 7 first row gahm over predicts the peak wind speeds by about 10 m s and under predicts the pressure deficit by 20 hpa on 2000 utc 07 october about 10 h later and 19 h before landfall when the storm was located 35 miles east of st augustine florida fig 6 second row the wind speeds decreased in all three fields close to the eye the winds interact with the coast with peak wind speeds of 25 to 30 m s for both gahm and owi and 20 m s for wf at this time the nos station mypfi located at the entrance of the st johns river florida received north northeasterly winds with a maximum wind speed of 22 7 m s and pressure deficit of about 28 hpa fig 7 second row as matthew moved northward it brought hurricane strength wind gusts to the coasts of southeastern georgia and southern south carolina on 0615 utc 08 october about 9 h before landfall the usgs station 311941081265201 near brunswick georgia recorded a maximum wind speed of 16 1 m s and a pressure deficit of about 29 hpa fig 7 third row with all the three atmospheric forcings having similar results when the storm reached offshore of charleston south carolina it had weakened to category 1 status on 1350 utc 08 october about 1 h before landfall the offshore ndbc buoy 41004 observed southwesterly winds with a maximum speed of 23 5 m s and a pressure deficit of 31 55 hpa fig 7 fourth row at the peak all three models gave similar results except for gahm under predicting the pressure deficit by about 20 hpa on 1500 utc 08 october the category 1 storm made landfall in mcclellanville south carolina fig 6 third row with observed wind speeds of 39 m s stewart 2017 near landfall there is a difference in the storm track with both gahm and owi predicting a slight inland trajectory for the storm compared to wf after landfall the storm moved offshore in an east northeastward direction by 0600 utc 09 october the storm was located 45 km offshore of cape hatteras north carolina fig 6 bottom row the eye of the storm is similar for gahm and owi with a large eye surrounded by a small 10 to 15 m s wind field although gahm has a much larger 25 to 30 m s field offshore at the ndbc buoy 41025 at diamond shoals wind speeds at this time were 18 m s which matches for wf and owi the eye for wf has become disorganized and extends into pamlico sound there are significant differences inside the sound with modeled winds in the ranges of 20 to 30 m s 5 to 15 m s and 10 to 20 m s for gahm wf and owi respectively the effects of matthew s wind field were observed even at the nos station 8652587 located north at the oregon inlet marina north carolina where a maximum wind speed of 20 56 m s and a pressure deficit of about 20 hpa was recorded on 1006 utc 9 october fig 7 last row the storm weakened to a tropical depression by 1200 utc 9 october when it was located 45 km southeast of cape hatteras overall for the surface pressures fig 7 left column gahm tends to under predict the pressure deficits during the storm by more than 10 hpa but the central pressure comes from the best track file and represents an input to the gahm which is then used to produce the surface barometric field thus these under predictions are almost entirely a result of errors in the central pressure coming from the best track file the data assimilated wf and owi products show a good match to the surface pressures at most locations with exceptions of wf before and after the storm due to its relatively shorter time period and owi at nos station bftn7 at beaufort north carolina where it under predicted the pressure deficit during the storm the peak wind speeds are also matched well between observations and predictions fig 7 right column the parametric gahm has zero wind speeds before and after the storm and it also tends to over predict the peaks at locations in florida trdf1 and into the carolinas 41024 bftn7 the data assimilated wf and owi products capture the large scale synoptic wind patterns as well as the storm winds 4 1 2 error statistics the agreement between observations and predictions is quantified table 2 through the use of the root mean squared error e rms e r m s 1 n i 1 n e i 2 and the mean normalized bias b mn b m n 1 n i 1 n e i 1 n i 1 n o i where n is the number of observations and e i is the difference between predicted and observed values the e rms is an indication of the magnitude of error and has an ideal value of zero the b mn indicates the model s magnitude of over prediction or under prediction normalized to the observed value and also has an ideal value of zero for surface pressures and wind speeds as well as for water levels in the upcoming sections these error statistics are calculated for a period ranging from 0000 utc 05 october to 0000 utc 11 october gahm has the largest e rms and magnitude of b mn thus showing the benefits of the data assimilated wf and owi products both gahm and wf under predict the surface pressure deficits with negative b mn values of 0 16 and 0 02 respectively whereas owi over predicts the surface pressure deficit with a positive b mn of 0 06 although the peak wind fields in gahm were the strongest fig 6 the negative b mn reflects gahm s lack of ambient winds before and after the storm wf and owi have positive b mn for wind speeds of 0 16 and 0 06 respectively thus indicating over prediction for both surface pressure deficits and wind speeds owi has smaller errors overall and thus it is the best match to the observations thus owi is a better representation of the atmospheric forcing during matthew it is a better match to the observed time series of surface pressures and wind speeds at locations throughout the region table 2 its fields also show the most realistic representation of the storm s evolution near landfall and afterward fig 6 in the following sections the authors will use owi as the best approximation of the true behavior of matthew as it moved offshore of the u s southeast coast although error statistics will be computed for water levels as forced with all three atmospheric sources only owi will be used in the analyses of spatial and temporal variability of storm surge and only owi will be used in the analyses of nonlinear interactions storm timing and forward speed 4 2 water levels 4 2 1 evolution of water levels as matthew tracked along the southeast coastline of the united states heavy winds and rainfall elevated water levels at several locations to historic levels although matthew brought northerly and north easterly hurricane peak winds of 20 to 25 m s along the florida coast from lake worth to port canaveral it resulted in very little storm tide with a maximum of 0 5 to 1 m fig 8 top left as the storm moved northward there was an increase in the water levels along the coastline on 1700 utc 07 october fig 8 top right winds blowing from the northeast pushed water against the coastline with peaks of 1 5 to 2 5 m the usgs sts stations flvol03143 and flstj03126 located between orlando beach and st augustine beach florida recorded peak water levels of 2 1 m and 2 56 m respectively fig 9 top row the winds decreased as the storm moved northward and weakened from category 3 to category 2 status the station nos 8720218 at mayport florida and located at the entrance of the st johns river received peak winds of 20 to 25 m s causing a maximum water level of 1 59 m the highest ever recorded at this site stewart 2017 fig 9 along the st johns river inundation occurred well inland from the coast fig 8 top right the nos 8720625 station at racy point observed a record peak of 1 58 m on 2236 utc 07 october stewart 2017 about 3 5 h after a maximum was observed at the river entrance north of the st johns river along the florida coast matthew caused storm tides of 2 to 2 3 m on 0200 utc 08 october fig 8 center left the storm now centered offshore of georgia caused shore parallel winds to drive water levels of 1 to 1 5 m into the relatively deep tidal inlets and sounds that separate the barrier islands stretching 160 km between the st mary s and savannah rivers stations along the rivers that extend from these sounds recorded even higher peaks the usgs perm 02226180 and usgs sts gacha17861 measured peak water levels of 1 87 m and 2 30 m respectively fig 9 third row on 0800 utc 08 october fig 8 center right approximately 7 h before landfall easterly and north easterly winds pushed water into the savannah river causing water levels larger than 2 5 m the maximum storm surge recorded by a tide gauge in the united states during matthew was at nos 8670870 fig 9 located at the entrance of the savannah river where peak surge occurred during high tide and caused maximum water levels of 2 59 m as matthew moved northward a combination of wind and storm surge caused extensive damage along the south carolina coastline the usgs sts sites on the islands south and east of beaufort county south carolina recorded peaks of 2 to 2 5 m the highest peak of all observations collected during matthew was at the usgs sts scbea14284 at bluffton southwest of beaufort where a maximum of 2 66 m was recorded as a category 1 storm matthew caused extensive flooding in charleston south carolina at the tidal gauge nos 8665530 fig 9 located at the cooper river entrance a peak surge occurred during a low tide resulting in a storm tide maximum of 1 87 m on 1500 utc 08 october at landfall fig 8 bottom left south easterly winds pushed water levels of 1 5 to 2 m against the coastline from bulls bay to myrtle beach the maximum water levels in north carolina varied significantly by location for the atlantic coastline south of oak island the maximum water levels were mostly in the range of 2 to 2 5 m this decreased to 1 5 to 2 m from oak island to masonboro inlet and 1 to 1 5 m for the coastline from wrightsville beach to cape hatteras on 0600 utc 09 october fig 8 bottom right northerly and northeasterly winds pushed water levels of 0 5 to 1 m toward the western pamlico sound the nos 8654467 gauge at the united states coast guard station on hatteras island received record water levels stewart 2017 with a peak of 1 85 m fig 9 bottom left on the rivers that drain into the sound the maximum water levels varied in the range of 0 5 to 1 m in the neuse river and 0 75 to 1 25 m in the pamlico and pungo rivers e g ncem blhn7 in fig 9 bottom right as the storm moved offshore the winds decreased along the coast and the water levels returned to normal tide levels at most locations 4 2 2 error statistics at most locations the swan adcirc predictions with owi atmospheric forcing show good agreement with the observations e g the 12 stations shown in fig 5 with time series in fig 9 one exception was nos 8654467 where the model underestimated the peak by more than 0 5 m there was an over prediction of the peak at some stations usgs sts flvol03143 nos 8720218 usgs perm02226180 and usgs sts gacha17861 but within 0 3 m otherwise the model was able to closely predict variations in both the tides and surge levels to quantify the model performance with regard to water level predictions error statistics were computed table 2 only at locations wetted by the model for 241 locations on the u s southeast coast the overall e rms was 0 28 m and the b mn was very close to zero the largest errors occurred on the gauges upstream of the savannah river where e rms of about 0 58 to 1 27 m and b mn of 0 83 to 1 56 were obtained large e rms of 0 41 to 0 94 m and b mn of 0 56 to 0 87 were also observed at stations on the sound side of the outer banks in north carolina these over predictions in the savannah river and under predictions in the north carolina sounds can likely be attributed to the relatively coarse representation of the channels and tidal inlets that lead to these locations comparing the overall statistics for water levels simulations with gahm had the highest e rms of 0 42 m and b mn of 0 32 while simulations with owi had the smallest e rms of 0 28 m and b mn of 0 04 simulations with gahm and wf had negative b mn and thus under predicted the water levels a total of 464 usgs observed hwms inside the model domain were found to be suitable for analysis when combined with the 289 hydrograph derived peak water levels a total of 753 locations were used to evaluate model performance during matthew along the u s southeast coast in fig 10 the points are color coded based on error predicted less observed expressed as percentage of the observed value warm colors indicate regions of over prediction by adcirc whereas cooler colors indicate regions of under prediction for the simulation forced by owi the errors in modeled peaks were within 10 at 322 52 of the 622 total stations wetted by adcirc and within 25 at 538 87 stations for the scatter plots the r 2 value was 0 78 and the slope of the best fit line was 0 96 table 2 the e rms were largest on the sound side of the outer banks in north carolina the model under predicted the peaks by more than 25 at most locations in this region in other regions the errors were lesser especially along the coast from florida to south carolina where the errors were usually less than 25 a negative value of b mn indicated an under prediction of the peaks overall by all the three models as seen for water levels the observation based owi and wf fields led to better error statistics than gahm for the predicted water levels the best correlation between modeled and observed peaks were given by owi with its better values of e rms b mn r 2 and best fit slope thus the swan adcirc simulation on the hsofs mesh with owi atmospheric forcing is the best prediction of the surface pressures wind speeds and water levels along matthew s track from florida through north carolina the water levels are a good match at both open coast and inland locations and the error statistics are comparable to other recent studies with swan adcirc on higher resolution meshes e g hope et al 2013 it is noted that the simulation was not tuned to achieve this performance the mesh and other input settings are similar to other studies including real time forecasting with adcirc using this well validated simulation we can now quantify the contributions of the nonlinear terms in adcirc and then investigate the effects of storm timing and forward speed on the peak water levels 5 surge interactions with tides storm timing and forward speed 5 1 nonlinear tide surge interaction the total storm tide should include contributions from both surge and tides however instead of a linear superposition there are physical processes that causes their interaction to be a nonlinear phenomenon bernier and thompson 2007 horsburgh and wilson 2007 poulose et al 2017 prandle and wolf 1978 tang et al 1996 wolf 1981 these processes are represented in the governing equations in adcirc as a momentum advection on the surge due to the presence of the tide b the nonlinear effects of bottom friction due to the quadratic parametrization c the coriolis acceleration feng et al 2016 valle levinson et al 2013 and d the shallow water effect idier et al 2012 prandle and wolf 1978 zhang et al 2010 which arises due to nonlinearities related to h h ζ terms in the mass and momentum equations the importance of these terms varies from case to case and is associated with water depth tidal ranges and storm strength at specific locations these nonlinear terms influence the distribution of energy between tide and surge and thus can be a crucial factor in the accurate prediction of total water levels during a hurricane the goal of the present study is not to re investigate the possible causes of these nonlinear interactions but rather to quantify their behavior during a shore parallel storm affecting a long coastline in contrast to earlier studies in this region feng et al 2016 valle levinson et al 2013 which used a typical resolution between 1 and 5 km along the coastline this study includes sufficient resolution to represent the behavior of the interactions into the estuaries and coastal water bodies to separate the nonlinear interaction term from the storm tide the nonlinear term can be computed as η i η t w η w η t where each η represents water levels from a simulation with some combination of winds w and or tides t bernier and thompson 2007 rego and li 2010 zhang et al 2010 therefore the offset surface was disabled only for this subsection to exclude the effects of relative sea level rise and steric effects on the nonlinear interaction between tide and surge it is noted that because we are using the depth averaged barotropic version of adcirc this study may not represent all of the dynamics on the deeper shelf however it is a reasonable assumption that the storm s effects were distributed well into the water column and the computational efficiency of the depth averaged version allows for additional resolution to explore the interactions into the estuaries and coastal regions during matthew it was seen that the nonlinear interactions were large especially in regions with broader shelf areas fig 11 in the estuaries along the south atlantic bight the peak magnitudes of the nonlinear interactions were larger than 1 m farther offshore from the estuaries the maximum values decreased to about 0 1 to 0 4 m along the coastline and to zero in the open ocean the tide surge interaction significantly affected the total water levels only when they were large enough to interact our results show that with respect to local mean sea level lmsl the nonlinearities are destructive η i 0 to the storm tide heights during a rising or high tide and constructive η i 0 during a low or falling tide these results are similar to previous studies lin et al 2012 rego and li 2010 at locations along blackbeard creek to the south of savannah georgia fig 12 the interaction terms were small with a maximum of 0 27 m at station 1 located offshore moving inland the magnitudes increased to a maximum of 0 48 m at station 2 near the coast and 1 04 m at station 3 in the estuary at station 3 the nonlinear terms were as large as the tidal amplitudes these values are large enough to be of practical importance during storm surge forecasting there is also a phase shift in the peak of the nonlinear terms as compared to that to the surge as has been recognized previously horsburgh and wilson 2007 at station 3 this phase shift was 5 h thus the tide surge nonlinear interactions during matthew occurred on the shallow and wider shelf regions of the domain and varied in sign based on the tidal cycles although similar trends have been seen in the literature this is the first study to represent the interactions into the estuaries and floodplains over a long coastline for a shore parallel storm and with representation of these features at appropriate resolution the magnitudes of these nonlinear terms were largest in the estuaries along the southeastern u s coast and are larger than in any of the previous studies the nonlinear tide surge interactions can have a significant effect in controlling the total water levels during a hurricane 5 2 storm timing the total water levels caused by matthew as it moved along the u s coastline were affected by both variations in tidal amplitudes and by its coincidence with different parts of the tidal cycle at different locations to understand how matthew s time of occurrence would have influenced the total water levels along the coast scenarios were simulated to alter the storm s timing relative to the tidal cycle for the u s southeast coast the dominant tidal constituent is the principal lunar semi diurnal m 2 tidal constituent thus simulations were conducted by delaying the storm by 3 11 h 6 21 h 9 32 h and 12 42 h corresponding to one fourth half three fourth and full m 2 tidal periods respectively the storm forward speed was unchanged during these simulations these scenarios resulted in water levels that varied from that during the storm with the greatest changes occurring during the 6 21 h simulation and least changes happening during the 12 42 h simulation these variations are shown in fig 13 where warm colors indicate an increase in water level and cool colors indicate a decrease in water levels in regions like the pamlico sound where tides are small there were no variations in the scenarios in regions along the coastline where tides are dominant the changes were larger and extended into the estuaries along the south atlantic bight these plots indicate how the inundation along the u s southeast coastline would have varied if matthew occurred at a different time to understand the changes in flooding at specific locations along the coastline the maximum water levels during matthew and the two scenarios above were plotted along the u s atlantic coast fig 14 near trident pier florida where the surge occurred during a falling stage in the tidal cycle during matthew all scenarios caused increased flooding especially the 6 21 h simulation which produced an increase of about 0 7 m near fort pulaski georgia where maximum inundation was observed during matthew the surge coincided with a lower high tide if the storm had been delayed by 12 42 h then the surge peak would have coincided with a higher high tide thus further increasing the peak by about 0 20 m near wrightsville beach north carolina where the surge occurred during a rising stage of the tide cycle the peak would have increased by about 0 20 m if the surge had occurred 3 11 h later thus for a shore parallel storm like matthew that interacted with tides over a large extent of the coastline timing can significantly influence the flooding at locations along the coast 5 3 forward speed the impact of a hurricane s forward speed on coastal flooding has been recognized previously berg 2013 jelesnianski 1972 peng et al 2004 2006 rego and li 2009 and has been shown to have significant effects on peak surge heights and inundation volumes for a given wind speed slower storms are generally considered to be more dangerous as they have considerably more time to impact the coastal waters and thus cause more flooding matthew had a forward speed of about 5 m s as it passed north carolina in three scenario simulations the forward speeds were 50 slower 50 faster and 100 faster which represent storm speeds of about 2 5 m s 7 5 m s and 10 m s respectively in north carolina these speeds are representative of the historical record blanton and vickery 2008 tides were disabled in these simulations in order to quantify the sole effect of forward speed on surge along this coastline the differences in maximum water levels between these scenarios and the base matthew simulation fig 15 demonstrate how the flooding is affected by the forward speed of the storm the 50 slower simulation had a decrease in flooding along the open coast however with more time to push water into inland areas the slower storm caused an increase in flooding in the rivers 0 2 to 0 4 m in the st johns river florida and alligator river north carolina and sounds 0 1 to 0 4 m in pamlico sound along the coast the surge was also higher and pushed further inland in the estuaries and floodplains along the south atlantic bight near savannah georgia the water levels increased by about 0 9 m as the speed of the storm was increased the trends in water levels were seen to reverse water levels were increased on the open coast but water levels were decreased in the bays and estuaries the coastline between daytona beach and st augustine florida had increased flooding of about 0 5 m along the coastline of southeast north carolina the water levels were also increased by 0 5 m the increase in water levels along the south atlantic bight coastline was lesser and this may be due to the extensive lowlands in the region that absorb more surge reduced flooding was observed in the estuaries along the bight near savannah georgia this decrease was as much as 0 7 m these trends can be further quantified by examining the maximum water levels along the open coastline fig 14 the faster simulations produced larger water levels along the coastline as compared to the base matthew simulation and the 50 slower scenario about 260 km of coastline had water levels of 2 m or higher during matthew the 50 slower scenario caused a 6 decrease in this distance whereas the 50 faster and 100 faster scenarios caused increases of 57 and 120 respectively thus the faster storms would have pushed water levels of 2 m or higher against a longer stretch of coastline but the inundation areas followed the opposite trends considering only the land regions that became wetted during the storm matthew had a total inundation volume of 5 5 km3 for the 50 slower scenario this volume was increased by 17 while for the 50 and 100 faster scenarios the volumes were decreased by about 6 and 16 respectively the faster storms increased the hazard at the open coast while the slower storms pushed more flooding into overland regions thus although slower storms can produce more widespread flooding faster storms can be dangerous as well producing higher surges especially at the coast proudman 1953 showed that the largest storm surges occur when speed of the storm is close to the propagation speed of the long wave g h for the 100 faster scenario the storm forward speeds near the u s southeast coast were about 10 to 14 m s which corresponds to a long wave for depths of 10 to 20 m these isobaths vary in distances offshore along the u s southeast coast but are within the region where the increased peaks were observed although the storm eye moved from south to north along the u s atlantic coast its anticlockwise winds caused the dominant direction of water velocities to be from north to south with the coastline on its right side thus it is plausible that a faster storm would energize a shelf wave increasing the forward speed of the storm caused an increase in peak water levels along the coastline but a decrease in overall volume of inundation regarding peak water levels these results agree with jelesnianski 1972 and rego and li 2009 whereas they contradict peng et al 2004 and berg 2013 a slower storm causes lesser flooding on the open coast but pushes more water into the estuaries and bays it also results in a larger total volume of inundation peng et al 2004 2006 rego and li 2009 however none of these studies looked at shore parallel storm effects on a large extent of complex shoreline although matthew had varying effects along the southeast u s coastline from florida through north carolina the maximum water levels and overland flooding would have changed as expected if the storm s forward speed had been faster 6 conclusions matthew caused devastating floods strong winds and moderate storm surge along the southeast coast of the united states and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane along the central south carolina coast during early october 2016 from east central florida to north carolina the storm moved slowly along a shore parallel track and causing widespread impacts that lasted for several days the swan adcirc modeling system was used to perform high resolution modeling of water levels during the storm and predictions were validated using the extensive network of observations throughout the region scenarios then quantified the effects of storm timing and forward speed on the surge and inundation our findings can be summarized as follows 1 observation based wind fields like wf and owi provide better meteorological forcing for hindcasting as compared to parametric models like gahm this is evident from their lower values of e rms and b mn for both surface pressure deficits and wind speeds owi had the lowest error metrics thus making it the most accurate wind and pressure fields during matthew 2 swan adcirc represents well the effects of matthew along the u s atlantic coast even when applied on the relatively coarse hsofs mesh the model results using owi forcing showed good agreement to observations for water levels and hwms water level comparisons at 241 locations on the u s southeast coast resulted in an overall e rms of less than 30 cm and a b mn very close to zero there was also good correlation between modeled and measured peak water levels for a total of 622 hwms the r 2 value was 0 78 and the slope of the best fit line was 0 96 these values are comparable to results from studies using meshes with much higher resolution 3 the nonlinear interactions between tides and surge on the southeast u s atlantic coast during matthew had a constructive effect on the total water levels during a low or falling tide and a destructive effect during a high or rising tide this study is the first to consider these interactions for a long coastline during a shore parallel storm the magnitudes of these interactions varied at different regions with respect to the coast with small values on the ocean side and large values on the estuary side in the estuaries these interactions were larger than 1 m larger than in previous studies 4 altering the timing of the storm caused locations along the coast to have increased or decreased water levels depending on how the storm coincided with various stages in the tidal cycle this is especially true for shore parallel storms that travel along a large extent of the coastline over several tidal cycles 5 the storm s forward speed also had large effects on water levels this study is the first to consider these interactions for a long coastline during a shore parallel storm slower storms with more time to impact the coastal waters cause more flooding in the bays and estuaries and lesser values on the open coast faster storms moving quickly across the coastline cause high surges on the open coast especially along straight coastlines and lower surges in the bays and estuaries although this study is specific to hurricane matthew it demonstrates the importance of considering the nonlinear tide surge interactions in flood risk studies it also shows that storm timing and forward speed can be two crucial factors that can significantly alter the surge during a hurricane acknowledgments this work was supported by the nsf grant enh 1635784 this material is also based

24035,the amount and extent of coastal flooding caused by hurricanes can be sensitive to the timing or speed of the storm for storms moving parallel to the coast the hazards can be stretched over a larger area hurricane matthew was a powerful storm that impacted the southeastern u s during october 2016 moving mostly parallel to the coastline from florida through north carolina in this study three sources for atmospheric forcing are considered for a simulation of matthew s water levels which are validated against extensive observations and then the storm s effects are explored on this long coastline it is hypothesized that the spatial variability of matthew s effects on total water levels is partly due to the surge interacting nonlinearly with tides by changing the time of occurrence of the storm differences in storm surge are observed in different regions due to the storm coinciding with other periods in the tidal cycles these differences are found to be as large as 1 m and comparable to the tidal amplitude a change in forward speed of the storm also should alter its associated flooding due to differences in the duration over which the storm impacts the coastal waters with respect to the forward speed the present study contributes to established results by considering the scenario of a shore parallel hurricane a faster storm caused an increase in peak water levels along the coast but a decrease in the overall volume of inundation on the other hand a slower storm pushed more water into the estuaries and bays and flooded a larger section of the coast implications for short term forecasting and long term design studies for storms moving parallel to long coastlines are discussed herein keywords adcirc swan inundation hindcasting hsofs mesh owi wind fields 1 introduction matthew was a tropical cyclone that reached category 5 hurricane status on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale during 2016 matthew affected about 1900 km of coastline in the united states caused 34 direct deaths and forced evacuations by 3 million people stewart 2017 between 1900 utc 06 october when the storm was located offshore of miami florida and 0600 utc 09 october when it was located offshore of cape hatteras north carolina matthew remained close to the coast and moved along a shore parallel track fig 1 with a relatively slow forward speed of 5 to 7 m s observations indicate large variations in peak water levels all along the u s atlantic coast and we hypothesize that this was caused by the storm s slower forward speed and shore parallel track which allowed it to interact with different stages in the tidal cycle at different locations and over several days several studies have examined the interactions between tides and surge in the 1950s proudman developed theoretical solutions for the propagation of an externally forced tide and surge into an estuary of uniform section proudman 1955 1957 and also identified the tendency of peak surge to most often occur on high tides which was later confirmed prandle and wolf 1978 rossiter 1961 tides and surge can also interact nonlinearly thus causing the water levels to be even higher or lower than their individual contributions would suggest due to feedbacks through bottom friction shallow water effects and advection wolf 1978 nonlinear parameterization of bottom stress was found to the primary contributor to nonlinear tide surge interactions along the queensland coast of australia tang et al 1996 on the east coast of canada and northeastern united states bernier and thompson 2007 and along the fujian coast zhang et al 2010 along the southeast coast of the united states coriolis acceleration was found to be a significant contributing factor to these perturbations feng et al 2016 valle levinson et al 2013 the magnitude of these interactions can be large reaching as high as 70 of the tidal amplitudes rego and li 2010 along the louisiana texas coast during hurricane rita and 74 cm idier et al 2012 for storms in the english channel the tide surge nonlinearities were also large with a mean absolute value of 60 of the tide magnitude lin et al 2012 for synthetic surge events in new york harbor and at least 15 20 for idealized cyclone tracks and straight coastlines representing the west coast of india poulose et al 2017 it can be challenging to include these nonlinear interactions in surge predictions flood risk studies typically represent the hurricane climate by using the joint probability method jpm with synthetic storms to determine the flooding at various return periods the effect of tides can be a crucial factor in these studies for studies looking at smaller regions with small and in phase tidal amplitudes tides were introduced as a constant addition to the jpm integral error term niedoroda et al 2010 other studies included tides into the jpm analysis by randomly adding tidal heights to the surge response blanton et al 2012 ho and myers 1975 u s army corps of engineers 2018b however these additions do not incorporate the often large effect of the nonlinear interactions between the surge and tides the present study quantifies these interactions along the entire u s southeast coast during matthew including their variation from the continental shelf into the estuaries the representation of coastal floodplains is larger than in previous studies and can allow the flooding from the shore parallel storm to interact with multiple phases of the tides the effects of storm parameters like size landfall location wind speeds and direction of approach on surge have also been studied previously irish et al 2008 sebastian et al 2014 weisburg and zheng 2006 the effect of storm forward speed can vary the surge can be greater for a faster storm e g for a standard hurricane on a representative shelf jelesnianski 1972 along the louisiana texas shelf for hurricane rita increasing the forward speed of the storm caused higher surges but smaller total flooded volumes rego and li 2009 but the surge and inundation areas can also be greater for a slower storm e g for the estuaries of north carolina peng et al 2004 and for the dutch coast berg 2013 for the charleston harbor in south carolina although a slower storm can produce larger inundation areas whether or not it can produce larger surge depends on the faster storm s speed and the distance of the track from the harbor peng et al 2006 while these studies have identified the vulnerability of the coastline to hurricane storm surge under different scenarios they considered small regions or idealized coastlines and storms that moved perpendicular to the coastline the present study uses hurricane matthew s track along the coast from florida to north carolina to examine how the forward speed of a shore parallel storm affects the surge and inundation along a complex estuarine coastline and coastal floodplain this study uses the coupled adcirc swan model which has proven to be accurate in flood predictions in many coastal systems dietrich et al 2018 hope et al 2013 suh et al 2015 the model utilizes an unstructured finite element mesh developed for surge and tide predictions for the u s atlantic and gulf coasts riverside technology and aecom 2015 the unstructured mesh can represent a large domain while using sufficient resolution to represent the complex shoreline this combination allows for comprehensive validation and scenario testing the goals of this study are to better understand the influence of storm timing and forward speed on flooding for a shore parallel storm in a large domain the goals are addressed by a validating model predictions of winds and water levels during matthew on a mesh with floodplain coverage over a large extent b quantifying the contributions of nonlinear interactions to the total water levels and c quantifying the differences in flooding due to differences in the storm s forward speed and time relative to the tidal cycle 2 hurricane matthew 2 1 synoptic history matthew began as a tropical wave off the west coast of africa on 23 september 2016 stewart 2017 and by 1200 utc 28 september measurements indicated a tropical storm formation about 27 km west northwest of barbados moving into the caribbean sea matthew attained hurricane status on 1800 utc 29 september about 300 km northeast of curaçao matthew then turned west southwest and intensified to an estimated peak intensity of 75 m s category 5 on 0000 utc 1 october over the next few days the storm weakened to a category 4 status as it moved northward and made landfall with peak wind speeds of 66 m s over haiti 1100 utc 4 october and 59 m s over cuba 0000 utc 5 october by 1200 utc 6 october the storm brought hurricane force winds and flooding rains to most of the central and northwestern bahamas with a peak wind speed of 64 m s the category 4 hurricane made landfall near west end grand bahama island around 0000 utc 7 october stewart 2017 a broad eastward moving mid latitude trough located over the central united states then caused matthew to turn toward the north northwest stewart 2017 and impact much of the southeastern u s fig 1 the storm weakened to a category 3 hurricane around 0600 utc 7 october about 64 km east of vero beach florida and to a category 2 hurricane by 0000 utc 8 october about 92 km east northeast of jacksonville beach florida as the storm moved northward its wind field expanded causing hurricane force wind gusts across the coastal regions of southeastern georgia and southern south carolina the mid latitude trough then caused the storm to weaken to a category 1 status stewart 2017 moving nearly parallel to the coast of south carolina matthew made landfall around 1500 utc 8 october just south of mcclellanville south carolina the center of the hurricane then traveled offshore of the coast of south carolina and remained just offshore of the coast of north carolina through 9 october contributions from matthew s tropical moisture the ongoing extratropical transition and an increasing pressure gradient from an approaching cold front caused sustained hurricane force winds over the outer banks and significant sound side storm surge flooding during the early hours of 9 october matthew lost its tropical characteristics by 1200 utc 9 october as it moved away from the u s stewart 2017 2 2 extensive observations along u s east coast matthew s effects on surface pressures and wind speeds offshore and nearshore waves and coastal water levels are well described by observational data along the southeastern u s coast from florida through north carolina fig 1 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the u s geological survey usgs and other agencies collected information at hundreds of buoys permanent and rapidly deployed gauges and stations and real time sensors along the storm s path surface pressures were observed at 283 locations wind speeds and directions were observed at 66 locations and significant wave heights were observed at 16 locations table 1 time series observations at buoys and stations operated by the noaa national data buoy center ndbc and the noaa national ocean service nos show how the peak 10 minute averaged wind speeds evolved during the course of the storm wave parameters were also observed at many of these same locations these winds and waves caused setup and storm surge along the southeastern u s coastline nos and usgs permanent and rapidly deployed gauges collected observations time series of water levels at 501 locations and 612 high water marks hwms were identified within the model extent for the analyses herein observations were omitted that did not operate during the storm peak or that showed elevated water levels after the storm due to freshwater run off or wave run up thus leaving 289 time series and 464 hwms to describe storm surge table 1 these observations are used to validate our predictive models for winds and storm surge 3 methods predictions of waves and storm surge are sensitive to the atmospheric conditions used as forcing to the model simulations in this study we evaluate forcings from three sources a vortex model based on storm parameters like the track forward speed and isotach radii and two data assimilated products available after the storm then the most accurate atmospheric forcing is used for a detailed hindcast of matthew s effects on water levels throughout the southeastern u s via comparison with extensive observations this study uses the depth averaged barotropic version of adcirc because the strong surface stresses during storms causes the water column to be well mixed in shallow nearshore and coastal regions this hindcast is then used as the basis for studies of the nonlinear interactions between tides and surge and of the effects of storm timing and forward speed in this section details are provided about the three sources for surface pressure and wind fields that were evaluated for hindcasts of matthew as well as the input settings for the coupled adcirc swan model 3 1 surface pressure and wind fields hydrodynamic predictions are analyzed with three sources of atmospheric forcing a parameterized vortex model based on storm parameters from the national hurricane center nhc and two data assimilated products for all three sources the surface pressures and wind velocities are developed either by the parametric model or by interpolation from the data assimilated products at the computational points in the model domain adcirc accounts for canopy cover and applies a surface roughness reduction factor increases to full marine winds as overland regions are inundated kerr et al 2013 3 1 1 parametric vortex model it is common to use parametric vortex models to represent storm wind fields based on limited input information hu et al 2012 2015 xie et al 2006 these models assume a hyperbolic radial pressure field that depends on the ambient and cyclone central surface pressures the radius to maximum winds and the hurricane shape parameter holland 1980 schloemer 1954 several parametric vortex models have been used within adcirc to generate wind and pressure fields in forecasting applications dietrich et al 2013a mattocks and forbes 2008 mattocks et al 2006 the most complete is the generalized asymmetric holland model gahm which has been shown to be a better representation than earlier versions gao et al 2017 and to compare well with observation based analysis products and full physics numerical models cyriac et al 2018 dietrich et al 2018 in this study gahm is used with the nhc best track storm parameters for matthew stewart 2017 to generate surface pressures and wind speeds at every computational point in the adcirc domain unlike the two atmospheric forcings described below gahm is not data assimilated and only represents the vortex with no far field meteorological representation 3 1 2 data assimilated atmospheric products surface pressure and wind velocities from weatherflow inc wf were developed using the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 which can simulate weather processes at synoptic scales down to large eddy simulations at microscales during matthew 52 stations measured sustained wind speeds greater than 22 m s with 32 stations measuring gusts of at least 33 m s these observations were assimilated into fields of surface pressures and wind velocities these fields cover a period from 2000 utc 06 october 2016 until 2000 utc 09 october 2016 at 10 min intervals the fields cover from latitude 24 15 n to 38 67 n and from longitude 83 55 w to 72 02 w with square elements of 96 12 arc seconds approximately 3 km north south by 3 km east west the surface pressures and wind velocities are interpolated in space and time to the adcirc computational points within the wf domain fig 2 the second source for data assimilated products was oceanweather inc owi whose fields are based on observations from anemometers airborne and land based doppler radar airborne stepped frequency microwave radiometer buoys ships aircraft coastal stations and satellite measurements bunya et al 2010 for matthew the tropical pbl troppbl model cardone et al 1994 thompson and cardone 1996 was applied in the core during the entire storm with hand analysis overlay from 2100 utc 06 october 2016 until 1500 utc 09 october 2016 to better represent the interaction of the storm with the coast the resultant wind and pressure fields are then subject to manual kinematic analysis using the ioka system to add features that are not well resolved by the troppbl model as well as in situ satellite and aircraft data into the final fields these fields represent 30 min sustained wind velocities at a reference height of 10 m above the ground sea level with consideration to marine exposure lagrangian based interpolation is then used to produce fields at 15 min intervals for use as atmospheric forcing to hydrodynamic models the surface pressure and wind fields are represented with a lower resolution basin grid and a higher resolution region grid fig 2 the basin grid covers from latitude 5 n to 42 n and from longitude 99 w to 55 w with a spatial resolution of 0 25 whereas the higher resolution region field covers from latitude 15 n to 40 n and from longitude 82 w to 68 w with a spatial resolution of 0 05 both covering a period from 0000 utc 01 october 2016 until 0000 utc 11 october 2016 at 15 min intervals 3 2 coupled models for nearshore waves and circulation the storm induced waves and circulation during matthew must be predicted by models that can represent their interactions over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales including coastal flooding into overland regions we use the coupled swan adcirc models dietrich et al 2012 2011b which have been validated extensively for flooding during tropical cyclones bhaskaran et al 2013 dietrich et al 2018 hope et al 2013 suh et al 2015 the unstructured mesh version of swan uses a sweeping gauss seidel method to propagate efficiently the wave action density booij et al 1999 zijlema 2010 the action balance equation is used to incorporate source sink terms for nearshore wave physics such as triad nonlinear interactions bottom friction and depth limited breaking in addition to deep water physics of quadruplet nonlinear interactions and whitecapping the simulations in this study use swan version 41 01 with a time step of 600 s the spectral space is discretized using 36 directional bins with directional resolution of 10 and 40 frequency bins with a logarithmic resolution over the range 0 031 to 1 42 hz this logarithmic discretization of frequencies is based on the ratio of δf f 0 1 for the discrete interaction approximation of the quadruplet interactions hasselmann et al 1985 this spectral discretization and other physical and numerical settings are the same as used in previous hindcast studies by the authors dietrich et al 2011a 2013b to prevent excessive directional turning or frequency shifting at a single vertex due to steep gradients in bathymetry or ambient currents the spectral velocities in swan are limited using a cfl restriction dietrich et al 2013b with an upper limit of 0 25 adcirc uses the continuous galerkin finite element method to solve the shallow water equations on unstructured meshes dawson et al 2006 kolar et al 1994 luettich and westerink 2004 luettich et al 1992 westerink et al 2008 water levels are calculated using the generalized wave continuity equation gwce which is a combined and differentiated form of the continuity and momentum equations kinnmark 1986 whereas depth averaged current velocities are determined from the vertically integrated momentum equations for the simulations in this study adcirc version 52 30 13 is used in explicit mode with the lumped mass matrix form of the gwce tanaka et al 2011 the bottom drag is applied using a depth dependent quadratic friction law with a drag coefficient set by the manning s n value specified for every vertex luettich and westerink 2004 luettich et al 1992 these manning s n values are also used by swan to compute roughness lengths based on the updated adcirc water levels at each mesh vertex bretschneider et al 1986 dietrich et al 2011a madsen et al 1988 the minimum bathymetric height and friction surface velocity required for wetting are 0 10 m and 0 01 m s respectively the spatially constant horizontal eddy viscosity for the momentum equations was set to 50 m2s 1 and an adcirc time step of 1 s was used the wind drag coefficients on the water surface are calculated using the garratt formulation garratt 1977 westerink et al 2008 with an upper limit of c d 0 002 similar to previous studies dietrich et al 2012 2011a the advective transport terms were enabled to account for nonlinear interactions between surge and tides the unstructured mesh spectral wave model swan and the shallow water circulation model adcirc were integrated into a coupled swan adcirc model so they share the same computational cores and the same unstructured mesh dietrich et al 2012 2011b adcirc interpolates the wind velocities and computes water levels and velocities and then supplies them to swan which uses them in its computations for evolution of spectral action density at the end of each swan time step wave radiation stresses and their gradients are computed by swan and then passed on to adcirc which applies them as surface stresses in its momentum equations the coupling interval is taken to be the same as the swan time step of 10 min 3 3 unstructured mesh to describe the southeast u s coast this study uses the hurricane surge on demand forecasting system hsofs mesh which provides coverage of nearshore regions and coastal floodplains along the entire u s coast from texas through maine riverside technology and aecom 2015 the widespread coverage of the hsofs mesh is possible because its local mesh resolution is typically coarser than meshes for specific coastal regions the mesh has an average resolution of 500 m along the coast with some areas decreasing to a resolution of 150 m at most locations the mesh extends inland to a smoothed version of the 10 m topographic contour fig 3 it has a total of 1 813 443 vertices and 3 564 104 elements two primary data sources were used to provide bathymetry topography the usgs 1 9 arc second national elevation dataset ned digital elevation model dem u s geological survey 2018a supplied overland topography and the noaa east coast 2012 ec2012 tidal constituent database mesh szpilka et al 2016 supplied bathymetry the mesh has been validated for 10 major tropical and extra tropical storms covering a spectrum of landfalls across the u s coast including isabel katrina ike and sandy riverside technology and aecom 2015 the hsofs mesh is ideal for this study because its widespread coverage includes the nearshore regions and floodplains impacted by matthew along the southeast u s coast 3 4 adjustments for water level processes on longer time scales to represent baroclinic and longer term processes water levels were adjusted a priori to account for local sea level rise and intra annual mean sea surface variability these adjustments are provided as a spatially varying offset surface and are thus an improvement over the spatially constant adjustments used in previous studies e g bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2018 2011a they provide a correction to the mean water levels before the storm without the expense of running a three dimensional baroclinic model from the open ocean into the floodplains the ground elevations in the hsofs mesh are referenced to local mean sea level based on the national tidal data epoch from 1983 through 2001 and thus the sea level must be adjusted to conditions during matthew in 2016 sea level trends were computed at 29 noaa tidal stations extending from florida through maine using relationships provided by the noaa center for operational and oceanographic products and services co ops national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2018a for a 15 year period from 2001 to 2016 to account for local increases in mean sea level relative to the datum used by the hsofs mesh this increase ranges from 3 to 5 cm for much of florida through south carolina but increases to 7 to 8 cm in northeast north carolina and virginia fig 4 the water levels were also adjusted to account for steric effects due to thermal expansion of the ocean waters antonov et al 2005 levitus et al 2000 willis et al 2004 and baroclinic interactions with the gulf stream ezer et al 2013 using the regional long term sea level station data at the time of landfall bunya et al 2010 for matthew the steric adjustment resulted in a maximum water level increase of about 19 cm along the georgia coast but decreases to about 10 cm to the south in florida and to the north in north carolina and virginia fig 4 the total vertical reference level adjustment at each station was calculated as the sum of the local sea level rise and steric increase this increase was then applied as an offset surface which varies spatially along the coast and transitions offshore to zero this offset surface was provided to adcirc at the start of the simulation using a 1 day ramp and is implemented as a pseudo barometric pressure term in adcirc asher et al 2019 4 model validation hindcasts of matthew were simulated with swan adcirc and atmospheric forcing from the three sources gahm wf and owi to establish the ambient water level condition prior to the storm the tides were spun up in a 15 day simulation from 0000 utc 17 september to 0000 utc 02 october then the storm was simulated over a 9 day period from 0000 utc 02 october to 0000 utc 11 october 4 1 atmospheric forcings 4 1 1 evolution of surface pressures and wind speeds the observed and predicted surface pressures and wind speeds are compared at selected locations ranging from florida through north carolina fig 5 and throughout the storm s evolution figs 6 7 surface pressures are analyzed as pressure deficits where an ambient pressure of 1013 25 hpa is subtracted from observed and predicted pressures on 0800 utc 07 october when the storm was located offshore of melbourne florida fig 6 first row north northeasterly winds were observed at the ndbc station trdf1 at trident pier florida with a maximum wind speed of 22 9 m s and a pressure deficit of about 40 hpa fig 7 first row gahm over predicts the peak wind speeds by about 10 m s and under predicts the pressure deficit by 20 hpa on 2000 utc 07 october about 10 h later and 19 h before landfall when the storm was located 35 miles east of st augustine florida fig 6 second row the wind speeds decreased in all three fields close to the eye the winds interact with the coast with peak wind speeds of 25 to 30 m s for both gahm and owi and 20 m s for wf at this time the nos station mypfi located at the entrance of the st johns river florida received north northeasterly winds with a maximum wind speed of 22 7 m s and pressure deficit of about 28 hpa fig 7 second row as matthew moved northward it brought hurricane strength wind gusts to the coasts of southeastern georgia and southern south carolina on 0615 utc 08 october about 9 h before landfall the usgs station 311941081265201 near brunswick georgia recorded a maximum wind speed of 16 1 m s and a pressure deficit of about 29 hpa fig 7 third row with all the three atmospheric forcings having similar results when the storm reached offshore of charleston south carolina it had weakened to category 1 status on 1350 utc 08 october about 1 h before landfall the offshore ndbc buoy 41004 observed southwesterly winds with a maximum speed of 23 5 m s and a pressure deficit of 31 55 hpa fig 7 fourth row at the peak all three models gave similar results except for gahm under predicting the pressure deficit by about 20 hpa on 1500 utc 08 october the category 1 storm made landfall in mcclellanville south carolina fig 6 third row with observed wind speeds of 39 m s stewart 2017 near landfall there is a difference in the storm track with both gahm and owi predicting a slight inland trajectory for the storm compared to wf after landfall the storm moved offshore in an east northeastward direction by 0600 utc 09 october the storm was located 45 km offshore of cape hatteras north carolina fig 6 bottom row the eye of the storm is similar for gahm and owi with a large eye surrounded by a small 10 to 15 m s wind field although gahm has a much larger 25 to 30 m s field offshore at the ndbc buoy 41025 at diamond shoals wind speeds at this time were 18 m s which matches for wf and owi the eye for wf has become disorganized and extends into pamlico sound there are significant differences inside the sound with modeled winds in the ranges of 20 to 30 m s 5 to 15 m s and 10 to 20 m s for gahm wf and owi respectively the effects of matthew s wind field were observed even at the nos station 8652587 located north at the oregon inlet marina north carolina where a maximum wind speed of 20 56 m s and a pressure deficit of about 20 hpa was recorded on 1006 utc 9 october fig 7 last row the storm weakened to a tropical depression by 1200 utc 9 october when it was located 45 km southeast of cape hatteras overall for the surface pressures fig 7 left column gahm tends to under predict the pressure deficits during the storm by more than 10 hpa but the central pressure comes from the best track file and represents an input to the gahm which is then used to produce the surface barometric field thus these under predictions are almost entirely a result of errors in the central pressure coming from the best track file the data assimilated wf and owi products show a good match to the surface pressures at most locations with exceptions of wf before and after the storm due to its relatively shorter time period and owi at nos station bftn7 at beaufort north carolina where it under predicted the pressure deficit during the storm the peak wind speeds are also matched well between observations and predictions fig 7 right column the parametric gahm has zero wind speeds before and after the storm and it also tends to over predict the peaks at locations in florida trdf1 and into the carolinas 41024 bftn7 the data assimilated wf and owi products capture the large scale synoptic wind patterns as well as the storm winds 4 1 2 error statistics the agreement between observations and predictions is quantified table 2 through the use of the root mean squared error e rms e r m s 1 n i 1 n e i 2 and the mean normalized bias b mn b m n 1 n i 1 n e i 1 n i 1 n o i where n is the number of observations and e i is the difference between predicted and observed values the e rms is an indication of the magnitude of error and has an ideal value of zero the b mn indicates the model s magnitude of over prediction or under prediction normalized to the observed value and also has an ideal value of zero for surface pressures and wind speeds as well as for water levels in the upcoming sections these error statistics are calculated for a period ranging from 0000 utc 05 october to 0000 utc 11 october gahm has the largest e rms and magnitude of b mn thus showing the benefits of the data assimilated wf and owi products both gahm and wf under predict the surface pressure deficits with negative b mn values of 0 16 and 0 02 respectively whereas owi over predicts the surface pressure deficit with a positive b mn of 0 06 although the peak wind fields in gahm were the strongest fig 6 the negative b mn reflects gahm s lack of ambient winds before and after the storm wf and owi have positive b mn for wind speeds of 0 16 and 0 06 respectively thus indicating over prediction for both surface pressure deficits and wind speeds owi has smaller errors overall and thus it is the best match to the observations thus owi is a better representation of the atmospheric forcing during matthew it is a better match to the observed time series of surface pressures and wind speeds at locations throughout the region table 2 its fields also show the most realistic representation of the storm s evolution near landfall and afterward fig 6 in the following sections the authors will use owi as the best approximation of the true behavior of matthew as it moved offshore of the u s southeast coast although error statistics will be computed for water levels as forced with all three atmospheric sources only owi will be used in the analyses of spatial and temporal variability of storm surge and only owi will be used in the analyses of nonlinear interactions storm timing and forward speed 4 2 water levels 4 2 1 evolution of water levels as matthew tracked along the southeast coastline of the united states heavy winds and rainfall elevated water levels at several locations to historic levels although matthew brought northerly and north easterly hurricane peak winds of 20 to 25 m s along the florida coast from lake worth to port canaveral it resulted in very little storm tide with a maximum of 0 5 to 1 m fig 8 top left as the storm moved northward there was an increase in the water levels along the coastline on 1700 utc 07 october fig 8 top right winds blowing from the northeast pushed water against the coastline with peaks of 1 5 to 2 5 m the usgs sts stations flvol03143 and flstj03126 located between orlando beach and st augustine beach florida recorded peak water levels of 2 1 m and 2 56 m respectively fig 9 top row the winds decreased as the storm moved northward and weakened from category 3 to category 2 status the station nos 8720218 at mayport florida and located at the entrance of the st johns river received peak winds of 20 to 25 m s causing a maximum water level of 1 59 m the highest ever recorded at this site stewart 2017 fig 9 along the st johns river inundation occurred well inland from the coast fig 8 top right the nos 8720625 station at racy point observed a record peak of 1 58 m on 2236 utc 07 october stewart 2017 about 3 5 h after a maximum was observed at the river entrance north of the st johns river along the florida coast matthew caused storm tides of 2 to 2 3 m on 0200 utc 08 october fig 8 center left the storm now centered offshore of georgia caused shore parallel winds to drive water levels of 1 to 1 5 m into the relatively deep tidal inlets and sounds that separate the barrier islands stretching 160 km between the st mary s and savannah rivers stations along the rivers that extend from these sounds recorded even higher peaks the usgs perm 02226180 and usgs sts gacha17861 measured peak water levels of 1 87 m and 2 30 m respectively fig 9 third row on 0800 utc 08 october fig 8 center right approximately 7 h before landfall easterly and north easterly winds pushed water into the savannah river causing water levels larger than 2 5 m the maximum storm surge recorded by a tide gauge in the united states during matthew was at nos 8670870 fig 9 located at the entrance of the savannah river where peak surge occurred during high tide and caused maximum water levels of 2 59 m as matthew moved northward a combination of wind and storm surge caused extensive damage along the south carolina coastline the usgs sts sites on the islands south and east of beaufort county south carolina recorded peaks of 2 to 2 5 m the highest peak of all observations collected during matthew was at the usgs sts scbea14284 at bluffton southwest of beaufort where a maximum of 2 66 m was recorded as a category 1 storm matthew caused extensive flooding in charleston south carolina at the tidal gauge nos 8665530 fig 9 located at the cooper river entrance a peak surge occurred during a low tide resulting in a storm tide maximum of 1 87 m on 1500 utc 08 october at landfall fig 8 bottom left south easterly winds pushed water levels of 1 5 to 2 m against the coastline from bulls bay to myrtle beach the maximum water levels in north carolina varied significantly by location for the atlantic coastline south of oak island the maximum water levels were mostly in the range of 2 to 2 5 m this decreased to 1 5 to 2 m from oak island to masonboro inlet and 1 to 1 5 m for the coastline from wrightsville beach to cape hatteras on 0600 utc 09 october fig 8 bottom right northerly and northeasterly winds pushed water levels of 0 5 to 1 m toward the western pamlico sound the nos 8654467 gauge at the united states coast guard station on hatteras island received record water levels stewart 2017 with a peak of 1 85 m fig 9 bottom left on the rivers that drain into the sound the maximum water levels varied in the range of 0 5 to 1 m in the neuse river and 0 75 to 1 25 m in the pamlico and pungo rivers e g ncem blhn7 in fig 9 bottom right as the storm moved offshore the winds decreased along the coast and the water levels returned to normal tide levels at most locations 4 2 2 error statistics at most locations the swan adcirc predictions with owi atmospheric forcing show good agreement with the observations e g the 12 stations shown in fig 5 with time series in fig 9 one exception was nos 8654467 where the model underestimated the peak by more than 0 5 m there was an over prediction of the peak at some stations usgs sts flvol03143 nos 8720218 usgs perm02226180 and usgs sts gacha17861 but within 0 3 m otherwise the model was able to closely predict variations in both the tides and surge levels to quantify the model performance with regard to water level predictions error statistics were computed table 2 only at locations wetted by the model for 241 locations on the u s southeast coast the overall e rms was 0 28 m and the b mn was very close to zero the largest errors occurred on the gauges upstream of the savannah river where e rms of about 0 58 to 1 27 m and b mn of 0 83 to 1 56 were obtained large e rms of 0 41 to 0 94 m and b mn of 0 56 to 0 87 were also observed at stations on the sound side of the outer banks in north carolina these over predictions in the savannah river and under predictions in the north carolina sounds can likely be attributed to the relatively coarse representation of the channels and tidal inlets that lead to these locations comparing the overall statistics for water levels simulations with gahm had the highest e rms of 0 42 m and b mn of 0 32 while simulations with owi had the smallest e rms of 0 28 m and b mn of 0 04 simulations with gahm and wf had negative b mn and thus under predicted the water levels a total of 464 usgs observed hwms inside the model domain were found to be suitable for analysis when combined with the 289 hydrograph derived peak water levels a total of 753 locations were used to evaluate model performance during matthew along the u s southeast coast in fig 10 the points are color coded based on error predicted less observed expressed as percentage of the observed value warm colors indicate regions of over prediction by adcirc whereas cooler colors indicate regions of under prediction for the simulation forced by owi the errors in modeled peaks were within 10 at 322 52 of the 622 total stations wetted by adcirc and within 25 at 538 87 stations for the scatter plots the r 2 value was 0 78 and the slope of the best fit line was 0 96 table 2 the e rms were largest on the sound side of the outer banks in north carolina the model under predicted the peaks by more than 25 at most locations in this region in other regions the errors were lesser especially along the coast from florida to south carolina where the errors were usually less than 25 a negative value of b mn indicated an under prediction of the peaks overall by all the three models as seen for water levels the observation based owi and wf fields led to better error statistics than gahm for the predicted water levels the best correlation between modeled and observed peaks were given by owi with its better values of e rms b mn r 2 and best fit slope thus the swan adcirc simulation on the hsofs mesh with owi atmospheric forcing is the best prediction of the surface pressures wind speeds and water levels along matthew s track from florida through north carolina the water levels are a good match at both open coast and inland locations and the error statistics are comparable to other recent studies with swan adcirc on higher resolution meshes e g hope et al 2013 it is noted that the simulation was not tuned to achieve this performance the mesh and other input settings are similar to other studies including real time forecasting with adcirc using this well validated simulation we can now quantify the contributions of the nonlinear terms in adcirc and then investigate the effects of storm timing and forward speed on the peak water levels 5 surge interactions with tides storm timing and forward speed 5 1 nonlinear tide surge interaction the total storm tide should include contributions from both surge and tides however instead of a linear superposition there are physical processes that causes their interaction to be a nonlinear phenomenon bernier and thompson 2007 horsburgh and wilson 2007 poulose et al 2017 prandle and wolf 1978 tang et al 1996 wolf 1981 these processes are represented in the governing equations in adcirc as a momentum advection on the surge due to the presence of the tide b the nonlinear effects of bottom friction due to the quadratic parametrization c the coriolis acceleration feng et al 2016 valle levinson et al 2013 and d the shallow water effect idier et al 2012 prandle and wolf 1978 zhang et al 2010 which arises due to nonlinearities related to h h ζ terms in the mass and momentum equations the importance of these terms varies from case to case and is associated with water depth tidal ranges and storm strength at specific locations these nonlinear terms influence the distribution of energy between tide and surge and thus can be a crucial factor in the accurate prediction of total water levels during a hurricane the goal of the present study is not to re investigate the possible causes of these nonlinear interactions but rather to quantify their behavior during a shore parallel storm affecting a long coastline in contrast to earlier studies in this region feng et al 2016 valle levinson et al 2013 which used a typical resolution between 1 and 5 km along the coastline this study includes sufficient resolution to represent the behavior of the interactions into the estuaries and coastal water bodies to separate the nonlinear interaction term from the storm tide the nonlinear term can be computed as η i η t w η w η t where each η represents water levels from a simulation with some combination of winds w and or tides t bernier and thompson 2007 rego and li 2010 zhang et al 2010 therefore the offset surface was disabled only for this subsection to exclude the effects of relative sea level rise and steric effects on the nonlinear interaction between tide and surge it is noted that because we are using the depth averaged barotropic version of adcirc this study may not represent all of the dynamics on the deeper shelf however it is a reasonable assumption that the storm s effects were distributed well into the water column and the computational efficiency of the depth averaged version allows for additional resolution to explore the interactions into the estuaries and coastal regions during matthew it was seen that the nonlinear interactions were large especially in regions with broader shelf areas fig 11 in the estuaries along the south atlantic bight the peak magnitudes of the nonlinear interactions were larger than 1 m farther offshore from the estuaries the maximum values decreased to about 0 1 to 0 4 m along the coastline and to zero in the open ocean the tide surge interaction significantly affected the total water levels only when they were large enough to interact our results show that with respect to local mean sea level lmsl the nonlinearities are destructive η i 0 to the storm tide heights during a rising or high tide and constructive η i 0 during a low or falling tide these results are similar to previous studies lin et al 2012 rego and li 2010 at locations along blackbeard creek to the south of savannah georgia fig 12 the interaction terms were small with a maximum of 0 27 m at station 1 located offshore moving inland the magnitudes increased to a maximum of 0 48 m at station 2 near the coast and 1 04 m at station 3 in the estuary at station 3 the nonlinear terms were as large as the tidal amplitudes these values are large enough to be of practical importance during storm surge forecasting there is also a phase shift in the peak of the nonlinear terms as compared to that to the surge as has been recognized previously horsburgh and wilson 2007 at station 3 this phase shift was 5 h thus the tide surge nonlinear interactions during matthew occurred on the shallow and wider shelf regions of the domain and varied in sign based on the tidal cycles although similar trends have been seen in the literature this is the first study to represent the interactions into the estuaries and floodplains over a long coastline for a shore parallel storm and with representation of these features at appropriate resolution the magnitudes of these nonlinear terms were largest in the estuaries along the southeastern u s coast and are larger than in any of the previous studies the nonlinear tide surge interactions can have a significant effect in controlling the total water levels during a hurricane 5 2 storm timing the total water levels caused by matthew as it moved along the u s coastline were affected by both variations in tidal amplitudes and by its coincidence with different parts of the tidal cycle at different locations to understand how matthew s time of occurrence would have influenced the total water levels along the coast scenarios were simulated to alter the storm s timing relative to the tidal cycle for the u s southeast coast the dominant tidal constituent is the principal lunar semi diurnal m 2 tidal constituent thus simulations were conducted by delaying the storm by 3 11 h 6 21 h 9 32 h and 12 42 h corresponding to one fourth half three fourth and full m 2 tidal periods respectively the storm forward speed was unchanged during these simulations these scenarios resulted in water levels that varied from that during the storm with the greatest changes occurring during the 6 21 h simulation and least changes happening during the 12 42 h simulation these variations are shown in fig 13 where warm colors indicate an increase in water level and cool colors indicate a decrease in water levels in regions like the pamlico sound where tides are small there were no variations in the scenarios in regions along the coastline where tides are dominant the changes were larger and extended into the estuaries along the south atlantic bight these plots indicate how the inundation along the u s southeast coastline would have varied if matthew occurred at a different time to understand the changes in flooding at specific locations along the coastline the maximum water levels during matthew and the two scenarios above were plotted along the u s atlantic coast fig 14 near trident pier florida where the surge occurred during a falling stage in the tidal cycle during matthew all scenarios caused increased flooding especially the 6 21 h simulation which produced an increase of about 0 7 m near fort pulaski georgia where maximum inundation was observed during matthew the surge coincided with a lower high tide if the storm had been delayed by 12 42 h then the surge peak would have coincided with a higher high tide thus further increasing the peak by about 0 20 m near wrightsville beach north carolina where the surge occurred during a rising stage of the tide cycle the peak would have increased by about 0 20 m if the surge had occurred 3 11 h later thus for a shore parallel storm like matthew that interacted with tides over a large extent of the coastline timing can significantly influence the flooding at locations along the coast 5 3 forward speed the impact of a hurricane s forward speed on coastal flooding has been recognized previously berg 2013 jelesnianski 1972 peng et al 2004 2006 rego and li 2009 and has been shown to have significant effects on peak surge heights and inundation volumes for a given wind speed slower storms are generally considered to be more dangerous as they have considerably more time to impact the coastal waters and thus cause more flooding matthew had a forward speed of about 5 m s as it passed north carolina in three scenario simulations the forward speeds were 50 slower 50 faster and 100 faster which represent storm speeds of about 2 5 m s 7 5 m s and 10 m s respectively in north carolina these speeds are representative of the historical record blanton and vickery 2008 tides were disabled in these simulations in order to quantify the sole effect of forward speed on surge along this coastline the differences in maximum water levels between these scenarios and the base matthew simulation fig 15 demonstrate how the flooding is affected by the forward speed of the storm the 50 slower simulation had a decrease in flooding along the open coast however with more time to push water into inland areas the slower storm caused an increase in flooding in the rivers 0 2 to 0 4 m in the st johns river florida and alligator river north carolina and sounds 0 1 to 0 4 m in pamlico sound along the coast the surge was also higher and pushed further inland in the estuaries and floodplains along the south atlantic bight near savannah georgia the water levels increased by about 0 9 m as the speed of the storm was increased the trends in water levels were seen to reverse water levels were increased on the open coast but water levels were decreased in the bays and estuaries the coastline between daytona beach and st augustine florida had increased flooding of about 0 5 m along the coastline of southeast north carolina the water levels were also increased by 0 5 m the increase in water levels along the south atlantic bight coastline was lesser and this may be due to the extensive lowlands in the region that absorb more surge reduced flooding was observed in the estuaries along the bight near savannah georgia this decrease was as much as 0 7 m these trends can be further quantified by examining the maximum water levels along the open coastline fig 14 the faster simulations produced larger water levels along the coastline as compared to the base matthew simulation and the 50 slower scenario about 260 km of coastline had water levels of 2 m or higher during matthew the 50 slower scenario caused a 6 decrease in this distance whereas the 50 faster and 100 faster scenarios caused increases of 57 and 120 respectively thus the faster storms would have pushed water levels of 2 m or higher against a longer stretch of coastline but the inundation areas followed the opposite trends considering only the land regions that became wetted during the storm matthew had a total inundation volume of 5 5 km3 for the 50 slower scenario this volume was increased by 17 while for the 50 and 100 faster scenarios the volumes were decreased by about 6 and 16 respectively the faster storms increased the hazard at the open coast while the slower storms pushed more flooding into overland regions thus although slower storms can produce more widespread flooding faster storms can be dangerous as well producing higher surges especially at the coast proudman 1953 showed that the largest storm surges occur when speed of the storm is close to the propagation speed of the long wave g h for the 100 faster scenario the storm forward speeds near the u s southeast coast were about 10 to 14 m s which corresponds to a long wave for depths of 10 to 20 m these isobaths vary in distances offshore along the u s southeast coast but are within the region where the increased peaks were observed although the storm eye moved from south to north along the u s atlantic coast its anticlockwise winds caused the dominant direction of water velocities to be from north to south with the coastline on its right side thus it is plausible that a faster storm would energize a shelf wave increasing the forward speed of the storm caused an increase in peak water levels along the coastline but a decrease in overall volume of inundation regarding peak water levels these results agree with jelesnianski 1972 and rego and li 2009 whereas they contradict peng et al 2004 and berg 2013 a slower storm causes lesser flooding on the open coast but pushes more water into the estuaries and bays it also results in a larger total volume of inundation peng et al 2004 2006 rego and li 2009 however none of these studies looked at shore parallel storm effects on a large extent of complex shoreline although matthew had varying effects along the southeast u s coastline from florida through north carolina the maximum water levels and overland flooding would have changed as expected if the storm s forward speed had been faster 6 conclusions matthew caused devastating floods strong winds and moderate storm surge along the southeast coast of the united states and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane along the central south carolina coast during early october 2016 from east central florida to north carolina the storm moved slowly along a shore parallel track and causing widespread impacts that lasted for several days the swan adcirc modeling system was used to perform high resolution modeling of water levels during the storm and predictions were validated using the extensive network of observations throughout the region scenarios then quantified the effects of storm timing and forward speed on the surge and inundation our findings can be summarized as follows 1 observation based wind fields like wf and owi provide better meteorological forcing for hindcasting as compared to parametric models like gahm this is evident from their lower values of e rms and b mn for both surface pressure deficits and wind speeds owi had the lowest error metrics thus making it the most accurate wind and pressure fields during matthew 2 swan adcirc represents well the effects of matthew along the u s atlantic coast even when applied on the relatively coarse hsofs mesh the model results using owi forcing showed good agreement to observations for water levels and hwms water level comparisons at 241 locations on the u s southeast coast resulted in an overall e rms of less than 30 cm and a b mn very close to zero there was also good correlation between modeled and measured peak water levels for a total of 622 hwms the r 2 value was 0 78 and the slope of the best fit line was 0 96 these values are comparable to results from studies using meshes with much higher resolution 3 the nonlinear interactions between tides and surge on the southeast u s atlantic coast during matthew had a constructive effect on the total water levels during a low or falling tide and a destructive effect during a high or rising tide this study is the first to consider these interactions for a long coastline during a shore parallel storm the magnitudes of these interactions varied at different regions with respect to the coast with small values on the ocean side and large values on the estuary side in the estuaries these interactions were larger than 1 m larger than in previous studies 4 altering the timing of the storm caused locations along the coast to have increased or decreased water levels depending on how the storm coincided with various stages in the tidal cycle this is especially true for shore parallel storms that travel along a large extent of the coastline over several tidal cycles 5 the storm s forward speed also had large effects on water levels this study is the first to consider these interactions for a long coastline during a shore parallel storm slower storms with more time to impact the coastal waters cause more flooding in the bays and estuaries and lesser values on the open coast faster storms moving quickly across the coastline cause high surges on the open coast especially along straight coastlines and lower surges in the bays and estuaries although this study is specific to hurricane matthew it demonstrates the importance of considering the nonlinear tide surge interactions in flood risk studies it also shows that storm timing and forward speed can be two crucial factors that can significantly alter the surge during a hurricane acknowledgments this work was supported by the nsf grant enh 1635784 this material is also based

24036,oceanic fluxes through fram strait may significantly contribute to climate variations in the arctic however their observations are difficult here a 26 year numerical model simulation is used to derive oceanic proxies for interannual variability in heat fluxes through fram strait it is found that variability in the cross slope gradient of sea surface height ssh across the west spitsbergen current wsc can explain about 90 of the variance of winter and annual mean volume transports of atlantic water at 79 n given the strong covariance between the simulated heat flux in the slope current along svalbard and the corresponding volume transport variability of the ssh gradient across the wsc is also found to account for about 80 of the variance of heat flux associated with the northward flow through fram strait moreover variations in the ssh gradient across the arctic slope current asc northeast of svalbard at 31 e explain about 85 of the variance of heat flux there and about 80 of the variance of the net heat flux upstream through fram strait finally about 85 and 75 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait is associated with anomalies of the eastward volume transport and depth averaged core velocity in the asc respectively these relations indicate that monitoring of the flow in the asc even with a single current meter mooring or of the ssh gradient across this current derived from either in situ or remote measurements may provide useful proxies for the heat import to the arctic ocean keywords heat flux atlantic water fram strait interannual variability numerical modelling statistical analysis 1 introduction the general ocean circulation transports warm and salty atlantic water aw of subtropical origin towards the arctic ocean through the nordic and barents seas see fig 1 for a simulated climatology of subsurface temperature and schematic circulation in these seas the main poleward stream of aw in the norwegian atlantic current nwac in

quadfasel et al 1991 polyakov et al 2012 might have contributed to the observed dramatic shrinkage of the polar ice cap e g carmack et al 2015 and consequently to arctic amplification of global warming e g screen and simmonds 2010 there is also growing evidence for a recent sea ice loss caused by enhanced wintertime upward heat flux from the aw layer occurring not only north and northeast of svalbard onarheim et al 2014 ivanov et al 2016 but also farther downstream polyakov et al 2017 as anomalous heat exchanges through fram strait may play a prominent role in variations of the arctic climate it is crucial to monitor these exchanges however their estimation from in situ observations is challenging since fram strait is the broadest 500 km wide deepest sill depth at 2500 m and partly ice covered passage to the arctic ocean inflows and outflows in boundary currents along steep continental slopes on the eastern and western sides of the passage often split and recirculate in several branches because of ubiquitous meandering and eddying caused by irregular topography ridges fracture zones deeps troughs plateaus gaps and a relatively small internal rossby radius of deformation e g gascard et al 1988 wekerle et al 2017 the latter determines the horizontal scale of mesoscale eddies in fram strait due to the high latitude and a weak stratification the internal deformation radius reaches a value of 3 6 km von appen et al 2016 which is smaller by an order of magnitude compared to its value in mid latitudes chelton et al 1998 since 1997 volume and heat exchanges through fram strait have been monitored continuously via year round velocity and temperature measurements with an array of moored instruments maintained along a zonal section at about 79 n by the alfred wegener institute awi and the norwegian polar institute npi e g fahrbach et al 2001 schauer et al 2004 beszczynska möller et al 2012 de steur et al 2014 up to 2012 an array of 14 16 moorings covered an about 300 km wide area with an average horizontal resolution of about 20 km beszczynska möller et al 2015 therefore the array could not adequately resolve the variable flow through the section moreover the heat transport through a single section along which the inflows and outflows are not in mass balance as it is the case of all arctic ocean openings cannot be determined unambiguously due to an arbitrary choice of the reference temperature e g schauer and beszczynska möller 2009 based on these arguments there is presently a tendency to reduce the costly array of moorings in fram strait rather than to refine it indeed while moorings in the boundary currents on both sides of the strait are still operated moorings in the central part of the strait are not maintained any longer ursula schauer awi personal communication in the light of the recent atlantification of the eurasian basin of the arctic ocean polyakov et al 2017 and because of uncertainties on the fate of heat injected to this basin by the wsc pathways recirculations and interactions with the sea ice and atmosphere in the northern fram strait there is a growing interest in monitoring oceanic variability in the boundary current downstream of the wsc year long measurements of the velocity temperature and salinity were successfully conducted in the asc northeast of svalbard at 31 e in 2004 2005 e g ivanov et al 2009 regular current and hydrographic observations in this area started in 2012 våge et al 2016 pérez hernández et al 2017 renner et al 2018 evidently existing observational data are not sufficient for investigation of interannual covariability of the volume and heat fluxes through fram strait with the corresponding fluxes in the asc northeast of svalbard this covariability can however be studied using numerical ice ocean models although the uncertainty on heat fluxes due to the choice of the reference temperature remains and models also have their limitations related for instance to insufficient resolution uncertainty on the atmospheric forcing and parameterizations employed results from a high resolution 2 3 km in the fram strait area global ice ocean circulation coco model suggest that anomalies of the heat transport in the asc northeast of svalbard are not related to anomalies of the heat transport in the wsc at its entrance to fram strait kawasaki and hasumi 2016 here we report results from another numerical simulation showing a strong interannual covariability of volume and heat fluxes in the northern fram strait with those in the asc we also show that gradients of the sea surface height ssh across the wsc and asc may be good proxies not only for volume and heat fluxes in these currents but also for the net heat flux through fram strait the study is based on a monthly mean output from the naval postgraduate school arctic modeling effort name regional coupled ice ocean model run for the period 1979 2004 maslowski et al 2012 2004 the model has a horizontal grid spacing of about 9 km so that it is not eddy resolving but eddy permitting in the fram strait region previously the name model was used for investigations of climatological mass heat and salt transports through the barents sea and fram strait maslowski et al 2004 mass and heat transports in the northeastern barents sea in 1991 1992 gammelsrød et al 2009 effects of mesoscale eddies on the

the wsc section 5 3 and asc section 5 4 is analysed a summary and discussion follow in section 6 2 data and methods 2 1 model description the domain of the coupled ice ocean name model includes the arctic ocean the canadian archipelago the nordic barents and labrador seas as well as the sub arctic regions of the north pacific and north atlantic see fig 1 in maslowski et al 2004 or http www oc nps edu name name html for the full domain the ocean component of the name model is a regional adaptation of the los alamos national laboratory lanl parallel ocean program pop model with a free surface formulation dukowicz and smith 1994 it integrates the primitive equations in the hydrostatic and bousinessq approximations using a finite difference scheme laplacian diffusivity and viscosity in the vertical and biharmonic in the horizontal were used the model was configured on a 1 12 9 km horizontal grid in rotated spherical coordinates in the vertical it has 45 fixed depth layers with the thickness ranging from 5 m near the surface to 200 300 m in deep waters to balance net mass exchanges between the arctic ocean and north pacific an artificial channel was created through north america connecting the north pacific to the north atlantic model bathymetry was derived from the 2 5 km resolution international bathymetric chart of the arctic ocean jakobsson et al 2000 for regions north of 64 n and from etopo5 at 5 min resolution for regions south of 64 n the ocean component was coupled to a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model with a viscous plastic rheology zhang and hibler iii 1997 and zero layer approximation for heat conduction through the ice semtner 1976 the surface heat budget was calculated following parkinson and washington 1979 the hindcast for the period 1979 2004 was forced with daily atmospheric data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 15 reanalysis to 1993 and operational data afterwards the forcing fields included wind velocity components at 10 m surface pressure temperature and dew point and shortwave and longwave radiation the spin up was initialized using temperature and salinity fields from the university of washington polar science center hydrographic climatology 1 0 phc steele et al 2001 the monthly and annual mean phc fields were also used to restore the temperature and salinity at the surface and lateral boundaries respectively more details on the model setup and run can be found in the study by maslowski et al 2004 here we use the monthly mean fields of the horizontal velocity vector u potential temperature θ and ssh from the name model to investigate interannual variability of volume and heat fluxes in the fram strait region the salinity s and potential density σ θ calculated from θ and s are used for illustration of some climatological features only 2 2 statistical methods the covariability between simulated currents and fluxes is studied using a linear regression analysis applied if not stated otherwise to linearly detrended time series of winter january february march jfm and annual august to july mean variables the statistical significance p value of the correlation r between the time series is assessed using a two tailed t test to account for the serial correlation the test is carried out with an effective sample size estimated using eq 31 from the study by bretherton et al 1999 the 95 confidence level is used as a threshold for significant correlations 2 3 validation data to assess the reliability of flow variations in the wsc the time series of the simulated cross slope difference of ssh δssh over the svalbard slope at about 79 n between the 200 and 2000 m isobaths marked by magenta crosses in fig 2 a are compared to the corresponding observational time series to this end the dt2014 monthly mean data of the sea level anomaly with a 0 25 cartesian resolution derived from multi mission satellite altimetry by duacs pujol et al 2016 and provided by aviso http www aviso altimetry fr are used these data are available since 1993 but have missing values in the winter of 1994 so that they are compared to the model output from the period 1993 1995 2004 to assess the reliability of temperature variations in the wsc a time series t obs representing observed summer aw temperature in the atlantic water core on the upper continental slope off the southern tip of spitsbergen at about 76 5 n magenta square in fig 2a for the 1979 2004 period is constructed using quality controlled temperature records gathered in the june july august jja season the summer season is selected since only for that season reliable time series can be constructed due to the availability of hydrographic profiles the hydrographic data are obtained from four sources the oceanographic database of the international council for the exploration of the sea ices 2017 world ocean database 2013 wod13 of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa u s boyer et al 2013 barents and kara seas oceanographic data base of the arctic climate system study acsys project office golubev et al 1999 and arex database of the institute of oceanology sopot poland the latter database compiles records from cruises of r v oceania to the arctic in the jja season since the beginning of the 1990s e g piechura et al 2001 schlichtholz and goszczko 2006 walczowski and piechura 2007 walczowski 2014 since the collected temperature profiles have a highly irregular distribution in both space and time any observed time series derived from these profiles has a large uncertainty here the time series of t obs are constructed using two methods one estimate of t obs is the temperature t avg averaged in each summer over the 100 300 m layer between the 300 and 700 m isobaths and between 75 and 78 n a box along the 500 m isobath marked by a thick white line in fig 2a the averaging method is the same as employed by schlichtholz and houssais 2011 to construct a time series of aw temperature in the barents sea opening the second estimate of t obs is for each summer the median t med of the same vertically averaged temperature data in the 100 300 m layer as used to compute t avg the time series of the two estimates of t obs are very consistent r 0 92 as the simulated temperature in the wsc correlates slightly higher with t med than t avg only t med is used later in this paper 2 4 flux calculations 2 4 1 general definitions the volume transport v and the heat flux q across a selected area a of a given oceanic section are calculated as follows 1 v a v d a and q ρ 0 c p a v θ θ ref d a where v is the cross sectional component of the current velocity ρ 0 is a constant reference density of seawater 1027 kg m 3 c p is the specific heat at constant pressure for seawater 4000 j kg c 1 and θ ref is a reference temperature calculations of v and q are made either for entire oceanic sections or specific currents crossing these sections in addition the local cumulated volume flux v x is calculated as follows 2 v x x 0 x v h d x where v is the cross sectional component of the depth averaged velocity u i e velocity averaged from the ocean bottom depth at z h to the ocean surface at z 0 and x is the along sectional coordinate the net volume flux is split into the inflow v and outflow v based on the sign of the cross sectional flow and the corresponding heat fluxes q and q are calculated since the flux q in eq 1 depends on an arbitrary choice of θ ref it is only a proxy for the heat transport for this reason it is sometimes referred to as quasi heat transport e g aksenov et al 2010 enthalpy transport e g schauer et al 2004 or temperature flux e g marnela et al 2013 here it is referred to as referenced heat flux or to be short heat flux the choice of the reference temperature is made in section 4 2 2 4 2 inherent uncertainties since the fluxes in eq 1 are calculated using monthly mean velocity and temperature data uncertainty on the computed heat flux arises due to the omitted eddy contribution to illustrate this uncertainty let us decompose the instantaneous cross sectional velocity v i and temperature θ i into the monthly mean values denoted by the subscript m and anomalies from these values denoted by the subscript a that is v i v m v a and θ i θ m θ a with this decomposition the monthly mean heat flux q m can be written as 3 q m ρ 0 c p a v m θ m θ ref d a ρ 0 c p a v a θ a m d a q m m q a a the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 q mm a v m θ m θ ref da represents the contribution to the mean heat flux from mean currents the second term q aa a v a θ a m da represents the eddy contribution resulting from the covariance of temperature and velocity anomalies as this covariance was not stored in the model output we approximate the monthly mean heat flux by its q mm component the winter and annual mean heat fluxes are obtained by averaging of q mm an exception is the volumetrically balanced heat flux introduced in the next section since q mm in eq 3 depends on the reference temperature while q aa does not the relative importance of the omitted eddy contribution depends on the reference temperature based on the high resolution coco model kawasaki and hasumi 2016 estimated the relative contribution of the submonthly eddies to the monthly average heat flux across the prime meridian in fram strait to be 5 this estimate was obtained with the freezing point of seawater as the reference temperature and therefore would be larger if a higher reference temperature was used in the present case the relative magnitude of the resolved but omitted eddy heat flux is probably smaller than in the coco model since the name model has a lower horizontal resolution by a factor of 3 4 in fram strait on the other hand a large uncertainty on heat and volume fluxes arises because of non resolved eddy motions which directly contribute to the heat flux and impact the mean circulation through eddy mean flow interactions compared to their lower resolution versions the eddy resolving models such as the global fesom model with the locally refined horizontal resolution of 1 km in the fram strait area wekerle et al 2017 show increased levels of eddy kinetic energy strengthened mean circulation and closer to observations thermal structure in fram strait both the fesom model and a high 800 m resolution regional s800 model of the circulation in the svalbard area hattermann et al 2016 indicate that eddy driven recirculation of aw in fram strait modifies the amount of heat that reaches the arctic ocean at least on the seasonal timescale here we assume that flux estimates derived from the monthly mean name output are despite their various limitations accurate enough to highlight real and important interannual relations between volume and heat transports in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean through fram strait 2 4 3 volumetrically balanced heat flux since any reference temperature is arbitrary an attempt is also made to construct a volumetrically balanced heat flux q 0 for sections across fram strait this flux is defined as the net heat flux integrated between spitsbergen and the location in the egc where the cumulated net volume transport v x vanishes at this location the contribution to q from ρ 0 c p a vθ ref da v in eq 1 also vanishes so that q 0 does not depend on θ ref this method of flux computation is a version of the stream tube method employed by schauer and beszczynska möller 2009 to observations at about 79 n to avoid uncertainties in the volume transport resulting from poorly sampled deep water flow in the observations their computations were made for an aw layer with a boundary defined by the 1 c isotherm and locally modified in the egc to meet the criterion of no net volume flux here we calculate q 0 for the whole water column instead of the aw layer assuming that all water entering the arctic ocean in the wsc makes loops within this ocean to eventually exit through fram strait one may consider the loops stream tubes as a closed volume and q 0 as the heat flux convergence within this volume a prerequisite for computation of q 0 is that the southward volume transport in the egc exceeds the northward volume transport in the wsc this condition is fulfilled for the simulated seasonal and annual means of the inflow and outflow through fram strait in each year however the intermonthly variability is relatively large and the location where the cumulated net volume transport through the strait vanishes cannot be found for a couple of months to circumvent this problem the winter mean q 0 is approximated by q w w 0 ρ 0 c p a 0 v w θ w d a 0 where v w and θ w are the winter mean velocity and temperature respectively and a 0 is the area over which the winter mean volume transport vanishes similarly the annual mean q 0 is approximated by q y y 0 ρ 0 c p a 0 v y θ y d a 0 where v y and θ y are the annual mean velocity and temperature respectively uncertainty on these approximations is discussed in section 4 2 3 simulated climatology in the fram strait region 3 1 general remarks to demonstrate that the name model simulates major hydrographic and flow features in the fram strait area quite well figs 1 3 display horizontal and vertical distributions of selected climatological 1979 2004 mean variables for the winter season fig 1 shows the potential temperature averaged over a subsurface layer from 50 m to 500 m or the bottom if shallower in the entire nordic barents seas region it underscores a pronounced temperature gradient along the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean resulting from a large heat loss to the atmosphere in the cold season e g simonsen and haugan 1996 and to cold ambient waters e g van aken and budéus 1995 it also illustrates the already mentioned bifurcations of the aw flow the general circulation in the fram strait region is shown explicitly in fig 2a displaying vectors of the total volume transport per unit width of the water column i e velocity integrated vertically from the ocean bottom to the ocean surface u h on the background of the bottom topography in that region the corresponding transport in the warm aw layer defined after schlichtholz and houssais 2002 as the layer occupied by water warmer than 2 c is shown in fig 3a arrows on the background of selected isobaths blue contours and the thickness d aw of the aw layer itself colours in the svalbard area the largest values of d aw 800 m that appear in the slope current all along svalbard fig 3a are approximately the same as the corresponding values based on the same temperature criterion for the aw definition obtained from the eddy resolving fesom model run for the period 2001 2009 wekerle et al 2017 fig 4 therein the main difference is over the boreas basin in the northern greenland sea where the fesom model does not exhibit wintertime temperatures above 2 c while the name model simulates a 400 500 m thick layer with such temperatures observations show that in the boreas basin this layer may not be thicker than 100 m even in summer e g schlichtholz and houssais 1999 the name model may also overestimate the aw layer thickness in the northern fram strait in this area the simulated values of d aw exceed 600 m in a southward recirculation fig 3a while observations in the 2000s e g beszczynska möller et al 2012 as well as the fesom model wekerle et al 2017 indicate that the layer with temperatures above 2 c is not thicker than 400 m in the recirculating current at about 79 n to fully illustrate the flow and hydrographic structure across fram strait fig 2b displays the distribution of the cross sectional velocity black and magenta contours and potential temperature colours along a zonal section at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a while fig 2c displays the corresponding distribution of the salinity colours and potential density black contours at the fs79n section the maximum temperature about 3 0 c and maximum salinity about 35 05 are found in the aw core on the upper svalvard slope at the 100 300 m depth over the 650 m isobath this core is carried northward by a mostly barotropic depth independent flow with the meridional velocity reaching 12 cm s 1 the dense σ θ 28 0 kg m 3 cold and salty water found east of the aw core and the baroclinic bottom intensified flow with the northward velocity exceeding 15 cm s 1 along the 350 m isobath are signatures of haline convection due to wintertime ice formation on the svalbard shelf the bottom intensification of the wsc at the shelf break may be a real feature as indicated by a 2 year 1997 1999 mean data from the current meter measurements at about 79 n fahrbach et al 2001 fig 4 therein the simulated maximum mean velocity in the wsc at this latitude fig 2b is somewhat lower than the corresponding velocity maximum above 20 cm s 1 in higher resolution models e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 wekerle et al 2017 and observations in the 2000s e g beszczynska möller et al 2012 wekerle et al 2017 consistent with observations e g schlichtholz and houssais 1999 fahrbach et al 2001 the warm and salty mode of aw recirculating southward towards the egc is pinched off from the surface by a wedge of cold θ 0 c fresh s 34 5 and light σ θ 27 6 kg m 3 surface polar water fig 2 the simulated main branch of the egc exhibits a baroclinic double core structure in the vertical with a surface intensified flow and a southward velocity maximum of 9 cm s 1 at intermediate 1000 m depths over the lower 2200 m isobath east greenland slope fig 2b such a double core structure of the egc was also simulated by the high resolution coco model run for the period 1993 2010 kawasaki and hasumi 2016 fig 4 therein the intermediate depth core was however not reported from current meter observations at about 79 n on the other hand the mooring array across the egc had no intermediate depth instrument just over the lower slope de steur et al 2014 the current meter data averaged over the period 2002 2008 show a secondary core in the egc at the bottom beszczynska möller et al 2012 de steur et al 2014 it is therefore uncertain how realistic is the simulated structure of the egc in the central deepest part of the fs79n section the simulated mean velocity is southward fig 2b while the mean velocity at about 79 n in observations e g beszczynska möller et al 2012 and high resolution models e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 wekerle et al 2017 show filaments of opposite sign resulting from meandering of the westward recirculating water the structure of the slope current in the svalbard area downstream and upstream of the fs79n section is illustrated in figs 3b and 3c they display the distribution of the cross sectional velocity and potential temperature in the wsc at its entrance to fram strait along the sb section in fig 3a and in the asc northeast of svalbard along the as section in fig 3a respectively the sb section is a zonal section at 76 5 n running from the southern tip of spitsbergen to the location in the boreas basin where the climatological depth averaged meridional velocity changes sign point b in fig 3a the as section is a meridional section northeast of svalbard at 31 e running from the northern barents sea shelf to the nansen basin of the arctic ocean the slope current at the sb section fig 3b has a similar structure to that of the wsc at the fs79n section fig 2b and will be further discussed later at the as section the aw layer appears as a warm fig 3c colours and salty not shown subsurface wedge hanging on the shelf break the simulated temperature maximum about 3 05 c in winter and 2 9 c in the annual climatology is found over the upper slope at the 200 m depth its value is close to the intermediate depth maximum of about 3 05 c in the vertical profile of a 2 year 2004 2006 mean temperature obtained from three moored instruments deployed in the same area over the 1000 m isobath at the about 70 215 and 990 m depths ivanov et al 2009 a 1 year 2004 2005 mean velocity profile from these instruments also exhibits an intermediate depth maximum pnyushkov et al 2015 such a maximum is also found in the simulated eastward flow across the as section at the 100 150 m depth over the 1000 m isobath fig 3c contours however the simulated maximum 5 cm s 1 in winter and 3 5 cm s 1 in the annual climatology is much lower than the maximum velocity of 20 cm s 1 found in the annual mean current speed profile in 2004 2005 e g pnyushkov et al 2015 as well as in summertime current snapshot observations in this area in 2012 våge et al 2016 and 2013 pérez hernández et al 2017 indicating that the simulated flow might be too weak also in the asc in the name model the climatological annual mean aw volume transport across the as section amounts to 1 0 sv 1 sv 106 m3 s 1 which is lower by 40 than the corresponding 9 year 2001 2009 mean transport of 1 6 sv obtained from the high resolution fesom model wekerle et al 2017 3 2 volume and heat exchanges through fram strait to further explore and validate the results from the name model table 1 gives annual statistics for selected variables in fram strait at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a in addition to heat fluxes discussed later the selected variables include the total surface to bottom net volume transport in the wsc v wsc 79n the corresponding transport in the aw layer warmer than 2 c v wsc 79n aw and the average potential temperature in this layer θ wsc 79n aw as well as the total northward inflow v fs79n and net volume transport v fs79n through the section the transport resp temperature in the wsc is cumulated resp averaged from spitsbergen to the location at the svalbard slope base where the climatological depth averaged meridional velocity changes sign marked by a black vertical line in fig 2b in addition to the average y of all annual means and their standard deviation std σ y in the 1979 2004 period the statistics in table 1 include the minimum m min and maximum m max of the mean seasonal cycle with the months of extremes given in parenthesis the simulated annual mean net volume transport in the wsc v wsc 79n in table 1 amounts to 3 9 sv it is lower by 40 than the corresponding observed transport of 6 6 sv in the period 1997 2010 beszczynska möller et al 2012 on the other hand the simulated annual mean net volume transport in the aw layer of the wsc v wsc 79n aw in table 1 is nearly as large 2 7 sv as the corresponding observed transport of 3 0 sv beszczynska möller et al 2012 the larger relative difference between the simulated and observed transports for the entire wsc than its aw layer should reflect differences in the aw layer thickness smaller in the observations and in the vertical structure of the flow more barotropic in the observations on the middle lower slope the simulated mean seasonal cycle of the net volume transport in the wsc both total and in the aw layer and of the total inflow from the south v fs79n in table 1 exhibits a maximum in march and a minimum from july to october similar timing of extremes a wintertime maximum and a summertime minimum is found in the seasonal cycle of the observed volume transport in the wsc beszczynska möller et al 2012 similarly a maximum in october and a minimum in april found in the simulated mean seasonal cycle of the aw temperature in the wsc θ wsc 79n aw in table 1 are consistent with the autumn and spring extremes in the corresponding observed cycle beszczynska möller et al 2012 von appen et al 2016 the estimates of the net volume transport through fram strait v fs79n in table 1 are valid for any section between spitsbergen and greenland because of mass conservation the annual mean value of v fs79n 2 2 sv is equal to the corresponding value from a global ice ocean circulation model having approximately the same resolution in the area of interest and run for approximately the same 1989 2004 period as the name model but forced with different atmospheric data aksenov et al 2010 both estimates are slightly lower by 20 than the corresponding estimates of 2 8 2 9 sv from the high resolution coco kawasaki and hasumi 2016 and fesom wekerle et al 2017 models they fall however into the range of estimates of the net volume transport through fram strait based on observations that is between a 9 year 1997 2006 mean of 2 0 sv from current meter measurements schauer et al 2008 and a mean of 3 1 sv from geostrophic computations using summertime hydrographic snapshots marnela et al 2013 as already noted there is no unique choice of the reference temperature for calculation of the heat flux through arbitrary oceanic sections for comparison s sake the referenced heat fluxes are first computed using θ ref 0 1 c see section 4 2 for a discussion of heat fluxes computed using other reference temperatures with θ ref 0 1 c the simulated annual means of the total heat flux through the fs79n section associated with the northward flow across this section q fs79n at the end of the 1990s reach 50 tw 1 tw 1012 j s 1 which is on the upper side of the range of the corresponding estimates 32 55 tw based on observations in the same period schauer et al 2004 the simulated annual means of the total net heat flux across the same section q fs79n at the end of the 1990s 15 tw are however at the lower limit of the corresponding observational estimates 16 41 tw since the observed exchanges through fram strait in the 1990s are not reliable because of a sparse instrumental coverage of the deep part of the strait e g schauer and beszczynska möller 2009 the observed net heat flux through the strait may be overestimated however it is also likely that the name model underestimates this flux because of for instance a too thick aw layer in the simulated southward recirculation see the previous section 3 3 recirculations in fram strait 3 3 1 southern and northern branches hydrographic and current observations reveal that the northward flow through the nordic seas towards fram strait occurs in two topographically guided branches e g orvik and niiler 2002 walczowski and piechura 2007 an eastern primarily barotropic branch follows the upper continental slope west of norway in the south and west of southern svalbard in the north a western primarily baroclinic surface intensified branch meanders along mid ocean ridges in fram strait it partly recirculates westward and partly converges with the slope branch due to the junction of the knipovich ridge with the svalbard continental slope such a current structure is also simulated by the name model at the sb section in the southern fram strait cyan line in fig 3a the slope current carries the warm aw core northward over the upper slope with the wintertime meridional velocity reaching 10 cm s 1 fig 3b the ridge current appears mainly as a broad surface intensified core on the western side of the knipovich ridge with the wintertime meridional velocity of up to 5 cm s 1 this western knipovich ridge branch recirculates westward and then southward mainly south of 79 n along the rim of the boreas basin figs 2a and 3a a secondary baroclinic core crossing the sb section on the eastern side of the knipovich ridge fig 3b merges farther downstream with the slope core figs 2a and 3a and is not distinguishable in the meridional flow across the section at about 79 n fig 2b north of 79 n the wsc is known to split over diverging isobaths at the junction of the yermak plateau with the spitsbergen shelf into the so called svalbard branch that turns east along shallower isobaths and the so called yermak branch that continues northward along the western slope of the yermak plateau e g manley 1995 cokelet et al 2008 the fate of aw from the yermak branch is uncertain hydrographic data indicate that it either circumvents the yermak plateau before entering the arctic ocean e g perkin and lewis 1984 rudels et al 2000 or recirculates southward in the northern fram strait e g quadfasel et al 1987 bourke et al 1988 lagrangian observations with floats also indicate the presence of a third filament fed by the yermak branch the so called yermak pass branch that enters the arctic ocean through gaps in the yermak plateau gascard et al 1995 recently developed numerical models generally simulate a westward filament or filaments recirculating from the yermak branch southward as well as filaments across or around the yermak plateau that enter the arctic ocean e g aksenov et al 2010 kawasaki and hasumi 2016 hattermann et al 2016 wekerle et al 2017 koenig et al 2017 the name model simulates the split of the wsc into the svalbard and yermak branches figs 2a and 3a the simulated svalbard branch is a major contributor to the asc while the yermak branch mainly recirculates southward there is a contribution to the eastward flow from the yermak pass branch but no signature of an anticyclonic loop around the yermak plateau is found instead some aw from the slope current recirculates north of spitsbergen along the outskirts of a local cyclonic circuit around the sofia deep toward the yermak plateau fig 3a after circumventing the northern tip of the plateau this flow converges with a tongue of aw in the northward flowing yermak branch that does not recirculate farther south a pronounced gradient of the aw layer thickness along this tongue is a signature of enhanced mixing with ambient waters in this area the general circulation in the svalbard area simulated by the name model is consistent with the general circulation 2005 2010 mean obtained from the eddy resolving s800 regional model of the circulation in this area hattermann et al 2016 in both models the three major features of aw flow are the svalbard branch joining the wsc to the asc and two westward recirculations from the wsc one south and one north of about 79 n a difference is that the cyclonic loop on the southern rim of the northern recirculation in the s800 model is limited to the molloy deep area while in the name model the loop protrudes farther south probably because of unresolved topographic features or locally deficient atmospheric forcing as a result or cause of this protrusion in the name model the southern westward recirculation from the ridge branch of the wsc occurs at slightly lower latitudes than in the s800 and other high resolution models e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 3 3 2 recirculation rates the simulated wintertime total net volume transport in the wsc at about 79 n between points m and c in fig 3a is 4 3 sv with a contribution of 3 0 sv from the aw layer warmer than 2 c the corresponding net inflow to the arctic ocean between points n and d in fig 3a is 1 5 sv 1 2 sv in the aw layer whereas the corresponding net westward recirculation from the wsc north of about 79 n between points c and d in fig 3a amounts to 2 8 sv 1 6 sv in the aw layer therefore in winter the fraction f rec of the total flow in the wsc at about 79 n that recirculates westward in the northern fram strait amounts to 65 the corresponding fraction for the aw transport is 50 the same northern recirculation fractions 65 for the total recirculation and 50 in the aw layer are obtained for the annual mean flow the seasonal cycle of f rec for the northern recirculation of aw is shown in fig 4 this cycle exhibits a maximum 70 in april and a minimum 25 in october it is reminiscent of the seasonal cycle of the relative strength of the northern recirculation from the eddy resolving s800 model a maximum of 60 in late winter spring and a minimum of 30 in autumn based on the relative trajectory density distribution in the upper 1000 m of the ocean hattermann et al 2016 in the southern fram strait the wintertime net aw inflow aw volume transport across the sb section in fig 3a is 4 2 sv with a contribution of 1 4 sv from the western knipovich ridge branch aw volume transport west of the black vertical line in fig 3b the corresponding net westward recirculation of aw along the entire fram strait aw volume transport across the b c d section in fig 3a is 2 3 sv therefore in winter the fraction of aw inflowing to fram strait from the south that recirculates westward in the strait amounts to 55 for the annual mean circulation the corresponding recirculation fraction is 60 these estimates are close to the estimates of 50 for the aw recirculation in fram strait from high resolution models kawasaki and hasumi 2016 wekerle et al 2017 and from geostrophic computations applied to observed hydrographic fields e g marnela et al 2013 some aw is lost during its transit through fram strait via local water mass modifications the fraction of aw inflowing to the strait from the south that enters the arctic ocean attains in the name model approximately the same value 40 in winter and 35 for the annual mean data as in the high resolution coco model kawasaki and hasumi 2016 4 general features of interannual variability in the fram strait region 4 1 validation of variability in the wsc while validation of the simulated interannual variability is not possible in the asc it is possible at least partly in the slope current farther upstream in the wsc fig 5 a compares the simulated time series of the winter anomaly of the ssh difference δssh across the svalbard slope at about 79 n between the magenta crosses in fig 2a to its altimetry derived counterpart as the cross slope ssh gradient is a quantity proportional to the along slope component of the surface geostrophic velocity it is often used as a proxy for the volume transport in slope currents e g chafik et al 2015 over the common period the simulated wintertime variability of δssh across the svalbard slope fits well r 0 89 p 0 001 the corresponding observed variability however the simulated time series exhibits stronger variability than the observed time series by a factor of nearly two most likely because of an underestimation of the observed ssh gradients due to strong filtering of altimetric measurements the duacs mapping processing is indeed based on low passed filtered along track sea level anomalies with a cut off wavelength of 65 km in high latitudes and an optimal interpolation scheme with horizontal correlation scales of 100 150 km in high latitudes pujol et al 2016 a quality assessment of an earlier version of the duacs product in the nordic seas revealed that the altimetry derived velocity and its variability in the wsc are considerably smaller than their in situ observed drifter derived counterparts volkov and pujol 2012 similarly to the variations of the ssh gradient the simulated variations of the temperature in the wsc are in a good agreement with observations to illustrate this fig 5b compares the simulated time series of the summer temperature θ wsc s averaged between the 100 and 300 m depth levels on the svalbard slope in the southern fram strait within the magenta box in fig 2a to its observational equivalent the two time series correlate highly r 0 84 p 0 001 moreover the simulated and observed temperatures have approximately the same long term mean about 3 8 c and 3 7 c respectively and standard deviation about 0 4 c and 0 5 c respectively the simulated time series represents a regional pattern of summertime temperature anomalies as shown by the field of the jja mean subsurface temperature averaged over the 100 300 m layer in the barents sea fram strait region regressed onto θ wsc s fig 6 in this pattern significant anomalies encompassed by black contours in fig 6 extend along the pathways of aw through the barents sea and fram strait including the westward recirculation in the southern fram strait the pattern is similar to a pattern of observed composite summertime subsurface temperature anomalies in the barents sea fram strait region schlichtholz 2016 fig 1 therein since the variability of both the summertime temperature in the wsc and the wintertime ssh gradient across this current are well represented by the name simulation we assume that wintertime temperature variations in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean are reasonably simulated as well 4 2 variability of referenced and volumetrically balanced heat fluxes through fram strait while any choice of the reference temperature for calculation of the heat flux through unclosed oceanic sections is arbitrary this choice should be based on physical reasoning for instance the freezing point of seawater θ f 1 8 c used in some arctic studies e g maslowski et al 2012 kawasaki and hasumi 2016 is a base temperature for which estimates of the heat transport correspond to heat available for melting sea ice another reference temperature which has been widely used in arctic studies e g aagaard and greisman 1975 karcher et al 2003 maslowski et al 2004 schauer et al 2004 aksenov et al 2010 is the mean temperature of the outflow from the arctic ocean estimated by aagaard and greisman 1975 to be 0 1 c with this base temperature which is primarily determined by the southward flow through fram strait in the egc there should be no average oceanic heat output from the arctic ocean via outflows to the surrounding oceans it is however not certain how exact could be the estimate of the arctic ocean outflow temperature in the 1970s moreover this temperature could have risen over recent decades due to multidecadal variability of aw temperature in the arctic ocean polyakov et al 2004 in any case the simulated outflow in the egc occurs at somewhat higher temperatures fig 2b the climatological mean temperature of the outflow from the arctic ocean through all its openings fram strait northern and eastern openings of the barents sea the bering strait and the canadian arctic archipelago calculated from all 312 26 12 monthly averages of the simulated temperature and velocity fields in the 1979 2004 period is θ out ao 0 4 c to illustrate uncertainty on the magnitude of the referenced heat flux fig 7 a compares the time series of the winter mean total northward heat flux through fram strait at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a computed with two reference temperatures θ out ao blue curve and θ f red curve the mean value of q fs79n for θ f 103 tw exceeds the corresponding mean value for θ out ao 47 tw by a factor of about two similarly the standard deviation of q fs79n for θ f 22 tw is twice larger than the corresponding standard deviation for θ out ao 11 tw however as far as qualitative tendencies from one year to another are concerned the two time series carry nearly the same information correlate at 0 96 hereafter if not stated otherwise the heat fluxes are referenced to θ out ao while arbitrary the choice of θ out ao as the reference temperature for computation of heat fluxes in the fram strait region is reasonable this conclusion is supported by a close correspondence between three time series of the wintertime heat flux across the fs79n section shown in fig 7b the first time series blue curve is the volumetrically balanced heat flux q f s 79 n 0 given by its q w w 0 approximation based on the winter mean velocity and temperature data see section 2 4 3 the second time series red curve is the referenced total net heat flux across the section q fs79n computed as the winter average q w of the heat flux based on monthly mean velocity and temperature data q mm term in eq 3 the third time series green curve is the contribution q ww to q w from the winter mean circulation that is q ww ρ 0 c p a v w θ w θ ref da the fluxes q w and q ww are both referenced to θ out ao clearly differences between them are indistinguishable meaning that the covariance between the intraseasonal monthly mean in winter months minus winter mean velocity and temperature anomalies is negligible for the selected reference temperature the two time series of q fs79n correlate very highly r 0 98 with q w w 0 and have nearly the same magnitude as the latter 13 tw for q fs79n versus 14 5 tw for q w w 0 on the average these relations show not only that the reference temperature for the referenced heat fluxes is selected reasonably but also that the calculation of the volumetrically balance heat fluxes from the winter mean data instead of the monthly mean data cannot introduce large errors relations between the corresponding annual fluxes are similar the approximation q y y 0 of the annual mean q f s 79 n 0 correlates highly r 0 95 with the annual mean q fs79n and both fluxes have a comparable magnitude see table 1 for the annual statistics of q f s 79 n 0 q fs79n and q f s 79 n 4 3 basic statistics of variability in the northern fram strait area the strongest variability of the net heat flux through fram strait occurs in winter and autumn this is illustrated in fig 8 a which shows the standard deviation of the monthly means of the net heat flux q fs79n across the fs79n section at about 79 n and of the net heat flux q fs across the zonal section at 79 6 n running from the northwestern tip of spitsbergen to greenland fs section in fig 1 as a function of the calendar month given the proximity of these sections the two curves in fig 8a are nearly identical and show maximum values of 13 tw in january and october hereafter the variability of the net heat flux through fram strait will be analysed using the winter and annual means of q fs the variability of both means is relatively large the standard deviation of the winter means of q fs 8 tw amounts to 60 of their climatological average 13 tw and the standard deviation of the annual means of q fs 5 tw reaches 40 of their climatological average 12 tw as in the case of the fluxes across the fs79n section see fig 7b for their winter time series the net heat flux across the fs section correlates nearly perfectly r 0 99 in winter with the volumetrically balanced heat flux q fs 0 across this section to further explore the variability in the northern fram strait area table 2 gives basic wintertime statistics not only for the referenced and volumetrically balanced net heat fluxes across the fs section but also for the total net volume transport v wsc 79n in the wsc at about 79 n east of the black vertical line in fig 2b total net volume transport v rec n in the westward recirculation north of about 79 n between points c and d in fig 3a and net volume transport v asc in the slope current northeast of svalbard at 31 e v asc is the zonal transport across the as section magenta line in fig 3a integrated over the magenta box in fig 3c that covers the area from the barents sea shelf to the 2000 m isobath in addition to the long term average w and the standard deviation σ w of the winter means in the 1979 2004 period the selected statistics include the range δw of the wintertime variations defined as the difference between the maximum w max and minimum w min values these statistics show that in winter the relative flow variability as measured by the ratios σ w w and δw w for the volume transport is stronger in the asc than in the part of the wsc that recirculates in the northern fram strait the ratios σ w w and δw w for v asc are approximately the same σ w w 0 7 and δw w 3 0 as for the net heat flux through fram strait for v wsc 79n and v rec n these ratios are about twice smaller as shown later the volume flux in the asc and the net heat flux through fram strait not only exhibit a high and comparable level of relative variability but also are systematically related one to the other see section 5 4 the relatively weak wintertime variations of the westward recirculation from the wsc in the northern fram strait compared to the corresponding variations in the slope current entering the arctic ocean to a large extent reflect a different seasonal cycle of the interannual variability in these flows as shown in fig 8b the variability of v rec n is strong in spring and autumn and weak in summer blue curve while the strongest variability of v asc occurs in winter months red curve the strong wintertime variability of the slope current in the svalbard area may result from variations of the wind forcing over the barents sea shelf indeed these variations can induce considerable slope current anomalies through anomalous cross slope ekman transport lien et al 2013 and are particularly large in cold months e g lien et al 2017 5 covariability between volume transports heat fluxes and ssh gradients 5 1 relation of fluxes in the wsc and asc to variations of the cross slope ssh gradient how well variations of the ssh gradient approximate volume transport anomalies in a current depends on the vertical coherence of velocity anomalies this coherence is strong in the slope current along svalbard as illustrated in fig 9 the upper panel of this figure shows local correlation coefficients of the winter mean velocity across the zonal section in fram strait at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a with the concurrent ssh gradient δssh across the svalbard slope at the same section significant correlations are encompassed by black contours in the anomalous velocity core on the middle svalbard slope the correlations exceed 0 8 nearly throughout the water column the relation to the cross slope ssh gradient is even tighter r 0 94 p 0 0001 see fig 10 a for comparison of the time series for the net volume transport v wsc 79n aw integrated over the aw layer warmer than 2 c in the entire climatological wsc east of the black vertical line in fig 2b a remarkably tight relation of the slope current variability to variations of the cross slope ssh gradient is also found in the asc northeast of svalbard the lower panel of fig 9 displays local correlation coefficients of the winter mean velocity across the meridional section at 31 e as section in fig 3a with the concurrent ssh gradient across the continental slope at the same section between white crosses in fig 3a on the upper slope these correlations exceed 0 9 throughout the water column the relation to δssh is equally tight r 0 90 p 0 0001 see fig 10b for comparison of the time series for the net volume transport v asc integrated across the upper and middle slope over the layer of significant local correlations asc box in fig 9b not only the volume transports in the wsc and asc but also the heat fluxes in these currents covary with the cross slope ssh gradient this covariability is found to be very tight for both winter and annual mean fluxes using the raw time series as in fig 10 as well as the detrended time series this is exemplified in tables 3 and 4 table 3 reports correlation coefficients of δssh across the wsc with the net volume transport in the aw layer of this current as well as with the total northward volume inflow v fs79n and the associated heat flux q fs79n through the fs79n section for the annual mean data in brackets all these correlations fall in the range of 0 85 to 0 96 in winter they correspond to anomalous fluxes of 0 8 sv v wsc 79n aw 1 0 sv v fs79n and 10 tw q fs79n per 1 std of δssh for the annual mean data the corresponding flux anomalies are lower by 20 40 table 4 gives correlation coefficients of δssh across the asc with the net volume v asc and heat q asc transports in this current both computed over the asc box in fig 9b all these correlations fall in the range of 0 88 to 0 94 with the maximum value for the detrended winter anomalies of q asc the wintertime correlations in table 4 correspond to anomalous volume and heat fluxes of 0 6 sv and 5 tw per 1 std of δssh respectively for the annual mean data the corresponding flux anomalies are lower by 50 5 2 dependence of the heat flux in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean on flow and temperature anomalies the nearly equal magnitude of the correlations with the ssh gradient for the volume and heat fluxes in the wsc table 3 and asc table 4 reflects a strong dependence of the interannual heat flux variability in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean on flow anomalies in fram strait such a dependence has been previously suggested by results from high resolution kawasaki and hasumi 2016 as well as low resolution karcher et al 2003 models here the strong impact of flow anomalies on heat flux variability in the slope current along svalbard is quantified in table 5 giving correlation coefficients of the wintertime and annual mean net heat fluxes in the wsc and in the asc farther downstream q wsc and q asc with the corresponding volume transports v wsc and v asc and area averaged temperatures θ wsc and θ asc computed over the same area as the heat and volume fluxes the volume and heat fluxes in the asc positive eastward are the same as used in table 4 the volume and heat fluxes in the wsc positive northward are computed across the zonal section in the northern fram strait at 79 6 n fs section in fig 11 they are integrated over the magenta box in fig 12 a that extends from the spitsbergen coast to the 2200 m isobath of the svalbard slope and from the surface to the 1000 m depth table 5 also includes correlation coefficients of the total net heat flux q rec n positive westward in the westward recirculation from the wsc north of about 79 n between points c and d in fig 3a with the corresponding volume transport v rec n and area averaged temperature θ rec n as shown in table 5 the relation of the heat flux to the volume transport is particularly tight r 0 95 in the asc for both winter and annual mean anomalies the corresponding relation is also tight r 0 85 in the wsc and in the recirculation the relation of the heat flux changes to the area averaged temperature anomalies is not significant in any of these currents in contrast to the heat flux in the wsc changes of the net heat flux q fs through the entire fs section are decoupled not only from variations of average temperature at this section but also from variations of the corresponding net volume flux r 0 2 for both to assess the dependence of the total net heat flux through fram strait on flow and temperature anomalies let us decompose the interannual anomaly of the heat flux q either winter or annual mean from its climatological average as follows 4 q ρ 0 c p a v θ θ ref v θ v θ d a q v q θ q v θ where the prime and tilde denote the anomaly and the climatological average respectively in eq 4 the term q v a v θ θ ref d a represents the contribution to q from the transport of the climatological temperature field by anomalous currents the term q θ a v θ d a represents the contribution from the transport of temperature anomalies by the climatological currents and the term q v θ a v θ da is the nonlinear contribution from the velocity and temperature anomalies correlations of the total net heat flux through the fs section q fs and of the net heat flux through the same section in the aw layer warmer than 2 c q fs aw with the corresponding contributions from the terms on the right hand side of eq 4 are given in table 6 for the winter and annual mean data whether computed over the whole section or in the aw layer alone the heat flux to the arctic ocean through fram strait depends strongly r 0 75 0 88 on flow anomalies q v term it also depends significantly at the 95 level on temperature anomalies q θ term for the winter r 0 4 as well as annual r 0 6 mean data the dependence on temperature anomalies should reflect the effect of temperature anomalies propagating from the south such a scenario is indicated by significant albeit low lagged correlations of the summer temperature in the wsc at its entrance to fram strait blue curve in fig 5b with the average temperature in the wsc θ wsc at its exit from fram strait across the fs section r 0 44 and with the contribution q θ to the anomaly of the net heat flux in the wsc q wsc across this section r 0 43 in the following winter it is worth noting that the relative importance of flow and temperature anomalies for the anomalous heat flux through fram strait reported here is unlikely to be biased by our choice of the reference temperature which determines the magnitude of the q v term in eq 4 this conclusion is supported by the very tight relationship between the referenced and volumetrically balanced heat fluxes through the strait which for the selected θ ref not only strongly covary but also have nearly the same magnitude see fig 7b and tables 1 and 2 a larger uncertainty on the relative magnitude of the terms in eq 4 may be related to possibly different fidelity of the simulated mean and anomalous circulation 5 3 relation of the net heat flux through fram strait to flow anomalies in the wsc correlations between heat fluxes in different areas of the fram strait region are given in table 7 these correlations show first of all that the total net heat flux q fs across the fs section in the northern fram strait red line in fig 11 covaries very strongly r 0 95 for both winter and annual mean time series with the net heat flux integrated along the same section over the aw layer warmer than 2 c as the latter depends strongly on flow anomalies table 6 the variability of the heat import to the arctic ocean through fram strait is determined mainly by the anomalous transport of warm aw this dependence is further illustrated in figs 11 and 12 which show winter mean flow anomalies regressed onto the concurrent total net heat flux across the fs section fig 11 displays the anomaly pattern of the upper layer circulation velocity averaged from the surface to the 500 m depth on the background of the bottom topography in the fram strait region while fig 12 displays the anomaly pattern of the velocity across the fs section in fram strait and across the as section northeast of svalbard yellow line in fig 11 the direction or sign of the velocity anomalies in all these patterns corresponds to a positive northward anomaly of q fs and their magnitude represents values per 1 std of q fs in fig 11 only significant anomalies are plotted while in fig 12 significant anomalies are encompassed by black contours in the northern fram strait the main core of the wintertime flow anomalies northward for a strengthened heat flux to the arctic ocean and southward for a weakened heat flux to the arctic ocean is found on the middle svalbard slope fig 12a the core is equivalent barotropic that is it exhibits velocities that decrease with increasing depth to a relatively small but significant value at the bottom it is accompanied by a secondary core of significant same sign flow anomalies in the upper layer of the central deepest part of the section the flow anomalies of the opposite sign that are found on the east greenland slope and in the deep layer on the lower svalbard slope should reflect local contributions to the mass balance of the arctic ocean and the nordic seas the anomaly pattern in fig 12a shows that variations of the net heat flux to the arctic ocean through fram strait are extreme when upper layer velocity anomalies over the svalbard slope and farther offshore tend to be in phase consistent with such a relationship q fs correlates higher with the net heat flux in the aw layer integrated along the entire fs section than in the wsc on the svalbard slope alone table 7 in winter the upper layer core of northward velocity anomalies in the central part of the fs section associated with the increased heat flux through fram strait fig 12a represents a meander of an anomalous outer branch of the strengthened wsc fig 11 this anomalous branch turns eastward north of the fs section and after crossing the yermak plateau merges with the anomalous svalbard branch of the aw inflow to the arctic ocean that is fed by the anomalous wsc core on the middle svalbard slope fig 12b similarly the decreased heat flux through fram strait is associated with a simultaneous weakening of the flow toward the arctic ocean in the svalbard branch and across the yermak plateau see figs 2a and 3a for the wintertime climatological currents in the fram strait region anomalous recirculations in fram strait are typically decoupled from changes in the net heat flux through the strait a marginally significant q fs related recirculation anomaly occurs only in the molloy deep area south of the fs section fig 11 neither the net heat flux to the arctic ocean through the fs section nor the heat flux in the wsc at this section correlate significantly with the total net heat flux q rec in the recirculations across the b c d section in fig 3a table 7 in the northern fram strait the magnitude of the anomalous wintertime heat flux in the outer branch of the wsc is much 4 5 times smaller than the magnitude of the corresponding flux integrated over the upper layer of the svalbard branch to demonstrate this the blue curve in fig 13 shows regression coefficients of the winter mean net meridional heat flux integrated between the sea surface and the 500 m depth cumulated along the fs section westward from spitsbergen and regressed onto the total net heat flux through this section one std of q fs 8 tw is associated with a heat flux anomaly of 6 tw in the 0 500 m layer the anomalous svalbard and outer branches of the wsc contribute to the latter 4 5 and 1 tw respectively it is noteworthy that regression coefficients of the annual mean net meridional heat flux in the 0 500 m layer cumulated along the fs section and regressed onto the concurrent total net heat flux through this section show an anomaly of 4 tw per 1 std of q fs 5 tw over the svalbard slope and no substantial change of their magnitude beyond this slope see the red curve in fig 13 such a structure of heat flux anomalies corresponds to a single core of anomalous velocity in the wsc at 79 6 n as indicated in fig 13 by thickening of the curves over locations of significant anomalies of the meridional velocity averaged over the 0 500 m layer therefore the interannual variability of the circulation in the fram strait region has a seasonally varying component that manifests not only in the magnitude of the flow but also in details of its spatial structure 5 4 relation of the net heat flux through fram strait to flow anomalies in the asc events of enhanced heat flux through fram strait are associated with a significant intensification of the eastward flow in the asc fig 11 the anomalous current across the as section northeast of svalbard yellow line in fig 11 exhibits an equivalent barotropic core with wintertime velocity anomalies up to 3 cm s 1 per 1 std of q fs over the 1000 m isobath fig 12b the significant covariability of the flow in the asc with the heat import to the arctic ocean through the fs section reflects the strong dependence of the latter on local flow anomalies table 6 and a downstream coherence of flow anomalies in the slope current this coherence is strong as indicated by a close resemblance between the q fs related pattern of the wintertime upper layer current anomalies fig 11 and the pattern of these anomalies regressed onto the volume transport in the asc across the as section integrated over the magenta box in fig 12b the v asc related pattern is shown in fig 14 in winter v asc correlates with the volume transport v fs aw across the fs section in the aw layer warmer than 2 c at 0 91 see fig 15 a for comparison of the time series and with the net heat flux across this section at 0 89 see fig 15b for comparison of the time series since v asc strongly depends on the ssh gradient across the arctic slope table 4 there is also a strong covariability between this gradient and the net heat flux through fram strait with the wintertime correlation of 0 91 see fig 15c for comparison of the time series the strong link of the net heat flux through fram strait to the volume transport and ssh gradient in the asc is not a result of the reference temperature selected for the calculation of the heat flux since for the selected θ ref q fs covaries almost perfectly r 0 99 in winter and r 0 98 for the annual mean data with the volumetrically balanced heat flux q fs 0 through the same section table 7 as the heat flux changes in the asc tightly follow the corresponding changes in the volume transport table 5 q fs correlates also very highly with q asc at 0 92 for both winter and annual mean data in winter this correlation is even higher than the correlation of q fs with the heat flux in the wsc integrated over the magenta box in fig 12a table 7 the strong covariability of the heat fluxes across the fs section and in the asc is not inconsistent with the lack of covariability between the annual mean heat fluxes in the asc and the southern wsc current between spitsbergen and zero meridian in the southern fram strait reported by kawasaki and hasumi 2016 from the coco model the relation between the annual mean heat fluxes in these currents calculated using the same reference temperature 1 8 c as used by kawasaki and hasumi 2016 is also nonsignificant in the name model r 0 3 for the total net heat flux q sb across the sb section in fig 3a this relation becomes significant albeit weak r 0 5 for the reference temperature used in the present study table 7 as already suggested by kawasaki and hasumi 2016 the relatively weak covariability between the heat fluxes in the asc and the southern wsc must result from incoherent flow anomalies in the slope current and westward recirculating branches of the wsc indeed q asc is not significantly linked to the total net heat flux q rec across the b c d section in fig 3a either for the annual or winter mean fluxes table 7 the strong link between the heat flux through fram strait and flow anomalies in the asc is further illustrated in fig 16 showing correlations of q fs with the local cumulated volume flux v x due to the eastward flow across the as section upper panel and with the local depth averaged velocity v across this section lower panel in the case of v x the maximum correlation is found for the eastward flux cumulated northward from the barents sea shelf to the 2700 m isobath it exceeds 0 9 in winter fig 16a blue curve as well as for the annual mean fluxes fig 16a red curve consistent with the high vertical coherence of the velocity anomalies in the asc fig 9b q fs is also tightly related to the depth averaged velocity in this current the maximum correlation for the depth averaged velocity in the core of the anomalous flow reaches 0 85 in winter fig 16b blue curve as well as for the annual mean data fig 16b red curve the correlations in fig 16 suggest that it is possible to monitor the interannual variability of the heat flux to the arctic ocean through fram strait with high fidelity even with a single current meter mooring in the asc if regularly deployed at an appropriate location according to the name simulation such a fidelity cannot be achieved via current measurements in fram strait on the svalbard slope alone this is shown in table 8 giving the correlation coefficients of q fs with v r m a x v at the location of its maximum correlation with q fs v r m a x v at the location of its maximum correlation with q fs and δssh in the asc at 31 e and wsc at about 79 n in the wsc the correlations for v r m a x and v r m a x do not exceed 0 7 and the correlations for the ssh gradient calculated as in table 3 are lower than 0 8 6 summary and discussion the interannual variability of volume and heat fluxes in the fram strait region is examined using a pan arctic eddy permitting ice ocean circulation name model run for the period 1979 2004 the model simulates reasonably main features of the general circulation in this region such as the route of aw to the arctic ocean in the slope current and two southward recirculations from the wsc one south of 79 n and one north of 79 n while the strength of the mean circulation is lower in the name model than in higher resolution models and observations the partition of the simulated aw transport between the inflow to the arctic ocean and the southward recirculations is consistent with estimates from other studies in particular the seasonal cycle of the fraction of aw flow in the wsc at 79 n that recirculates southward obtained from the name model a maximum in spring and a minimum in autumn agrees well with the corresponding cycle reported by hattermann et al 2016 from an eddy resolving model the name model exhibits a realistic interannual variability in the wsc as demonstrated by comparison of the simulated time series of the wintertime anomalies of the ssh gradient across the svalbard slope at 79 n and of the summertime aw temperature on the svalbard slope at 76 5 n with observations the simulated interannual variability standard deviation of the volume transport in the asc northeast of svalbard at 31 e has a maximum during winter consistent with an earlier study kawasaki and hasumi 2016 variations of either winter or annual mean volume and heat fluxes in the asc are not significantly linked to the corresponding fluxes in the fram strait recirculations here the heat fluxes are referenced to the simulated climatological annual mean temperature of the outflow from the arctic ocean through all its openings 0 4 c with this reference temperature the net heat flux to the arctic ocean through the entire fram strait is very close regarding both magnitude and variability to the volumetrically balanced heat flux through the strait that does not depend on the reference temperature another remarkable feature of the simulated heat fluxes in the fram strait region already suggested by earlier modelling studies e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 is their strong covariability with flow anomalies according to the name model the volume transport anomalies explain 75 80 of the heat flux variance in the wsc at its exit to the arctic ocean at 79 6 n and more than 95 of the heat flux variance in the asc at 31 e a strong dependence of the simulated heat flux variations on flow anomalies is found not only in the pathway of aw along the continental slope but also for the variations of the net heat flux through the entire fram strait as demonstrated by chafik et al 2015 anomalies of the cross slope ssh gradient are good proxies for the volume transport variability over the continental slope in the norwegian atlantic current according to the name model anomalies of the cross slope ssh gradient are also good proxies for the volume transport variability over the svalbard slope in the wsc at 79 n such anomalies account for about 90 of the variance of the volume transport in the aw layer warmer than 2 c for both winter and annual mean data since the heat flux in the slope current along svalbard strongly covaries with the corresponding volume transport variations of the ssh gradient across the wsc also explain a large fraction about 80 of the variance of the heat flux associated with the northward flow through fram strait variations of the ssh gradient across the asc at 31 e explain about 80 of the variance of the volume flux in this current and account for about 85 of the variance of the corresponding heat flux as variations of the net heat flux through fram strait strongly depend on local flow anomalies and the latter covary with flow anomalies in the asc variations of the net heat flux through fram strait are also coupled to flow anomalies in the asc variations of the eastward volume transport in this current at 31 e explain about 85 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait at 79 6 n for both winter and annual mean data this finding may have implications for future in situ observing systems suppose that the currents in fram strait and the flow in the asc are monitored using the same limited number of instruments in this case the variability of the heat import to the arctic ocean through fram strait will be captured more accurately by the instruments on the narrow continental slope northeast of svalbard than by the instruments in the wide fram strait where numerous topographic irregularities favour flow meandering splitting and recirculations in the extreme case of current measurements with only a single current meter mooring up to about 75 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait at 79 6 n could be captured by continuous measurements in the asc core at 31 e not more than 40 of this variance could be captured by continuous measurements in the wsc core at 79 n since flow anomalies in the asc strongly depend on variations of the ssh gradient across this current also the net heat flux through fram strait covaries with this gradient anomalies of the ssh gradient across the asc at 31 e account for about 80 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait at 79 6 n for both winter and annual mean data this relation indicates that monitoring of the ssh gradient across the asc could provide useful proxies not only for the local heat flux but also for the total heat import to the arctic ocean through fram strait while variations of the ssh gradient across the wsc can be monitored by inspecting the ssh anomaly field that is routinely derived from satellite altimetric measurements variations of the ssh gradient across the asc cannot be retrieved from the altimetric data since these data do not provide estimates of the ssh anomaly field in the ice covered areas e g volkov and pujol 2012 pujol et al 2016 the variability of the ssh gradient in the asc could be monitored by for instance in situ measurements with a cross slope line of pressure sensor equipped inverted echo sounders pies installed on the ocean bottom e g baker yeboah et al 2009 such measurements would allow for recording ssh variations resulting from both mass changes of the water column via measurements of the ocean bottom pressure and steric changes within this column due to temperature and salinity variations via measurements of the round trip acoustic travel time the contribution to changes of the ssh gradient across the asc due to local adjustments of the mass field can also be estimated using measurements of ocean bottom pressure anomalies from the satellite mission gravity recovery and climate experiment grace these measurements are not hampered by the presence of sea ice on the ocean surface and have provided a global coverage of ocean bottom pressure changes since 2002 e g fukumori et al 2015 using gradients of the ocean bottom pressure anomalies from grace as proxies for interannual variations of the heat flux to the arctic ocean is promising since the velocity anomalies in the asc core simulated by the name model are highly coherent in the vertical moreover several studies analysing the grace data in conjunction with altimetric ssh data and ocean models have shown that the monthly to interannual ssh variability in the arctic ocean nordic seas region is largely mass related due to a strong barotropic ocean response to wind forcing e g peralta ferriz et al 2014 volkov 2014 fukumori et al 2015 a key question to be answered in future studies is whether the effective spatial resolution of the grace data about 300 km is sufficient to capture the flow anomalies in the asc that covary with the anomalous heat flux through fram strait another question is whether this covariability is as strong in eddy resolving models as in the eddy permitting model analysed here acknowledgements basic support for this work was provided by internal funds

24036,oceanic fluxes through fram strait may significantly contribute to climate variations in the arctic however their observations are difficult here a 26 year numerical model simulation is used to derive oceanic proxies for interannual variability in heat fluxes through fram strait it is found that variability in the cross slope gradient of sea surface height ssh across the west spitsbergen current wsc can explain about 90 of the variance of winter and annual mean volume transports of atlantic water at 79 n given the strong covariance between the simulated heat flux in the slope current along svalbard and the corresponding volume transport variability of the ssh gradient across the wsc is also found to account for about 80 of the variance of heat flux associated with the northward flow through fram strait moreover variations in the ssh gradient across the arctic slope current asc northeast of svalbard at 31 e explain about 85 of the variance of heat flux there and about 80 of the variance of the net heat flux upstream through fram strait finally about 85 and 75 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait is associated with anomalies of the eastward volume transport and depth averaged core velocity in the asc respectively these relations indicate that monitoring of the flow in the asc even with a single current meter mooring or of the ssh gradient across this current derived from either in situ or remote measurements may provide useful proxies for the heat import to the arctic ocean keywords heat flux atlantic water fram strait interannual

warming e g screen and simmonds 2010 there is also growing evidence for a recent sea ice loss caused by enhanced wintertime upward heat flux from the aw layer occurring not only north and northeast of svalbard onarheim et al 2014 ivanov et al 2016 but also farther downstream polyakov et al 2017 as anomalous heat exchanges through fram strait may play a prominent role in variations of the arctic climate it is crucial to monitor these exchanges however their estimation from in situ observations is challenging since fram strait is the broadest 500 km wide deepest sill depth at 2500 m and partly ice covered passage to the arctic ocean inflows and outflows in boundary currents along steep continental slopes on the eastern and western sides of the passage often split and recirculate in several branches because of ubiquitous meandering and eddying caused by irregular topography ridges fracture zones deeps troughs plateaus gaps and a relatively small internal rossby radius of deformation e g gascard et al 1988 wekerle et al 2017 the latter determines the horizontal scale of mesoscale eddies in fram strait due to the high latitude and a weak stratification the internal deformation radius reaches a value of 3 6 km von appen et al 2016 which is smaller by an order of magnitude compared to its value in mid latitudes chelton et al 1998 since 1997 volume and heat exchanges through fram strait have been monitored continuously via year round velocity and temperature measurements with an array of moored instruments maintained along a zonal section at about 79 n by the alfred wegener institute awi and the norwegian polar institute npi e g fahrbach et al 2001 schauer et al 2004 beszczynska möller et al 2012 de steur et al 2014 up to 2012 an array of 14 16 moorings covered an about 300 km wide area with an average horizontal resolution of about 20 km beszczynska möller et al 2015 therefore the array could not adequately resolve the variable flow through the section moreover the heat transport through a single section along which the inflows and outflows are not in mass balance as it is the case of all arctic ocean openings cannot be determined unambiguously due to an arbitrary choice of the reference temperature e g schauer and beszczynska möller 2009 based on these arguments there is presently a tendency to reduce the costly array of moorings in fram strait rather than to refine it indeed while moorings in the boundary currents on both sides of the strait are still operated moorings in the central part of the strait are not maintained any longer ursula schauer awi personal communication in the light of the recent atlantification of the eurasian basin of the arctic ocean polyakov et al 2017 and because of uncertainties on the fate of heat injected to this basin by the wsc pathways recirculations and interactions with the sea ice and atmosphere in the northern fram strait there is a growing interest in monitoring oceanic variability in the boundary current downstream of the wsc year long measurements of the velocity temperature and salinity were successfully conducted in the asc northeast of svalbard at 31 e in 2004 2005 e g ivanov et al 2009 regular current and hydrographic observations in this area started in 2012 våge et al 2016 pérez hernández et al 2017 renner et al 2018 evidently existing observational data are not sufficient for investigation of interannual covariability of the volume and heat fluxes through fram strait with the corresponding fluxes in the asc northeast of svalbard this covariability can however be studied using numerical ice ocean models although the uncertainty on heat fluxes due to the choice of the reference temperature remains and models also have their limitations related for instance to insufficient resolution uncertainty on the atmospheric forcing and parameterizations employed results from a high resolution 2 3 km in the fram strait area global ice ocean circulation coco model suggest that anomalies of the heat transport in the asc northeast of svalbard are not related to anomalies of the heat transport in the wsc at its entrance to fram strait kawasaki and hasumi 2016 here we report results from another numerical simulation showing a strong interannual covariability of volume and heat fluxes in the northern fram strait with those in the asc we also show that gradients of the sea surface height ssh across the wsc and asc may be good proxies not only for volume and heat fluxes in these currents but also for the net heat flux through fram strait the study is based on a monthly mean output from the naval postgraduate school arctic modeling effort name regional coupled ice ocean model run for the period 1979 2004 maslowski et al 2012 2004 the model has a horizontal grid spacing of about 9 km so that it is not eddy resolving but eddy permitting in the fram strait region previously the name model was used for investigations of climatological mass heat and salt

arctic ocean the canadian archipelago the nordic barents and labrador seas as well as the sub arctic regions of the north pacific and north atlantic see fig 1 in maslowski et al 2004 or http www oc nps edu name name html for the full domain the ocean component of the name model is a regional adaptation of the los alamos national laboratory lanl parallel ocean program pop model with a free surface formulation dukowicz and smith 1994 it integrates the primitive equations in the hydrostatic and bousinessq approximations using a finite difference scheme laplacian diffusivity and viscosity in the vertical and biharmonic in the horizontal were used the model was configured on a 1 12 9 km horizontal grid in rotated spherical coordinates in the vertical it has 45 fixed depth layers with the thickness ranging from 5 m near the surface to 200 300 m in deep waters to balance net mass exchanges between the arctic ocean and north pacific an artificial channel was created through north america connecting the north pacific to the north atlantic model bathymetry was derived from the 2 5 km resolution international bathymetric chart of the arctic ocean jakobsson et al 2000 for regions north of 64 n and from etopo5 at 5 min resolution for regions south of 64 n the ocean component was coupled to a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model with a viscous plastic rheology zhang and hibler iii 1997 and zero layer approximation for heat conduction through the ice semtner 1976 the surface heat budget was calculated following parkinson and washington 1979 the hindcast for the period 1979 2004 was forced with daily atmospheric data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 15 reanalysis to 1993 and operational data afterwards the forcing fields included wind velocity components at 10 m surface pressure temperature and dew point and shortwave and longwave radiation the spin up was initialized using temperature and salinity fields from the university of washington polar science center hydrographic climatology 1 0 phc steele et al 2001 the monthly and annual mean phc fields were also used to restore the temperature and salinity at the surface and lateral boundaries respectively more details on the model setup and run can be found in the study by maslowski et al 2004 here we use the monthly mean fields of the horizontal velocity vector u potential temperature θ and ssh from the name model to investigate interannual variability of volume and heat fluxes in the fram strait region the salinity s and potential density σ θ calculated from θ and s are used for illustration of some climatological features only 2 2 statistical methods the covariability between simulated currents and fluxes is studied using a linear regression analysis applied if not stated otherwise to linearly detrended time series of winter january february march jfm and annual august to july mean variables the statistical significance p value of the correlation r between the time series is assessed using a two tailed t test to account for the serial correlation the test is carried out with an effective sample size estimated using eq 31 from the study by bretherton et al 1999 the 95 confidence level is used as a threshold for significant correlations 2 3 validation data to assess the reliability of flow variations in the wsc the time series of the simulated cross slope difference of ssh δssh over the svalbard slope at about 79 n between the 200 and 2000 m isobaths marked by magenta crosses in fig 2 a are compared to the corresponding observational time series to this end the dt2014 monthly mean data of the sea level anomaly with a 0 25 cartesian resolution derived from multi mission satellite altimetry by duacs pujol et al 2016 and provided by aviso http www aviso altimetry fr are used these data are available since 1993 but have missing values in the winter of 1994 so that they are compared to the model output from the period 1993 1995 2004 to assess the reliability of temperature variations in the wsc a time series t obs representing observed summer aw temperature in the atlantic water core on the upper continental slope off the southern tip of spitsbergen at about 76 5 n magenta square in fig 2a for the 1979 2004 period is constructed using quality controlled temperature records gathered in the june july august jja season the summer season is selected since only for that season reliable time series can be constructed due to the availability of hydrographic profiles the hydrographic data are obtained from four sources the oceanographic database of the international council for the exploration of the sea ices 2017 world ocean database 2013 wod13 of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa u s boyer et al 2013 barents and kara seas oceanographic data base of the arctic climate system study acsys project office golubev et al 1999 and arex database of the institute of oceanology sopot poland the latter database compiles records from cruises of r v oceania to the arctic in the jja season since the beginning of the 1990s e g piechura et al 2001 schlichtholz and goszczko 2006 walczowski and piechura 2007 walczowski 2014 since the collected temperature profiles have a highly irregular distribution in both space and time any observed time series derived from these profiles has a large uncertainty here the time series of t obs are constructed using two methods one estimate of t obs is the temperature t avg averaged in each summer over the 100 300 m layer between the 300 and 700 m isobaths and between 75 and 78 n a box along the 500 m isobath marked by a thick white line in fig 2a the averaging method is the same as employed by schlichtholz and houssais 2011 to construct a time series of aw temperature in the barents sea opening the second estimate of t obs is for each summer the median t med of the same vertically averaged temperature data in the 100 300 m layer as used to compute t avg the time series of the two estimates of t obs are very consistent r 0 92 as the simulated temperature in the wsc correlates slightly higher with t med than t avg only t med is used later in this paper 2 4 flux calculations 2 4 1 general definitions the volume transport v and the heat flux q across a selected area a of a given oceanic section are calculated as follows 1 v a v d a and q ρ 0 c p a v θ θ ref d a where v is the cross sectional component of the current velocity ρ 0 is a constant reference density of seawater 1027 kg m 3 c p is the specific heat at constant pressure for seawater 4000 j kg c 1 and θ ref is a reference temperature calculations of v and q are made either for entire oceanic sections or specific currents crossing these sections in addition the local cumulated volume flux v x is calculated as follows 2 v x x 0 x v h d x where v is the cross sectional component of the depth averaged velocity u i e velocity averaged from the ocean bottom depth at z h to the ocean surface at z 0 and x is the along sectional coordinate the net volume flux is split into the inflow v and outflow v based on the sign of the cross sectional flow and the corresponding heat fluxes q and q are calculated since the flux q in eq 1 depends on an arbitrary choice of θ ref it is only a proxy for the heat transport for this reason it is sometimes referred to as quasi heat transport e g aksenov et al 2010 enthalpy transport e g schauer et al 2004 or temperature flux e g marnela et al 2013 here it is referred to as referenced heat flux or to be short heat flux the choice of the reference temperature is made in section 4 2 2 4 2 inherent uncertainties since the fluxes in eq 1 are calculated using monthly mean velocity and temperature data uncertainty on the computed heat flux arises due to the omitted eddy contribution to illustrate this uncertainty let us decompose the instantaneous cross sectional velocity v i and temperature θ i into the monthly mean values denoted by the subscript m and anomalies from these values denoted by the subscript a that is v i v m v a and θ i θ m θ a with this decomposition the monthly mean heat flux q m can be written as 3 q m ρ 0 c p a v m θ m θ ref d a ρ 0 c p a v a θ a m d a q m m q a a the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 q mm a v m θ m θ ref da represents the contribution to the mean heat flux from mean currents the second term q aa a v a θ a m da represents the eddy contribution resulting from the covariance of temperature and velocity anomalies as this covariance was not stored in the model output we approximate the monthly mean heat flux by its q mm component the winter and annual mean heat fluxes are obtained by averaging of q mm an exception is the volumetrically balanced heat flux introduced in the next section since q mm in eq 3 depends on the reference temperature while q aa does not the relative importance of the omitted eddy contribution depends on the reference temperature based on the high resolution coco model kawasaki and hasumi 2016 estimated the relative contribution of the submonthly eddies to the monthly average heat flux across the prime meridian in fram strait to be 5 this estimate was obtained with the freezing point of seawater as the reference temperature and therefore would be larger if a higher reference temperature was used in the present case the relative magnitude of the resolved but omitted eddy heat flux is probably smaller than in the coco model since the name model has a lower horizontal resolution by a factor of 3 4 in fram strait on the other hand a large uncertainty on heat and volume fluxes arises because of non resolved eddy motions which directly contribute to the heat flux and impact the mean circulation through eddy mean flow interactions compared to their lower resolution versions the eddy resolving models such as the global fesom model with the locally refined horizontal resolution of 1 km in the fram strait area wekerle et al 2017 show increased levels of eddy kinetic energy strengthened mean circulation and closer to observations thermal structure in fram strait both the fesom model and a high 800 m resolution regional s800 model of the circulation in the svalbard area hattermann et al 2016 indicate that eddy driven recirculation of aw in fram strait modifies the amount of heat that reaches the arctic ocean at least on the seasonal timescale here we assume that flux estimates derived from the monthly mean name output are despite their various limitations accurate enough to highlight real and important interannual relations between volume and heat transports in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean through fram strait 2 4 3 volumetrically balanced heat flux since any reference temperature is arbitrary an attempt is also made to construct a volumetrically balanced heat flux q 0 for sections across fram strait this flux is defined as the net heat flux integrated between spitsbergen and the location in the egc where the cumulated net volume transport v x vanishes at this location the contribution to q from ρ 0 c p a vθ ref da v in eq 1 also vanishes so that q 0 does not depend on θ ref this method of flux computation is a version of the stream tube method employed by schauer and beszczynska möller 2009 to observations at about 79 n to avoid uncertainties in the volume transport resulting from poorly sampled deep water flow in the observations their computations were made for an aw layer with a boundary defined by the 1 c isotherm and locally modified in the egc to meet the criterion of no net volume flux here we calculate q 0 for the whole water column instead of the aw layer assuming that all water entering the arctic ocean in the wsc makes loops within this ocean to eventually exit through fram strait one may consider the loops stream tubes as a closed volume and q 0 as the heat flux convergence within this volume a prerequisite for computation of q 0 is that the southward volume transport in the egc exceeds the northward volume transport in the wsc this condition is fulfilled for the simulated seasonal and annual means of the inflow and outflow through fram strait in each year however the intermonthly variability is relatively large and the location where the cumulated net volume transport through the strait vanishes cannot be found for a couple of months to circumvent this problem the winter mean q 0 is approximated by q w w 0 ρ 0 c p a 0 v w θ w d a 0 where v w and θ w are the winter mean velocity and temperature respectively and a 0 is the area over which the winter mean volume transport vanishes similarly the annual mean q 0 is approximated by q y y 0 ρ 0 c p a 0 v y θ y d a 0 where v y and θ y are the annual mean velocity and temperature respectively uncertainty on these approximations is discussed in section 4 2 3 simulated climatology in the fram strait region 3 1 general remarks to demonstrate that the name model simulates major hydrographic and flow features in the fram strait area quite well figs 1 3 display horizontal and vertical distributions of selected climatological 1979 2004 mean variables for the winter season fig 1 shows the potential temperature averaged over a subsurface layer from 50 m to 500 m or the bottom if shallower in the entire nordic barents seas region it underscores a pronounced temperature gradient along the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean resulting from a large heat loss to the atmosphere in the cold season e g simonsen and haugan 1996 and to cold ambient waters e g van aken and budéus 1995 it also illustrates the already mentioned bifurcations of the aw flow the general circulation in the fram strait region is shown explicitly in fig 2a displaying vectors of the total volume transport per unit width of the water column i e velocity integrated vertically from the ocean bottom to the ocean surface u h on the background of the bottom topography in that region the corresponding transport in the warm aw layer defined after schlichtholz and houssais 2002 as the layer occupied by water warmer than 2 c is shown in fig 3a arrows on the background of selected isobaths blue contours and the thickness d aw of the aw layer itself colours in the svalbard area the largest values of d aw 800 m that appear in the slope current all along svalbard fig 3a are approximately the same as the corresponding values based on the same temperature criterion for the aw definition obtained from the eddy resolving fesom model run for the period 2001 2009 wekerle et al 2017 fig 4 therein the main difference is over the boreas basin in the northern greenland sea where the fesom model does not exhibit wintertime temperatures above 2 c while the name model simulates a 400 500 m thick layer with such temperatures observations show that in the boreas basin this layer may not be thicker than 100 m even in summer e g schlichtholz and houssais 1999 the name model may also overestimate the aw layer thickness in the northern fram strait in this area the simulated values of d aw exceed 600 m in a southward recirculation fig 3a while observations in the 2000s e g beszczynska möller et al 2012 as well as the fesom model wekerle et al 2017 indicate that the layer with temperatures above 2 c is not thicker than 400 m in the recirculating current at about 79 n to fully illustrate the flow and hydrographic structure across fram strait fig 2b displays the distribution of the cross sectional velocity black and magenta contours and potential temperature colours along a zonal section at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a while fig 2c displays the corresponding distribution of the salinity colours and potential density black contours at the fs79n section the maximum temperature about 3 0 c and maximum salinity about 35 05 are found in the aw core on the upper svalvard slope at the 100 300 m depth over the 650 m isobath this core is carried northward by a mostly barotropic depth independent flow with the meridional velocity reaching 12 cm s 1 the dense σ θ 28 0 kg m 3 cold and salty water found east of the aw core and the baroclinic bottom intensified flow with the northward velocity exceeding 15 cm s 1 along the 350 m isobath are signatures of haline convection due to wintertime ice formation on the svalbard shelf the bottom intensification of the wsc at the shelf break may be a real feature as indicated by a 2 year 1997 1999 mean data from the current meter measurements at about 79 n fahrbach et al 2001 fig 4 therein the simulated maximum mean velocity in the wsc at this latitude fig 2b is somewhat lower than the corresponding velocity maximum above 20 cm s 1 in higher resolution models e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 wekerle et al 2017 and observations in the 2000s e g beszczynska möller et al 2012 wekerle et al 2017 consistent with observations e g schlichtholz and houssais 1999 fahrbach et al 2001 the warm and salty mode of aw recirculating southward towards the egc is pinched off from the surface by a wedge of cold θ 0 c fresh s 34 5 and light σ θ 27 6 kg m 3 surface polar water fig 2 the simulated main branch of the egc exhibits a baroclinic double core structure in the vertical with a surface intensified flow and a southward velocity maximum of 9 cm s 1 at intermediate 1000 m depths over the lower 2200 m isobath east greenland slope fig 2b such a double core structure of the egc was also simulated by the high resolution coco model run for the period 1993 2010 kawasaki and hasumi 2016 fig 4 therein the intermediate depth core was however not reported from current meter observations at about 79 n on the other hand the mooring array across the egc had no intermediate depth instrument just over the lower slope de steur et al 2014 the current meter data averaged over the period 2002 2008 show a secondary core in the egc at the bottom beszczynska möller et al 2012 de steur et al 2014 it is therefore uncertain how realistic is the simulated structure of the egc in the central deepest part of the fs79n section the simulated mean velocity is southward fig 2b while the mean velocity at about 79 n in observations e g beszczynska möller et al 2012 and high resolution models e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 wekerle et al 2017 show filaments of opposite sign resulting from meandering of the westward recirculating water the structure of the slope current in the svalbard area downstream and upstream of the fs79n section is illustrated in figs 3b and 3c they display the distribution of the cross sectional velocity and potential temperature in the wsc at its entrance to fram strait along the sb section in fig 3a and in the asc northeast of svalbard along the as section in fig 3a respectively the sb section is a zonal section at 76 5 n running from the southern tip of spitsbergen to the location in the boreas basin where the climatological depth averaged meridional velocity changes sign point b in fig 3a the as section is a meridional section northeast of svalbard at 31 e running from the northern barents sea shelf to the nansen basin of the arctic ocean the slope current at the sb section fig 3b has a similar structure to that of the wsc at the fs79n section fig 2b and will be further discussed later at the as section the aw layer appears as a warm fig 3c colours and salty not shown subsurface wedge hanging on the shelf break the simulated temperature maximum about 3 05 c in winter and 2 9 c in the annual climatology is found over the upper slope at the 200 m depth its value is close to the intermediate depth maximum of about 3 05 c in the vertical profile of a 2 year 2004 2006 mean temperature obtained from three moored instruments deployed in the same area over the 1000 m isobath at the about 70 215 and 990 m depths ivanov et al 2009 a 1 year 2004 2005 mean velocity profile from these instruments also exhibits an intermediate depth maximum pnyushkov et al 2015 such a maximum is also found in the simulated eastward flow across the as section at the 100 150 m depth over the 1000 m isobath fig 3c contours however the simulated maximum 5 cm s 1 in winter and 3 5 cm s 1 in the annual climatology is much lower than the maximum velocity of 20 cm s 1 found in the annual mean current speed profile in 2004 2005 e g pnyushkov et al 2015 as well as in summertime current snapshot observations in this area in 2012 våge et al 2016 and 2013 pérez hernández et al 2017 indicating that the simulated flow might be too weak also in the asc in the name model the climatological annual mean aw volume transport across the as section amounts to 1 0 sv 1 sv 106 m3 s 1 which is lower by 40 than the corresponding 9 year 2001 2009 mean transport of 1 6 sv obtained from the high resolution fesom model wekerle et al 2017 3 2 volume and heat exchanges through fram strait to further explore and validate the results from the name model table 1 gives annual statistics for selected variables in fram strait at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a in addition to heat fluxes discussed later the selected variables include the total surface to bottom net volume transport in the wsc v wsc 79n the corresponding transport in the aw layer warmer than 2 c v wsc 79n aw and the average potential temperature in this layer θ wsc 79n aw as well as the total northward inflow v fs79n and net volume transport v fs79n through the section the transport resp temperature in the wsc is cumulated resp averaged from spitsbergen to the location at the svalbard slope base where the climatological depth averaged meridional velocity changes sign marked by a black vertical line in fig 2b in addition to the average y of all annual means and their standard deviation std σ y in the 1979 2004 period the statistics in table 1 include the minimum m min and maximum m max of the mean seasonal cycle with the months of extremes given in parenthesis the simulated annual mean net volume transport in the wsc v wsc 79n in table 1 amounts to 3 9 sv it is lower by 40 than the corresponding observed transport of 6 6 sv in the period 1997 2010 beszczynska möller et al 2012 on the other hand the simulated annual mean net volume transport in the aw layer of the wsc v wsc 79n aw in table 1 is nearly as large 2 7 sv as the corresponding observed transport of 3 0 sv beszczynska möller et al 2012 the larger relative difference between the simulated and observed transports for the entire wsc than its aw layer should reflect differences in the aw layer thickness smaller in the observations and in the vertical structure of the flow more barotropic in the observations on the middle lower slope the simulated mean seasonal cycle of the net volume transport in the wsc both total and in the aw layer and of the total inflow from the south v fs79n in table 1 exhibits a maximum in march and a minimum from july to october similar timing of extremes a wintertime maximum and a summertime minimum is found in the seasonal cycle of the observed volume transport in the wsc beszczynska möller et al 2012 similarly a maximum in october and a minimum in april found in the simulated mean seasonal cycle of the aw temperature in the wsc θ wsc 79n aw in table 1 are consistent with the autumn and spring extremes in the corresponding observed cycle beszczynska möller et al 2012 von appen et al 2016 the estimates of the net volume transport through fram strait v fs79n in table 1 are valid for any section between spitsbergen and greenland because of mass conservation the annual mean value of v fs79n 2 2 sv is equal to the corresponding value from a global ice ocean circulation model having approximately the same resolution in the area of interest and run for approximately the same 1989 2004 period as the name model but forced with different atmospheric data aksenov et al 2010 both estimates are slightly lower by 20 than the corresponding estimates of 2 8 2 9 sv from the high resolution coco kawasaki and hasumi 2016 and fesom wekerle et al 2017 models they fall however into the range of estimates of the net volume transport through fram strait based on observations that is between a 9 year 1997 2006 mean of 2 0 sv from current meter measurements schauer et al 2008 and a mean of 3 1 sv from geostrophic computations using summertime hydrographic snapshots marnela et al 2013 as already noted there is no unique choice of the reference temperature for calculation of the heat flux through arbitrary oceanic sections for comparison s sake the referenced heat fluxes are first computed using θ ref 0 1 c see section 4 2 for a discussion of heat fluxes computed using other reference temperatures with θ ref 0 1 c the simulated annual means of the total heat flux through the fs79n section associated with the northward flow across this section q fs79n at the end of the 1990s reach 50 tw 1 tw 1012 j s 1 which is on the upper side of the range of the corresponding estimates 32 55 tw based on observations in the same period schauer et al 2004 the simulated annual means of the total net heat flux across the same section q fs79n at the end of the 1990s 15 tw are however at the lower limit of the corresponding observational estimates 16 41 tw since the observed exchanges through fram strait in the 1990s are not reliable because of a sparse instrumental coverage of the deep part of the strait e g schauer and beszczynska möller 2009 the observed net heat flux through the strait may be overestimated however it is also likely that the name model underestimates this flux because of for instance a too thick aw layer in the simulated southward recirculation see the previous section 3 3 recirculations in fram strait 3 3 1 southern and northern branches hydrographic and current observations reveal that the northward flow through the nordic seas towards fram strait occurs in two topographically guided branches e g orvik and niiler 2002 walczowski and piechura 2007 an eastern primarily barotropic branch follows the upper continental slope west of norway in the south and west of southern svalbard in the north a western primarily baroclinic surface intensified branch meanders along mid ocean ridges in fram strait it partly recirculates westward and partly converges with the slope branch due to the junction of the knipovich ridge with the svalbard continental slope such a current structure is also simulated by the name model at the sb section in the southern fram strait cyan line in fig 3a the slope current carries the warm aw core northward over the upper slope with the wintertime meridional velocity reaching 10 cm s 1 fig 3b the ridge current appears mainly as a broad surface intensified core on the western side of the knipovich ridge with the wintertime meridional velocity of up to 5 cm s 1 this western knipovich ridge branch recirculates westward and then southward mainly south of 79 n along the rim of the boreas basin figs 2a and 3a a secondary baroclinic core crossing the sb section on the eastern side of the knipovich ridge fig 3b merges farther downstream with the slope core figs 2a and 3a and is not distinguishable in the meridional flow across the section at about 79 n fig 2b north of 79 n the wsc is known to split over diverging isobaths at the junction of the yermak plateau with the spitsbergen shelf into the so called svalbard branch that turns east along shallower isobaths and the so called yermak branch that continues northward along the western slope of the yermak plateau e g manley 1995 cokelet et al 2008 the fate of aw from the yermak branch is uncertain hydrographic data indicate that it either circumvents the yermak plateau before entering the arctic ocean e g perkin and lewis 1984 rudels et al 2000 or recirculates southward in the northern fram strait e g quadfasel et al 1987 bourke et al 1988 lagrangian observations with floats also indicate the presence of a third filament fed by the yermak branch the so called yermak pass branch that enters the arctic ocean through gaps in the yermak plateau gascard et al 1995 recently developed numerical models generally simulate a westward filament or filaments recirculating from the yermak branch southward as well as filaments across or around the yermak plateau that enter the arctic ocean e g aksenov et al 2010 kawasaki and hasumi 2016 hattermann et al 2016 wekerle et al 2017 koenig et al 2017 the name model simulates the split of the wsc into the svalbard and yermak branches figs 2a and 3a the simulated svalbard branch is a major contributor to the asc while the yermak branch mainly recirculates southward there is a contribution to the eastward flow from the yermak pass branch but no signature of an anticyclonic loop around the yermak plateau is found instead some aw from the slope current recirculates north of spitsbergen along the outskirts of a local cyclonic circuit around the sofia deep toward the yermak plateau fig 3a after circumventing the northern tip of the plateau this flow converges with a tongue of aw in the northward flowing yermak branch that does not recirculate farther south a pronounced gradient of the aw layer thickness along this tongue is a signature of enhanced mixing with ambient waters in this area the general circulation in the svalbard area simulated by the name model is consistent with the general circulation 2005 2010 mean obtained from the eddy resolving s800 regional model of the circulation in this area hattermann et al 2016 in both models the three major features of aw flow are the svalbard branch joining the wsc to the asc and two westward recirculations from the wsc one south and one north of about 79 n a difference is that the cyclonic loop on the southern rim of the northern recirculation in the s800 model is limited to the molloy deep area while in the name model the loop protrudes farther south probably because of unresolved topographic features or locally deficient atmospheric forcing as a result or cause of this protrusion in the name model the southern westward recirculation from the ridge branch of the wsc occurs at slightly lower latitudes than in the s800 and other high resolution models e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 3 3 2 recirculation rates the simulated wintertime total net volume transport in the wsc at about 79 n between points m and c in fig 3a is 4 3 sv with a contribution of 3 0 sv from the aw layer warmer than 2 c the corresponding net inflow to the arctic ocean between points n and d in fig 3a is 1 5 sv 1 2 sv in the aw layer whereas the corresponding net westward recirculation from the wsc north of about 79 n between points c and d in fig 3a amounts to 2 8 sv 1 6 sv in the aw layer therefore in winter the fraction f rec of the total flow in the wsc at about 79 n that recirculates westward in the northern fram strait amounts to 65 the corresponding fraction for the aw transport is 50 the same northern recirculation fractions 65 for the total recirculation and 50 in the aw layer are obtained for the annual mean flow the seasonal cycle of f rec for the northern recirculation of aw is shown in fig 4 this cycle exhibits a maximum 70 in april and a minimum 25 in october it is reminiscent of the seasonal cycle of the relative strength of the northern recirculation from the eddy resolving s800 model a maximum of 60 in late winter spring and a minimum of 30 in autumn based on the relative trajectory density distribution in the upper 1000 m of the ocean hattermann et al 2016 in the southern fram strait the wintertime net aw inflow aw volume transport across the sb section in fig 3a is 4 2 sv with a contribution of 1 4 sv from the western knipovich ridge branch aw volume transport west of the black vertical line in fig 3b the corresponding net westward recirculation of aw along the entire fram strait aw volume transport across the b c d section in fig 3a is 2 3 sv therefore in winter the fraction of aw inflowing to fram strait from the south that recirculates westward in the strait amounts to 55 for the annual mean circulation the corresponding recirculation fraction is 60 these estimates are close to the estimates of 50 for the aw recirculation in fram strait from high resolution models kawasaki and hasumi 2016 wekerle et al 2017 and from geostrophic computations applied to observed hydrographic fields e g marnela et al 2013 some aw is lost during its transit through fram strait via local water mass modifications the fraction of aw inflowing to the strait from the south that enters the arctic ocean attains in the name model approximately the same value 40 in winter and 35 for the annual mean data as in the high resolution coco model kawasaki and hasumi 2016 4 general features of interannual variability in the fram strait region 4 1 validation of variability in the wsc while validation of the simulated interannual variability is not possible in the asc it is possible at least partly in the slope current farther upstream in the wsc fig 5 a compares the simulated time series of the winter anomaly of the ssh difference δssh across the svalbard slope at about 79 n between the magenta crosses in fig 2a to its altimetry derived counterpart as the cross slope ssh gradient is a quantity proportional to the along slope component of the surface geostrophic velocity it is often used as a proxy for the volume transport in slope currents e g chafik et al 2015 over the common period the simulated wintertime variability of δssh across the svalbard slope fits well r 0 89 p 0 001 the corresponding observed variability however the simulated time series exhibits stronger variability than the observed time series by a factor of nearly two most likely because of an underestimation of the observed ssh gradients due to strong filtering of altimetric measurements the duacs mapping processing is indeed based on low passed filtered along track sea level anomalies with a cut off wavelength of 65 km in high latitudes and an optimal interpolation scheme with horizontal correlation scales of 100 150 km in high latitudes pujol et al 2016 a quality assessment of an earlier version of the duacs product in the nordic seas revealed that the altimetry derived velocity and its variability in the wsc are considerably smaller than their in situ observed drifter derived counterparts volkov and pujol 2012 similarly to the variations of the ssh gradient the simulated variations of the temperature in the wsc are in a good agreement with observations to illustrate this fig 5b compares the simulated time series of the summer temperature θ wsc s averaged between the 100 and 300 m depth levels on the svalbard slope in the southern fram strait within the magenta box in fig 2a to its observational equivalent the two time series correlate highly r 0 84 p 0 001 moreover the simulated and observed temperatures have approximately the same long term mean about 3 8 c and 3 7 c respectively and standard deviation about 0 4 c and 0 5 c respectively the simulated time series represents a regional pattern of summertime temperature anomalies as shown by the field of the jja mean subsurface temperature averaged over the 100 300 m layer in the barents sea fram strait region regressed onto θ wsc s fig 6 in this pattern significant anomalies encompassed by black contours in fig 6 extend along the pathways of aw through the barents sea and fram strait including the westward recirculation in the southern fram strait the pattern is similar to a pattern of observed composite summertime subsurface temperature anomalies in the barents sea fram strait region schlichtholz 2016 fig 1 therein since the variability of both the summertime temperature in the wsc and the wintertime ssh gradient across this current are well represented by the name simulation we assume that wintertime temperature variations in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean are reasonably simulated as well 4 2 variability of referenced and volumetrically balanced heat fluxes through fram strait while any choice of the reference temperature for calculation of the heat flux through unclosed oceanic sections is arbitrary this choice should be based on physical reasoning for instance the freezing point of seawater θ f 1 8 c used in some arctic studies e g maslowski et al 2012 kawasaki and hasumi 2016 is a base temperature for which estimates of the heat transport correspond to heat available for melting sea ice another reference temperature which has been widely used in arctic studies e g aagaard and greisman 1975 karcher et al 2003 maslowski et al 2004 schauer et al 2004 aksenov et al 2010 is the mean temperature of the outflow from the arctic ocean estimated by aagaard and greisman 1975 to be 0 1 c with this base temperature which is primarily determined by the southward flow through fram strait in the egc there should be no average oceanic heat output from the arctic ocean via outflows to the surrounding oceans it is however not certain how exact could be the estimate of the arctic ocean outflow temperature in the 1970s moreover this temperature could have risen over recent decades due to multidecadal variability of aw temperature in the arctic ocean polyakov et al 2004 in any case the simulated outflow in the egc occurs at somewhat higher temperatures fig 2b the climatological mean temperature of the outflow from the arctic ocean through all its openings fram strait northern and eastern openings of the barents sea the bering strait and the canadian arctic archipelago calculated from all 312 26 12 monthly averages of the simulated temperature and velocity fields in the 1979 2004 period is θ out ao 0 4 c to illustrate uncertainty on the magnitude of the referenced heat flux fig 7 a compares the time series of the winter mean total northward heat flux through fram strait at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a computed with two reference temperatures θ out ao blue curve and θ f red curve the mean value of q fs79n for θ f 103 tw exceeds the corresponding mean value for θ out ao 47 tw by a factor of about two similarly the standard deviation of q fs79n for θ f 22 tw is twice larger than the corresponding standard deviation for θ out ao 11 tw however as far as qualitative tendencies from one year to another are concerned the two time series carry nearly the same information correlate at 0 96 hereafter if not stated otherwise the heat fluxes are referenced to θ out ao while arbitrary the choice of θ out ao as the reference temperature for computation of heat fluxes in the fram strait region is reasonable this conclusion is supported by a close correspondence between three time series of the wintertime heat flux across the fs79n section shown in fig 7b the first time series blue curve is the volumetrically balanced heat flux q f s 79 n 0 given by its q w w 0 approximation based on the winter mean velocity and temperature data see section 2 4 3 the second time series red curve is the referenced total net heat flux across the section q fs79n computed as the winter average q w of the heat flux based on monthly mean velocity and temperature data q mm term in eq 3 the third time series green curve is the contribution q ww to q w from the winter mean circulation that is q ww ρ 0 c p a v w θ w θ ref da the fluxes q w and q ww are both referenced to θ out ao clearly differences between them are indistinguishable meaning that the covariance between the intraseasonal monthly mean in winter months minus winter mean velocity and temperature anomalies is negligible for the selected reference temperature the two time series of q fs79n correlate very highly r 0 98 with q w w 0 and have nearly the same magnitude as the latter 13 tw for q fs79n versus 14 5 tw for q w w 0 on the average these relations show not only that the reference temperature for the referenced heat fluxes is selected reasonably but also that the calculation of the volumetrically balance heat fluxes from the winter mean data instead of the monthly mean data cannot introduce large errors relations between the corresponding annual fluxes are similar the approximation q y y 0 of the annual mean q f s 79 n 0 correlates highly r 0 95 with the annual mean q fs79n and both fluxes have a comparable magnitude see table 1 for the annual statistics of q f s 79 n 0 q fs79n and q f s 79 n 4 3 basic statistics of variability in the northern fram strait area the strongest variability of the net heat flux through fram strait occurs in winter and autumn this is illustrated in fig 8 a which shows the standard deviation of the monthly means of the net heat flux q fs79n across the fs79n section at about 79 n and of the net heat flux q fs across the zonal section at 79 6 n running from the northwestern tip of spitsbergen to greenland fs section in fig 1 as a function of the calendar month given the proximity of these sections the two curves in fig 8a are nearly identical and show maximum values of 13 tw in january and october hereafter the variability of the net heat flux through fram strait will be analysed using the winter and annual means of q fs the variability of both means is relatively large the standard deviation of the winter means of q fs 8 tw amounts to 60 of their climatological average 13 tw and the standard deviation of the annual means of q fs 5 tw reaches 40 of their climatological average 12 tw as in the case of the fluxes across the fs79n section see fig 7b for their winter time series the net heat flux across the fs section correlates nearly perfectly r 0 99 in winter with the volumetrically balanced heat flux q fs 0 across this section to further explore the variability in the northern fram strait area table 2 gives basic wintertime statistics not only for the referenced and volumetrically balanced net heat fluxes across the fs section but also for the total net volume transport v wsc 79n in the wsc at about 79 n east of the black vertical line in fig 2b total net volume transport v rec n in the westward recirculation north of about 79 n between points c and d in fig 3a and net volume transport v asc in the slope current northeast of svalbard at 31 e v asc is the zonal transport across the as section magenta line in fig 3a integrated over the magenta box in fig 3c that covers the area from the barents sea shelf to the 2000 m isobath in addition to the long term average w and the standard deviation σ w of the winter means in the 1979 2004 period the selected statistics include the range δw of the wintertime variations defined as the difference between the maximum w max and minimum w min values these statistics show that in winter the relative flow variability as measured by the ratios σ w w and δw w for the volume transport is stronger in the asc than in the part of the wsc that recirculates in the northern fram strait the ratios σ w w and δw w for v asc are approximately the same σ w w 0 7 and δw w 3 0 as for the net heat flux through fram strait for v wsc 79n and v rec n these ratios are about twice smaller as shown later the volume flux in the asc and the net heat flux through fram strait not only exhibit a high and comparable level of relative variability but also are systematically related one to the other see section 5 4 the relatively weak wintertime variations of the westward recirculation from the wsc in the northern fram strait compared to the corresponding variations in the slope current entering the arctic ocean to a large extent reflect a different seasonal cycle of the interannual variability in these flows as shown in fig 8b the variability of v rec n is strong in spring and autumn and weak in summer blue curve while the strongest variability of v asc occurs in winter months red curve the strong wintertime variability of the slope current in the svalbard area may result from variations of the wind forcing over the barents sea shelf indeed these variations can induce considerable slope current anomalies through anomalous cross slope ekman transport lien et al 2013 and are particularly large in cold months e g lien et al 2017 5 covariability between volume transports heat fluxes and ssh gradients 5 1 relation of fluxes in the wsc and asc to variations of the cross slope ssh gradient how well variations of the ssh gradient approximate volume transport anomalies in a current depends on the vertical coherence of velocity anomalies this coherence is strong in the slope current along svalbard as illustrated in fig 9 the upper panel of this figure shows local correlation coefficients of the winter mean velocity across the zonal section in fram strait at about 79 n fs79n section in fig 2a with the concurrent ssh gradient δssh across the svalbard slope at the same section significant correlations are encompassed by black contours in the anomalous velocity core on the middle svalbard slope the correlations exceed 0 8 nearly throughout the water column the relation to the cross slope ssh gradient is even tighter r 0 94 p 0 0001 see fig 10 a for comparison of the time series for the net volume transport v wsc 79n aw integrated over the aw layer warmer than 2 c in the entire climatological wsc east of the black vertical line in fig 2b a remarkably tight relation of the slope current variability to variations of the cross slope ssh gradient is also found in the asc northeast of svalbard the lower panel of fig 9 displays local correlation coefficients of the winter mean velocity across the meridional section at 31 e as section in fig 3a with the concurrent ssh gradient across the continental slope at the same section between white crosses in fig 3a on the upper slope these correlations exceed 0 9 throughout the water column the relation to δssh is equally tight r 0 90 p 0 0001 see fig 10b for comparison of the time series for the net volume transport v asc integrated across the upper and middle slope over the layer of significant local correlations asc box in fig 9b not only the volume transports in the wsc and asc but also the heat fluxes in these currents covary with the cross slope ssh gradient this covariability is found to be very tight for both winter and annual mean fluxes using the raw time series as in fig 10 as well as the detrended time series this is exemplified in tables 3 and 4 table 3 reports correlation coefficients of δssh across the wsc with the net volume transport in the aw layer of this current as well as with the total northward volume inflow v fs79n and the associated heat flux q fs79n through the fs79n section for the annual mean data in brackets all these correlations fall in the range of 0 85 to 0 96 in winter they correspond to anomalous fluxes of 0 8 sv v wsc 79n aw 1 0 sv v fs79n and 10 tw q fs79n per 1 std of δssh for the annual mean data the corresponding flux anomalies are lower by 20 40 table 4 gives correlation coefficients of δssh across the asc with the net volume v asc and heat q asc transports in this current both computed over the asc box in fig 9b all these correlations fall in the range of 0 88 to 0 94 with the maximum value for the detrended winter anomalies of q asc the wintertime correlations in table 4 correspond to anomalous volume and heat fluxes of 0 6 sv and 5 tw per 1 std of δssh respectively for the annual mean data the corresponding flux anomalies are lower by 50 5 2 dependence of the heat flux in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean on flow and temperature anomalies the nearly equal magnitude of the correlations with the ssh gradient for the volume and heat fluxes in the wsc table 3 and asc table 4 reflects a strong dependence of the interannual heat flux variability in the pathways of aw to the arctic ocean on flow anomalies in fram strait such a dependence has been previously suggested by results from high resolution kawasaki and hasumi 2016 as well as low resolution karcher et al 2003 models here the strong impact of flow anomalies on heat flux variability in the slope current along svalbard is quantified in table 5 giving correlation coefficients of the wintertime and annual mean net heat fluxes in the wsc and in the asc farther downstream q wsc and q asc with the corresponding volume transports v wsc and v asc and area averaged temperatures θ wsc and θ asc computed over the same area as the heat and volume fluxes the volume and heat fluxes in the asc positive eastward are the same as used in table 4 the volume and heat fluxes in the wsc positive northward are computed across the zonal section in the northern fram strait at 79 6 n fs section in fig 11 they are integrated over the magenta box in fig 12 a that extends from the spitsbergen coast to the 2200 m isobath of the svalbard slope and from the surface to the 1000 m depth table 5 also includes correlation coefficients of the total net heat flux q rec n positive westward in the westward recirculation from the wsc north of about 79 n between points c and d in fig 3a with the corresponding volume transport v rec n and area averaged temperature θ rec n as shown in table 5 the relation of the heat flux to the volume transport is particularly tight r 0 95 in the asc for both winter and annual mean anomalies the corresponding relation is also tight r 0 85 in the wsc and in the recirculation the relation of the heat flux changes to the area averaged temperature anomalies is not significant in any of these currents in contrast to the heat flux in the wsc changes of the net heat flux q fs through the entire fs section are decoupled not only from variations of average temperature at this section but also from variations of the corresponding net volume flux r 0 2 for both to assess the dependence of the total net heat flux through fram strait on flow and temperature anomalies let us decompose the interannual anomaly of the heat flux q either winter or annual mean from its climatological average as follows 4 q ρ 0 c p a v θ θ ref v θ v θ d a q v q θ q v θ where the prime and tilde denote the anomaly and the climatological average respectively in eq 4 the term q v a v θ θ ref d a represents the contribution to q from the transport of the climatological temperature field by anomalous currents the term q θ a v θ d a represents the contribution from the transport of temperature anomalies by the climatological currents and the term q v θ a v θ da is the nonlinear contribution from the velocity and temperature anomalies correlations of the total net heat flux through the fs section q fs and of the net heat flux through the same section in the aw layer warmer than 2 c q fs aw with the corresponding contributions from the terms on the right hand side of eq 4 are given in table 6 for the winter and annual mean data whether computed over the whole section or in the aw layer alone the heat flux to the arctic ocean through fram strait depends strongly r 0 75 0 88 on flow anomalies q v term it also depends significantly at the 95 level on temperature anomalies q θ term for the winter r 0 4 as well as annual r 0 6 mean data the dependence on temperature anomalies should reflect the effect of temperature anomalies propagating from the south such a scenario is indicated by significant albeit low lagged correlations of the summer temperature in the wsc at its entrance to fram strait blue curve in fig 5b with the average temperature in the wsc θ wsc at its exit from fram strait across the fs section r 0 44 and with the contribution q θ to the anomaly of the net heat flux in the wsc q wsc across this section r 0 43 in the following winter it is worth noting that the relative importance of flow and temperature anomalies for the anomalous heat flux through fram strait reported here is unlikely to be biased by our choice of the reference temperature which determines the magnitude of the q v term in eq 4 this conclusion is supported by the very tight relationship between the referenced and volumetrically balanced heat fluxes through the strait which for the selected θ ref not only strongly covary but also have nearly the same magnitude see fig 7b and tables 1 and 2 a larger uncertainty on the relative magnitude of the terms in eq 4 may be related to possibly different fidelity of the simulated mean and anomalous circulation 5 3 relation of the net heat flux through fram strait to flow anomalies in the wsc correlations between heat fluxes in different areas of the fram strait region are given in table 7 these correlations show first of all that the total net heat flux q fs across the fs section in the northern fram strait red line in fig 11 covaries very strongly r 0 95 for both winter and annual mean time series with the net heat flux integrated along the same section over the aw layer warmer than 2 c as the latter depends strongly on flow anomalies table 6 the variability of the heat import to the arctic ocean through fram strait is determined mainly by the anomalous transport of warm aw this dependence is further illustrated in figs 11 and 12 which show winter mean flow anomalies regressed onto the concurrent total net heat flux across the fs section fig 11 displays the anomaly pattern of the upper layer circulation velocity averaged from the surface to the 500 m depth on the background of the bottom topography in the fram strait region while fig 12 displays the anomaly pattern of the velocity across the fs section in fram strait and across the as section northeast of svalbard yellow line in fig 11 the direction or sign of the velocity anomalies in all these patterns corresponds to a positive northward anomaly of q fs and their magnitude represents values per 1 std of q fs in fig 11 only significant anomalies are plotted while in fig 12 significant anomalies are encompassed by black contours in the northern fram strait the main core of the wintertime flow anomalies northward for a strengthened heat flux to the arctic ocean and southward for a weakened heat flux to the arctic ocean is found on the middle svalbard slope fig 12a the core is equivalent barotropic that is it exhibits velocities that decrease with increasing depth to a relatively small but significant value at the bottom it is accompanied by a secondary core of significant same sign flow anomalies in the upper layer of the central deepest part of the section the flow anomalies of the opposite sign that are found on the east greenland slope and in the deep layer on the lower svalbard slope should reflect local contributions to the mass balance of the arctic ocean and the nordic seas the anomaly pattern in fig 12a shows that variations of the net heat flux to the arctic ocean through fram strait are extreme when upper layer velocity anomalies over the svalbard slope and farther offshore tend to be in phase consistent with such a relationship q fs correlates higher with the net heat flux in the aw layer integrated along the entire fs section than in the wsc on the svalbard slope alone table 7 in winter the upper layer core of northward velocity anomalies in the central part of the fs section associated with the increased heat flux through fram strait fig 12a represents a meander of an anomalous outer branch of the strengthened wsc fig 11 this anomalous branch turns eastward north of the fs section and after crossing the yermak plateau merges with the anomalous svalbard branch of the aw inflow to the arctic ocean that is fed by the anomalous wsc core on the middle svalbard slope fig 12b similarly the decreased heat flux through fram strait is associated with a simultaneous weakening of the flow toward the arctic ocean in the svalbard branch and across the yermak plateau see figs 2a and 3a for the wintertime climatological currents in the fram strait region anomalous recirculations in fram strait are typically decoupled from changes in the net heat flux through the strait a marginally significant q fs related recirculation anomaly occurs only in the molloy deep area south of the fs section fig 11 neither the net heat flux to the arctic ocean through the fs section nor the heat flux in the wsc at this section correlate significantly with the total net heat flux q rec in the recirculations across the b c d section in fig 3a table 7 in the northern fram strait the magnitude of the anomalous wintertime heat flux in the outer branch of the wsc is much 4 5 times smaller than the magnitude of the corresponding flux integrated over the upper layer of the svalbard branch to demonstrate this the blue curve in fig 13 shows regression coefficients of the winter mean net meridional heat flux integrated between the sea surface and the 500 m depth cumulated along the fs section westward from spitsbergen and regressed onto the total net heat flux through this section one std of q fs 8 tw is associated with a heat flux anomaly of 6 tw in the 0 500 m layer the anomalous svalbard and outer branches of the wsc contribute to the latter 4 5 and 1 tw respectively it is noteworthy that regression coefficients of the annual mean net meridional heat flux in the 0 500 m layer cumulated along the fs section and regressed onto the concurrent total net heat flux through this section show an anomaly of 4 tw per 1 std of q fs 5 tw over the svalbard slope and no substantial change of their magnitude beyond this slope see the red curve in fig 13 such a structure of heat flux anomalies corresponds to a single core of anomalous velocity in the wsc at 79 6 n as indicated in fig 13 by thickening of the curves over locations of significant anomalies of the meridional velocity averaged over the 0 500 m layer therefore the interannual variability of the circulation in the fram strait region has a seasonally varying component that manifests not only in the magnitude of the flow but also in details of its spatial structure 5 4 relation of the net heat flux through fram strait to flow anomalies in the asc events of enhanced heat flux through fram strait are associated with a significant intensification of the eastward flow in the asc fig 11 the anomalous current across the as section northeast of svalbard yellow line in fig 11 exhibits an equivalent barotropic core with wintertime velocity anomalies up to 3 cm s 1 per 1 std of q fs over the 1000 m isobath fig 12b the significant covariability of the flow in the asc with the heat import to the arctic ocean through the fs section reflects the strong dependence of the latter on local flow anomalies table 6 and a downstream coherence of flow anomalies in the slope current this coherence is strong as indicated by a close resemblance between the q fs related pattern of the wintertime upper layer current anomalies fig 11 and the pattern of these anomalies regressed onto the volume transport in the asc across the as section integrated over the magenta box in fig 12b the v asc related pattern is shown in fig 14 in winter v asc correlates with the volume transport v fs aw across the fs section in the aw layer warmer than 2 c at 0 91 see fig 15 a for comparison of the time series and with the net heat flux across this section at 0 89 see fig 15b for comparison of the time series since v asc strongly depends on the ssh gradient across the arctic slope table 4 there is also a strong covariability between this gradient and the net heat flux through fram strait with the wintertime correlation of 0 91 see fig 15c for comparison of the time series the strong link of the net heat flux through fram strait to the volume transport and ssh gradient in the asc is not a result of the reference temperature selected for the calculation of the heat flux since for the selected θ ref q fs covaries almost perfectly r 0 99 in winter and r 0 98 for the annual mean data with the volumetrically balanced heat flux q fs 0 through the same section table 7 as the heat flux changes in the asc tightly follow the corresponding changes in the volume transport table 5 q fs correlates also very highly with q asc at 0 92 for both winter and annual mean data in winter this correlation is even higher than the correlation of q fs with the heat flux in the wsc integrated over the magenta box in fig 12a table 7 the strong covariability of the heat fluxes across the fs section and in the asc is not inconsistent with the lack of covariability between the annual mean heat fluxes in the asc and the southern wsc current between spitsbergen and zero meridian in the southern fram strait reported by kawasaki and hasumi 2016 from the coco model the relation between the annual mean heat fluxes in these currents calculated using the same reference temperature 1 8 c as used by kawasaki and hasumi 2016 is also nonsignificant in the name model r 0 3 for the total net heat flux q sb across the sb section in fig 3a this relation becomes significant albeit weak r 0 5 for the reference temperature used in the present study table 7 as already suggested by kawasaki and hasumi 2016 the relatively weak covariability between the heat fluxes in the asc and the southern wsc must result from incoherent flow anomalies in the slope current and westward recirculating branches of the wsc indeed q asc is not significantly linked to the total net heat flux q rec across the b c d section in fig 3a either for the annual or winter mean fluxes table 7 the strong link between the heat flux through fram strait and flow anomalies in the asc is further illustrated in fig 16 showing correlations of q fs with the local cumulated volume flux v x due to the eastward flow across the as section upper panel and with the local depth averaged velocity v across this section lower panel in the case of v x the maximum correlation is found for the eastward flux cumulated northward from the barents sea shelf to the 2700 m isobath it exceeds 0 9 in winter fig 16a blue curve as well as for the annual mean fluxes fig 16a red curve consistent with the high vertical coherence of the velocity anomalies in the asc fig 9b q fs is also tightly related to the depth averaged velocity in this current the maximum correlation for the depth averaged velocity in the core of the anomalous flow reaches 0 85 in winter fig 16b blue curve as well as for the annual mean data fig 16b red curve the correlations in fig 16 suggest that it is possible to monitor the interannual variability of the heat flux to the arctic ocean through fram strait with high fidelity even with a single current meter mooring in the asc if regularly deployed at an appropriate location according to the name simulation such a fidelity cannot be achieved via current measurements in fram strait on the svalbard slope alone this is shown in table 8 giving the correlation coefficients of q fs with v r m a x v at the location of its maximum correlation with q fs v r m a x v at the location of its maximum correlation with q fs and δssh in the asc at 31 e and wsc at about 79 n in the wsc the correlations for v r m a x and v r m a x do not exceed 0 7 and the correlations for the ssh gradient calculated as in table 3 are lower than 0 8 6 summary and discussion the interannual variability of volume and heat fluxes in the fram strait region is examined using a pan arctic eddy permitting ice ocean circulation name model run for the period 1979 2004 the model simulates reasonably main features of the general circulation in this region such as the route of aw to the arctic ocean in the slope current and two southward recirculations from the wsc one south of 79 n and one north of 79 n while the strength of the mean circulation is lower in the name model than in higher resolution models and observations the partition of the simulated aw transport between the inflow to the arctic ocean and the southward recirculations is consistent with estimates from other studies in particular the seasonal cycle of the fraction of aw flow in the wsc at 79 n that recirculates southward obtained from the name model a maximum in spring and a minimum in autumn agrees well with the corresponding cycle reported by hattermann et al 2016 from an eddy resolving model the name model exhibits a realistic interannual variability in the wsc as demonstrated by comparison of the simulated time series of the wintertime anomalies of the ssh gradient across the svalbard slope at 79 n and of the summertime aw temperature on the svalbard slope at 76 5 n with observations the simulated interannual variability standard deviation of the volume transport in the asc northeast of svalbard at 31 e has a maximum during winter consistent with an earlier study kawasaki and hasumi 2016 variations of either winter or annual mean volume and heat fluxes in the asc are not significantly linked to the corresponding fluxes in the fram strait recirculations here the heat fluxes are referenced to the simulated climatological annual mean temperature of the outflow from the arctic ocean through all its openings 0 4 c with this reference temperature the net heat flux to the arctic ocean through the entire fram strait is very close regarding both magnitude and variability to the volumetrically balanced heat flux through the strait that does not depend on the reference temperature another remarkable feature of the simulated heat fluxes in the fram strait region already suggested by earlier modelling studies e g kawasaki and hasumi 2016 is their strong covariability with flow anomalies according to the name model the volume transport anomalies explain 75 80 of the heat flux variance in the wsc at its exit to the arctic ocean at 79 6 n and more than 95 of the heat flux variance in the asc at 31 e a strong dependence of the simulated heat flux variations on flow anomalies is found not only in the pathway of aw along the continental slope but also for the variations of the net heat flux through the entire fram strait as demonstrated by chafik et al 2015 anomalies of the cross slope ssh gradient are good proxies for the volume transport variability over the continental slope in the norwegian atlantic current according to the name model anomalies of the cross slope ssh gradient are also good proxies for the volume transport variability over the svalbard slope in the wsc at 79 n such anomalies account for about 90 of the variance of the volume transport in the aw layer warmer than 2 c for both winter and annual mean data since the heat flux in the slope current along svalbard strongly covaries with the corresponding volume transport variations of the ssh gradient across the wsc also explain a large fraction about 80 of the variance of the heat flux associated with the northward flow through fram strait variations of the ssh gradient across the asc at 31 e explain about 80 of the variance of the volume flux in this current and account for about 85 of the variance of the corresponding heat flux as variations of the net heat flux through fram strait strongly depend on local flow anomalies and the latter covary with flow anomalies in the asc variations of the net heat flux through fram strait are also coupled to flow anomalies in the asc variations of the eastward volume transport in this current at 31 e explain about 85 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait at 79 6 n for both winter and annual mean data this finding may have implications for future in situ observing systems suppose that the currents in fram strait and the flow in the asc are monitored using the same limited number of instruments in this case the variability of the heat import to the arctic ocean through fram strait will be captured more accurately by the instruments on the narrow continental slope northeast of svalbard than by the instruments in the wide fram strait where numerous topographic irregularities favour flow meandering splitting and recirculations in the extreme case of current measurements with only a single current meter mooring up to about 75 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait at 79 6 n could be captured by continuous measurements in the asc core at 31 e not more than 40 of this variance could be captured by continuous measurements in the wsc core at 79 n since flow anomalies in the asc strongly depend on variations of the ssh gradient across this current also the net heat flux through fram strait covaries with this gradient anomalies of the ssh gradient across the asc at 31 e account for about 80 of the variance of the net heat flux through fram strait at 79 6 n for both winter and annual mean data this relation indicates that monitoring of the ssh gradient across the asc could provide useful proxies not only for the local heat flux but also for the total heat import to the arctic ocean through fram strait while variations of the ssh gradient across the wsc can be monitored by inspecting the ssh anomaly field that is routinely derived from satellite altimetric measurements variations of the ssh gradient across the asc cannot be retrieved from the altimetric data since these data do not provide estimates of the ssh anomaly field in the ice covered areas e g volkov and pujol 2012 pujol et al 2016 the variability of the ssh gradient in the asc could be monitored by for instance in situ measurements with a cross slope line of pressure sensor equipped inverted echo sounders pies installed on the ocean bottom e g baker yeboah et al 2009 such measurements would allow for recording ssh variations resulting from both mass changes of the water column via measurements of the ocean bottom pressure and steric changes within this column due to temperature and salinity variations via measurements of the round trip acoustic travel time the contribution to changes of the ssh gradient across the asc due to local adjustments of the mass field can also be estimated using measurements of ocean bottom pressure anomalies from the satellite mission gravity recovery and climate experiment grace these measurements are not hampered by the presence of sea ice on the ocean surface and have provided a global coverage of ocean bottom pressure changes since 2002 e g fukumori et al 2015 using gradients of the ocean bottom pressure anomalies from grace as proxies for interannual variations of the heat flux to the arctic ocean is promising since the velocity anomalies in the asc core simulated by the name model are highly coherent in the vertical moreover several studies analysing the grace data in conjunction with altimetric ssh data and ocean models have shown that the monthly to interannual ssh variability in the arctic ocean nordic seas region is largely mass related due to a strong barotropic ocean response to wind forcing e g peralta ferriz et al 2014 volkov 2014 fukumori et al 2015 a key question to be answered in future studies is whether the effective spatial resolution of the grace data about 300 km is sufficient to capture the flow anomalies in the asc that covary with the anomalous heat flux through fram strait another question is whether this covariability is as strong in eddy resolving models as in the eddy permitting model analysed here acknowledgements basic support for this work was provided by internal funds

24037,a large eddy simulation les model is applied to study convective instability processes driven by hydrothermal exhalations the process of convective mixing induced by a bottom heating source is examined in a stratified and rotating frame the control case of numerical experiment is configured with the horizontal and vertical resolution 5 m located at 35 s its results show that the three dimensional structure of the hydrothermal plume displays an umbrella shape a strong clockwise vortex above the vent is present and the axis of the vortex is tilted with organized precession a series of numerical experiments are conducted to test the sensitivity of three characteristic parameters eddy viscosity k maximum plume rise height z max and the intensity of the vortex i vortex to three variables heat flux from the vent hf rotation rate f and background stratification n based on the sensitivity experiments parameterizations of eddy viscosity and maximum plume rise height with respect to hf f and n are obtained keywords convective mixing large eddy simulation hydrothermal plume parameterization 1 introduction convection is an essential physical process in the ocean which plays an important role in the mixing and dispersion of heat momentum and materials in the water column german and von damm 2003 for example convection activity has a significant influence on the thermohaline circulation as well as on the global climate system understanding the physical mechanism of convection is necessary and beneficial for modeling ocean circulation and improving parameterization of ocean mixing convection dynamics is classified into two categories the ascent of hydrothermal plumes from the seafloor source induced by heating and the descent of dense surface water into the depth induced by salt rejection due to ice formation and cooling effect goodman et al 2004 speer and marshall 1995 marshall and schott 1999 klinger and marshall 1995 the heat transferred to the ocean by hydrothermal systems amounts to roughly 1013 w which accounts for a quarter of the whole heat exchange between the earth interior and ocean and the chemical elements transported by hydrothermal systems are comparable to riverine input speer and marshall 1995 german and von damm 2003 tao et al 2013 therefore hydrothermal vents are of importance to the oceanic environment and climate change over the past decades much effort has been made to understand the physical processes associated with convection activities owing to the practical difficulty to directly observe deep ocean convection various laboratory experiments were conducted on convectively driven turbulence in rotating homogeneous fluids boubnov et al 1991 chen et al 2015 maxworthy and narimousa 1994 brickman 1995 raasch and etling 1998 goodman et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 due to the limitations of laboratory experiments numerical models are preferred in the study of convective processes madec et al 1991 adopted a totally parameterized model to study convective processes giving more focus on mean or large scale flow speer and marshall 1995 conducted a number of numerical experiments and found that stratification constrains the convection in the vertical giving rise to an equilibrium spreading layer hoult and weil 1972 and wang and law 2002 applied integral models and concluded that crossflow can alter the mixing and rising height of plumes jiang and breier 2014 developed a computational fluid dynamics cfd model to examine how the transport of hydrothermal plumes the influence of vent exit velocity background stratification and chimney height affect the mixing of hydrothermal fluid with seawater these studies have provided details about flow structures such as plumes rim currents and the influence of correlative factors however direct numerical simulation dns and reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation rans have the limitations of computer resources and accuracy respectively then les large eddy simulation is developed to treat large scale and small scale flows separately turbulent scales larger than a filter width are directly resolved while smaller scales are parameterized by a subgrid scale sgs model therefore les is less cost than dns and more efficiency than rans in simulation of highly turbulent flows so far les model has been widely applied to simulate upper ocean processes and to assess parameterized turbulent quantities for the oceanic mixed layer process wang et al 1996 mcwilliams et al 1997 skyllingstad et al 2000 noh et al 2004 sullivan et al 2007 noh et al 2011 furuichi et al 2012 furuichi and hibiya 2015 li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 les model has also been used to analyze the effects of rotation and thermobaricity on convection garwood et al 1994 julien et al 1996 denbo and skyllingstad 1996 wang 2003 wang 2006 raasch and etling 1991 applied a les model to study rotating thermal convection julien et al 1996 examined the lateral scale of plumes and the vertical transport of buoyancy and kinetic energy across the convective layer and found that they were reduced with enhanced rotation while in their study sgs processes were parameterized by using constant eddy diffusivities lavelle 1997 used les to investigate the symmetry breaking induced by the rotation on plumes in cross flows and found that background values such as rotation buoyancy frequency and cross flow significantly influence the plume rise height pham et al 2011 utilized les to study the effect of rotation frequency on the vertical development of turbulent thermal plumes yang et al 2016 adopted a hybrid les model to simulate bubble driven buoyancy plumes in a stably stratified quiescent and captured detailed characteristics of the three dimensional mean structure of plume which is used to assess and improve integral models fabregat tomàs et al 2016 used les to investigate the thermal driven buoyant plumes in stratified rotating environments but they mainly focused on the physical mechanism rather than parameterizations of plume mixing and the numerical solution they used is filtered at near grid scales using an approach similar to the spectral vanishing viscosity technique instead of a sgs model to account for unresolved turbulent scales therefore there is a lack of understanding of the detailed three dimensional structure of thermal driven plumes and the influences of related factors such as rotation heat flux from the vent and stratification on mixing parameters which are useful to improve parameterization of ocean mixing in the present study the les model we used is parallelized les model palm developed by the institute of meteorology and climatology imuk at leibniz universität hannover germany over the last 20 years palm has been applied for a variety of simulations about atmospheric boundary layers such as heterogeneously heated convective boundary layers raasch and harbusch 2001 letzel and raasch 2002 maronga and raasch 2013 urban canopy flows park et al 2012 kanda et al 2013 and cloudy boundary layers riechelmann et al 2012 heinze et al 2015 it also has been widely used for studying the oceanic boundary layer such as oceanic upper mixed layer noh et al 2010 2011 feedback between atmosphere and ocean esau 2014 and seafloor turbulent boundary layer wakata 2011 maronga and raasch 2013 compared the palm simulation results with observations during litfass 2003 and found that the palm was able to simulate the observed cbl development esau 2014 applied palm to study turbulent interactions between the humid atmospheric boundary layer and the salt water oceanic mixed layer and found that the magnitude of simulated fluxes was consistent with the magnitude of observed fluxes in the long lived convective boundary layers by clayson et al 1996 in the present study we employ the palm to investigate the 3 d structure of the hydrothermal plume and it s induced mixing the rest of the paper is organized as follows les model

direction meridional y direction and vertical z direction directions grid numbers are 161 161 162 the grid size ensures that most of the turbulent transport are resolved to justify that the spatial resolution used in the present study is fine enough to resolve energy containing eddies we calculate the percentage p of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy tke in total tke based on the formula below 5 p v resolved tke v total tke resolved tke 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 total tke resoved tke sgs tke where u u u overbar represents filtered quantities about temporal average in this study sgs tke is the model output the percentage is 76 which suggests that the spatial resolution of our current model simulations are fine enough to resolve energy containing eddies and the parameterization is not dependent on the subgrid model used in addition to examine the sensitivity of the above percentage p to the model resolution we conduct a test with the spatial resolution of 4 m in the x y and z directions and the above percentage is 83 the results are consistent with the current simulation cyclic boundary conditions are adopted in the horizontal directions a hydrothermal vent a 15 m 15 m 5 m cuboid shape is set at the center of the bottom a constant heat flux is set at the surface of the hydrothermal vent to ensure that the turbulence fully develops and that the mean flow reaches a steady state the integration time is 120 h and the data for the last 24 h of each simulation run is analyzed the time step is 18 s and the data are output every 10 min for the post processing for a control run the heat flux from the hydrothermal vent is set as 2 k m s according to the scaling of maximum rise height of a plume concluded by jiang and breier 2014 the plume rise height can reach about half of the computational domain height so that the upper boundary has no effect on the plume in our model we define the maximum rise height of the plume z max as a level where the magnitude of the area averaged vertical momentum flux is 10 of the maximum of all the levels of vertical momentum flux center of the domain is located at φ 35 s for the control case and rotation rate f is represented by the geographical latitude φ in this paper initial vertical profiles of the background potential temperature and salinity are set as shown in fig 1 vertical profile of the potential temperature includes three linear variation sections top boundary layer stratification layer and bottom boundary layer while the profile of salinity has the last two layers experiments are designed as that the plume can only affect the bottom boundary layer so only the vertical gradient of the temperature in the bottom boundary layer is changed in the sensitivity numerical experiments the stratification n in the bottom boundary layer is therefore represented by the background bottom buoyancy frequency and is set as n1 0 0023 s 1 for the control case the results from the control case are presented in section 3 for the sensitivity numerical experiments different heat flux from the vent rotation rates and stratification in the bottom boundary layer are tested which are discussed in section 4 3 results from the control case in this section results from the control run are analyzed from which the 3 dimensional structure of the plume is examined and the mixing caused by the convective instability due to the bottom heat flux is discussed 3 1 3 d structure of the plume 3 1 1 time averaged fields although the instantaneous plume structure is highly turbulent the time averaged plume is relatively smooth vertical sections of velocity and potential temperature averaged over the last 24 h of the control case les 1 are plotted in fig 2 fig 2 shows the plume in the control case can rise to the level of 365 m then the rise height of the plume is 435 m from the surface of the vent from the figure one can see that the plume water temperature decreases with height but it is warmer than the surrounding water at the lower levels and then gradually becomes colder than the surrounding water at the higher levels in the whole water volume the upward momentum gradually decreases the velocity increases with height due to the injection of hydrothermal fluid reaching a maximum of 0 5 m s at 765 m and then gradually decreases with height until it reaches zero from fig 2 one can also find that the distribution of the velocity is not symmetrical about the centerline and deflects to the left side of centerline on the x z plane to the right side on the y z plane to further examine the 3 d structure of the plume the distributions of the horizontal potential temperature and the horizontal velocity at four different levels are plotted in fig 3 z 730 m 630 m 530 m and 380 m at z 730 m the potential temperature at the plume core reaches 10 c then decreases toward the temperature of the surrounding waters with less than 5 c when moving away from the center the distributions of the potential temperature at 630 m and 530 m resemble that is found at 730 m but at 380 m potential temperature in the center of the plume is colder than the surroundings the distributions of the horizontal velocity display a clockwise vortex at lower levels 730 m 630 m 530 m it can be seen that the intensity of the clockwise vortex decreases with the rise of the plume and finally at the level of 380 m the vortex disappears and the water flows away from the plume core to all sides fig 4 shows the vertical sections of streamlines and vertical velocity at two sections y 400 m and x 400 m it is can be seen that at the lower level the vertical velocity is positive and at the upper level about from 500 m to 350 m the vertical velocity around the plume core is negative white streamlines are based on 2 d velocity of the mean flow in the cross section through the central axis following the streamlines ambient water is entrained into the plume area at the lower levels and then flows upward at the upper levels of the plume streamlines turn outward and then downward where the vertical velocity is negative eventually the streamlines turn to be horizontal vertical velocity skewness s w is often used to detect the presence of coherent structures in a convective flow moeng and rotunno 1990 and sullivan et al 2007 found that the bias of vertical velocity skewness can be an indicator of a thermal plume or thermal plume like in a convective flow the blue line in fig 5 is the profile of plume area defined in section 3 2 averaged vertical velocity skewness calculated using the formula 6 s w w 3 w 2 3 2 where the denotes spatial average from 800 m to about 480 m vertical velocity skewness is large and persistently positive indicating the vigorous convective rising process from 480 m to 280 m vertical velocity skewness is slightly negative indicating that convective downwelling processes develop in the upper layer the profile of the vertical velocity skewness clearly shows the development process of the plume red line in fig 5 is the profile of the plume area averaged heat flux w t due to the tiny variation of salinity about 0 01 psu from 800 m to 250 m the buoyancy flux is mainly contributed by the heat flux from 800 m to 500 m w t is large and persistently positive and from 500 m to about 300 m w t is slightly negative and its magnitude is quite smaller than the positive value according to figs 2 5 the development process of the plume can be concluded due to the high temperature fluid injected into the ocean from the hydrothermal vent in the southern hemisphere is less dense compared to the ambient water and begins to rise under the effect of positive buoyancy force forming a hydrothermal plume as the plume rises the clockwise vortex associated with the upward vertical velocity entrains surrounding cold fluid through turbulent mixing the plume fluid eventually becomes denser than the ambient fluid at a certain level as the entrained fluid is transported upwards produce negative buoyancy force at the same time it begins to decelerate due to the vortex while the plume continues upward under inertial effect until the vertical velocity decreases to zero and even negative the water flows downward as shown in fig 4 eventually the fluids stop moving downward and reach a neutral buoyancy level 3 1 2 instantaneous fields despite the mean fields of the last 24 h are well organized for the hydrothermal vent plume the instantaneous fields are more turbulent fig 6 shows instantaneous vertical sections of streamlines and vertical velocity the streamlines are based on 2 d velocity of the instantaneous flow in the cross section through central axis compared with fig 4 they are very turbulent and the main axis is titled such plume axis bending is also reported in literatures fabregat tomàs et al 2016 marques and lopez 2014 the bended axis rotates around the central axis which is called organized precession fabregat tomàs et al 2016 to display the organized precession snapshots of vertical velocity at the height of 500 m are plotted in fig 7a the red colour reflects the upward fluid according to the position of the maximum value of positive velocity it displays the characteristic of the precession time series of the vertical velocity at one location 322 m 357 m at the same level of 500 m is plotted fig 7b it shows that the temporal variation of the vertical velocity is periodic demonstrating that the deflection of the rotating plume from the central axis results in a robust and organized periodic precession rotation period decreases with increasing rotation rate see the sensitivity experiments in section 4 following the method used by fabregat tomàs et al 2016 empirical orthogonal functions eof analysis of the last 144 instantaneous snapshots of the vertical velocity at the depth of z 500 m is adopted to obtain further details of the periodic precession first two principal modes explain 66 of the total variance as shown in fig 7c and fig 7d is the time evolution of the coefficient of them red line represents the first eof mode which indicates the periodic rotation of the plume deflection away from the vertical axis with the period of about 3 1 h 3 2 turbulence intensity fig 8 displays the temporal averaged resolved tke of the plume averaged along x direction resolved tke represents the intensity of the turbulence and it is defined in eq 5 in section 2 2 according to the distributions of tke we define the plume area as that the magnitude of tke is 8 of the tke maximum of the domain in other words the points with the tke less than 8 are blank the vertical structure of the tke displays an umbrella shaped distribution near the vent tke increases with height and reaches maximum at about 560 m then it gradually decreases to zero at about 300 m it should be noted that instantaneous tke values are much larger than the section and time averaged values presented in fig 8 the maximum value of instantaneous tke near the vent can reach 0 06 m 2 s 2 this is caused by the high plume fluid velocity as they flow out of the vent 3 3 turbulence mixing turbulence mixing intensity is measured by the vertical eddy viscosity k m which can be estimated by the formula suggested by mcwilliams et al 1997 7 k m u w d u dz d u dz 2 the bold font denotes vectors to avoid the zero denominator we use the scattering plots to obtain the k m profile in the les the unresolved processes sgs fluxes are parameterized in the palm the parameterization is realized according to deardorff

grid resolution x y z 3 and d is the distance from the bottom boundary and e is the sgs tke eddy viscosity is the sum of the mean eddy viscosity and sgs eddy viscosity k k m k sgs fig 9 shows the vertical profile of the eddy viscosity k k m is averaged over the horizontal plane and k sgs is averaged over the plume area as we can see that k increases sharply from 0 to 0 027 m 2 s near the vent and decreases to 0 013 m 2 s from 790 m to 720 m k increases with the rising plume and reaches a maximum value of 0 053 m 2 s at about 570 m i e 0 53 z max from 0 53 z max to z max k shows a quick decrease again until it reaches nearly zero at the maximum height of the plume 4 parameterization 4 1 sensitivity experiments to obtain the parameterization of the mixing induced by hydrothermal plume a series of numerical experiments are conducted to examine the effects of three variables heat flux from the vent hf rotation rate f and bottom boundary layer stratification n on three parameters which characterize the mixing eddy viscosity k maximum rise height of plume z max and intensity of ring shaped vortex i vortex f n k and z max have been defined in preceded section and i vortex is defined as the maximum speed on the horizontal plane at the same level of 730 m the same level is chosen to make a better comparison table 1 lists all the sensitivity experiments and les 1 denotes the control case in the sensitivity experiments heat flux hf varies from 0 2 to 5 0 k m s totally 6 cases 2 0 2 0 5 1 0 4 0 5 0 k m s i e les 1 and les 10 14 rotation rate f varies from 45 s to 45 n

n4 0 0035 n5 0 0041 s 1 i e les 1 and les 15 18 totally 16 cases are conducted with some of cases are combined 4 1 1 heat flux from the vent hf how the heat flux from the bottom vent affects the mixing of the plume is investigated fig 10a shows the vertical profiles of the vertical eddy viscosity k with different heat flux intensities one can see that all the vertical profiles of the vertical viscosity with different heat fluxes share the similar bell shaped curve that takes the maximum value in the middle of the bottom boundary layer it is also noted that both the maximum value of the eddy viscosity and the depth of the maximum value increase with the heat flux which implies that the heat flux intensity affects the intensity of the mixing and the penetration depth of the mixing the maximum values of k are all located between 0 5 0 6 z max fig 10b shows the effects of the heat flux from the vent on z max and i vortex it is found that z max and i vortex increase with the heat flux when the heat flux is 0 2 k m s z max and i vortex are 225 m and 0 014 m s respectively when the heat flux is increased to 5 0 k m s z max and i vortex reach 600 m and 0 04 m s increasing by factors of about two since the mixing is caused by the convection instability due to the heat flux from the vent the intensity of the vertical buoyancy flux w t can well represent the intensity of the mixing fig 10c shows the vertical profiles of the heat flux averaged over the plume area with different heat fluxes from the vent sharing a bell shape it can be clearly seen that at the lower level of the plume the heat flux is persistently positive and the maximum value increases as the heat flux from the vent increases at the upper level the heat flux becomes negative and the level where the heat flux starts to become negative rises as the heat flux from the vent increases therefore the increase in the heat flux from the vent enhances the positive buoyancy flux and strengthens the rising plume which results in the increment of z max and i vortex 4 1 2 rotation rate f fig 11a shows how the rotation rate affects the eddy viscosity k the vertical profiles of k under different rotation rates i e in the different geographic locations share the same pattern the profile is a bell shaped curve with the maximum value of k at the level of 500 m 600 m and the second maximum near the vent the maximum value of k decreases with the increase in the rotation rate i e the geographic location moves poleward this is because that the coriolis effect redistributes the energy from the vertical direction to the horizontal direction thus depresses the vertical flux such effect can also be reflected on the variation in the maximum rise height of the plume z max and the intensity of the horizontal vortex i vortex shown in fig 11b it can be clearly seen that with the increasing rotation rate the value of z max becomes smaller and i vortex becomes larger when the vent is located at the equator which means the effect of the vertical component of the rotation on the plume is minimal then z max and i vortex are 460 m and 0 015 m s respectively from the equator to the latitude of 45 the largest variation of z max decreases by 60 m about 15 while the largest variation of i vortex increases by 0 020 m s about 130 the results imply that the rotation rate has a profound effect on the plume and the mixing fig 11c shows the rotation effect on the vertical velocity and its organized precession period the vertical velocity is chosen at the same level of 700 m to make a comparison with different rotation rates results show that rotation rate has a significant effect on the value of vertical velocity peak and its precession period when the geographic latitude is 0 the rotation effect is the weakest the value of the vertical velocity peak is smallest and the periodic feature of the signal of the vertical velocity is not evident with the increase in the rotation rate the precession period decreases the precise precession periods obtained from the power spectra of the vertical velocity are 4 1 h 3 4 h 3 1 h and 2 4 h at latitudes 15 s 25 s 35 s 45 s respectively meanwhile the value of the vertical velocity peak at the same depth decreases with the increasing rotation rate representing the inhibition effect of the rotation rate on the vertical momentum flux transport 4 1 3 background stratification n the effects of the stratification in the bottom boundary layer are examined fig 12b shows the effect of background stratification on k it can be seen that k does not vary significantly with the different n from fig 12c one can see that z max decreases and i vortex increases with the enhanced stratification when n is n2 0 0013 s 1 z max is 440 m with an enhanced stratification n increases from n2 0 0013 s 1 to n5 0 0041 s 1 z max decreases to 405 m which is about 8 smaller as for i vortex it is 0 026 m s when n is n2 0 0013 s 1 and increases to 0 0284 m s when n is n5 0 0041 s 1 that is about 9 larger fig 12d shows the effect of the stratification on the heat flux w t it can be concluded that the heat flux w t does not change too much with different stratification the less sensitivity of the mixing in the plume could be due to the range of background stratification variation 4 2 parameterization based on the above sensitivity experiments in this section we present the parameterization of the eddy viscosity i e derive a formula to explicitly illustrate the relationship between the plume parameters eddy viscosity and plume height and hydrological environmental variables heat flux hf rotation rate f and background stratification n 4 2 1 eddy viscosity scaling based on the series of sensitivity numerical experiments it can be found that all the profiles of the eddy viscosity have the same bell shaped curve then we can suggest a scaling relationship for the eddy viscosity with respect to hf n and f is as follows 10 k 0 0054 b exit n f v 1 2 e z 0 48 0 42 2 where b exit is the buoyancy flux b exit g ρ vent hf s vent s vent represents the surface area of the vent ρ vent is the density near the vent f v is defined as a function of the geographical latitude φ f v sin φ z is the normalized vertical distance defined as z z z b z t z b z is the vertical coordinate z b and z t are bottom boundary and top boundary for the vertical range to fit the eddy viscosity respectively in fig 13 b blue scatters represent the values of eddy viscosity of the sensitivity experiments and the red line represents their linear fitted line it shows the relationship between eddy viscosity and hf n and f the blue line in fig 13 a represents the pattern of the eddy viscosity and the red dashed line indicates its fitted curve 4 2 2 maximum rise height of the plume z max scaling according to briggs 1969 the scaling of the maximum rise height of the plume z max in a stratified fluid is given by 11 z max a b exit n 3 1 4 the value of the scaling coefficient a is suggested to be 3 76 by briggs 1969 which is based on oil fires in the atmosphere and the laboratory experiments the number needs to be changed to be adapted to the environment of the hydrothermal plume according to jiang and breier 2014 who suggest that a 1 999 for the hydrothermal vent with the rotation not included the numerical model used by jiang and breier 2014 is the computational fluid dynamics cfd model which is different from the les used in the present study to examine if the coefficient they obtained works for the les we conducted a simulation same with control case under non rotation effect les 19 we obtain a 1 97 which is close to 1 999 suggested by jiang and breier 2014 with the rotation effect included in the control case the latitude is set as 35 s we obtain a 1 840 which is slightly smaller than 1 999 by jiang and breier 2014 from the results above z max decreases as the rotation rate increases rotation effect has some effect on the coefficient of z max based on a series of experiments taking into account the effect of the rotation the maximum height z max is suggested 12 z max 1 196 b exit n 3 1 4 e 1 2 cos φ where φ is the geographical latitude fig 14 shows the results from numerical experiments and the fitted curve from formula 12 with the correlation coefficient r 2 97 6 and the root mean squared error rmse 0 0087 5 discussion compared with the previous study on the eddy viscosity induced by the hydrothermal vent such as jiang and breier 2014 the vertical profile of the eddy viscosity from the present study is different from that in jiang and breier 2014 the maximum value of the eddy viscosity in our study is present at 0 5 0 6 z max but jiang and breier 2014 shows the maximum value near the plume top it is because that the different formula are used by the two studies the present study uses eq 7 which is based on the spatial and temporal averaged eddy flux and the eddy viscosity represents the mixing at the plume scale jiang and breier 2014 used the urans model i e k ε to calculate the eddy viscosity based on the definition from the reynolds averaging which represents the mixing at the grid point to prove it we conduct a new simulation les 19 same as the control case with non rotation effect ω 0 and calculate the resolved tke turbulence dissipation rate and eddy viscosity applying their method fig 15 show the vertical sections through the central axis it can be seen that the contours are same with jiang and breier 2014 and what s more the maximum eddy viscosity is located near the top of the plume see fig 15 c such comparison with jiang and breier 2014 can be also considered as one validation of the present model another validation of the model can be seen from our sensitivity tests in section 4 on rotation on the z max it can be found in section 4 2 1 that the fitting scale coefficient of z max in eq 13 when the latitude is zero is close to that obtained by jiang and breier 2014 such agreement is another validation of the present model 6 summary les model is applied to examine the three dimensional structure of the plume induced by hydrothermal exhalations and the mixing caused results show that the plume is an umbrella like shape and generates clockwise vortex when the vent is located in the southern hemisphere as a control case the vertical axis of the plume is titled and rotates around the vertical axis which is so called organized precession vertical profile of the vertical eddy viscosity is derived from the numerical results which shows the maximum mixing takes place at 0 5 0 6 z max a series of numerical experiments are conducted to test the sensitivity of three plume characteristic parameters eddy viscosity k maximum rising plume height z max and the intensity of the vortex i vortex to three environmental variables heat flux from the vent hf rotation rate f and background stratification n based on the sensitivity experiments a parameterization of

24037,a large eddy simulation les model is applied to study convective instability processes driven by hydrothermal exhalations the process of convective mixing induced by a bottom heating source is examined in a stratified and rotating frame the control case of numerical experiment is configured with the horizontal and vertical resolution 5 m located at 35 s its results show that the three dimensional structure of the hydrothermal plume displays an umbrella shape a strong clockwise vortex above the vent is present and the axis of the vortex is tilted with organized precession a series

to hf f and n are obtained keywords convective mixing large eddy simulation hydrothermal plume parameterization 1 introduction convection is an essential physical process in the ocean which plays an important role in the mixing and dispersion of heat momentum and materials in the water column german and von damm 2003 for example convection activity has a significant influence on the thermohaline circulation as well as on the global climate system understanding the physical mechanism of convection is necessary and beneficial for modeling ocean circulation and improving parameterization of ocean mixing convection dynamics is classified into two categories the ascent of hydrothermal plumes from the seafloor source induced by heating and the descent of dense surface water into the depth induced by salt rejection due to ice formation and cooling effect goodman et al 2004 speer and marshall 1995 marshall and schott 1999 klinger and marshall 1995 the heat transferred to the ocean by hydrothermal systems amounts to roughly 1013 w which accounts for a quarter of the whole heat exchange between the earth interior and ocean and the chemical elements transported by hydrothermal systems are comparable to riverine input speer and marshall 1995 german and von damm 2003 tao et al 2013 therefore hydrothermal vents are of importance to the oceanic environment and climate change over the past decades much effort has been made to understand the physical processes associated with convection activities owing to the practical difficulty to directly observe deep ocean convection various laboratory experiments were conducted on convectively driven turbulence in rotating homogeneous fluids boubnov et al 1991 chen et al 2015 maxworthy and narimousa 1994 brickman 1995 raasch and etling 1998 goodman et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 due to the limitations of laboratory experiments numerical models are preferred in the study of convective processes madec et al 1991 adopted a totally parameterized model to study convective processes giving more focus on mean or large scale flow speer and marshall 1995 conducted a number of numerical experiments and found that stratification constrains the convection in the vertical giving rise to an equilibrium spreading layer hoult and weil 1972 and wang and law 2002 applied integral models and concluded that crossflow can alter the mixing and rising height of plumes jiang and breier 2014 developed a computational fluid dynamics cfd model to examine how the transport of hydrothermal plumes the influence of vent exit velocity background stratification and chimney height affect the mixing of hydrothermal fluid with seawater these studies have provided details about flow structures such as plumes rim currents and the influence of correlative factors however direct numerical simulation dns and reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation rans have the limitations of computer resources and accuracy respectively then les large eddy simulation is developed to treat large scale and small scale flows separately turbulent scales larger than a filter width are directly resolved while smaller scales are parameterized by a subgrid scale sgs model therefore les is less cost than dns and more efficiency than rans in simulation of highly turbulent flows so far les model has been widely applied to simulate upper ocean processes and to assess parameterized turbulent quantities for the oceanic mixed layer process wang et al 1996 mcwilliams et al 1997 skyllingstad et al 2000 noh et al 2004 sullivan et al 2007 noh et al 2011 furuichi et al 2012 furuichi and hibiya 2015 li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 les model has also been used to analyze the effects of rotation and thermobaricity on convection garwood et al 1994 julien et al 1996 denbo and skyllingstad 1996 wang 2003 wang 2006 raasch and etling 1991 applied a les model to study rotating thermal convection julien et al 1996 examined the lateral scale of plumes and the vertical transport of buoyancy and kinetic energy across the convective layer and found that they were reduced with enhanced rotation while in their study sgs processes were parameterized by using constant eddy diffusivities lavelle 1997 used les to investigate the symmetry breaking induced by the rotation on plumes in cross flows and found that background values such as rotation buoyancy frequency and cross flow significantly influence the plume rise height pham et al 2011 utilized les to study the effect of rotation frequency on the vertical development of turbulent thermal plumes yang et al 2016 adopted a hybrid les model to simulate bubble driven buoyancy plumes in a stably stratified quiescent and captured detailed characteristics of the three dimensional mean structure of plume which is used to assess and improve integral models fabregat tomàs et al 2016 used les to investigate the thermal driven buoyant plumes in stratified rotating environments but they mainly focused on the physical mechanism rather than parameterizations of plume mixing and the numerical solution they used is filtered at near grid scales using an approach similar to the spectral vanishing viscosity technique instead of a sgs model to account for unresolved turbulent scales therefore there is a lack of understanding of the detailed three dimensional structure of thermal driven plumes and the influences of related factors such as rotation heat flux from the vent and stratification on mixing parameters which are useful to improve parameterization of ocean mixing in the present study the les model we used is parallelized les model palm developed by the institute of meteorology and climatology imuk at leibniz universität hannover germany over the last 20 years palm has been applied for a variety of simulations about atmospheric boundary layers such as heterogeneously heated convective boundary layers raasch and harbusch 2001 letzel and raasch 2002 maronga and raasch 2013 urban canopy flows park et al 2012 kanda et al 2013 and cloudy boundary layers riechelmann et al 2012 heinze et al 2015 it also has been widely used for studying the oceanic boundary layer such as oceanic upper mixed layer noh et al 2010 2011 feedback between atmosphere and ocean esau 2014 and seafloor turbulent boundary layer wakata 2011 maronga and raasch 2013 compared the palm simulation results with observations during litfass 2003 and found that the palm was able to simulate the observed cbl development esau 2014 applied palm to study turbulent interactions between the humid atmospheric boundary layer and the salt water oceanic mixed layer and found that the magnitude of simulated fluxes was consistent with the magnitude of observed fluxes in the long lived convective boundary layers by clayson et al 1996 in the present study we employ the palm to investigate the 3 d structure of the hydrothermal plume and it s induced mixing the rest of the paper is organized as follows les model

section 6 is the summary 2 the model 2 1 les model the palm used in this study allows both cyclic horizontal boundary conditions and non cyclic boundary conditions along the x or y axis additionally palm contains salinity and state of seawater equations which make ocean atmosphere coupling possible the model is based on the non hydrostatic filtered incompressible navier stokes equations in

direction meridional y direction and vertical z direction directions grid numbers are 161 161 162 the grid size ensures that most of the turbulent transport are resolved to justify that the spatial resolution used in the present study is fine enough to resolve energy containing eddies we calculate the percentage p of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy tke in total tke based on the formula below 5 p v resolved tke v total tke resolved tke 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 total tke resoved tke sgs tke where u u u overbar represents filtered quantities about temporal average in this study sgs tke is the model output the percentage is 76 which suggests that the spatial resolution of our current model simulations are fine enough to resolve energy containing eddies and the parameterization is not dependent on the subgrid model used in addition to examine the sensitivity of the above percentage p to the model resolution we conduct a test with the spatial resolution of 4 m in the x y and z directions and the above percentage is 83 the results are consistent with the current simulation cyclic boundary conditions are adopted in the horizontal directions a hydrothermal vent a 15 m 15 m 5 m cuboid shape is set at the center of the bottom a constant heat flux is set at the surface of the hydrothermal vent to ensure that the turbulence fully develops and that the mean flow reaches a steady state the integration time is 120 h and the data for the last 24 h of each simulation run is analyzed the time step is 18 s and the data are output every 10 min for the post processing for a control run the heat flux from the hydrothermal vent is set as 2 k m s according to the scaling of maximum rise height of a plume concluded by jiang and breier 2014 the plume rise height can reach about half of the computational domain height so that the upper boundary has no effect on the plume in our model we define the maximum rise height of the plume z max as a level where the magnitude of the area averaged vertical momentum flux is 10 of the maximum of all the levels of vertical momentum flux center of the domain is located at φ 35 s for the control case and rotation rate f is represented by the geographical latitude φ in this paper initial vertical profiles of the background potential temperature and salinity are set as shown in fig 1 vertical profile of the potential temperature includes three linear variation sections top boundary layer stratification layer and bottom boundary layer while the profile of salinity has the last two layers experiments are designed as that the plume can only affect the bottom boundary layer so only the vertical gradient of the temperature in the bottom boundary layer is changed in the sensitivity numerical experiments the stratification n in the bottom boundary layer is therefore represented by the background bottom buoyancy frequency and is set as n1 0 0023 s 1 for the control case the results from the control case are presented in section 3 for the sensitivity numerical experiments different heat flux from the vent rotation rates and stratification in the bottom boundary layer are tested which are discussed in section 4 3 results from the control case in this section results from the control run are analyzed from which the 3 dimensional structure of the plume is examined and the mixing caused by the convective instability due to the bottom heat flux is discussed 3 1 3 d structure of the plume 3 1 1 time averaged fields although the instantaneous plume structure is highly turbulent the time averaged plume is relatively smooth vertical sections of velocity and potential temperature averaged over the last 24 h of the control case les 1 are plotted in fig 2 fig 2 shows the plume in the control case can rise to the level of 365 m then the rise height of the plume is 435 m from the surface of the vent from the figure one can see that the plume water temperature decreases with height but it is warmer than the surrounding water at the lower levels and then gradually becomes colder than the surrounding water at the higher levels in the whole water volume the upward momentum gradually decreases the velocity increases with height due to the injection of hydrothermal fluid reaching a maximum of 0 5 m s at 765 m and then gradually decreases with height until it reaches zero from fig 2 one can also find that the distribution of the velocity is not symmetrical about the centerline and deflects to the left side of centerline on the x z plane to the right side on the y z plane to further examine the 3 d structure of the plume the distributions of the horizontal potential temperature and the horizontal velocity at four different levels are plotted in fig 3 z 730 m 630 m 530 m and 380 m at z 730 m the potential temperature at the plume core reaches 10 c then decreases toward the temperature of the surrounding waters with less than 5 c when moving away from the center the distributions of the potential temperature at 630 m and 530 m resemble that is found at 730 m but at 380 m potential temperature in the center of the plume is colder than the surroundings the distributions of the horizontal velocity display a clockwise vortex at lower levels 730 m 630 m 530 m it can be seen that the intensity of the clockwise vortex decreases with the rise of the plume and finally at the level of 380 m the vortex disappears and the water flows away from the plume core to all sides fig 4 shows the vertical sections of streamlines and vertical velocity at two sections y 400 m and x 400 m it is can be seen that at the lower level the vertical velocity is positive and at the upper level about from 500 m to 350 m the vertical velocity around the plume core is negative white streamlines are based on 2 d velocity of the mean flow in the cross section through the central axis following the streamlines ambient water is entrained into the plume area at the lower levels and then flows upward at the upper levels of the plume streamlines turn outward and then downward where the vertical velocity is negative eventually the streamlines turn to be horizontal vertical velocity skewness s w is often used to detect the presence of coherent structures in a convective flow moeng and rotunno 1990 and sullivan et al 2007 found that the bias of vertical velocity skewness can be an indicator of a thermal plume or thermal plume like in a convective flow the blue line in fig 5 is the profile of plume area defined in section 3 2 averaged vertical velocity skewness calculated using the formula 6 s w w 3 w 2 3 2 where the denotes spatial average from 800 m to about 480 m vertical velocity skewness is large and persistently positive indicating the vigorous convective rising process from 480 m to 280 m vertical velocity skewness is slightly negative indicating that convective downwelling processes develop in the upper layer the profile of the vertical velocity skewness clearly shows the development process of the plume red line in fig 5 is the profile of the plume area averaged heat flux w t due to the tiny variation of salinity about 0 01 psu from 800 m to 250 m the buoyancy flux is mainly contributed by the heat flux from 800 m to 500 m w t is large and persistently positive and from 500 m to about 300 m w t is slightly negative and its magnitude is quite smaller than the positive value according to figs 2 5 the development process of the plume can be concluded due to the high temperature fluid injected into the ocean from the hydrothermal vent in the southern hemisphere is less dense compared to the ambient water and begins to rise under the effect of positive buoyancy force forming a hydrothermal plume as the plume rises the clockwise vortex associated with the upward vertical velocity entrains surrounding cold fluid through turbulent mixing the plume fluid eventually becomes denser than the ambient fluid at a certain level as the entrained fluid is transported upwards produce negative buoyancy force at the same time it begins to decelerate due to the vortex while the plume continues upward under inertial effect until the vertical velocity decreases to zero and even negative the water flows downward as shown in fig 4 eventually the fluids stop moving downward and reach a neutral buoyancy level 3 1 2 instantaneous fields despite the mean fields of the last 24 h are well organized for the hydrothermal vent plume the instantaneous fields are more turbulent fig 6 shows instantaneous vertical sections of streamlines and vertical velocity the streamlines are based on 2 d velocity of the instantaneous flow in the cross section through central axis compared with fig 4 they are very turbulent and the main axis is titled such plume axis bending is also reported in literatures fabregat tomàs et al 2016 marques and lopez 2014 the bended axis rotates around the central axis which is called organized precession fabregat tomàs et al 2016 to display the organized precession snapshots of vertical velocity at the height of 500 m are plotted in fig 7a the red colour reflects the upward fluid according to the position of the maximum value of positive velocity it displays the characteristic of the precession time series of the vertical velocity at one location 322 m 357 m at the same level of 500 m is plotted fig 7b it shows that the temporal variation of the vertical velocity is periodic demonstrating that the deflection of the rotating plume from the central axis results in a robust and organized periodic precession rotation period decreases with increasing rotation rate see the sensitivity experiments in section 4 following the method used by fabregat tomàs et al 2016 empirical orthogonal functions eof analysis of the last 144 instantaneous snapshots of the vertical velocity at the depth of z 500 m is adopted to obtain further details of the periodic precession first two principal modes explain 66 of the total variance as shown in fig 7c and fig 7d is the time evolution of the coefficient of them red line represents the first eof mode which indicates the periodic rotation of the plume deflection away from the vertical axis with the period of about 3 1 h 3 2 turbulence intensity fig 8 displays the temporal averaged resolved tke of the plume averaged along x direction resolved tke represents the intensity of the turbulence and it is defined in eq 5 in section 2 2 according to the distributions of tke we define the plume area as that the magnitude of tke is 8 of the tke maximum of the domain in other words the points with the tke less than 8 are blank the vertical structure of the tke displays an umbrella shaped distribution near the vent tke increases with height and reaches maximum at about 560 m then it gradually decreases to zero at about 300 m it should be noted that instantaneous tke values are much larger than the section and time averaged values presented in fig 8 the maximum value of instantaneous tke near the vent can reach 0 06 m 2 s 2 this is caused by the high plume fluid velocity as they flow out of the vent 3 3 turbulence mixing turbulence mixing intensity is measured by the vertical eddy viscosity k m which can be estimated by the formula suggested by mcwilliams et al 1997 7 k m u w d u dz d u dz 2 the bold font denotes vectors to avoid the zero denominator we use the scattering plots to obtain the k m profile in the les the unresolved processes sgs fluxes are parameterized in the palm the parameterization is realized according to deardorff

grid resolution x y z 3 and d is the distance from the bottom boundary and e is the sgs tke eddy viscosity is the sum of the mean eddy viscosity and sgs eddy viscosity k k m k sgs fig 9 shows the vertical profile of the eddy viscosity k k m is averaged over the horizontal plane and k sgs is averaged over the plume area as we can see that k increases sharply from 0 to 0 027 m 2 s near the vent and decreases to 0 013 m 2 s from 790 m to 720 m k increases with the rising plume and reaches a maximum value of 0 053 m 2 s at about 570 m i e 0 53 z max from 0 53 z max to z max k shows a quick decrease again until it reaches nearly zero at the maximum height of the plume 4 parameterization 4 1 sensitivity experiments to obtain the parameterization of the mixing induced by hydrothermal plume a series of numerical experiments are conducted to examine the effects of three variables heat flux from the vent hf rotation rate f and bottom boundary layer stratification n on three parameters which characterize the mixing eddy viscosity k maximum rise height of plume z max and intensity of ring shaped vortex i vortex f n k and z max have been defined in preceded section and i vortex is defined as the maximum speed on the horizontal plane at the same level of 730 m the same level is chosen to make a better comparison table 1 lists all the sensitivity experiments and les 1 denotes the control case in the sensitivity experiments heat flux hf varies from 0 2 to 5 0 k m s totally 6 cases 2 0 2 0 5 1 0 4 0 5 0 k m s i e les 1 and les 10 14 rotation rate f varies from 45 s to 45 n

n4 0 0035 n5 0 0041 s 1 i e les 1 and les 15 18 totally 16 cases are conducted with some of cases are combined 4 1 1 heat flux from the vent hf how the heat flux from the bottom vent affects the mixing of the plume is investigated fig 10a shows the vertical profiles of the vertical eddy viscosity k with different heat flux intensities one can see that all the vertical profiles of the vertical viscosity with different heat fluxes share the similar bell shaped curve that takes the maximum value in the middle of the bottom boundary layer it is also noted that both the maximum value of the eddy viscosity and the depth of the maximum value increase with the heat flux which implies that the heat flux intensity affects the intensity of the mixing and the penetration depth of the mixing the maximum values of k are all located between 0 5 0 6 z max fig 10b shows the effects of the heat flux from the vent on z max and i vortex it is found that z max and i vortex increase with the heat flux when the heat flux is 0 2 k m s z max and i vortex are 225 m and 0 014 m s respectively when the heat flux is increased to 5 0 k m s z max and i vortex reach 600 m and 0 04 m s increasing by factors of about two since the mixing is caused by the convection instability due to the heat flux from the vent the intensity of the vertical buoyancy flux w t can well represent the intensity of the mixing fig 10c shows the vertical profiles of the heat flux averaged over the plume area with different heat fluxes from the vent sharing a bell shape it can be clearly seen that at the lower level of the plume the heat flux is persistently positive and the maximum value increases as the heat flux from the vent increases at the upper level the heat flux becomes negative and the level where the heat flux starts to become negative rises as the heat flux from the vent increases therefore the increase in the heat flux from the vent enhances the positive buoyancy flux and strengthens the rising plume which results in the increment of z max and i vortex 4 1 2 rotation rate f fig 11a shows how the rotation rate affects the eddy viscosity k the vertical profiles of k under different rotation rates i e in the different geographic locations share the same pattern the profile is a bell shaped curve with the maximum value of k at the level of 500 m 600 m and the second maximum near the vent the maximum value of k decreases with the increase in the rotation rate i e the geographic location moves poleward this is because that the coriolis effect redistributes the energy from the vertical direction to the horizontal direction thus depresses the vertical flux such effect can also be reflected on the variation in the maximum rise height of the plume z max and the intensity of the horizontal vortex i vortex shown in fig 11b it can be clearly seen that with the increasing rotation rate the value of z max becomes smaller and i vortex becomes larger when the vent is located at the equator which means the effect of the vertical component of the rotation on the plume is minimal then z max and i vortex are 460 m and 0 015 m s respectively from the equator to the latitude of 45 the largest variation of z max decreases by 60 m about 15 while the largest variation of i vortex increases by 0 020 m s about 130 the results imply that the rotation rate has a profound effect on the plume and the mixing fig 11c shows the rotation effect on the vertical velocity and its organized precession period the vertical velocity is chosen at the same level of 700 m to make a comparison with different rotation rates results show that rotation rate has a significant effect on the value of vertical velocity peak and its precession period when the geographic latitude is 0 the rotation effect is the weakest the value of the vertical velocity peak is smallest and the periodic feature of the signal of the vertical velocity is not evident with the increase in the rotation rate the precession period decreases the precise precession periods obtained from the power spectra of the vertical velocity are 4 1 h 3 4 h 3 1 h and 2 4 h at latitudes 15 s 25 s 35 s 45 s respectively meanwhile the value of the vertical velocity peak at the same depth decreases with the increasing rotation rate representing the inhibition effect of the rotation rate on the vertical momentum flux transport 4 1 3 background stratification n the effects of the stratification in the bottom boundary layer are examined fig 12b shows the effect of background stratification on k it can be seen that k does not vary significantly with the different n from fig 12c one can see that z max decreases and i vortex increases with the enhanced stratification when n is n2 0 0013 s 1 z max is 440 m with an enhanced stratification n increases from n2 0 0013 s 1 to n5 0 0041 s 1 z max decreases to 405 m which is about 8 smaller as for i vortex it is 0 026 m s when n is n2 0 0013 s 1 and increases to 0 0284 m s when n is n5 0 0041 s 1 that is about 9 larger fig 12d shows the effect of the stratification on the heat flux w t it can be concluded that the heat flux w t does not change too much with different stratification the less sensitivity of the mixing in the plume could be due to the range of background stratification variation 4 2 parameterization based on the above sensitivity experiments in this section we present the parameterization of the eddy viscosity i e derive a formula to explicitly illustrate the relationship between the plume parameters eddy viscosity and plume height and hydrological environmental variables heat flux hf rotation rate f and background stratification n 4 2 1 eddy viscosity scaling based on the series of sensitivity numerical experiments it can be found that all the profiles of the eddy viscosity have the same bell shaped curve then we can suggest a scaling relationship for the eddy viscosity with respect to hf n and f is as follows 10 k 0 0054 b exit n f v 1 2 e z 0 48 0 42 2 where b exit is the buoyancy flux b exit g ρ vent hf s vent s vent represents the surface area of the vent ρ vent is the density near the vent f v is defined as a function of the geographical latitude φ f v sin φ z is the normalized vertical distance defined as z z z b z t z b z is the vertical coordinate z b and z t are bottom boundary and top boundary for the vertical range to fit the eddy viscosity respectively in fig 13 b blue scatters represent the values of eddy viscosity of the sensitivity experiments and the red line represents their linear fitted line it shows the relationship between eddy viscosity and hf n and f the blue line in fig 13 a represents the pattern of the eddy viscosity and the red dashed line indicates its fitted curve 4 2 2 maximum rise height of the plume z max scaling according to briggs 1969 the scaling of the maximum rise height of the plume z max in a stratified fluid is given by 11 z max a b exit n 3 1 4 the value of the scaling coefficient a is suggested to be 3 76 by briggs 1969 which is based on oil fires in the atmosphere and the laboratory experiments the number needs to be changed to be adapted to the environment of the hydrothermal plume according to jiang and breier 2014 who suggest that a 1 999 for the hydrothermal vent with the rotation not included the numerical model used by jiang and breier 2014 is the computational fluid dynamics cfd model which is different from the les used in the present study to examine if the coefficient they obtained works for the les we conducted a simulation same with control case under non rotation effect les 19 we obtain a 1 97 which is close to 1 999 suggested by jiang and breier 2014 with the rotation effect included in the control case the latitude is set as 35 s we obtain a 1 840 which is slightly smaller than 1 999 by jiang and breier 2014 from the results above z max decreases as the rotation rate increases rotation effect has some effect on the coefficient of z max based on a series of experiments taking into account the effect of the rotation the maximum height z max is suggested 12 z max 1 196 b exit n 3 1 4 e 1 2 cos φ where φ is the geographical latitude fig 14 shows the results from numerical experiments and the fitted curve from formula 12 with the correlation coefficient r 2 97 6 and the root mean squared error rmse 0 0087 5 discussion compared with the previous study on the eddy viscosity induced by the hydrothermal vent such as jiang and breier 2014 the vertical profile of the eddy viscosity from the present study is different from that in jiang and breier 2014 the maximum value of the eddy viscosity in our study is present at 0 5 0 6 z max but jiang and breier 2014 shows the maximum value near the plume top it is because that the different formula are used by the two studies the present study uses eq 7 which is based on the spatial and temporal averaged eddy flux and the eddy viscosity represents the mixing at the plume scale jiang and breier 2014 used the urans model i e k ε to calculate the eddy viscosity based on the definition from the reynolds averaging which represents the mixing at the grid point to prove it we conduct a new simulation les 19 same as the control case with non rotation effect ω 0 and calculate the resolved tke turbulence dissipation rate and eddy viscosity applying their method fig 15 show the vertical sections through the central axis it can be seen that the contours are same with jiang and breier 2014 and what s more the maximum eddy viscosity is located near the top of the plume see fig 15 c such comparison with jiang and breier 2014 can be also considered as one validation of the present model another validation of the model can be seen from our sensitivity tests in section 4 on rotation on the z max it can be found in section 4 2 1 that the fitting scale coefficient of z max in eq 13 when the latitude is zero is close to that obtained by jiang and breier 2014 such agreement is another validation of the present model 6 summary les model is applied to examine the three dimensional structure of the plume induced by hydrothermal exhalations and the mixing caused results show that the plume is an umbrella like shape and generates clockwise vortex when the vent is located in the southern hemisphere as a control case the vertical axis of the plume is titled and rotates around the vertical axis which is so called organized precession vertical profile of the vertical eddy viscosity is derived from the numerical results which shows the maximum mixing

24038,internal tides power much of the observed small scale turbulence in the ocean interior to represent mixing induced by this turbulence in ocean climate models the cascade of internal tide energy to dissipation scales must be understood and mapped here we present a framework for estimating the geography of internal tide energy sinks the mapping relies on the following ingredients i a global observational climatology of stratification ii maps of the generation of m2 s2 and k1 internal tides decomposed into vertical normal modes iii simplified representations of the dissipation of low mode internal tides due to wave wave interactions scattering by small scale topography interaction with critical slopes and shoaling iv lagrangian tracking of low mode energy beams through observed stratification including refraction and reflection we thus obtain a global map of the column integrated energy dissipation for each of the four considered dissipative processes each of the three tidal constituents and each of the first five modes modes 6 are inferred to dissipate within the local water column at the employed half degree horizontal resolution combining all processes modes and constituents we construct a map of the total internal tide energy dissipation which compares well with observational inferences of internal wave energy dissipation this result suggests that tides largely shape observed spatial contrasts of dissipation and that the framework has potential in improving understanding and modelling of ocean mixing however sensitivity to poorly constrained parameters and simplifying assumptions entering the parameterized energy sinks calls for additional investigation the attenuation of low mode internal tides by wave wave interactions needs particular attention keywords ocean mixing internal tides energy dissipation parameterization 1 introduction ocean general circulation models ogcms do not resolve the cascade of energy down to dissipation scales they rely on parameterizations of the irreversible mixing accomplished by small scale turbulence this parameterized mixing is pivotal to model behaviour on climatic timescales because it is the principal source of density transformation away from boundaries iudicone et al 2008 yet ad hoc representations of irreversible mixing such as the specification of diffusivities that are fixed in time remain common in ocean modelling tuning of fixed diffusivities may allow fair reproduction of some targeted observations but their prescription generally precludes a realistic model response to perturbations indeed for an ocean model to appropriately respond to changes in external forcing irreversible mixing must be connected to the forcing via conservative and realistic tracking of energy eden et al 2014 one important forcing to account for is the gravitational attraction of the moon and sun which generates surface barotropic ocean tides about two thirds of the power input to surface tides is directly lost to shear driven mixing and frictional heating at continental margins taylor 1919 jeffreys 1920 the remaining third about 1 tw feeds the generation of internal baroclinic tides egbert and ray 2000 nycander 2005 internal tides are internal waves of tidal frequency that radiate from sloping topography where barotropic tidal currents push stratified fluid up and down the slope munk 1966 bell 1975 they are a major energy source for the internal wave field and via instabilities of that field for irreversible mixing in the ocean interior sjöberg and stigebrandt 1992 munk and wunsch 1998 rudnick et al 2003 internal tides of small vertical scale are more prone to instability than larger scale waves which can propagate over longer distances and dissipate far from their generation site olbers 1976 st laurent and garrett 2002 garrett and kunze 2007 to characterize the vertical scales of internal tides it is customary to describe their vertical wavenumber spectrum by a discrete set of vertical normal modes or equivalent modes the first few modes have been observed to travel up to several thousands of kilometres dushaw et al 1995 ray and mitchum 1996 zhao et al 2016 in contrast higher modes are thought to break into small scale turbulence within a relatively small radius of their emission this premise together with available maps of internal tide generation jayne and st laurent 2001 carrère and lyard 2003 nycander 2005 has been used to map the near field dissipation of internal tides and parameterize the associated mixing in ogcms it is commonly assumed that a fixed fraction of the power input to internal tides feeds local bottom intensified turbulence st laurent et al 2002 simmons et al 2004 this power fraction related to the modal content of internal tide generation is traditionally taken as one third based on turbulence observations from the brazil basin st laurent et al 2002 for lack of a global map of its spatial variations falahat et al 2014a most models do not explicitly represent the contribution of far field internal tide dissipation to mixing rather a fixed diffusivity of about 10 5 m2 s 1 is commonly prescribed as representative of background internal wave driven mixing e g jochum 2009 the power effectively consumed by this mixing is then not controlled nor tied to the supply of energy by external forcings in order to resolve this disconnect substantial effort has been deployed to refine our understanding of the generation propagation and dissipation of low mode internal tides mackinnon et al 2017 an estimate of the modal distribution of internal tide generation has been attained falahat et al 2014b further estimation of the direction of emission of energy beams is ongoing pollmann et al 2019 the propagation through variable stratification and geostrophic flows has been studied through a combination of in situ measurements satellite altimetry and high resolution numerical experiments and found to agree well with linear wave theory rainville and pinkel 2006 alford and zhao 2007b arbic et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 ray and zaron 2016 wave wave interactions have long been recognized as a conduit to wave breaking via downscale energy transfer olbers 1976 mccomas and bretherton 1977 müller et al 1986 henyey et al 1986 they are dominated by triadic wave instabilities also known as parametric subharmonic instability psi which are active equatorward of about 30 15 for the semidiurnal diurnal internal tides eden and olbers 2014 psi appears to be a significant sink of low mode energy but seemingly not the dominant dissipation pathway of the semidiurnal mode 1 tide hibiya et al 1998 alford et al 2007 hazewinkel and winters 2011 xie et al 2011 mackinnon et al 2013b sun and pinkel 2013 much attention has therefore been directed to the interaction of low mode waves with topography rays bouncing off small scale seafloor roughness lose energy through scattering to higher modes müller and xu 1992 st laurent and garrett 2002 bülher and holmes cerfon 2011 kelly et al 2013 beams reaching larger scale topographic obstacles can either reflect back to deeper waters dissipate at the slope shoal or undergo a combination of the latter their fate depends in a largely predictable way on the height and shape of the obstacle müller and liu 2000 johnston and merrifield 2003 nash et al 2004 klymak et al 2011 2013 mathur et al 2014 legg 2014 other dissipative processes such as wave capture or scattering by mesoscale eddies bühler and mcintyre 2005 polzin 2008 dunphy and lamb 2014 dunphy et al 2017 remain less well documented or quantified building on this progress steps toward comprehensive parameterization of tidal mixing have been taken niwa and hibiya 2011 constructed a horizontal map of low mode internal tide dissipation using high resolution ogcm experiments that include tidal forcing and a 30 day linear damping of baroclinic wave fluctuations such experiments allow investigation of the generation and propagation of the first few modes but they do not resolve the full wave spectrum and the inferred dissipation is dependent on model numerics and adjustable damping terms e g buijsman et al 2016 an alternative approach consists of calculating the horizontal propagation of depth integrated low mode energy through an observed or modelled stratification using linear wave theory and parameterized energy sinks eden and olbers 2014 this approach allows estimation of energy sinks due to specific processes known to produce specific vertical structures of dissipation e g melet et al 2016 thus paving the way for a comprehensive three dimensional mapping of internal tide driven mixing indeed the vertical distribution of far field dissipation is a key ingredient of internal wave driven mixing parameterizations de lavergne et al 2016a 2016b melet et al 2016 here we adapt and extend the framework developed by eden and olbers 2014 to construct climatological two dimensional maps of low mode dissipation broken down into four dissipative processes for the first five vertical modes of the three main tidal constituents we then sum the estimated low mode dissipation with the local dissipation of higher modes to obtain a horizontal map of the total internal tide dissipation this map shows fair agreement with full depth dissipation estimates from observed finescale strain kunze 2017a suggesting that the framework has potential to narrow the gap toward comprehensive mapping and parameterization of tidal mixing the presentation proceeds as follows the methodology including the estimation of energy sources energy sinks and beam trajectories is detailed in section 2 the resultant distributions of internal tide energy loss and their sensitivity to least constrained parameters of the calculation are presented in section 3 next we compare our results to independent observational estimates of internal wave energy dissipation section 4 and to previous global budgets of internal tide energy sinks section 5 limitations and perspectives are discussed in the concluding section details about the treatment of interactions with topographic slopes are provided in appendix a the rationale for choosing a lagrangian rather than eulerian propagation scheme is exposed in appendix b 2 method 2 1 strategy consider internal waves of given tidal frequency and vertical mode number their column integrated energy e is a function of time t geographical position r x y and angle ϕ of the horizontal wavevector k h the energy evolution is governed by eden and olbers 2014 1 t e div r ϕ f g d where f c g e is the horizontal energy transport by modal group velocity c g g is the position and angle dependent generation rate of the considered mode and d encapsulates energy sinks note that divergence of f includes both position propagation and angle refraction or reflection terms since c g is parallel to k h ϕ represents the direction of energy propagation in the horizontal our objective is to map the steady state dissipation d x y because propagation and dissipation depend on the frequency and mode number of the internal tide we separately consider each mode of the three most energetic tidal constituents m2 s2 and k1 egbert and ray 2003 we exploit the mode partitioned generation estimates of falahat et al 2014b section 2 2 propose simple formulations for the decay due to wave wave interactions section 2 3 1 and scattering off abyssal hills section 2 3 2 and introduce a geometric treatment of interactions with large scale topographic slopes section 2 3 3 propagation and refraction are modelled using linear wave theory applied to the annual mean woce global hydrographic climatology gouretski and koltermann 2004 we thus ignore time variations and build the steady state dissipation field by tracking individual energy beams from sources to sinks then summing over all beams section 2 4 this strategy resembles that of eden and olbers 2014 who solved eq 1 for the first mode m2 internal tide using the woce climatology a map of internal tide generation rates and parameterizations for energy transfers to high modes the present approach differs from theirs in the following principal ways i energy beams are tracked one by one using a lagrangian scheme rather than 1 being solved using eulerian advection schemes ii the first five vertical modes are treated individually iii interactions with large scale topographic slopes are explicitly modelled iv parameterization choices for wave wave interactions and topographic scattering differ 2 2 energy sources falahat et al 2014b developed a semi analytical model for the tidal generation of internal waves projected onto vertical normal modes using global observational climatologies of stratification gouretski and koltermann 2004 bathymetry smith and sandwell 1997 and barotropic tidal velocities egbert and erofeeva 2002 they mapped the generation rate of each of the first 10 modes of the semidiurnal m2 tide for the purpose of this study we calculated analogous maps for the semidiurnal s2 and diurnal k1 tides the global total power input to m2 s2 and k1 internal tides is 634 148 and 68 gw respectively 1 1 note that power values reported in falahat et al 2014b were uniformly overestimated by a factor of 1 11 due to a typographic error in their analysis script these integral values exclude seafloor depths 400 m where the calculation becomes unreliable due to violation of the assumptions of small tidal excursion and subcritical topography falahat et al 2014b they are only slightly lower than equivalent values derived from the same products and the non modal formulation of nycander 2005 680 150 and 83 gw for m2 s2 and k1 respectively the modal partitioning of global generation rates is similar for the two semidiurnal constituents table 1 modes 1 2 and 3 receive about 35 25 and 15 of the total energy flux respectively together modes 6 represent only about 10 of the total power however the latter fraction is a lower bound since it does not incorporate modes 11 which are not resolved by the calculation in particular abyssal hill topography which is absent from the 1 30 resolution etopo2v2 bathymetry product smith and sandwell 1997 is responsible for significant high mode 50 internal tide generation melet et al 2013 lefauve et al 2015 adding the m2 internal tide generation by abyssal hills as estimated by melet et al 2013 the power received by modes 6 rises to 23 of the m2 total table 1 generation over abyssal hills has not been estimated for the other tidal constituents compared to m2 and s2 k1 internal tide generation projects less strongly onto modes 1 2 which receive no more than 40 of the total flux table 1 this different modal distribution relates to the different spatial distribution of diurnal conversion which is dominated by hotspots in luzon strait and indonesian seas not shown total modes 1 10 generation rates integrated over the pacific atlantic and indian basins are shown as a function of seafloor depth in fig 1 for all three constituents and all three basins generation rates decrease with depth the decrease is sharper in the pacific which hosts 62 58 and 82 of the m2 s2 and k1 barotropic to baroclinic conversion respectively profiles of conversion predicted by the non modal formulation of nycander 2005 are very similar compare thin and thick curves in fig 1 however spatial maps of conversion reveal important differences as opposed to the non modal estimate fig 2c the calculation of falahat et al 2014b often predicts negative conversion rates fig 2a negative rates could be interpreted as baroclinic to barotropic conversion however it is not known whether such conversion actually occurs and it is unclear whether these apparent internal tide energy sinks can feasibly connect with the sources to circumvent the issue we apply a correction to each modal conversion field to remove negative values while preserving key integral properties specifically we set all negative values to zero and multiply the resulting field by a depth dependent correction factor to recover the original depth dependent generation rate integrated over each of the pacific atlantic and indian oceans this procedure is performed on each field at the original 1 30 resolution using a vertical bin size of 200 m we finally average generation rates onto the 0 5 resolution grid of the woce hydrographic climatology the resulting conversion rates of the m2 tide are shown in fig 2 summed over modes 1 to 10 the total corrected field fig 2b closely resembles its non modal counterpart fig 2c grid cells where the two fields agree within a factor of 2 cumulate 87 of the total power input of 634 gw we expect the slightly smoother patterns of the corrected field to be more realistic reflecting superior accuracy of the modal formulation demonstrated in test cases falahat et al 2014b corrected generation maps for each mode also display realistic patterns fig 2d g the western pacific including indonesian seas stands out as the main source region for the first few modes the western indian ocean and mid atlantic ridge are the next two most prominent generation regions as mode number increases power input gradually spreads from localized hotspots at abrupt topography such as hawaii to more distributed sources above flatter but corrugated topography such as ridge flanks in accord with theory and observations st laurent and nash 2004 falahat et al 2014a the estimated power input to modes 6 fig 2g is dominated by the contribution of abyssal hills and therefore by regions centred around slow spreading ridges goff 2010 similar trends are found for the conversion of s2 and k1 tides not shown in summary the applied correction for negative conversion rates introduces important uncertainties but produces plausible fields that are suitable for the present mode by mode global mapping exercise the generation of internal waves by the principal eight tidal constituents has been estimated by nycander 2005 excluding regions shallower than 400 m m2 accounts for 67 of the global energy flux summed over all constituents m2 s2 and k1 together account for 90 tidal constituents with proximate frequencies cause internal wave generation rates that differ in magnitude but little in distribution egbert and ray 2003 using m2 s2 and k1 as our best proxy for n2 k2 and the next three diurnal constituents respectively we estimate the mode by mode generation across all constituents as 2 g all 1 05 g m 2 1 09 g s 2 1 70 g k 1 where appropriate power ratios have been introduced including the contribution of abyssal hills we thus calculate that mode 1 takes up about 30 of the total internal tide generation table 1 the percentage decreases monotonically with mode number reducing to 5 at mode 5 these global percentages mask pronounced spatial contrasts fig 3 internal tides generated at continental slopes are dominantly mode 1 whereas those radiated off rough and less steep topography are dominantly mode 2 and higher modes 6 dominate over the global mid ocean ridge system the angular distribution of energy sources has not yet been mapped as a surrogate for such a map we use bathymetry information to direct energy sources away from large scale topographic slopes we fit planes to the etopo2v2 bathymetry over half degree grid squares find the vector normal to each of these planes obtain the angle ϕ g of that vector in the horizontal with respect to due east and distribute energy sources around ϕ g with a cosine weight 3 g ref x y ϕ 1 2 g x y max 0 cos ϕ ϕ g x y this distribution ensures that most of the energy radiates away from bathymetric slopes with no energy directed upslope most internal tide sources are focused in one direction zhao et al 2016 however propagation through the time variable eddying ocean tends to rapidly disperse time average energy fluxes rainville and pinkel 2006 alford and zhao 2007a zaron and egbert 2014 vic et al 2018 motivating the choice 3 of angularly distributed sources we examined sensitivity to this choice by running an additional experiment referred to as beam with 4 g beam x y ϕ g x y δ ϕ ϕ g x y in the numerical code eqs 3 and 4 are discretised at the angular resolution of π 30 eq 4 means that local energy sources are placed within a single angle bin that which contains ϕ g x y 2 3 energy sinks 2 3 1 wave wave interactions wave wave interactions constitute a prominent but poorly quantified dissipation pathway of low mode internal tides satellite altimetry allows tracking of low mode energy beams that remain coherent with the astronomical tide ray and mitchum 1996 zhao et al 2016 however loss of coherence means that satellite observations provide only an upper bound on the open ocean dissipation rate of low mode beams rainville and pinkel 2006 buijsman et al 2017 zaron 2017 other constraints are called for theory indicates that the decay rate due to wave wave interactions increases with mode number and is elevated equatorward of the psi latitude where the tidal frequency ω is twice the coriolis frequency f mccomas and müller 1981 hibiya et al 2002 eden and olbers 2014 observations of a beam travelling northeastward from hawaii suggest that psi barely attenuates the first mode semidiurnal internal tide in this region alford et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 mackinnon et al 2013b this is supported by dedicated numerical experiments hazewinkel and winters 2011 in which the energy loss of the mode 1 m2 tide was inferred to be 15 over 760 km using an appropriate local group speed of 2 5 m s 1 the latter estimate translates into an e folding decay time of 21 days we choose 20 days as a representative timescale over which mode 1 tides are damped by psi noting that in reality this timescale varies in space and time and decreases with the amplitude of the participating waves mackinnon et al 2013b sun and pinkel 2013 ansong et al 2018 attenuation of low modes by other wave wave interactions is thought to be an order of magnitude slower hibiya et al 1998 eden and olbers 2014 in situ observations northeast of hawaii suggest a decrease of diffusivity by a factor of 4 north of the m2 psi latitude 28 8 occurring over four latitude degrees with little concomitant change in stratification mackinnon et al 2013a we take the e folding decay time of mode 1 to increase fourfold over the same latitude span plateauing at 80 days poleward of the transition fig 4 for lack of independent constraints an analogous latitudinal variation is employed for s2 and k1 mode 1 tides taking into account their different psi latitudes 29 9 and 14 5 respectively note that linear free waves do not exist poleward of the turning latitude at which their frequency equals the inertial frequency m2 s2 and k1 horizontal energy fluxes are thus confined equatorward of 74 5 85 8 and 30 0 respectively we must also specify the dependence on mode of these attenuation rates evaluation by olbers 1983 of the transfer integral within a garrett munk wave spectrum suggests that decay times scale with the 2 power of mode number cf his fig 33 this approximate dependence might not be representative of all types of wave wave interactions nor of all types of wave fields eden and olbers 2014 lacking better knowledge of the relative efficiency of wave wave interactions as a function of mode we set the e folding decay time of mode number n as τ wwi n τ wwi 1 n 2 since the group speed is inversely proportional to mode number this choice means that wave wave interactions cut horizontal energy fluxes f by a factor 1 e over a length c g τ wwi proportional to 1 n 3 this decay length is shown in fig 5 for the first four modes of the m2 tide the group speed has been computed from the annual mean stratification of the woce climatology as llewellyn smith and young 2002 5 c g h nπ n 2 ω 2 3 2 ω 2 f 2 1 2 ω n 2 f 2 where n is the depth mean buoyancy frequency and h the ocean thickness shortest decay lengths occur within regions of weak depth integrated stratification such as shelves and polar seas where slow group velocities leave more time for wave wave interactions to act fig 5 away from these regions the decay length of the first mode m2 tide is typically a few 1000 km in the latitude range where psi is active and 10 000 km or more at higher latitudes by contrast the decay length of mode 2 is generally 1000 km that of mode 4 rarely exceeds 100 km the chosen latitude and mode dependence of the e folding time over which wave wave interactions erode low mode beams is broadly compatible with observations but remains largely a place holder awaiting refined representation of this energy cascade more complex and more realistic parameterizations of the rate at which low mode internal tides lose energy to the background wave field can be considered in future implementations as a first step in order to gauge the sensitivity of the calculation to the chosen timescales we performed two sensitivity experiments referred to as fast and slow in which e folding decay times are uniformly halved and doubled respectively 2 3 2 scattering by abyssal hills bühler and holmes cerfon 2011 studied the decay of a low mode internal tide as it bounces over random bottom topography they showed that the energy flux decays as exp λ sca r where the decay rate per unit horizontal distance r is a function of topography statistics only 6 λ sca 2 π π 2 h 2 e h r 2 e h r 2 topographic corrugations h r enter eq 6 through the probabilistic expectation e of their squared height and of their squared spatial derivative here we apply eq 6 to abyssal hill statistics mapped by goff 2010 the decay rate can be approximated in terms of the local rms height h rms and local mean horizontal wavenumber κ of abyssal hills as 7 λ sca 2 π 4 h 2 h rms 2 κ the corresponding e folding decay length λ sca 1 is shown in fig 6 scattering is efficient near ridge crests where the decay length is typically several 100 km but is weak over old or sediment rich seafloor the predicted decay rates do not depend on the frequency and mode number of the low mode internal tide and are a factor of 3 to 10 smaller than those estimated by eden and olbers 2014 by contrast they are roughly one order of magnitude stronger than deep ocean scattering rates of the first mode m2 tide calculated by kelly et al 2013 using the model of nycander 2005 and bathymetric variations resolved in etopo2v2 this would suggest that scattering by resolved scale topographic roughness in the abyss is negligible the role of topographic slopes resolved in current global bathymetric maps is considered next 2 3 3 interactions with topographic slopes the fate of a low mode internal tide impinging onto a large scale topographic obstacle depends on the ratio of the topographic slope to the ray path slope fig 7 the ray path slope or wave slope s follows from the dispersion relation as 8 s ω 2 f 2 n 2 ω 2 independent of mode number topographic slopes smaller than s termed subcritical allow the internal tide to bounce forward and shoal e g müller and liu 2000 legg 2014 those approximately equal to s termed critical cause a transfer of energy to very high modes and boundary turbulence e g eriksen 1982 legg and adcroft 2003 martini et al 2013 topographic slopes significantly steeper than the wave slope termed supercritical mainly result in the backward reflection of the internal tide e g klymak et al 2013 johnston et al 2015 these general principles allied with knowledge of the ocean s topography and stratification can be used to estimate a priori the transmitted reflected and dissipated fractions of incident energy fluxes the rationale is illustrated in fig 7 in the simplified situation of a three segment obstacle of height h immersed in constant stratification consider a horizontal energy beam or energy flux f b encountering shoaling topography this beam is made of individual rays travelling up and down the water column with slope s meeting the surface every 2h s of travelled horizontal distance we assume rays to be randomly distributed a reasonable assumption given decoherence of internal tides by the fluctuating ocean environment the fraction of f b dissipated at critical topography is first estimated as the proportion of rays encountering a near critical slope i e as the ratio of the horizontal length shown in red to the distance between consecutive bounces 2h s legg 2014 we define near critical slopes as those ranging between 0 8 and 1 5 s the approximate range over which critical reflection dominates muller and liu 2000 mathur et al 2014 legg 2014 next we calculate the reflected fraction as the portion of rays ultimately impinging on supercritical topography slopes exceeding 1 5 s the remaining fraction of the energy flux is transmitted transmitted internal tides undergo shoaling which may cause their direct breaking via increase of their energy density and shear legg 2014 we further parameterize the fractional dissipation of the transmitted flux due to shoaling as h h 2 a simplifying approximation based on the model results of legg 2014 cf her figs 6 and 14 as detailed in appendix a this geometric treatment of interactions with bathymetric slopes can be generalized to depth varying stratification and arbitrary topography dissipated reflected and transmitted fractions were estimated within each grid column of the 0 5 resolution woce climatology for each of the four cardinal directions and each of the three tidal constituents using depth varying wave slopes and 1 30 resolution bathymetric variations dissipation and reflection are zero in downslope directions except at crests whose specific treatment is outlined in appendix a with non uniform stratification the fractional dissipation due to shoaling of the transmitted energy flux becomes the square of the wkb scaled bathymetric rise h h h ndz 0 h ndz 2 where z is depth h is the local ocean thickness and h is the thickness of a shallower neighbouring grid column this simple parameterization neglects the dependence on froude number of shoaling driven wave breaking legg 2014 likely underestimating overestimating fractional dissipation of most least energetic transmitted waves a low bias of shoaling induced dissipation could be implied on average though uncertainties make a more detailed assessment premature fig 8 shows the estimated fractions for m2 there are four values for four directions at each grid point we show the maximum of the four usually corresponding to the direction along which topography shoals most rapidly energy loss due to shoaling is substantial at the shelf break and shoreward but quasi negligible elsewhere critical and supercritical topography primarily consists of continental slopes in accord with previous studies e g kelly et al 2013 johnston et al 2015 klymak et al 2016 supercritical reflection generally dominates implying that much of the internal tide energy reaching continental slopes turns back to the open ocean nonetheless the estimated fractional dissipation at critical slopes is significant around most of the open ocean s perimeter and is non negligible near ridge crests and major fractures or seamounts the s2 tidal constituent has a frequency close to that of m2 and therefore has similar ray paths and similar transmission reflection dissipation characteristics as m2 in contrast the lower frequency of k1 internal tides means that their ray paths are less steep implying fewer but more often supercritical encounters with the bottom as a result k1 energy reflection at continental slopes is proportionately large not shown 2 4 energy propagation to quantify and map the modelled energy sinks we propagate energy fluxes from generation sites through climatological stratification accounting for refraction and for reflection at supercritical slopes we adopt a lagrangian approach beams are tracked one by one throughout their lifecycle the procedure for a given beam is the following the energy flux f b carried by the beam emerges from the centre of the generation grid cell x y at an angle ϕ with respect to the east with magnitude g x y ϕ we first determine the exact position it reaches along the grid cell perimeter and save the energy lost to wave wave interactions within the generation grid cell the beam tracing algorithm is then identical from grid cell to grid cell 1 given the angle of f b we find the next grid cell edge and position along that edge reached by f b and determine crossed distance δr 2 the dissipation by wave wave interactions and by scattering off abyssal hills within the traversed grid cell are saved f b is reduced accordingly 3 the angle of f b is updated due to refraction 4 the magnitude and emission angle of reflected energy flux are saved the dissipation due to critical slopes is saved f b is updated 5 the dissipation due to shoaling is saved f b is updated these steps are repeated until f b becomes negligibly small refraction along path r of the beam follows from ϕ arctan k y k x d k h dt ω and the dispersion relation as 9 dϕ dr f f ω 2 f 2 h h n n n 2 ω 2 sin ϕ cos ϕ interactions with topographic slopes are performed last because they apply to bathymetric variations from the traversed grid cell to the next the emission angle of reflected fluxes is determined by specular reflection against plane fits to the 1 30 c resolution bathymetry the remainder of slope interactions do not depend on the exact incident angle but only on the appropriate cardinal direction a practical but reasonable simplification kelly et al 2013 see appendix a specular reflection at the land ocean boundary ensures no energy is lost the latter reflected fluxes are found to be very small the sequence above is applied to all source triplets x y ϕ characterised by g x y ϕ 0 next the source term g is replaced by the saved field of reflected fluxes and the whole procedure repeated five such iterations suffice to reach a total dissipation within 1 of the total generation we perform the calculation for each of m2 s2 and k1 and each of the first five modes we find that barely any mode 6 internal tide energy escapes generation grid cells given the modelled attenuation rates see propagation distances in table 2 using a π 30 angular resolution for g the calculation for a single mode takes between a few minutes mode 5 and a few hours mode 1 to complete on a laptop computer this makes the framework well suited for sensitivity studies by treating modes 1 to 5 independently we have implicitly assumed that there is no exchange of energy between these low modes in other words we have assumed that i dissipative processes transfer energy directly to locally dissipating modes or to small scale turbulence and ii propagation and supercritical reflection do not alter the modal content of low mode beams assumption i is justified for the modelled interactions with topography thought to generate small scale motions bühler and holmes cerfon 2011 nash et al 2004 legg 2014 psi also tends to generate relatively high vertical wavenumbers hibiya et al 1998 2002 nonetheless wave wave interactions or interactions with vortical flows not modelled here may cascade energy from one low mode to another mccomas and bretherton 1977 dunphy and lamb 2014 such transfers presently lack quantification and are thus not considered here assumption ii is unlikely to hold everywhere open ocean propagation can be assumed to preserve mode number rainville and pinkel 2006 however reflection at supercritical slopes generally alters the modal content of energy fluxes müller and liu 2000 klymak et al 2016 to explore the impact of wavenumber modification upon reflection we carried an additional experiment termed exch where only half the magnitude of reflected fluxes conserves the mode number of incident fluxes the other half is equally distributed among higher propagating modes n 5 it is saved as an additional energy source for these modes experiment exch thus demonstrates the feasibility of including a downscale energy transfer between low modes 3 results 3 1 energy transport and content we begin by illustrating the energy redistribution accomplished by the first mode m2 internal tide example beam trajectories originating from three source grid cells with three different emission angles each are depicted in fig 9 relatively slow open ocean attenuation particularly poleward of 30 allows the beams to travel over basin scales most beams lose significant energy at continental slopes and give birth to one or several reflected beams refraction acts to bend trajectories i toward the equator and ii toward weaker depth integrated stratification effect ii steers beams into shallower regions increasing the total mode 1 dissipation due to critical reflection and shoaling by a few percent not shown effect i diminishes the energy transport to high latitudes for example if refraction is unaccounted for the predicted mode 1 dissipation south of 60 s increases by 30 horizontal energy fluxes accumulated across all beams shown in fig 10a b highlight prominent regions of first mode semidiurnal internal tide activity hotspots include waters around madagascar indonesia new zealand french polynesia hawaii east of china and japan and west of morocco and europe to assess the realism of our framework we compare m2 mode 1 energy transports of the ref and beam experiments fig 10a b to those extracted from satellite observations of sea surface height fig 10e zhao et al 2016 all hotspots listed above also stand out in the satellite derived map conversely only one observed hotspot is not captured here the continental slope of northeastern brazil colocated hotspots indicate that major sites of m2 mode 1 generation are accurately placed in the corrected conversion field fig 2d however transports detected in satellite observations are much weaker than their counterparts in ref and beam the present global rate of first mode m2 internal tide generation 213 gw is on the low side of previously estimated ranges 0 1 0 5 tw kelly et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 so that substantial overestimation of energy sources is unlikely alternative explanations for the discrepancy include i limited detection of internal tides propagating perpendicularly to satellite tracks ii absence of incoherent internal tide energy fluxes in the satellite map because satellite tracks are generally oriented in the north south direction the high pass filter applied to sea surface height data tends to suppress east west oriented waves zhao et al 2016 zhao 2018 this suppression is conspicuous in the aggregate angular distribution of energy transports largely north south in the satellite product fig 10f red but largely isotropic and dominantly eastbound in the ref and beam experiments fig 10f blue and black to mimic the suppression of eastbound westbound waves we multiply local angle resolved transports of ref and beam by the red curve in fig 10f that is by the aggregate angular distribution of satellite derived transports normalized by its maximum the resulting maps of energy transports fig 10c d are in better agreement with the observational map fig 10e both in terms of magnitude and spatial patterns in particular the global energy content in ref beam decreases from 165 172 to 64 69 pj a level more comparable to the 36 pj reported by zhao et al 2016 masking out regions unmapped in zhao et al 2016 further reduces by 10 pj the energy content in ref and beam the remaining mismatch likely reflect loss of coherence particularly in the equatorial band shriver et al 2014 buijsman et al 2017 zaron 2017 where satellite derived transports are much weaker than those modelled here comparison with satellite observed internal tides also illustrates biases in the angular distribution of sources in ref and beam the ref energy emission is too diffuse whereas the beam experiment underestimates angular spreading at and away from sources the source orientation ϕ g deduced from topography appears to be a decent approximation at some but not all prominent generation sites future work should strive to constrain the angle dependence of generation and to model the dispersion of energy beams by fluctuating currents and stratification here only a preliminary assessment of the sensitivity of dissipation to angular spreading will be performed by contrasting ref and beam experiments we henceforth focus on the ref experiment sensitivity will be examined in section 3 3 table 2 summarizes global characteristics of m2 low mode energy propagation on average energy in the first mode travels 1440 km at a speed of 2 3 m s 1 the corresponding mean residence time is 9 days because the e folding length of attenuation by wave wave interactions is proportional to 1 n 3 travel distance and energy content decrease sharply with mode number the distribution of the energy content among modes 1 to 5 resembles local estimates from mooring observations zhao et al 2010 vic et al 2018 cumulated over the first five modes the global energy content of m2 internal tides approaches 300 pj in the range of extrapolations from in situ observations alford and zhao 2007a kelly et al 2013 mode 5 internal tide energy travels only 68 km on average so that its dissipation is near local 3 2 energy dissipation the contrasting propagation characteristics of modes 1 to 5 translate into contrasting distributions of dissipation fig 11 the first mode is the only one capable of redistributing energy on planetary scales and is therefore the main contributor to dissipation in regions remote from important generation sites e g at southern high latitudes despite this redistribution the dissipation of the first mode m2 tide remains focused around major source regions namely the western indian western pacific and mid atlantic and equatorward of 30 fig 11a we estimate that wave wave interactions and scattering off abyssal hills in the open ocean contribute 45 of the dissipation of the mode 1 m2 tide leaving substantial energy loss at continental slopes and shelves table 2 dissipation becomes increasingly clustered around energy sources fig 11b f and increasingly dominated by the contribution of wave wave interactions table 2 as mode number increases whereas interactions with topography account for the bulk 72 of the dissipation of the first mode this balance is reversed at higher modes wave wave interactions monopolise 74 90 96 and 99 of the dissipation of mode 2 mode 3 mode 4 and mode 5 respectively a small fraction of the energy loss by wave wave interactions occurs on shelves defined here by h 400 m so that the percentages of dissipation by open ocean wave wave interactions given in table 2 are slightly lower dissipation summed over modes 1 to 5 is shown in fig 12 for each tidal constituent the spatial pattern of energy loss by low mode s2 internal tides is very similar to that of m2 low modes however s2 dissipation extends further into polar oceans and is about four times weaker diurnal k1 internal tides are less energetic still and their dissipation is focused in the tropical western pacific fig 12c in particular there is substantial energy loss near the two dominant k1 generation sites luzon strait and the indonesian archipelago but almost no activity in the atlantic basin low mode dissipation patterns also reflect the uneven distribution of decay rates dissipation tends to be enhanced over rough or steep topography and equatorward of psi latitudes even though psi decay times are uniform there is a slight enhancement of dissipation near the psi latitudes 30 for s2 and m2 15 for k1 relative to lower latitudes due to energy travelling from higher latitudes into the region of active psi the decomposition by process of the total dissipation of modes 1 5 is broadly similar across the three tidal constituents table 3 though k1 has somewhat larger percentage dissipation from shoaling and wave wave interactions because they act everywhere and powerfully on modes 2 wave wave interactions dominate causing about 60 of the overall low mode dissipation only 5 of the dissipation occurs in marginal seas shallower than 400 m implying that most of the low mode energy approaching continental margins is reflected or dissipated before crossing the shelf break shoaling and critical slopes together account for about 25 of the low mode dissipation guided by the similar dissipation distributions of m2 and s2 we estimate the total dissipation across the eight most energetic tidal constituents as 10 d all 1 05 d m 2 1 09 d s 2 1 70 d k 1 analogous to eq 2 the global integral of d all is 1044 gw equal to that of g all of this total internal tide energy loss rate fig 13f we estimate that 217 gw or 21 is the local dissipation of modes 6 fig 13e the remaining 827 gw transit through lower modes but eventually power small scale turbulence via four modelled routes of the energy cascade fig 13a d and table 3 wave wave interactions 521 gw or 63 scattering by small scale seafloor roughness 83 gw or 10 near critical reflection 128 gw or 15 and shoaling 95 gw or 12 the obtained global maps of internal tide energy sinks possess plausible distinct patterns that integrate present knowledge of the topography stratification internal tide generation beam propagation and beam degradation 3 3 sensitivity experiments multiple assumptions and approximations underlie the maps of internal tide energy sinks the angular distribution of sources attenuation rates by wave wave interactions and preservation of mode number upon reflection rank among key choices we have made to explore sensitivity to these choices we examine four variants of the reference ref calculation beam a single beam emanates from each source grid cell in the direction normal to topographic slope fast e folding decay times due to wave wave interactions are halved slow e folding decay times due to wave wave interactions are doubled exch mode n horizontal energy fluxes that reflect at supercritical slopes become 50 mode n and 50 equally partitioned into modes n 1 to 5 changes to the partitioning by process of low mode dissipation are summarised in table 3 and changes to the maps of total dissipation illustrated in fig 14 the beam experiment leads to a more heterogeneous spatial structure of dissipation but has virtually unchanged process contributions to the overall dissipation larger changes occur under modified decay times wave wave interactions in the open ocean contribute 51 and 71 of the modes 1 5 dissipation in slow and fast respectively bracketing the ref contribution of 61 opposite tendencies are implied for the dissipation due to interactions with topography in particular the summed percentage contribution of critical slopes and shoaling climbs from 18 in fast to 31 in slow representing an increase from 150 to 253 gw over the factor of 4 range of decay times explored sensitivity of the process distribution of dissipation is thus sizeable but linear this overall sensitivity is reflected in the difference maps fig 14e f relative to its ref and fast counterparts internal tide energy loss in slow is less focused around the main source regions and is elevated along basin perimeters reflection of first mode energy is substantial in ref mode 1 reflected fluxes total 88 24 and 13 gw for m2 s2 and k1 respectively transferring half of reflected fluxes to higher modes accelerates the degradation of low mode beams effectively augmenting damping by wave wave interactions and reducing energy fluxes impinging on continental slopes as a result the exch experiment entails modifications analogous albeit smaller to those obtained in fast table 3 and fig 14d f faster beam degradation also lowers the energy content of low mode internal tides for example first mode m2 internal tide energy totals 198 pj in slow but only 141 pj in exch and 127 pj in fast refined constraints on energy content if attainable could therefore help to reduce uncertainties in bulk attenuation rates 4 comparison to finestructure observations estimates of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy from measured microscale velocity fluctuations are relatively sparse waterhouse et al 2014 estimates of the dissipation rate of internal wave energy from the finescale strain observed in ctd profiles are much more abundant whalen et al 2015 kunze 2017a the latter estimates rely on a parameterization henyey et al 1986 gregg 1989 polzin et al 1995 whose underlying assumptions and implementation choices imply larger uncertainties polzin et al 2014 for individual strain based estimates the uncertainty tied to parameter choices is thought to be a factor of 3 to 5 kunze 2017a pollmann et al 2017 here we employ the global dataset of kunze 2017a who estimated dissipation from vertical strain contained in ship based hydrographic casts four characteristics of this dataset make it most suitable for comparison with present maps of column integrated internal tide energy loss i wide geographical coverage ii full depth extent of most profiles iii theoretical restriction to energy lost by the internal wave field and iv degree of spatio temporal averaging implicit in the parameterization whalen et al 2015 the dataset downloaded from ftp nwra com outgoing kunze iwturb contains dissipation rates ϵ w kg 1 and diffusivities k ρ m2 s 1 applying to half overlapping 256 m segments spanning each hydrographic profile we first calculated an average dissipation profile within each sampled half degree grid cell of the woce climatology values at depths 400 m are often unreliable due to presence of the surface mixed layer kunze 2017a taking a similar approach to kunze 2017a we approximated dissipation at depths z 400 m as ϵ z k ρ z 400 m n 2 z r f where n is the local climatological buoyancy frequency k ρ the finestructure inferred diffusivity and r f 0 2 the mixing efficiency assumed in the finescale parameterization this conservative prolongation of dissipation profiles to the surface rests upon the scaling ϵ z n 2 z typical of internal wave breaking in the upper ocean gregg 1989 but could underestimate the shallow dissipation in particular breaking of near inertial internal waves generated by atmospheric storms pollard 1970 is expected to be underrepresented in the profiles an expectation reinforced by the bias of ship based sampling toward moderate winds next we dismissed profiles that cover 90 of the total water column stratification i e such that ϵ r n 2 dz 0 9 n 2 dz this criterion excludes 6 of profiles we finally integrate dissipation ϵ times the seawater density ρ over the whole water column to obtain depth integrated internal wave energy dissipation rates the spatial pattern of the finestructure inferred dissipation exhibits strong similarities to the mapped internal tide energy loss fig 15 dissipation in the indian ocean is focused in the western half of the basin generally decreasing away from madagascar dissipation in the pacific is focused in the western tropics and relatively weak along a crescent joining the northern eastern and southern portions of the deep basin dissipation in the atlantic is relatively high above the mid atlantic ridge but tends to have weaker large scale contrasts than in the indo pacific dissipation in the southern ocean is generally weak except for hotspots near the southwest indian ridge macquarie ridge and drake passage a more quantitative comparison is presented in fig 16a for the global ocean and in fig 17 for separate basins the qualitative similarities outlined above translate into a global correlation of 0 41 between the finestructure and ref dissipations when computed using the logarithm of dissipation values the global correlation coefficient becomes 0 55 the correlation is strongest in the pacific and indian oceans and weakest in the atlantic all correlation coefficients have high statistical significance p value indistinguishable from zero encouraging agreement in magnitudes is also observed figs 15c and 16a 65 80 of values agree within a factor of 3 factor of 5 clear discrepancies also emerge from the comparison first the mapped tidal dissipation displays a slight pattern amplification compared to the observational dataset the ref experiment generally predicts somewhat larger rates in the most dissipative regions and somewhat weaker rates in more quiescent open ocean areas fig 15c this could indicate a lack of energy redistribution in our calculation possibly related to overestimated transfers to dissipation biases in the finestructure estimates notably in regions of strong forcing hibiya et al 2012 waterman et al 2014 thurnherr et al 2015 bouruet aubertot et al 2018 could also contribute to the pattern of differences superimposed on this broad pattern is a second more significant mismatch the ref dissipation is substantially lower than that estimated by kunze 2017a in five important regions namely the western boundary of the atlantic the agulhas region the region west and south of australia the kuroshio region and the southeast pacific sector of the southern ocean fig 15c these discrepancies are most pronounced in the atlantic and southern oceans leading to weaker overall agreement compared to the indo pacific fig 17 the large underestimates by ref of the finestructure inferred dissipation consistently occur in the regions of atmospheric and or oceanic storm tracks this suggests that non tidal forcings or non modelled interactions dominate in these areas possible contributors to the observed dissipation include i breaking of wind powered near inertial waves perhaps catalysed by mesoscale ocean eddies kunze 1985 zhai et al 2007 jing and wu 2014 ii high mode internal wave generation by eddies interacting with topography notably along western boundaries zhai et al 2010 nikurashin and ferrari 2010 clément et al 2016 pollmann et al 2017 iii scattering of low mode internal tides by mesoscale eddies dunphy and lamb 2014 to evaluate the ability of the energy source i to bridge the gap between the ref and finestructure dissipations we employed an estimate of the atmospheric power input to near inertial motions rimac et al 2013 and assumed that a 10 20 fraction of this power fuels near inertial waves that break in the near local water column furuichi et al 2008 zhai et al 2009 cuypers et al 2013 jouanno et al 2016 this additional dissipation barely modifies the overall correlation with finestructure data but raises the agreement within a factor of 3 factor of 5 to 72 74 88 of all values fig 16c d order of magnitude underestimates only persist along the western boundary of the atlantic not shown calling for additional contributions there importantly the ref mapping of internal tide energy dissipation has not been tuned to match the finestructure data other experiments compare similarly with the observational dataset table 4 agreement within a factor of 3 ranges from 63 in beam and fast to 67 in slow hence comparison lends confidence that both the present approach and the finescale parameterization have skill in mapping the energy flow from internal waves to small scale turbulence to put this skill in context we mapped the dissipation implied by a standard ogcm parameterization of internal wave driven mixing fig 14b and compared it to the finestructure dataset fig 16b as in the nemo model mignot et al 2013 near field mixing is parameterized using one third of the local power input to internal tides nycander 2005 and far field mixing is represented by a fixed diffusivity equal to 10 5 m2 s 1 except for a reduction around the equator and under sea ice applied to the woce climatology this ogcm parameterization implies a total power consumption of 920 gw and generally yields order of magnitude agreement with the observational dissipation rates fig 16b however the depth integrated dissipation implied by the ogcm parameterization varies mostly with latitude and misses the large spatial contrasts of far field mixing evident in the observations 5 comparison with previous budgets whether continental slopes and shelves host an important proportion of low mode internal tide energy loss remains a matter of debate kelly et al 2013 argued that the first mode semidiurnal tide loses the bulk of its energy at large scale topographic obstacles in contrast eden and olbers 2014 estimated that wave wave interactions and scattering off abyssal hills in the open ocean contribute 90 of the dissipation of the first mode m2 tide our estimate lies in between interactions with large scale topographic obstacles account for about half of the dissipation of the mode 1 m2 tide table 2 the lesser role attributed to basin margins by eden and olbers 2014 stems from different parameterization choices they estimated the open ocean attenuation timescale to be o 1 day compared to o 10 days here the latter timescale seems to better accord with the observed long range propagation of the first mode m2 internal tide zhao and alford 2009 dushaw et al 2011 waterhouse et al 2018 however we emphasize that dissipation characteristics of the first vertical mode are not representative of the overall non local internal tide dissipation in agreement with mooring observations zhao et al 2010 vic et al 2018 we find that modes 2 5 also accomplish important horizontal energy redistribution yet because of stronger damping by wave wave interactions this redistribution occurs over distances that are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that associated with mode 1 as a result dissipation in the basins interior away from continental slopes and shelves accounts for 65 80 of the total modes 1 5 dissipation of 827 gw and is dominated by wave wave interactions table 3 the presence of substantial low mode dissipation in the open ocean concurs with inferences from high resolution ogcm simulations ansong et al 2015 buijsman et al 2016 according to present calculations the proportion of low mode dissipation occurring in marginal seas shallower than 400 m is only 4 6 table 3 a comparison between available microstructure measurements of water column dissipation rates and estimated internal wave generation rates suggested a higher proportion of 30 waterhouse et al 2014 nevertheless it was recognized that this inferred residual may also incorporate under sampled continental slopes the higher proportion could also reflect in part a bias of microstructure sampling toward regions of strong forcing where the ratio of water column dissipation to generation tends to be low kunze 2017a fig 18 shows the distribution of the ratio of internal tide dissipation to generation d g according to the ref calculation because sources are more localised than sinks the ratio exceeds 1 over the vast majority of the ocean area the bulk 64 of the dissipation also occurs at ratios above 1 in contrast 72 of the total internal tide generation occurs in locations where generation exceeds dissipation these distributions of d g reflect the substantial energy redistribution achieved by low mode beams and illustrate the difficulty of predicting dissipation rates from generation rates alone 6 conclusions mapping the breaking of internal tides is a long standing challenge of oceanography munk 1966 here we proposed a framework for estimating the geography of internal tide energy sinks and applied it to the contemporary ocean the framework builds upon the pioneering work of eden and olbers 2014 recent calculations of internal tide generation projected onto vertical normal modes falahat et al 2014b and the growing understanding of the downscale cascade of internal tide energy mackinnon et al 2017 it consists of tracking every internal tide energy beam from generation to dissipation through observed stratification accounting for refraction and for reflection against supercritical topography using the woce global hydrographic climatology generation maps for the three most energetic tidal constituents m2 s2 and k1 and simplified representations of dissipation via interactions with topography and with the ambient wave field we constructed a global horizontal map of internal tide energy loss fig 13f decomposed into contributing dissipative processes fig 13a e different breaking pathways produce distinct vertical structures of dissipation by coupling each map of column integrated energy dissipation with an appropriate vertical structure three dimensional maps of dissipation and diffusivity may be built such maps could then serve to refine estimates of water mass transformation in the ocean interior e g de lavergne et al 2017 kunze 2017b to constrain inverse estimates of ocean circulation e g ganachaud and wunsch 2000 groeskamp et al 2017 or to parameterize internal tide driven mixing in ogcms e g eden et al 2014 melet et al 2016 these applications may in turn illuminate the impact of each dissipative process on ocean circulation and the sensitivity of circulation to the assumptions and choices made in the mapping procedure two principal limitations of the framework must be underlined first the choice to track low mode energy beams one by one and then sum over all beams to recover the total dissipation disallows a straightforward treatment of nonlinear interactions between beams for example if the efficiency of a dissipative process at some location depends on the total low mode energy at this location such dependence cannot be easily factored in only the energy carried by the beam being tracked has thus been used to diagnose its contribution to dissipation in return the adopted lagrangian approach avoids the numerical diffusion dispersion of energy fluxes produced by eulerian advection schemes see appendix b this is a key advantage if the trajectories and energy levels of observed beams are to be reproduced and if the eddy modulated dispersion of energy fluxes is to be explicitly represented second implementation of the lagrangian calculation within a running ogcm is fraught with challenges related to the number of beams and to the complexity and stratification dependence of interactions with topographic slopes presently the framework is designed to produce static dissipation maps appropriate to a given mean ocean state several elements suggest that such static maps can still serve ogcm applications i they can replace maps of internal tide generation as the power available to the model s tidal mixing parameterization ii such a parameterization could obviate the need for a fixed background diffusivity ensuring mixing is energy constrained and obviate the computational cost of an interactive representation of low mode energy propagation iii we expect the sensitivity of the global horizontal distribution of dissipation to changes in stratification to be modest as is the case of internal tide generation egbert et al 2004 iv the vertical structure of dissipation most crucial for ocean ventilation de lavergne et al 2016a can be coupled to the evolving model stratification v the maps could be updated at distant times of a simulation if large changes in the simulated ocean state warrant doing so limitations of the present application to the modern ocean are numerous primary among them is the ad hoc representation of low mode energy loss through wave wave interactions we chose decay times that depend only and crudely on latitude and mode number since this a nonlinear process the decay time should in reality also depend on the amplitude of the internal wave field further work is required to assess our choices and incorporate more realistic variations of decay rates so as to reduce the uncertainty attached to this dominant sink of internal tide energy the modelled interactions with topographic slopes also suffer from important approximations in particular we did not account for the dependence on froude number of the near critical slope range and of the fractional energy loss due to shoaling legg 2014 additional uncertainty originates from the estimation of energy sources which demanded a correction for the negative values present in modal generation fields falahat et al 2014b and an arbitrary choice for the angular distribution of energy emission substantial uncertainty in the dissipation maps also stems from processes that have not been explicitly modelled not least are interactions between low mode beams and geostrophic flows whose role in the spreading and downscale cascade of energy rainville and pinkel 2006 dunphy and lamb 2014 buijsman et al 2017 deserves more attention in spite of these uncertainties the estimated maps of internal tide energy sinks appear to be plausible and broadly compatible with available observations most of the energy generated at hawaii radiates away and feeds dissipation across the pacific klymak et al 2006 alford et al 2007 most of the energy travelling from macquarie ridge toward tasmania reflects or dissipates at the tasman continental slope johnston et al 2015 waterhouse et al 2018 most of the dissipation in the eastern brazil basin originates from locally generated high modes polzin 2004 indonesian seas host 10 of both the total source and total loss of internal tide energy koch larrouy et al 2007 patterns and magnitudes of the mapped internal tide dissipation compare well with observational internal wave dissipation estimates along hydrographic sections of the world ocean kunze 2017a regional discrepancies with the latter dataset are consistent with significant local dissipation of wind generated near inertial waves jing and wu 2014 and are suggestive of mesoscale eddy energy loss to internal waves near western

declarations of interest none appendix a interactions with topographic slopes the geometric treatment of interactions with topographic slopes resolved in the etopo2v2 bathymetry product follows the rationale of fig 7 accounting for topographic complexities and depth variations of the ray path slope here we detail the calculation of relevant fractions considering the example of a grid column i j of the woce climatology whose eastern neighbour i 1 j is shallower as sketched in fig a1 the thickness h of the column is the average of the 15 15 etopo2v2 bathymetric values contained in the half degree cell i j the buoyancy frequency n is known at each level of the woce climatology and extrapolated to the bottom where necessary the energy flux f b of a beam exiting the grid square i j through its boundary with i 1 j interacts with longitudinal topographic segments connecting h i j to h i 1 j to determine the fraction of f b encountering critical or supercritical topography we begin by calculating the wave slope s at each level using eq 8 next we apply the same procedure to each of the 15 longitudinal rows of 29 topography segments covering i j and i 1 j from west to east find the first bathymetric value less than h i j and the first value less than h i 1 j or points a and b respectively fig a1 ignore segments west of a and east of b this ensures f b does not interact twice with the same topography calculate the effective horizontal projection or projected length l x δx δh s of each topographic segment here δx and δh are the horizontal length and the positive or negative eastward height increment of a single segment respectively from west to east find the first segment that has a negative projected length point r if such a segment exists sum l x cumulatively eastward until it becomes positive point r set all l x values to zero between r and r repeat eastward from r this procedure accounts for shadowing i e for the presence of downsloping segments invisible to rays find topographic segments whose slope δh δx lies between 0 8s and 1 5s and sum their projected lengths l x to obtain the critical projected length of the whole row from east to west find the first segment whose slope exceeds 1 5s follow a ray path backward from the top of this segment point s until it encounters the seafloor point s sum all non critical projected lengths l x between s and s repeat westward from s cumulate the summed projected lengths to obtain the supercritical projected length of the whole row the critical supercritical projected length is then averaged over the 15 rows and divided by the distance between two consecutive bounces 2 0 h i j s 1 dz to yield the fraction of f b dissipated reflected at the slope the remaining transmitted flux loses another fraction of its magnitude through shoaling the latter fraction is estimated as h i 1 j h i j ndz 0 h i j ndz 2 a crude approximation based on the model results of legg 2014 fractions are calculated for each tidal constituent each half degree grid cell and each of the four cardinal directions they are set to zero in the directions along which h increases except for crest grid cells where h increases in opposite directions indeed we find that grid columns straddling the crests of mid ocean ridges host significant critical dissipation their relatively high bottom stratification implies relatively small wave slopes that often match those of the topography to obtain critical and supercritical projected lengths at a crest cell the procedure detailed above is applied to the 15 rows of 14 topography segments contained in the cell defining point b as the shallowest topographic point in each row the distance between consecutive bounces is calculated as previously the fraction dissipated through shoaling becomes h b i j h i j ndz 0 h i j ndz 2 with h b the bathymetric depth at point b averaged over the 15 rows premises implicit in this local geometric analysis include i 0 5 is an appropriate horizontal resolution to estimate transmission reflection dissipation fractions ii internal tides behave as individual rays of infinitesimal width that are randomly distributed in the horizontal iii effects of non normal incidence can be neglected premises i and ii relate to the horizontal scale most relevant to interactions between a low mode beam and a topographic obstacle this scale is thought to be o 10 100 km comparable to the wavelength of the incident low mode internal tide nash et al 2004 kunze and llewellyn smith 2004 this suggests that 0 5 is an appropriate resolution for the analysis but that accounting for topographic variations down to a horizontal resolution of 3 km may be superfluous the calculated fractions should thus be interpreted as best estimates of the likelihood that transmission reflection dissipation dominates in any half degree grid cell we also note that the effective resolution of the etopo2v2 bathymetry map is closer to 10 km over most of the ocean falahat et al 2014b premise ii also entails that we ignore complexities related to the interplay between rays and modes which can modulate interactions with topography klymak et al 2011 premise iii is a practical choice dictated by the longitude latitude grid of bathymetry and stratification climatologies fractions in non cardinal directions could be estimated using bathymetric fields interpolated onto rotated grids however such added complexity was deemed unwarranted here given other uncertainties in the global mapping and given evidence that oblique incidence has only a modest overall impact kelly et al 2013 appendix b lagrangian versus eulerian propagation consider a beam of initial magnitude f b and orientation ϕ in the lagrangian framework the beam propagates from one grid cell to the next changing direction and magnitude as it interacts with the environment but retaining a single orientation and infinitesimal width at any given time in an eulerian framework energy transports are not attached to beams but instead to a discrete three dimensional longitude latitude angle grid a numerical scheme propagates f b from the source cell to neighbouring cells depending on the beam angle ϕ unless ϕ matches exactly one of the grid s underlying directions the beam will necessarily be divided between two grid cells each receiving a fraction of f b further splitting will occur at the next iteration resulting in numerical spreading of energy transports refraction also causes numerical diffusion unless the shift in angle over one time step is an exact multiple of the angular resolution energy transports split into adjoining discrete angles numerical choices advection schemes resolution can alleviate but not eliminate diffusion dispersion inherent to discretisation in the eulerian framework to illustrate these effects we calculated m2 mode 1 energy transports in the beam experiment using an eulerian fig b1b instead of the lagrangian fig b1a propagation scheme in the eulerian framework all beams propagate simultaneously feeding a three dimensional field of energy fluxes f x y ϕ f is iteratively updated until steady state is achieved i e until the global dissipation rate matches the global generation rate to mitigate numerical diffusion the propagation scheme allows direct communication between cardinal as well as diagonal neighbours over one iteration a given beam feeds two among its eight contiguous grid cells depending on its orientation ϕ substantial numerical spreading is nonetheless apparent in the comparatively diffuse distribution of energy transports produced by the eulerian scheme fig b1 furthermore spreading is not uniform over all orientations transports that retain a beam like structure are those oriented in cardinal or diagonal directions along which propagation is less dispersive this artificial segregation of beams depending on their orientation is amplified at higher angular resolution offsetting potential gains of resolution increases 
24038,internal tides power much of the observed small scale turbulence in the ocean interior to represent mixing induced by this turbulence in ocean climate models the cascade of internal tide energy to dissipation scales must be understood and mapped here we present a framework for estimating the geography of internal tide energy sinks the mapping relies on the following ingredients i a global observational climatology of stratification ii maps of the generation of m2 s2 and k1 internal tides decomposed into vertical normal modes iii simplified representations of the dissipation of low mode internal tides due to wave wave interactions scattering by small scale topography interaction with critical slopes and shoaling iv lagrangian tracking of low mode energy beams through observed stratification including refraction and reflection we thus obtain a global map of the column integrated energy dissipation for each of the four considered dissipative processes each of the three tidal constituents and each of the first five modes modes 6 are inferred to dissipate within the local water column at the employed half degree horizontal resolution combining all processes modes and constituents we construct a map of the total internal tide energy dissipation which compares well with observational inferences of internal wave energy dissipation this result suggests that tides largely shape observed spatial contrasts of dissipation and that the framework has potential in improving understanding and modelling of ocean mixing however sensitivity to poorly constrained parameters and simplifying assumptions entering the parameterized energy sinks calls for additional investigation the attenuation of low mode internal tides by wave wave interactions needs particular attention keywords ocean mixing internal tides energy dissipation parameterization 1 introduction ocean general circulation models ogcms do not resolve the cascade of energy down to dissipation scales they rely on parameterizations of the irreversible mixing accomplished by small scale turbulence this parameterized mixing is pivotal to model behaviour on climatic timescales because it is the principal source of density transformation away from boundaries iudicone et al 2008 yet ad hoc representations of irreversible mixing such as the specification of diffusivities that are fixed in time remain common in ocean modelling tuning of fixed diffusivities may allow fair reproduction of some targeted observations but their prescription generally precludes a realistic model response to perturbations indeed for an ocean model to appropriately respond to changes in external forcing irreversible mixing must be connected to the forcing via conservative and realistic tracking of energy eden et al 2014 one important forcing to account for is the gravitational attraction of the moon and sun which generates surface barotropic ocean tides about two thirds of the power input to surface tides is directly lost to shear driven mixing and frictional heating at continental margins taylor 1919 jeffreys 1920 the remaining third about 1 tw feeds the generation of internal baroclinic tides egbert and ray 2000 nycander 2005 internal tides are internal waves of tidal frequency that radiate from sloping topography where barotropic tidal currents push stratified fluid up and down the slope munk 1966 bell 1975 they are a major energy source for the internal wave field and via instabilities of that field for irreversible mixing in the ocean interior sjöberg and stigebrandt 1992 munk and wunsch 1998 rudnick et al 2003 internal tides of small vertical scale are more prone to instability than larger scale waves which can propagate over longer distances and dissipate far from their generation site olbers 1976 st laurent and garrett 2002 garrett and kunze 2007 to characterize the vertical scales of internal tides it is customary to describe their vertical wavenumber spectrum by a discrete set of vertical normal modes or equivalent modes the first few modes have been observed to travel up to several thousands of kilometres dushaw et al 1995 ray and mitchum 1996 zhao et al 2016 in contrast higher modes are thought to break into small scale turbulence within a relatively small radius of their emission this premise together with available maps of internal tide generation jayne and st laurent 2001 carrère and lyard 2003 nycander 2005 has been used to map the near field dissipation of internal tides and parameterize the associated mixing in ogcms it is commonly assumed that a fixed fraction of the power input to internal tides feeds local bottom intensified turbulence st laurent et al 2002 simmons et al 2004 this power fraction related to the modal content of internal tide generation is traditionally taken as one third based on turbulence observations from the brazil basin st laurent et al 2002 for lack of a global map of its spatial variations falahat et al 2014a most models do not explicitly represent the contribution of far field internal tide dissipation to mixing rather a fixed diffusivity of about 10 5 m2 s 1 is commonly prescribed as representative of background internal wave driven mixing e g jochum 2009 the power effectively consumed by this mixing is then not controlled nor tied to the supply of energy by external forcings in order to resolve this disconnect substantial effort has been deployed to refine our understanding of the generation propagation and dissipation of low mode internal tides mackinnon et al 2017 an estimate of the modal distribution of internal tide generation has been attained falahat et al 2014b further estimation of the direction of emission of energy beams is ongoing pollmann et al 2019 the propagation through variable stratification and geostrophic flows has been studied through a combination of in situ measurements satellite altimetry and high resolution numerical experiments and found to agree well with linear wave theory rainville and pinkel 2006 alford and zhao 2007b arbic et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 ray and zaron 2016 wave wave interactions have long been recognized as a conduit to wave breaking via downscale energy transfer olbers 1976 mccomas and bretherton 1977 müller et al 1986 henyey et al 1986 they are dominated by triadic wave instabilities also known as parametric subharmonic instability psi which are active equatorward of about 30 15 for the semidiurnal diurnal internal tides eden and olbers 2014 psi appears to be a significant sink of low mode energy but seemingly not the dominant dissipation pathway of the semidiurnal mode 1 tide hibiya et al 1998 alford et al 2007 hazewinkel and winters 2011 xie et al 2011 mackinnon et al 2013b sun and pinkel 2013 much attention has therefore been directed to the interaction of low mode waves with topography rays bouncing off small scale seafloor roughness lose energy through scattering to higher modes müller and xu 1992 st laurent and garrett 2002 bülher and holmes cerfon 2011 kelly et al 2013 beams reaching larger scale topographic obstacles can either reflect back to deeper waters dissipate at the slope shoal or undergo a combination of the latter their fate depends in a largely predictable way on the height and shape of the obstacle müller and liu 2000 johnston and merrifield 2003 nash et al 2004 klymak et al 2011 2013 mathur et al 2014 legg 2014 other dissipative processes such as wave capture or scattering by mesoscale eddies bühler and mcintyre 2005 polzin 2008 dunphy and lamb 2014 dunphy et al 2017 remain less well documented or quantified building on this progress steps toward comprehensive parameterization of tidal mixing have been taken niwa and hibiya 2011 constructed a horizontal map of low mode internal tide dissipation using high resolution ogcm experiments that include tidal forcing and a 30 day linear damping of baroclinic wave fluctuations such experiments allow investigation of the generation and propagation of the first few modes but they do not resolve the full wave spectrum and the inferred dissipation is dependent on model numerics and adjustable damping terms e g buijsman et al 2016 an alternative approach consists of calculating the horizontal propagation of depth integrated low mode energy through an observed or modelled stratification using linear wave theory and parameterized energy sinks eden and olbers 2014 this approach allows estimation of energy sinks due to specific processes known to produce specific vertical structures of dissipation e g melet et al 2016 thus paving the way for a comprehensive three dimensional mapping of internal tide driven mixing indeed the vertical distribution of far field dissipation is a key ingredient of internal wave driven mixing parameterizations de lavergne et al 2016a 2016b melet et al 2016 here we adapt and extend the framework developed by eden and olbers 2014 to construct climatological two dimensional maps of low mode dissipation broken down into four dissipative processes for the first five vertical modes of the three main tidal constituents we then sum the estimated low mode dissipation with the local dissipation of higher modes to obtain a horizontal map of the total internal tide dissipation this map shows fair agreement with full depth dissipation estimates from observed finescale strain kunze 2017a suggesting that the framework has potential to narrow the gap toward comprehensive mapping and parameterization of tidal mixing the presentation proceeds as follows the methodology including the estimation of energy sources energy sinks and beam trajectories is detailed in section 2 the resultant distributions of internal tide energy loss and their sensitivity to least constrained parameters of the calculation are presented in section 3 next we compare our results to independent observational estimates of internal wave energy dissipation section 4 and to previous global budgets of internal tide energy sinks section 5 limitations and perspectives are discussed in the concluding section details about the treatment of interactions with topographic slopes are provided in appendix a the rationale for choosing a lagrangian rather than eulerian propagation scheme is exposed in appendix b 2 method 2 1 strategy consider internal waves of given tidal frequency and vertical mode number their column integrated energy e is a function of time t geographical position r x y and angle ϕ of the horizontal wavevector k h the energy evolution is governed by eden and olbers 2014 1 t e div r ϕ f g d where f c g e is the horizontal energy transport by modal group velocity c g g is the position and angle dependent generation rate of the considered mode and d encapsulates energy sinks note that divergence of f includes both position propagation and angle refraction or reflection terms since c g is parallel to k h ϕ represents the direction of energy propagation in the horizontal our objective is to map the steady state dissipation d x y because propagation and dissipation depend on the frequency and mode number of the internal tide we separately consider each mode of the three most energetic tidal constituents m2 s2 and k1 egbert and ray 2003 we exploit the mode partitioned generation estimates of falahat et al 2014b section 2 2 propose simple formulations for the decay due to wave wave interactions section 2 3 1 and scattering off abyssal hills section 2 3 2 and introduce a geometric treatment of interactions with large scale topographic slopes section 2 3 3 propagation and refraction are modelled using linear wave theory applied to the annual mean woce global hydrographic climatology gouretski and koltermann 2004 we thus ignore time variations and build the steady state dissipation field by tracking individual energy beams from sources to sinks then summing over all beams section 2 4 this strategy resembles that of eden and olbers 2014 who solved eq 1 for the first mode m2 internal tide using the woce climatology a map of internal tide generation rates and parameterizations for energy transfers to high modes the present approach differs from theirs in the following principal ways i energy beams are tracked one by one using a lagrangian scheme rather than 1 being solved using eulerian advection schemes ii the first five vertical modes are treated individually iii interactions with large scale topographic slopes are explicitly modelled iv parameterization choices for wave wave interactions and topographic scattering differ 2 2 energy sources falahat et al 2014b developed a semi analytical model for the tidal generation of internal waves projected onto vertical normal modes using global observational climatologies of stratification gouretski and koltermann 2004 bathymetry smith and sandwell 1997 and barotropic tidal velocities egbert and erofeeva 2002 they mapped the generation rate of each of the first 10 modes of the semidiurnal m2 tide for the purpose of this study we calculated analogous maps for the semidiurnal s2 and diurnal k1 tides the global total power input to m2 s2 and k1 internal tides is 634 148 and 68 gw respectively 1 1 note that power values reported in falahat et al 2014b were uniformly overestimated by a factor of 1 11 due to a typographic error in their analysis script these integral values exclude seafloor depths 400 m where the calculation becomes unreliable due to violation of the assumptions of small tidal excursion and subcritical topography falahat et al 2014b they are only slightly lower than equivalent values derived from the same products and the non modal formulation of nycander 2005 680 150 and 83 gw for m2 s2 and k1 respectively the modal partitioning of global generation rates is similar for the two semidiurnal constituents table 1 modes 1 2 and 3 receive about 35 25 and 15 of the total energy flux respectively together modes 6 represent only about 10 of the total power however the latter fraction is a lower bound since it does not incorporate modes 11 which are not resolved by the calculation in particular abyssal hill topography which is absent from the 1 30 resolution etopo2v2 bathymetry product smith and sandwell 1997 is responsible for significant high mode 50 internal tide generation melet et al 2013 lefauve et al 2015 adding the m2 internal tide generation by abyssal hills as estimated by melet et al 2013 the power received by modes 6 rises to 23 of the m2 total table 1 generation over abyssal hills has not been estimated for the other tidal constituents compared to m2 and s2 k1 internal tide generation projects less strongly onto modes 1 2 which receive no more than 40 of the total flux table 1 this different modal distribution relates to the different spatial distribution of diurnal conversion which is dominated by hotspots in luzon strait and indonesian seas not shown total modes 1 10 generation rates integrated over the pacific atlantic and indian basins are shown as a function of seafloor depth in fig 1 for all three constituents and all three basins generation rates decrease with depth the decrease is sharper in the pacific which hosts 62 58 and 82 of the m2 s2 and k1 barotropic to baroclinic conversion respectively profiles of conversion predicted by the non modal formulation of nycander 2005 are very similar compare thin and thick curves in fig 1 however spatial maps of conversion reveal important differences as opposed to the non modal estimate fig 2c the calculation of falahat et al 2014b often predicts negative conversion rates fig 2a negative rates could be interpreted as baroclinic to barotropic conversion however it is not known whether such conversion actually occurs and it is unclear whether these apparent internal tide energy sinks can feasibly connect with the sources to circumvent the issue we apply a correction to each modal conversion field to remove negative values while preserving key integral properties specifically we set all negative values to zero and multiply the resulting field by a depth dependent correction factor to recover the original depth dependent generation rate integrated over each of the pacific atlantic and indian oceans this procedure is performed on each field at the original 1 30 resolution using a vertical bin size of 200 m we finally average generation rates onto the 0 5 resolution grid of the woce hydrographic climatology the resulting conversion rates of the m2 tide are shown in fig 2 summed over modes 1 to 10 the total corrected field fig 2b closely resembles its non modal counterpart fig 2c grid cells where the two fields agree within a factor of 2 cumulate 87 of the total power input of 634 gw we expect the slightly smoother patterns of the corrected field to be more realistic reflecting superior accuracy of the modal formulation demonstrated in test cases falahat et al 2014b corrected generation maps for each mode also display realistic patterns fig 2d g the western pacific including indonesian seas stands out as the main source region for the first few modes the western indian ocean and mid atlantic ridge are the next two most prominent generation regions as mode number increases power input gradually spreads from localized hotspots at abrupt topography such as hawaii to more distributed sources above flatter but corrugated topography such as ridge flanks in accord with theory and observations st laurent and nash 2004 falahat et al 2014a the estimated power input to modes 6 fig 2g is dominated by the contribution of abyssal hills and therefore by regions centred around slow spreading ridges goff 2010 similar trends are found for the conversion of s2 and k1 tides not shown in summary the applied correction for negative conversion rates introduces important uncertainties but produces plausible fields that are suitable for the present mode by mode global mapping exercise the generation of internal waves by the principal eight tidal constituents has been estimated by nycander 2005 excluding regions shallower than 400 m m2 accounts for 67 of the global energy flux summed over all constituents m2 s2 and k1 together account for 90 tidal constituents with proximate frequencies cause internal wave generation rates that differ in magnitude but little in distribution egbert and ray 2003 using m2 s2 and k1 as our best proxy for n2 k2 and the next three diurnal constituents respectively we estimate the mode by mode generation across all constituents as 2 g all 1 05 g m 2 1 09 g s 2 1 70 g k 1 where appropriate power ratios have been introduced including the contribution of abyssal hills we thus calculate that mode 1 takes up about 30 of the total internal tide generation table 1 the percentage decreases monotonically with mode number reducing to 5 at mode 5 these global percentages mask pronounced spatial contrasts fig 3 internal tides generated at continental slopes are dominantly mode 1 whereas those radiated off rough and less steep topography are dominantly mode 2 and higher modes 6 dominate over the global mid ocean ridge system the angular distribution of energy sources has not yet been mapped as a surrogate for such a map we use bathymetry information to direct energy sources away from large scale topographic slopes we fit planes to the etopo2v2 bathymetry over half degree grid squares find the vector normal to each of these planes obtain the angle ϕ g of that vector in the horizontal with respect to due east and distribute energy sources around ϕ g with a cosine weight 3 g ref x y ϕ 1 2 g x y max 0 cos ϕ ϕ g x y this distribution ensures that most of the energy radiates away from bathymetric slopes with no energy directed upslope most internal tide sources are focused in one direction zhao et al 2016 however propagation through the time variable eddying ocean tends to rapidly disperse time average energy fluxes rainville and pinkel 2006 alford and zhao 2007a zaron and egbert 2014 vic et al 2018 motivating the choice 3 of angularly distributed sources we examined sensitivity to this choice by running an additional experiment referred to as beam with 4 g beam x y ϕ g x y δ ϕ ϕ g x y in the numerical code eqs 3 and 4 are discretised at the angular resolution of π 30 eq 4 means that local energy sources are placed within a single angle bin that which contains ϕ g x y 2 3 energy sinks 2 3 1 wave wave interactions wave wave interactions constitute a prominent but poorly quantified dissipation pathway of low mode internal tides satellite altimetry allows tracking of low mode energy beams that remain coherent with the astronomical tide ray and mitchum 1996 zhao et al 2016 however loss of coherence means that satellite observations provide only an upper bound on the open ocean dissipation rate of low mode beams rainville and pinkel 2006 buijsman et al 2017 zaron 2017 other constraints are called for theory indicates that the decay rate due to wave wave interactions increases with mode number and is elevated equatorward of the psi latitude where the tidal frequency ω is twice the coriolis frequency f mccomas and müller 1981 hibiya et al 2002 eden and olbers 2014 observations of a beam travelling northeastward from hawaii suggest that psi barely attenuates the first mode semidiurnal internal tide in this region alford et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 mackinnon et al 2013b this is supported by dedicated numerical experiments hazewinkel and winters 2011 in which the energy loss of the mode 1 m2 tide was inferred to be 15 over 760 km using an appropriate local group speed of 2 5 m s 1 the latter estimate translates into an e folding decay time of 21 days we choose 20 days as a representative timescale over which mode 1 tides are damped by psi noting that in reality this timescale varies in space and time and decreases with the amplitude of the participating waves mackinnon et al 2013b sun and pinkel 2013 ansong et al 2018 attenuation of low modes by other wave wave interactions is thought to be an order of magnitude slower hibiya et al 1998 eden and olbers 2014 in situ observations northeast of hawaii suggest a decrease of diffusivity by a factor of 4 north of the m2 psi latitude 28 8 occurring over four latitude degrees with little concomitant change in stratification mackinnon et al 2013a we take the e folding decay time of mode 1 to increase fourfold over the same latitude span plateauing at 80 days poleward of the transition fig 4 for lack of independent constraints an analogous latitudinal variation is employed for s2 and k1 mode 1 tides taking into account their different psi latitudes 29 9 and 14 5 respectively note that linear free waves do not exist poleward of the turning latitude at which their frequency equals the inertial frequency m2 s2 and k1 horizontal energy fluxes are thus confined equatorward of 74 5 85 8 and 30 0 respectively we must also specify the dependence on mode of these attenuation rates evaluation by olbers 1983 of the transfer integral within a garrett munk wave spectrum suggests that decay times scale with the 2 power of mode number cf his fig 33 this approximate dependence might not be representative of all types of wave wave interactions nor of all types of wave fields eden and olbers 2014 lacking better knowledge of the relative efficiency of wave wave interactions as a function of mode we set the e folding decay time of mode number n as τ wwi n τ wwi 1 n 2 since the group speed is inversely proportional to mode number this choice means that wave wave interactions cut horizontal energy fluxes f by a factor 1 e over a length c g τ wwi proportional to 1 n 3 this decay length is shown in fig 5 for the first four modes of the m2 tide the group speed has been computed from the annual mean stratification of the woce climatology as llewellyn smith and young 2002 5 c g h nπ n 2 ω 2 3 2 ω 2 f 2 1 2 ω n 2 f 2 where n is the depth mean buoyancy frequency and h the ocean thickness shortest decay lengths occur within regions of weak depth integrated stratification such as shelves and polar seas where slow group velocities leave more time for wave wave interactions to act fig 5 away from these regions the decay length of the first mode m2 tide is typically a few 1000 km in the latitude range where psi is active and 10 000 km or more at higher latitudes by contrast the decay length of mode 2 is generally 1000 km that of mode 4 rarely exceeds 100 km the chosen latitude and mode dependence of the e folding time over which wave wave interactions erode low mode beams is broadly compatible with observations but remains largely a place holder awaiting refined representation of this energy cascade more complex and more realistic parameterizations of the rate at which low mode internal tides lose energy to the background wave field can be considered in future implementations as a first step in order to gauge the sensitivity of the calculation to the chosen timescales we performed two sensitivity experiments referred to as fast and slow in which e folding decay times are uniformly halved and doubled respectively 2 3 2 scattering by abyssal hills bühler and holmes cerfon 2011 studied the decay of a low mode internal tide as it bounces over random bottom topography they showed that the energy flux decays as exp λ sca r where the decay rate per unit horizontal distance r is a function of topography statistics only 6 λ sca 2 π π 2 h 2 e h r 2 e h r 2 topographic corrugations h r enter eq 6 through the probabilistic expectation e of their squared height and of their squared spatial derivative here we apply eq 6 to abyssal hill statistics mapped by goff 2010 the decay rate can be approximated in terms of the local rms height h rms and local mean horizontal wavenumber κ of abyssal hills as 7 λ sca 2 π 4 h 2 h rms 2 κ the corresponding e folding decay length λ sca 1 is shown in fig 6 scattering is efficient near ridge crests where the decay length is typically several 100 km but is weak over old or sediment rich seafloor the predicted decay rates do not depend on the frequency and mode number of the low mode internal tide and are a factor of 3 to 10 smaller than those estimated by eden and olbers 2014 by contrast they are roughly one order of magnitude stronger than deep ocean scattering rates of the first mode m2 tide calculated by kelly et al 2013 using the model of nycander 2005 and bathymetric variations resolved in etopo2v2 this would suggest that scattering by resolved scale topographic roughness in the abyss is negligible the role of topographic slopes resolved in current global bathymetric maps is considered next 2 3 3 interactions with topographic slopes the fate of a low mode internal tide impinging onto a large scale topographic obstacle depends on the ratio of the topographic slope to the ray path slope fig 7 the ray path slope or wave slope s follows from the dispersion relation as 8 s ω 2 f 2 n 2 ω 2 independent of mode number topographic slopes smaller than s termed subcritical allow the internal tide to bounce forward and shoal e g müller and liu 2000 legg 2014 those approximately equal to s termed critical cause a transfer of energy to very high modes and boundary turbulence e g eriksen 1982 legg and adcroft 2003 martini et al 2013 topographic slopes significantly steeper than the wave slope termed supercritical mainly result in the backward reflection of the internal tide e g klymak et al 2013 johnston et al 2015 these general principles allied with knowledge of the ocean s topography and stratification can be used to estimate a priori the transmitted reflected and dissipated fractions of incident energy fluxes the rationale is illustrated in fig 7 in the simplified situation of a three segment obstacle of height h immersed in constant stratification consider a horizontal energy beam or energy flux f b encountering shoaling topography this beam is made of individual rays travelling up and down the water column with slope s meeting the surface every 2h s of travelled horizontal distance we assume rays to be randomly distributed a reasonable assumption given decoherence of internal tides by the fluctuating ocean environment the fraction of f b dissipated at critical topography is first estimated as the proportion of rays encountering a near critical slope i e as the ratio of the horizontal length shown in red to the distance between consecutive bounces 2h s legg 2014 we define near critical slopes as those ranging between 0 8 and 1 5 s the approximate range over which critical reflection dominates muller and liu 2000 mathur et al 2014 legg 2014 next we calculate the reflected fraction as the portion of rays ultimately impinging on supercritical topography slopes exceeding 1 5 s the remaining fraction of the energy flux is transmitted transmitted internal tides undergo shoaling which may cause their direct breaking via increase of their energy density and shear legg 2014 we further parameterize the fractional dissipation of the transmitted flux due to shoaling as h h 2 a simplifying approximation based on the model results of legg 2014 cf her figs 6 and 14 as detailed in appendix a this geometric treatment of interactions with bathymetric slopes can be generalized to depth varying stratification and arbitrary topography dissipated reflected and transmitted fractions were estimated within each grid column of the 0 5 resolution woce climatology for each of the four cardinal directions and each of the three tidal constituents using depth varying wave slopes and 1 30 resolution bathymetric variations dissipation and reflection are zero in downslope directions except at crests whose specific treatment is outlined in appendix a with non uniform stratification the fractional dissipation due to shoaling of the transmitted energy flux becomes the square of the wkb scaled bathymetric rise h h h ndz 0 h ndz 2 where z is depth h is the local ocean thickness and h is the thickness of a shallower neighbouring grid column this simple parameterization neglects the dependence on froude number of shoaling driven wave breaking legg 2014 likely underestimating overestimating fractional dissipation of most least energetic transmitted waves a low bias of shoaling induced dissipation could be implied on average though uncertainties make a more detailed assessment premature fig 8 shows the estimated fractions for m2 there are four values for four directions at each grid point we show the maximum of the four usually corresponding to the direction along which topography shoals most rapidly energy loss due to shoaling is substantial at the shelf break and shoreward but quasi negligible elsewhere critical and supercritical topography primarily consists of continental slopes in accord with previous studies e g kelly et al 2013 johnston et al 2015 klymak et al 2016 supercritical reflection generally dominates implying that much of the internal tide energy reaching continental slopes turns back to the open ocean nonetheless the estimated fractional dissipation at critical slopes is significant around most of the open ocean s perimeter and is non negligible near ridge crests and major fractures or seamounts the s2 tidal constituent has a frequency close to that of m2 and therefore has similar ray paths and similar transmission reflection dissipation characteristics as m2 in contrast the lower frequency of k1 internal tides means that their ray paths are less steep implying fewer but more often supercritical encounters with the bottom as a result k1 energy reflection at continental slopes is proportionately large not shown 2 4 energy propagation to quantify and map the modelled energy sinks we propagate energy fluxes from generation sites through climatological stratification accounting for refraction and for reflection at supercritical slopes we adopt a lagrangian approach beams are tracked one by one throughout their lifecycle the procedure for a given beam is the following the energy flux f b carried by the beam emerges from the centre of the generation grid cell x y at an angle ϕ with respect to the east with magnitude g x y ϕ we first determine the exact position it reaches along the grid cell perimeter and save the energy lost to wave wave interactions within the generation grid cell the beam tracing algorithm is then identical from grid cell to grid cell 1 given the angle of f b we find the next grid cell edge and position along that edge reached by f b and determine crossed distance δr 2 the dissipation by wave wave interactions and by scattering off abyssal hills within the traversed grid cell are saved f b is reduced accordingly 3 the angle of f b is updated due to refraction 4 the magnitude and emission angle of reflected energy flux are saved the dissipation due to critical slopes is saved f b is updated 5 the dissipation due to shoaling is saved f b is updated these steps are repeated until f b becomes negligibly small refraction along path r of the beam follows from ϕ arctan k y k x d k h dt ω and the dispersion relation as 9 dϕ dr f f ω 2 f 2 h h n n n 2 ω 2 sin ϕ cos ϕ interactions with topographic slopes are performed last because they apply to bathymetric variations from the traversed grid cell to the next the emission angle of reflected fluxes is determined by specular reflection against plane fits to the 1 30 c resolution bathymetry the remainder of slope interactions do not depend on the exact incident angle but only on the appropriate cardinal direction a practical but reasonable simplification kelly et al 2013 see appendix a specular reflection at the land ocean boundary ensures no energy is lost the latter reflected fluxes are found to be very small the sequence above is applied to all source triplets x y ϕ characterised by g x y ϕ 0 next the source term g is replaced by the saved field of reflected fluxes and the whole procedure repeated five such iterations suffice to reach a total dissipation within 1 of the total generation we perform the calculation for each of m2 s2 and k1 and each of the first five modes we find that barely any mode 6 internal tide energy escapes generation grid cells given the modelled attenuation rates see propagation distances in table 2 using a π 30 angular resolution for g the calculation for a single mode takes between a few minutes mode 5 and a few hours mode 1 to complete on a laptop computer this makes the framework well suited for sensitivity studies by treating modes 1 to 5 independently we have implicitly assumed that there is no exchange of energy between these low modes in other words we have assumed that i dissipative processes transfer energy directly to locally dissipating modes or to small scale turbulence and ii propagation and supercritical reflection do not alter the modal content of low mode beams assumption i is justified for the modelled interactions with topography thought to generate small scale motions bühler and holmes cerfon 2011 nash et al 2004 legg 2014 psi also tends to generate relatively high vertical wavenumbers hibiya et al 1998 2002 nonetheless wave wave interactions or interactions with vortical flows not modelled here may cascade energy from one low mode to another mccomas and bretherton 1977 dunphy and lamb 2014 such transfers presently lack quantification and are thus not considered here assumption ii is unlikely to hold everywhere open ocean propagation can be assumed to preserve mode number rainville and pinkel 2006 however reflection at supercritical slopes generally alters the modal content of energy fluxes müller and liu 2000 klymak et al 2016 to explore the impact of wavenumber modification upon reflection we carried an additional experiment termed exch where only half the magnitude of reflected fluxes conserves the mode number of incident fluxes the other half is equally distributed among higher propagating modes n 5 it is saved as an additional energy source for these modes experiment exch thus demonstrates the feasibility of including a downscale energy transfer between low modes 3 results 3 1 energy transport and content we begin by illustrating the energy redistribution accomplished by the first mode m2 internal tide example beam trajectories originating from three source grid cells with three different emission angles each are depicted in fig 9 relatively slow open ocean attenuation particularly poleward of 30 allows the beams to travel over basin scales most beams lose significant energy at continental slopes and give birth to one or several reflected beams refraction acts to bend trajectories i toward the equator and ii toward weaker depth integrated stratification effect ii steers beams into shallower regions increasing the total mode 1 dissipation due to critical reflection and shoaling by a few percent not shown effect i diminishes the energy transport to high latitudes for example if refraction is unaccounted for the predicted mode 1 dissipation south of 60 s increases by 30 horizontal energy fluxes accumulated across all beams shown in fig 10a b highlight prominent regions of first mode semidiurnal internal tide activity hotspots include waters around madagascar indonesia new zealand french polynesia hawaii east of china and japan and west of morocco and europe to assess the realism of our framework we compare m2 mode 1 energy transports of the ref and beam experiments fig 10a b to those extracted from satellite observations of sea surface height fig 10e zhao et al 2016 all hotspots listed above also stand out in the satellite derived map conversely only one observed hotspot is not captured here the continental slope of northeastern brazil colocated hotspots indicate that major sites of m2 mode 1 generation are accurately placed in the corrected conversion field fig 2d however transports detected in satellite observations are much weaker than their counterparts in ref and beam the present global rate of first mode m2 internal tide generation 213 gw is on the low side of previously estimated ranges 0 1 0 5 tw kelly et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 so that substantial overestimation of energy sources is unlikely alternative explanations for the discrepancy include i limited detection of internal tides propagating perpendicularly to satellite tracks ii absence of incoherent internal tide energy fluxes in the satellite map because satellite tracks are generally oriented in the north south direction the high pass filter applied to sea surface height data tends to suppress east west oriented waves zhao et al 2016 zhao 2018 this suppression is conspicuous in the aggregate angular distribution of energy transports largely north south in the satellite product fig 10f red but largely isotropic and dominantly eastbound in the ref and beam experiments fig 10f blue and black to mimic the suppression of eastbound westbound waves we multiply local angle resolved transports of ref and beam by the red curve in fig 10f that is by the aggregate angular distribution of satellite derived transports normalized by its maximum the resulting maps of energy transports fig 10c d are in better agreement with the observational map fig 10e both in terms of magnitude and spatial patterns in particular the global energy content in ref beam decreases from 165 172 to 64 69 pj a level more comparable to the 36 pj reported by zhao et al 2016 masking out regions unmapped in zhao et al 2016 further reduces by 10 pj the energy content in ref and beam the remaining mismatch likely reflect loss of coherence particularly in the equatorial band shriver et al 2014 buijsman et al 2017 zaron 2017 where satellite derived transports are much weaker than those modelled here comparison with satellite observed internal tides also illustrates biases in the angular distribution of sources in ref and beam the ref energy emission is too diffuse whereas the beam experiment underestimates angular spreading at and away from sources the source orientation ϕ g deduced from topography appears to be a decent approximation at some but not all prominent generation sites future work should strive to constrain the angle dependence of generation and to model the dispersion of energy beams by fluctuating currents and stratification here only a preliminary assessment of the sensitivity of dissipation to angular spreading will be performed by contrasting ref and beam experiments we henceforth focus on the ref experiment sensitivity will be examined in section 3 3 table 2 summarizes global characteristics of m2 low mode energy propagation on average energy in the first mode travels 1440 km at a speed of 2 3 m s 1 the corresponding mean residence time is 9 days because the e folding length of attenuation by wave wave interactions is proportional to 1 n 3 travel distance and energy content decrease sharply with mode number the distribution of the energy content among modes 1 to 5 resembles local estimates from mooring observations zhao et al 2010 vic et al 2018 cumulated over the first five modes the global energy content of m2 internal tides approaches 300 pj in the range of extrapolations from in situ observations alford and zhao 2007a kelly et al 2013 mode 5 internal tide energy travels only 68 km on average so that its dissipation is near local 3 2 energy dissipation the contrasting propagation characteristics of modes 1 to 5 translate into contrasting distributions of dissipation fig 11 the first mode is the only one capable of redistributing energy on planetary scales and is therefore the main contributor to dissipation in regions remote from important generation sites e g at southern high latitudes despite this redistribution the dissipation of the first mode m2 tide remains focused around major source regions namely the western indian western pacific and mid atlantic and equatorward of 30 fig 11a we estimate that wave wave interactions and scattering off abyssal hills in the open ocean contribute 45 of the dissipation of the mode 1 m2 tide leaving substantial energy loss at continental slopes and shelves table 2 dissipation becomes increasingly clustered around energy sources fig 11b f and increasingly dominated by the contribution of wave wave interactions table 2 as mode number increases whereas interactions with topography account for the bulk 72 of the dissipation of the first mode this balance is reversed at higher modes wave wave interactions monopolise 74 90 96 and 99 of the dissipation of mode 2 mode 3 mode 4 and mode 5 respectively a small fraction of the energy loss by wave wave interactions occurs on shelves defined here by h 400 m so that the percentages of dissipation by open ocean wave wave interactions given in table 2 are slightly lower dissipation summed over modes 1 to 5 is shown in fig 12 for each tidal constituent the spatial pattern of energy loss by low mode s2 internal tides is very similar to that of m2 low modes however s2 dissipation extends further into polar oceans and is about four times weaker diurnal k1 internal tides are less energetic still and their dissipation is focused in the tropical western pacific fig 12c in particular there is substantial energy loss near the two dominant k1 generation sites luzon strait and the indonesian archipelago but almost no activity in the atlantic basin low mode dissipation patterns also reflect the uneven distribution of decay rates dissipation tends to be enhanced over rough or steep topography and equatorward of psi latitudes even though psi decay times are uniform there is a slight enhancement of dissipation near the psi latitudes 30 for s2 and m2 15 for k1 relative to lower latitudes due to energy travelling from higher latitudes into the region of active psi the decomposition by process of the total dissipation of modes 1 5 is broadly similar across the three tidal constituents table 3 though k1 has somewhat larger percentage dissipation from shoaling and wave wave interactions because they act everywhere and powerfully on modes 2 wave wave interactions dominate causing about 60 of the overall low mode dissipation only 5 of the dissipation occurs in marginal seas shallower than 400 m implying that most of the low mode energy approaching continental margins is reflected or dissipated before crossing the shelf break shoaling and critical slopes together account for about 25 of the low mode dissipation guided by the similar dissipation distributions of m2 and s2 we estimate the total dissipation across the eight most energetic tidal constituents as 10 d all 1 05 d m 2 1 09 d s 2 1 70 d k 1 analogous to eq 2 the global integral of d all is 1044 gw equal to that of g all of this total internal tide energy loss rate fig 13f we estimate that 217 gw or 21 is the local dissipation of modes 6 fig 13e the remaining 827 gw transit through lower modes but eventually power small scale turbulence via four modelled routes of the energy cascade fig 13a d and table 3 wave wave interactions 521 gw or 63 scattering by small scale seafloor roughness 83 gw or 10 near critical reflection 128 gw or 15 and shoaling 95 gw or 12 the obtained global maps of internal tide energy sinks possess plausible distinct patterns that integrate present knowledge of the topography stratification internal tide generation beam propagation and beam degradation 3 3 sensitivity experiments multiple assumptions and approximations underlie the maps of internal tide energy sinks the angular distribution of sources attenuation rates by wave wave interactions and preservation of mode number upon reflection rank among key choices we have made to explore sensitivity to these choices we examine four variants of the reference ref calculation beam a single beam emanates from each source grid cell in the direction normal to topographic slope fast e folding decay times due to wave wave interactions are halved slow e folding decay times due to wave wave interactions are doubled exch mode n horizontal energy fluxes that reflect at supercritical slopes become 50 mode n and 50 equally partitioned into modes n 1 to 5 changes to the partitioning by process of low mode dissipation are summarised in table 3 and changes to the maps of total dissipation illustrated in fig 14 the beam experiment leads to a more heterogeneous spatial structure of dissipation but has virtually unchanged process contributions to the overall dissipation larger changes occur under modified decay times wave wave interactions in the open ocean contribute 51 and 71 of the modes 1 5 dissipation in slow and fast respectively bracketing the ref contribution of 61 opposite tendencies are implied for the dissipation due to interactions with topography in particular the summed percentage contribution of critical slopes and shoaling climbs from 18 in fast to 31 in slow representing an increase from 150 to 253 gw over the factor of 4 range of decay times explored sensitivity of the process distribution of dissipation is thus sizeable but linear this overall sensitivity is reflected in the difference maps fig 14e f relative to its ref and fast counterparts internal tide energy loss in slow is less focused around the main source regions and is elevated along basin perimeters reflection of first mode energy is substantial in ref mode 1 reflected fluxes total 88 24 and 13 gw for m2 s2 and k1 respectively transferring half of reflected fluxes to higher modes accelerates the degradation of low mode beams effectively augmenting damping by wave wave interactions and reducing energy fluxes impinging on continental slopes as a result the exch experiment entails modifications analogous albeit smaller to those obtained in fast table 3 and fig 14d f faster beam degradation also lowers the energy content of low mode internal tides for example first mode m2 internal tide energy totals 198 pj in slow but only 141 pj in exch and 127 pj in fast refined constraints on energy content if attainable could therefore help to reduce uncertainties in bulk attenuation rates 4 comparison to finestructure observations estimates of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy from measured microscale velocity fluctuations are relatively sparse waterhouse et al 2014 estimates of the dissipation rate of internal wave energy from the finescale strain observed in ctd profiles are much more abundant whalen et al 2015 kunze 2017a the latter estimates rely on a parameterization henyey et al 1986 gregg 1989 polzin et al 1995 whose underlying assumptions and implementation choices imply larger uncertainties polzin et al 2014 for individual strain based estimates the uncertainty tied to parameter choices is thought to be a factor of 3 to 5 kunze 2017a pollmann et al 2017 here we employ the global dataset of kunze 2017a who estimated dissipation from vertical strain contained in ship based hydrographic casts four characteristics of this dataset make it most suitable for comparison with present maps of column integrated internal tide energy loss i wide geographical coverage ii full depth extent of most profiles iii theoretical restriction to energy lost by the internal wave field and iv degree of spatio temporal averaging implicit in the parameterization whalen et al 2015 the dataset downloaded from ftp nwra com outgoing kunze iwturb contains dissipation rates ϵ w kg 1 and diffusivities k ρ m2 s 1 applying to half overlapping 256 m segments spanning each hydrographic profile we first calculated an average dissipation profile within each sampled half degree grid cell of the woce climatology values at depths 400 m are often unreliable due to presence of the surface mixed layer kunze 2017a taking a similar approach to kunze 2017a we approximated dissipation at depths z 400 m as ϵ z k ρ z 400 m n 2 z r f where n is the local climatological buoyancy frequency k ρ the finestructure inferred diffusivity and r f 0 2 the mixing efficiency assumed in the finescale parameterization this conservative prolongation of dissipation profiles to the surface rests upon the scaling ϵ z n 2 z typical of internal wave breaking in the upper ocean gregg 1989 but could underestimate the shallow dissipation in particular breaking of near inertial internal waves generated by atmospheric storms pollard 1970 is expected to be underrepresented in the profiles an expectation reinforced by the bias of ship based sampling toward moderate winds next we dismissed profiles that cover 90 of the total water column stratification i e such that ϵ r n 2 dz 0 9 n 2 dz this criterion excludes 6 of profiles we finally integrate dissipation ϵ times the seawater density ρ over the whole water column to obtain depth integrated internal wave energy dissipation rates the spatial pattern of the finestructure inferred dissipation exhibits strong similarities to the mapped internal tide energy loss fig 15 dissipation in the indian ocean is focused in the western half of the basin generally decreasing away from madagascar dissipation in the pacific is focused in the western tropics and relatively weak along a crescent joining the northern eastern and southern portions of the deep basin dissipation in the atlantic is relatively high above the mid atlantic ridge but tends to have weaker large scale contrasts than in the indo pacific dissipation in the southern ocean is generally weak except for hotspots near the southwest indian ridge macquarie ridge and drake passage a more quantitative comparison is presented in fig 16a for the global ocean and in fig 17 for separate basins the qualitative similarities outlined above translate into a global correlation of 0 41 between the finestructure and ref dissipations when computed using the logarithm of dissipation values the global correlation coefficient becomes 0 55 the correlation is strongest in the pacific and indian oceans and weakest in the atlantic all correlation coefficients have high statistical significance p value indistinguishable from zero encouraging agreement in magnitudes is also observed figs 15c and 16a 65 80 of values agree within a factor of 3 factor of 5 clear discrepancies also emerge from the comparison first the mapped tidal dissipation displays a slight pattern amplification compared to the observational dataset the ref experiment generally predicts somewhat larger rates in the most dissipative regions and somewhat weaker rates in more quiescent open ocean areas fig 15c this could indicate a lack of energy redistribution in our calculation possibly related to overestimated transfers to dissipation biases in the finestructure estimates notably in regions of strong forcing hibiya et al 2012 waterman et al 2014 thurnherr et al 2015 bouruet aubertot et al 2018 could also contribute to the pattern of differences superimposed on this broad pattern is a second more significant mismatch the ref dissipation is substantially lower than that estimated by kunze 2017a in five important regions namely the western boundary of the atlantic the agulhas region the region west and south of australia the kuroshio region and the southeast pacific sector of the southern ocean fig 15c these discrepancies are most pronounced in the atlantic and southern oceans leading to weaker overall agreement compared to the indo pacific fig 17 the large underestimates by ref of the finestructure inferred dissipation consistently occur in the regions of atmospheric and or oceanic storm tracks this suggests that non tidal forcings or non modelled interactions dominate in these areas possible contributors to the observed dissipation include i breaking of wind powered near inertial waves perhaps catalysed by mesoscale ocean eddies kunze 1985 zhai et al 2007 jing and wu 2014 ii high mode internal wave generation by eddies interacting with topography notably along western boundaries zhai et al 2010 nikurashin and ferrari 2010 clément et al 2016 pollmann et al 2017 iii scattering of low mode internal tides by mesoscale eddies dunphy and lamb 2014 to evaluate the ability of the energy source i to bridge the gap between the ref and finestructure dissipations we employed an estimate of the atmospheric power input to near inertial motions rimac et al 2013 and assumed that a 10 20 fraction of this power fuels near inertial waves that break in the near local water column furuichi et al 2008 zhai et al 2009 cuypers et al 2013 jouanno et al 2016 this additional dissipation barely modifies the overall correlation with finestructure data but raises the agreement within a factor of 3 factor of 5 to 72 74 88 of all values fig 16c d order of magnitude underestimates only persist along the western boundary of the atlantic not shown calling for additional contributions there importantly the ref mapping of internal tide energy dissipation has not been tuned to match the finestructure data other experiments compare similarly with the observational dataset table 4 agreement within a factor of 3 ranges from 63 in beam and fast to 67 in slow hence comparison lends confidence that both the present approach and the finescale parameterization have skill in mapping the energy flow from internal waves to small scale turbulence to put this skill in context we mapped the dissipation implied by a standard ogcm parameterization of internal wave driven mixing fig 14b and compared it to the finestructure dataset fig 16b as in the nemo model mignot et al 2013 near field mixing is parameterized using one third of the local power input to internal tides nycander 2005 and far field mixing is represented by a fixed diffusivity equal to 10 5 m2 s 1 except for a reduction around the equator and under sea ice applied to the woce climatology this ogcm parameterization implies a total power consumption of 920 gw and generally yields order of magnitude agreement with the observational dissipation rates fig 16b however the depth integrated dissipation implied by the ogcm parameterization varies mostly with latitude and misses the large spatial contrasts of far field mixing evident in the observations 5 comparison with previous budgets whether continental slopes and shelves host an important proportion of low mode internal tide energy loss remains a matter of debate kelly et al 2013 argued that the first mode semidiurnal tide loses the bulk of its energy at large scale topographic obstacles in contrast eden and olbers 2014 estimated that wave wave interactions and scattering off abyssal hills in the open ocean contribute 90 of the dissipation of the first mode m2 tide our estimate lies in between interactions with large scale topographic obstacles account for about half of the dissipation of the mode 1 m2 tide table 2 the lesser role attributed to basin margins by eden and olbers 2014 stems from different parameterization choices they estimated the open ocean attenuation timescale to be o 1 day compared to o 10 days here the latter timescale seems to better accord with the observed long range propagation of the first mode m2 internal tide zhao and alford 2009 dushaw et al 2011 waterhouse et al 2018 however we emphasize that dissipation characteristics of the first vertical mode are not representative of the overall non local internal tide dissipation in agreement with mooring observations zhao et al 2010 vic et al 2018 we find that modes 2 5 also accomplish important horizontal energy redistribution yet because of stronger damping by wave wave interactions this redistribution occurs over distances that are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that associated with mode 1 as a result dissipation in the basins interior away from continental slopes and shelves accounts for 65 80 of the total modes 1 5 dissipation of 827 gw and is dominated by wave wave interactions table 3 the presence of substantial low mode dissipation in the open ocean concurs with inferences from high resolution ogcm simulations ansong et al 2015 buijsman et al 2016 according to present calculations the proportion of low mode dissipation occurring in marginal seas shallower than 400 m is only 4 6 table 3 a comparison between available microstructure measurements of water column dissipation rates and estimated internal wave generation rates suggested a higher proportion of 30 waterhouse et al 2014 nevertheless it was recognized that this inferred residual may also incorporate under sampled continental slopes the higher proportion could also reflect in part a bias of microstructure sampling toward regions of strong forcing where the ratio of water column dissipation to generation tends to be low kunze 2017a fig 18 shows the distribution of the ratio of internal tide dissipation to generation d g according to the ref calculation because sources are more localised than sinks the ratio exceeds 1 over the vast majority of the ocean area the bulk 64 of the dissipation also occurs at ratios above 1 in contrast 72 of the total internal tide generation occurs in locations where generation exceeds dissipation these distributions of d g reflect the substantial energy redistribution achieved by low mode beams and illustrate the difficulty of predicting dissipation rates from generation rates alone 6 conclusions mapping the breaking of internal tides is a long standing challenge of oceanography munk 1966 here we proposed a framework for estimating the geography of internal tide energy sinks and applied it to the contemporary ocean the framework builds upon the pioneering work of eden and olbers 2014 recent calculations of internal tide generation projected onto vertical normal modes falahat et al 2014b and the growing understanding of the downscale cascade of internal tide energy mackinnon et al 2017 it consists of tracking every internal tide energy beam from generation to dissipation through observed stratification accounting for refraction and for reflection against supercritical topography using the woce global hydrographic climatology generation maps for the three most energetic tidal constituents m2 s2 and k1 and simplified representations of dissipation via interactions with topography and with the ambient wave field we constructed a global horizontal map of internal tide energy loss fig 13f decomposed into contributing dissipative processes fig 13a e different breaking pathways produce distinct vertical structures of dissipation by coupling each map of column integrated energy dissipation with an appropriate vertical structure three dimensional maps of dissipation and diffusivity may be built such maps could then serve to refine estimates of water mass transformation in the ocean interior e g de lavergne et al 2017 kunze 2017b to constrain inverse estimates of ocean circulation e g ganachaud and wunsch 2000 groeskamp et al 2017 or to parameterize internal tide driven mixing in ogcms e g eden et al 2014 melet et al 2016 these applications may in turn illuminate the impact of each dissipative process on ocean circulation and the sensitivity of circulation to the assumptions and choices made in the mapping procedure two principal limitations of the framework must be underlined first the choice to track low mode energy beams one by one and then sum over all beams to recover the total dissipation disallows a straightforward treatment of nonlinear interactions between beams for example if the efficiency of a dissipative process at some location depends on the total low mode energy at this location such dependence cannot be easily factored in only the energy carried by the beam being tracked has thus been used to diagnose its contribution to dissipation in return the adopted lagrangian approach avoids the numerical diffusion dispersion of energy fluxes produced by eulerian advection schemes see appendix b this is a key advantage if the trajectories and energy levels of observed beams are to be reproduced and if the eddy modulated dispersion of energy fluxes is to be explicitly represented second implementation of the lagrangian calculation within a running ogcm is fraught with challenges related to the number of beams and to the complexity and stratification dependence of interactions with topographic slopes presently the framework is designed to produce static dissipation maps appropriate to a given mean ocean state several elements suggest that such static maps can still serve ogcm applications i they can replace maps of internal tide generation as the power available to the model s tidal mixing parameterization ii such a parameterization could obviate the need for a fixed background diffusivity ensuring mixing is energy constrained and obviate the computational cost of an interactive representation of low mode energy propagation iii we expect the sensitivity of the global horizontal distribution of dissipation to changes in stratification to be modest as is the case of internal tide generation egbert et al 2004 iv the vertical structure of dissipation most crucial for ocean ventilation de lavergne et al 2016a can be coupled to the evolving model stratification v the maps could be updated at distant times of a simulation if large changes in the simulated ocean state warrant doing so limitations of the present application to the modern ocean are numerous primary among them is the ad hoc representation of low mode energy loss through wave wave interactions we chose decay times that depend only and crudely on latitude and mode number since this a nonlinear process the decay time should in reality also depend on the amplitude of the internal wave field further work is required to assess our choices and incorporate more realistic variations of decay rates so as to reduce the uncertainty attached to this dominant sink of internal tide energy the modelled interactions with topographic slopes also suffer from important approximations in particular we did not account for the dependence on froude number of the near critical slope range and of the fractional energy loss due to shoaling legg 2014 additional uncertainty originates from the estimation of energy sources which demanded a correction for the negative values present in modal generation fields falahat et al 2014b and an arbitrary choice for the angular distribution of energy emission substantial uncertainty in the dissipation maps also stems from processes that have not been explicitly modelled not least are interactions between low mode beams and geostrophic flows whose role in the spreading and downscale cascade of energy rainville and pinkel 2006 dunphy and lamb 2014 buijsman et al 2017 deserves more attention in spite of these uncertainties the estimated maps of internal tide energy sinks appear to be plausible and broadly compatible with available observations most of the energy generated at hawaii radiates away and feeds dissipation across the pacific klymak et al 2006 alford et al 2007 most of the energy travelling from macquarie ridge toward tasmania reflects or dissipates at the tasman continental slope johnston et al 2015 waterhouse et al 2018 most of the dissipation in the eastern brazil basin originates from locally generated high modes polzin 2004 indonesian seas host 10 of both the total source and total loss of internal tide energy koch larrouy et al 2007 patterns and magnitudes of the mapped internal tide dissipation compare well with observational internal wave dissipation estimates along hydrographic sections of the world ocean kunze 2017a regional discrepancies with the latter dataset are consistent with significant local dissipation of wind generated near inertial waves jing and wu 2014 and are suggestive of mesoscale eddy energy loss to internal waves near western

declarations of interest none appendix a interactions with topographic slopes the geometric treatment of interactions with topographic slopes resolved in the etopo2v2 bathymetry product follows the rationale of fig 7 accounting for topographic complexities and depth variations of the ray path slope here we detail the calculation of relevant fractions considering the example of a grid column i j of the woce climatology whose eastern neighbour i 1 j is shallower as sketched in fig a1 the thickness h of the column is the average of the 15 15 etopo2v2 bathymetric values contained in the half degree cell i j the buoyancy frequency n is known at each level of the woce climatology and extrapolated to the bottom where necessary the energy flux f b of a beam exiting the grid square i j through its boundary with i 1 j interacts with longitudinal topographic segments connecting h i j to h i 1 j to determine the fraction of f b encountering critical or supercritical topography we begin by calculating the wave slope s at each level using eq 8 next we apply the same procedure to each of the 15 longitudinal rows of 29 topography segments covering i j and i 1 j from west to east find the first bathymetric value less than h i j and the first value less than h i 1 j or points a and b respectively fig a1 ignore segments west of a and east of b this ensures f b does not interact twice with the same topography calculate the effective horizontal projection or projected length l x δx δh s of each topographic segment here δx and δh are the horizontal length and the positive or negative eastward height increment of a single segment respectively from west to east find the first segment that has a negative projected length point r if such a segment exists sum l x cumulatively eastward until it becomes positive point r set all l x values to zero between r and r repeat eastward from r this procedure accounts for shadowing i e for the presence of downsloping segments invisible to rays find topographic segments whose slope δh δx lies between 0 8s and 1 5s and sum their projected lengths l x to obtain the critical projected length of the whole row from east to west find the first segment whose slope exceeds 1 5s follow a ray path backward from the top of this segment point s until it encounters the seafloor point s sum all non critical projected lengths l x between s and s repeat westward from s cumulate the summed projected lengths to obtain the supercritical projected length of the whole row the critical supercritical projected length is then averaged over the 15 rows and divided by the distance between two consecutive bounces 2 0 h i j s 1 dz to yield the fraction of f b dissipated reflected at the slope the remaining transmitted flux loses another fraction of its magnitude through shoaling the latter fraction is estimated as h i 1 j h i j ndz 0 h i j ndz 2 a crude approximation based on the model results of legg 2014 fractions are calculated for each tidal constituent each half degree grid cell and each of the four cardinal directions they are set to zero in the directions along which h increases except for crest grid cells where h increases in opposite directions indeed we find that grid columns straddling the crests of mid ocean ridges host significant critical dissipation their relatively high bottom stratification implies relatively small wave slopes that often match those of the topography to obtain critical and supercritical projected lengths at a crest cell the procedure detailed above is applied to the 15 rows of 14 topography segments contained in the cell defining point b as the shallowest topographic point in each row the distance between consecutive bounces is calculated as previously the fraction dissipated through shoaling becomes h b i j h i j ndz 0 h i j ndz 2 with h b the bathymetric depth at point b averaged over the 15 rows premises implicit in this local geometric analysis include i 0 5 is an appropriate horizontal resolution to estimate transmission reflection dissipation fractions ii internal tides behave as individual rays of infinitesimal width that are randomly distributed in the horizontal iii effects of non normal incidence can be neglected premises i and ii relate to the horizontal scale most relevant to interactions between a low mode beam and a topographic obstacle this scale is thought to be o 10 100 km comparable to the wavelength of the incident low mode internal tide nash et al 2004 kunze and llewellyn smith 2004 this suggests that 0 5 is an appropriate resolution for the analysis but that accounting for topographic variations down to a horizontal resolution of 3 km may be superfluous the calculated fractions should thus be interpreted as best estimates of the likelihood that transmission reflection dissipation dominates in any half degree grid cell we also note that the effective resolution of the etopo2v2 bathymetry map is closer to 10 km over most of the ocean falahat et al 2014b premise ii also entails that we ignore complexities related to the interplay between rays and modes which can modulate interactions with topography klymak et al 2011 premise iii is a practical choice dictated by the longitude latitude grid of bathymetry and stratification climatologies fractions in non cardinal directions could be estimated using bathymetric fields interpolated onto rotated grids however such added complexity was deemed unwarranted here given other uncertainties in the global mapping and given evidence that oblique incidence has only a modest overall impact kelly et al 2013 appendix b lagrangian versus eulerian propagation consider a beam of initial magnitude f b and orientation ϕ in the lagrangian framework the beam propagates from one grid cell to the next changing direction and magnitude as it interacts with the environment but retaining a single orientation and infinitesimal width at any given time in an eulerian framework energy transports are not attached to beams but instead to a discrete three dimensional longitude latitude angle grid a numerical scheme propagates f b from the source cell to neighbouring cells depending on the beam angle ϕ unless ϕ matches exactly one of the grid s underlying directions the beam will necessarily be divided between two grid cells each receiving a fraction of f b further splitting will occur at the next iteration resulting in numerical spreading of energy transports refraction also causes numerical diffusion unless the shift in angle over one time step is an exact multiple of the angular resolution energy transports split into adjoining discrete angles numerical choices advection schemes resolution can alleviate but not eliminate diffusion dispersion inherent to discretisation in the eulerian framework to illustrate these effects we calculated m2 mode 1 energy transports in the beam experiment using an eulerian fig b1b instead of the lagrangian fig b1a propagation scheme in the eulerian framework all beams propagate simultaneously feeding a three dimensional field of energy fluxes f x y ϕ f is iteratively updated until steady state is achieved i e until the global dissipation rate matches the global generation rate to mitigate numerical diffusion the propagation scheme allows direct communication between cardinal as well as diagonal neighbours over one iteration a given beam feeds two among its eight contiguous grid cells depending on its orientation ϕ substantial numerical spreading is nonetheless apparent in the comparatively diffuse distribution of energy transports produced by the eulerian scheme fig b1 furthermore spreading is not uniform over all orientations transports that retain a beam like structure are those oriented in cardinal or diagonal directions along which propagation is less dispersive this artificial segregation of beams depending on their orientation is amplified at higher angular resolution offsetting potential gains

24039,five different parameterizations of langmuir turbulence lt effect are investigated in a realistic model of the north atlantic and arctic using realistic wave forcing from a global wave hindcast the parameterizations mainly apply an enhancement to the turbulence velocity scale and or to the entrainment buoyancy flux in the surface boundary layer an additional run is also performed with other wave effects to assess the relative importance of langmuir turbulence namely the coriolis stokes forcing stokes tracer advection and wave modified momentum fluxes the default model without wave effects underestimates the mixed layer depth in summer and overestimates it at high latitudes in the winter the results show that adding lt mixing reduces shallow mixed layer depth mld biases particularly in the subtropics all year around and in the nordic seas in summer there is overall a stronger relative impact on the mld during winter than during summer in particular the parameterization with the most vigorous lt effect causes winter mld increases by more than 50 relative to a control run without langmuir mixing on the contrary the parameterization which assumes lt effects on the entrainment buoyancy flux and accounts for the stokes penetration depth is able to enhance the mixing in summer more than in winter this parameterization is also distinct from the others because it restrains the lt mixing in regions of deep mld biases so it is the preferred choice for our purpose the different parameterizations do not change the amplitude or phase of the seasonal cycle of heat content but do influence its long term trend which means that the lt can influence the drift of ocean models the combined impact on water mass properties from the coriolis stokes force the stokes drift tracer advection and the wave dependent momentum fluxes is negligible compared to the effect from the parameterized langmuir turbulence keywords langmuir mixing parameterization mixed layer depth sea surface temperature ocean heat content stokes penetration depth 1 introduction the interaction between surface waves and ocean circulation is a complex process which involves a wide range of temporal and spatial scales ranging from fast moving waves to the much slower mean flow the influence of wind driven surface waves on the underlying ocean circulation and upper ocean mixing has been recognized to play a critical role in reducing known systematic biases in climate models as discussed by belcher et al 2012 who argued that turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer will be underestimated if the effect of surface waves is not accounted for the feedback to the atmosphere is mostly thermodynamic and a relatively small temperature bias may have large consequences for the deep convection in the atmosphere sheldon and czaja 2014 the ocean primary production is also strongly influenced by the thickness of the mixed layer and therefore accurate predictions of the mixed layer depth mld are crucial for biogeochemical modeling neglecting the near surface effects of whitecapping the main impact of surface waves on upper ocean dynamics

respectively the turbulent langmuir number lat can be understood as a measure of the production of the turbulence kinetic energy by current shear relative to the stokes drift production grant and belcher 2009 ms00 themselves noted that their parameterization lacks an explicit stability dependence suggesting that it may not be applicable in realistic applications without further modifications to address this limitation smyth et al 2002 hereafter sm02 extended the ms00 formula to include stratification effects intended to restrain the mixing enhancement under unstable stratification i e in convective conditions and to magnify it under stable stratification harcourt and d asaro 2008 reformulated the langmuir number in terms of a surface layer averaged value of the stokes drift instead of its surface value and have shown it to be successful in capturing the bulk properties of the vke in the mixed layer the surface layer averaged langmuir number is given as 2 la sl u v s sl v ref s 1 2 where v s sl represents the stokes drift magnitude averaged over a thin layer near the surface and its thickness is estimated as the top 20 of the ocean mixed layer harcourt and d asaro 2008 and v ref s is the stokes drift at a reference level considered to be at the base of the mixed layer the averaging over the thin surface layer is introduced to address the importance of the stokes decay scale in influencing the structure and the dynamics of lt the surface layer averaged langmuir number 2 has recently been shown to yield good results in the lt induced mixing enhancement in several studies harcourt and d asaro 2008 van roekel et al 2012 reichl et al 2016b li et al 2016 takaya et al 2010 hereafter tk10 proposed a refinement of a prognostic skin sst model by accounting for langmuir turbulence mixing under stable conditions using a velocity scale by grant and belcher 2009 although they did not test it in kpp they followed the ms00 approach and proposed the scaling by grant and belcher 2009 as an lt enhancement factor applied to the eddy diffusivity in their sst model in such way that it neglects the lt effects under large values of lat they have shown it to be successful in enhancing ocean mixing and reducing the diurnal variability of sst under waves presence van roekel et al 2012 hereafter vr12 using a broadband empirical wave spectrum introduced langmuir mixing parameterization accounting for the misalignment between wind and wave directions which is also based on a surface layer averaged langmuir number here we use their adjusted enhancement factor for the conditions where wind and waves are aligned li et al 2016 in addition we adopt the lt enhancement of the boundary layer entrainment by modifying the bulk richardson number with a stokes drift term li et al 2016 li and fox kemper 2017 hereafter lf17 investigated the lt effects on the entrainment buoyancy flux in the ocean surface boundary layer using les with various combinations of wind waves and destabilizing surface buoyancy flux it is found that the entrainment is enhanced substantially under weakly convective conditions while the effects are moderate under strongly convective turbulence they therefore proposed an lt enhancement estimate of the scaling of the entrainment buoyancy flux at the base of the boundary layer and derived a new expression for the unresolved turbulence shear velocity in the kpp scheme combined with a lasl based enhancement factor from van roekel et al 2012 they have shown that this new modification has improved the mld in the southern ocean in their community earth system model cesm model simulations there have been recent studies where langmuir mixing parameterizations in kpp have been compared in global climate simulations for example fan and griffies 2014 and li et al 2016 using respectively the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl climate model cm2m and cesm both are coupled with wavewatch iii tolman et al 2002 tolman and others 2009 the ocean components for cm2 m and cesm are the modular ocean model mom4 and the parallel ocean program pop2 respectively fan and griffies 2014 found the ms00 parameterization to cause excessive mixing and the sm02 scaling to work best in correcting warm sst and shallow mld biases in cm2m however li et al 2016 found both parameterizations to induce too much mixing suggesting that the effect could be model dependent this motivated them to test with the parameterization from van roekel et al 2012 considering surface layer averaged langmuir number wind wave misalignment as well as boundary layer entrainment enhancement finding these to introduce substantial improvements in mld predictions in the southern ocean in the summer in this study we assess the impact of five parameterizations of lt mixing in the kpp scheme implemented in the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom bleck 2002 described above as ms00 sm02 tk10 vr12 and lf17 with enhancement factors based on the langmuir numbers lat or lasl and in the case of the sm02 and lf17 parameterizations also the stability the wave forcing fields are interpolated from a wavewatch iii global hindcast rascle et al 2008 rascle and ardhuin 2013 langmuir turbulence is considered to be an important wave related mixing process belcher et al 2012 in the open ocean in order to assess its impact relative to other wave effects we have included one experiment csfsm02 where we add the coriolis stokes force hasselmann 1970 the tracer advection by the stokes drift uchiyama et al 2010 and the wave modified stress the latter is a consequence of the growth and decay of waves with changing winds because waves absorb a portion of the wind stress when they grow and conversely the momentum flux to the ocean from breaking waves continues after the wind has died down weber 1983 janssen 2012 breivik et al 2015 a regional configuration of hycom for the north atlantic and the arctic ocean is used here referred to as topaz4 sakov et al 2012 which is providing both the arctic forecast and reanalysis products of the copernicus marine environment services cmems we will try to reconcile the results from previous comparison studies and suggest a practical operational implementation able to improve the topaz4 forecast and reanalysis services for cmems to our knowledge this study is the first time these parameterizations have been compared in a realistic basin scale ocean model as will be shown we find improvements in the reduction of the warm sst and shallow mld biases with langmuir mixing in the subtropical summer with sm02 vr12 and lf17 parameterizations however the sm02 and vr12 scalings appear to degrade the wintertime mld leading to increased root mean square errors rmse at high latitudes the tk10 scaling is also found to reduce mld and sst biases however it appears to introduce an excessive mixing that causes too high heat content and mld deepening in agreement with the findings by fan and griffies 2014 and li et al 2016 we also find the parameterization by ms00 to introduce the most vigorous mixing the control run without lt effects yields a too deep mixed layer at mid high latitudes and underpredicted ssts in the middle of the north atlantic these biases in the control run are found to be exacerbated when adding langmuir mixing particularly with the parameterization of ms00 in agreement with the finding by li and fox kemper 2017 the lt enhanced unresolved shear with the lf17 approach is found to restrain the mld deepening induced by vr12 parameterization in which the stokes drift term v s 0 2 is added to the denominator of the bulk richardson number furthermore the mixing enhancement with the surface layer averaged langmuir number used in lf17 is shown to reduce the lt effects in regions that already overestimate the winter mld while it increases it during summer among the lt parameterizations considered here the lf17 scheme is found to reduce the summer mld rmses the most it also performs as good as the control run during winter this paper is organized as follows a description of the methodology is given in section 2 where the wave averaged equations the stokes drift profile approximation and the parameterization of the langmuir turbulence mixing are outlined in section 3 the results of in total seven experiments as well as a comparison against observations are presented with a focus on the influence on ocean temperature total heat content and mixed layer depth the results are discussed and summarized in section 4 2 methodology in the present study hycom is configured for a domain covering the north atlantic and arctic oceans ranging from 10 km and 16 km horizontal resolution from 1 6 to 1 8 and forced with wind fields from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf there are 50 hybrid vertical layers of which 10 are fixed z layers covering approximately the upper 20 m the model setup is similar to sakov et al 2012 except that data assimilation is not included and the vertical resolution has been increased from 28 to 50 hybrid layers in addition the thickness of the top layer is set to 1 m rather than 3 m which is important in particular for the coriolis stokes force and the stokes tracer advection since the stokes drift decays rapidly with depth at the lateral boundary the model variables are relaxed towards the corresponding monthly climatology using relaxation zones of width equivalent to 20 grid cells in addition a barotropic inflow is imposed through the bering strait to account for the inflow of pacific water this however is balanced by an equivalent outflow at the southern open boundary the thermodynamics fluxes are determined following drange and simonsen 1996 and to better represent the diurnal cycle the estimation of the short wave radiation is updated every three hours the integrated wave parameters are computed from the full wave spectrum where the wave effects on sea ice are neglected the wind forcings used in the wave hindcast are from a combination of ecmwf operational analyses and the climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 the stokes drift profile is reconstructed based on the phillips spectrum approximation following breivik et al 2016 and li et al 2017 here a brief description of the wave averaged equations and the langmuir turbulence mixing parameterizations in the kpp scheme are given at the end of this section the stokes drift profile approximation is presented as well as a description of the experimental setup and the observations used for model validation 2 1 wave terms in the mean flow equations the stokes drift stokes 1847 is defined as the difference between the mean eulerian velocity at a fixed point u w and the mean lagrangian velocity u l w l of a particle subjected to an orbital motion andrews and mcintyre 1978 van den bremer and breivik 2018 and given by the relation 3 u l w l u w u s w s the implementation of the wave averaged equations in hycom following the vortex force formalism based on the generalized lagrangian mean glm see andrews and mcintyre 1978 ardhuin et al 2008 approach is reported by rogers and wallcraft 2013 the glm equations of ardhuin et al 2008 are also presented more explicitly in bennis et al 2011 in an eulerian frame of reference and using the asymptotic theory in which the relation 3 is valid the wave averaged equations craik and leibovich 1976 mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 mcwilliams et al 2004 uchiyama et al 2010 are 4 u t u h u w u z f v 1 ρ p x f m x f v x u y v s w s u z j x f w x v t u h v w v z f u 1 ρ p y f m y f v x u y u s w s v z j y f w y where h is the horizontal differential operator and u s u s v s w s and u u v w represent the 3d stokes and mean eulerian velocities respectively the water density is represented by ρ and the hydrostatic pressure as p the terms f m x f m y represent the non wave source of momentum diffusion and mixing effects j denotes bernoulli head and f w x f w y is the wave induced non conservative force due to for example wave breaking or dissipation due to ocean bottom friction the vortex force including the coriolis stokes force f z u s is given by the first two terms on the right hand side in eq 4 at the surface the boundary condition is modified by the presence of surface waves which reduce the momentum injected to the ocean when they grow and conversely release momentum when they break and dissipate therefore the wind stress τ a is modified by subtracting the part absorbed by wave generation or the atmospheric to wave momentum flux τ aw at the same time the wave to ocean momentum flux τ wo due to wave breaking is added as an additional stress hence the ocean side stress τ oc following jenkins 1989 weber et al 2006 and janssen 2012 is expressed as 5 τ oc τ a τ aw τ wo where 6 τ aw ρ g 0 2 π 0 k ω s in d ω d θ and τ wo ρ g 0 2 π 0 k ω s diss d ω d θ here s in is the wind input source function s diss is the wave dissipation source term k is the wave number ω the angular wave frequency and θ is the wave direction the transport equation for a tracer c with stokes advection u s h is given in the form uchiyama et al 2010 7 c t u h c w c z u s h c w s c z h ν h c z ν z c z where ν ν z are the horizontal and vertical turbulent diffusion coefficients respectively as the main focus of this study is the langmuir mixing we only include the coriolis stokes force the stokes tracer advection and the wave dependent stress in one experiment csfsm02 to assess the importance of these effects relative to the impact of langmuir turbulence general ocean circulation models are mainly assumed hydrostatic typically with o 10 km horizontal grid resolution while turbulence mixing is due to non hydrostatic processes of o 1 m scales these small scale processes must thus be parameterized with turbulence closure schemes an essential goal of these schemes is to produce accurate and efficient parameterizations of the vertical mixing in large scale circulation models an example of such turbulence schemes is the non local k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 which provides a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and resolving boundary layer physics here a number of les based parameterizations proposed to capture the sub grid scale effects of the langmuir turbulence in kpp are investigated 2 2 langmuir mixing parameterization in kpp in the kpp scheme large et al 1994 the parameterization of the turbulent fluxes requires splitting the water column into two regions the surface boundary layer and the ocean interior each of which has a distinct mixing regime the ocean surface boundary layer depth not mld is defined as the shallowest depth h t at which the bulk richardson number rib z reaches a critical number ric here considered to be 0 3 where rib z is defined as 8 ri b z b r b z z u r u z 2 v t 2 z here v t represents the unresolved turbulent velocity shear while b r is the buoyancy and u r the velocity both averaged over a thin surface layer large et al 1994 define the mld as the shallowest depth at which the buoyancy gradient exceeds a threshold and thus their mld in most cases is smaller than the boundary layer depth h the unresolved turbulence shear is parameterized large et al 1994 by the relation 9 v t 2 z c v n z w s z r i c κ 2 β t c s ϵ 1 2 where c v max 2 1 200 0 max 0 n 1 7 danabasoglu et al 2006 w s is the turbulence velocity scale for scalar properties n z is the local buoyancy frequency κ 0 4 is the von kármán constant and c s 98 96 and ϵ 0 1 the parameter β t represents the ratio of the entrainment buoyancy flux w b e at the base of the boundary layer to the surface buoyancy flux which is considered to be approximately a constant here β t 0 2 under pure convection large et al 1994 the turbulent flux of a property x is parameterized by 10 x w k x x z γ x here γ x represents a non local transport large et al 1994 which is assumed to be non zero only for scalar variables in unstable regimes within the surface boundary layer 0 z h the turbulent eddy diffusivity viscosity is parameterized as 11 k x z t h t w x z h t g z h where g is a smooth shape function assumed to be a cubic polynomial and the subscript x refers to a scalar or momentum property the turbulence velocity scale is given as w x κu ϕ where u is the friction velocity and ϕ is the stability function defined by large et al 1994 with the aid of les simulatins of the wave averaged equations mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 proposed a parameterization of the bulk effects of lt mixing in kpp by applying an enhancement factor e la t to the turbulence velocity scale within the surface boundary layer as 12 w x κ u ϕ e la t which means that the lt enhancement factor is applied to the velocity scale for both scalar and momentum quantities enhancing both the unresolved shear and the eddy diffusivity the enhancement factor proposed by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 has the form 13 e la t 1 c w la t 2 α 1 α where c w and α are assumed positive constants in cases with small turbulent langmuir numbers the turbulence velocities become proportional to the surface stokes drift and in the limit of lat the enhancement factor becomes unity meaning that the tke production is dominated by current shear production in addition to amplifying the mixing the enhanced turbulence velocity scale will also deepen the boundary layer h through increasing the unresolved shear velocity in the denominator of the bulk richardson number 8 mcwilliams et al 2014 also suggest that the expression for v t 2 should include the effects of the unresolved lt on the boundary layer thickness in the default kpp implementation in hycom the mixing coefficients at the boundary layer depth h are matched with those of the interior thus the mixing in the interior can influence the mixing within h in the following subsections we look at the choice of the enhancement factor suggested for each of the five lt parameterizations considered in this study 2 2 1 mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 parameterization ms00 from their les experiments of the wave averaged equation on a weakly convective quasi equilibrium turbulent state ms00 proposed an enhancement factor in the form 14 e la t 1 0 080 la t 4 1 2 which they found to give better agreement with their les results their les model was forced by a uniform wind stress and monochromatic surface waves however ms00 admitted that their definition lacks an explicit stability dependency on the convective forcing suggesting that their proposed generalization of the kpp model may not be applicable in a full range of realistic oceanic conditions without further modifications 2 2 2 smyth et al 2002 parameterization sm02 based on analyses of les experiments and observational data of strongly stable daytime warming and strongly unstable nocturnal cooling forcing conditions smyth et al 2002 proposed an extension to the ms00 scaling incorporating a dependence on the convective velocity scale w b f h 1 3 where b f is the surface buoyancy flux the proposed modification makes c w which was assigned a constant value of 0 08 in ms00 s formulation a function of w and the friction velocity u such that the influence of the langmuir mixing is restrained under destabilizing surface forcing b f 0 and is enhanced under stabilizing conditions b f 0 the extended formulation therefore takes the form 15 e la t 1 c w u w la t 4 1 2 where c w u w 0 15 u 3 u 3 0 6 w 3 2 ensures that the enhancement is prevented from attaining unreasonably high levels in strongly convective conditions in addition smyth et al 2002 proposed non local momentum fluxes however these are not considered here following large et al 1994 as well as fan and griffies 2014 2 2 3 takaya et al 2010 parameterization tk10 takaya et al 2010 modified a prognostic skin sst scheme developed by zeng and beljaars 2005 to include a surface wave dependence under stable surface warming forcing conditions in which the standard scheme has been found to overestimate the surface temperature whereas the original scheme parameterized the thermal diffusivity in terms of classical monin obukhov similarity theory the tk10 modification adds an lat dependent enhancement factor to the diffusivity formula as 16 e la t max 1 la t 2 3 here the langmuir enhancement function e la t is defined so that it does not affect the mixing for large lat and is made to fit with the langmuir turbulence velocity scaling by grant and belcher 2009 tk10 found that including the impact of langmuir turbulence in terms of increased mixing improved the model s representation of the diurnal sst variability although not originally designed to parameterize langmuir turbulence in the kpp mixing scheme the lt enhancement function of tk10 has been implemented in the hycom version of kpp in an equivalent manner to the previously described parameterizations i e as a multiplicative enhancement factor for the unresolved turbulent vertical velocity w x 2 2 4 van roekel et al 2012 parameterization vr12 the parameterization by van roekel et al 2012 takes into account a possible mismatch in the direction between waves and the wind neglected in this work and has been tested in global simulations by li et al 2016 it was found to show the optimal mld improvement when combined with an enhancement of the boundary layer entrainment specially in the southern ocean assuming that wind and waves are aligned and hence the definition of lat as a function of only u and v s 0 the enhancement factor van roekel et al 2012 li et al 2016 used in this study takes the from 17 e la t 1 3 1 la t 2 5 4 la t 4 1 2 modification of the parameterization of the boundary layer in kpp following li et al 2016 proposes an enhancement of the entrainment at the base of the surface boundary layer by adding the stokes speed term to account for the lagrangian current in the definition of the bulk richardson number as 18 r i b z b r b z z u r u z 2 v t 2 z v s 0 2 this entrainment enhancement is combined with the van roekel et al 2012 scaling 17 and simply referred to as vr12 see table 1 however to avoid double counting it should be noted that the lt enhancement factor eq 17 is not applied to the velocity scale w s appearing in the expression for the unresolved shear eq 9 the enhancement of the boundary layer entrainment by langmuir turbulence is found to elevate the deepening effects of the vr12 parameterization li et al 2016 2 2 5 li and fox kemper 2017 parameterization lf17 motivated by the work of li et al 2016 with respect to parameterization of the lt influence on the boundary layer entrainment li and fox kemper 2017 proposed a scaling to the entrainment buoyancy flux w b e to account for the effect of lt under a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux in the derivation leading to the expression 9 for the unresolved shear in the default kpp the entrainment buoyancy flux is parameterized using the empirical relation w b e β t b f under pure convection large et al 1994 to account for the langmuir turbulence effects li and fox kemper 2017 proposed that the entrainment buoyancy flux under unstable conditions scales as 19 w b e h u 3 0 17 0 083 la sl 2 0 15 h κ l where l u 3 κb f is the monin obukhov length for the constants appearing in the right hand side see li and fox kemper 2017 their fig 8b and eq 21 also suggested through personal communication with the authors then the unresolved shear given in eq 9 is re derived li and fox kemper 2017 to incorporate the new lt enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux 19 as 20 v tl 2 z c v n z w s z z r i c w b e h w s z 3 1 2 note that this modified turbulent shear by li and fox kemper 2017 is applied only under destabilizing surface buoyancy flux because this is the regime in which their les simulations were conducted under neutral and stabilizing regimes we apply the default unresolved turbulence shear given in eq 9 as illustrated by li and fox kemper 2017 the modified unresolved turbulence shear velocity v tl 2 will make the diagnosed surface boundary layer slightly shallower in the convection limit as v tl 2 becomes slightly smaller than the default v t 2 however it will have deepening effects in the weak surface cooling limit see li and fox kemper 2017 p 2877 this means that the deepening effect will be constrained under pure convection conditions dominant winter conditions for example in the labrador sea while it will be enhanced under weak surface cooling and in the presence of wind and waves in experiment lf17 in addition to including lt effects in the entrainment buoyancy flux in eq 19 and hence adopting the modified unresolved shear in eq 20 the lasl based enhancement factor van roekel et al 2012 li et al 2016 21 e la sl 1 1 5 la sl 2 5 4 la sl 4 1 2 is applied to the velocity scale w x of the turbulence eddy diffusivity in eq 11 it is assumed that the lt affects both the entrainment buoyancy flux and the eddy diffusivity however to avoid double counting it should be noted that the lt enhancement factor 21 is not applied to the velocity scale appearing in the expression for the unresolved shear 20 note also that here the stokes drift term is not added in the denominator of the bulk richardson number see table 1 2 3 estimating the stokes drift velocity profile in deep water the stokes drift velocity profile is computed from the two dimensional wave spectrum e ω θ as 22 u s z 2 g 0 2 π 0 ω 3 k e 2 k z e ω θ d ω d θ where θ is the direction in which the wave component is propagating clockwise from north ω is the angular frequency and k sin θ cos θ is a unit vector in the direction of the wave component this is a costly operation to perform for all model points and often as in this study the full wave spectrum is not available therefore we use an approximate profile based on the parametric spectrum by phillips 1958 integrating over all directions the one dimensional frequency spectrum reads 23 f ω 0 2 π e ω θ d θ substituting eq 23 in eq 22 and using the phillips spectrum phillips 1958 an approximate profile of the stokes drift speed v s u s can be obtained by integrating for all frequencies breivik et al 2016 in the form 24 v s z v s 0 e 2 k z β 2 k π z erfc 2 k z where erfc is the complementary error function the inverse depth scale can be estimated from the surface stokes drift and the stokes transport see eq 23 by breivik et al 2016 k v s 0 2 v 1 2 β 3 where β is a constant and as suggested by breivik et al 2016 it is generally close to unity which is what we assume in this study the stokes transport can be estimated from the mean wave frequency f the mean wave direction and the significant wave height h m 0 v 2 π 16 f h m 0 2 k s breivik et al 2014 however in this study the surface stokes drift and stokes transport are interpolated from the wavewatch iii hindcast computed directly from the full wave energy spectrum these two parameters will be enough to reconstruct the profile 24 however averaging over the instantaneous hybrid coordinate is required in hycom therefore in order to reconstruct the layer averaged profile we use the integrated form of eq 24 that represents the stokes transport between a level z and the surface given in the form li et al 2017 25 v z v s 0 2 k 1 e 2 k z 2 β 3 1 π 2 k z 3 2 erfc 2 k z 1 2 k z e 2 k z thus the stokes drift averaged on a layer with upper interface at z top and lower interface at z bot is estimated as 26 v s v z bot v z top z bot z top where again β 1 using 2d parameters from the wavewatch iii hindcast as input to hycom i e the surface stokes drift velocities and the stokes transport the layer averaged profile is computed online using the depths of the pressure interfaces the direction of stokes drift is chosen to be in the direction of the stokes transport and assumed to be constant with depth the reconstructed and layer averaged stokes profile in hycom has been verified by computing its transport and comparing it against the corresponding stokes transport from wavewatch iii a very good agreement is found therefore the wave momentum is conserved in the layer averaged reconstruction we use the surface layer averaged stokes drift v s sl eq 26 to compute lasl because of the large depth of the mixed layer here the surface boundary layer in this study the impact of the reference stokes drift v ref s is negligible and is therefore taken to be zero similar to the approach by li et al 2016 and reichl et al 2016a 2 4 experimental setup the model has been initialized from a climatology of the world ocean atlas of 2005 locarnini et al 2006 antonov et al 2006 and spun up for 8 years from which the first two years are forced with climatology and the rest with realistic forcing the atmospheric forcing is interpolated from six hourly fluxes from era interim with grid resolution of approximately 79 km dee et al 2011 the wave parameters cover the world oceans to 80 n with three hourly temporal resolution which has been linearly interpolated at every model time step 800 s the spatial resolution of the wave parameters is 1 2 which is interpolated to the topaz4 grid all experiments are integrated for 3 years covering the period 2010 2012 the comparison of the impact of the parameterized langmuir turbulence mixing is performed using six experiments presented in table 1 where column 2 represents the experiment name as well as it refers to the corresponding parameterization and the third column shows the enhancement factor see also fig 1 in addition a separate experiment csfsm02 is conducted where the parameterization of the lt of smyth et al 2002 is combined with the coriolis stokes force stokes tracer advection and the wave modified stress it should be noted that the enhancement factor e la t in the case of the first four parameterizations ms00 sm02 tk10 is also applied to the velocity scale w s of the unresolved shear in shown in eq 9 however this is not the case for the last two parameterization vr12 and lf17 where the unresolved shear is enhanced either by the addition of stokes term in denominator of ri b or by an enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux as in eq 20 to investigate the performance of the different langmuir turbulence parameterizations on different geographical regions we split the domain into three sub regions as shown in fig 2 nordic covering nordic seas subplg covering the sub polar gyre region and subtrp covering the rest of the north atlantic south of 50 n while the whole domain will be referred to as wholed 2 5 validation data in order to assess the wave effects on the surface temperature we use sst from the operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis ostia dataset from the metoffice donlon et al 2012 representing globally interpolated data on 24 h temporal resolution it has been obtained from the cmems server 1 1 http marine copernicus eu and interpolated to the model domain see fig 2 ii the mld climatology data used here comes from de boyer montégut et al 2004 updated to include argo float data to 2012 rodgers et al 2014 gridded in 1 its winter and summer means interpolated to the model domain are plotted in fig 2 i in this data set the mld has been diagnosed using the density profile criterion defined as the depth at which the potential density differs from its surface value by a fixed threshold of 0 03 kg m 3 we use the same density criterion to calculate the mld fields from daily mean profiles then the monthly mean mld fields are obtained by averaging the daily mean mld fields the heat content estimates are computed following skagseth and mork 2012 27 hc c p ρ 0 h 0 t t ref d z where hc is the heat content c p the specific heat capacity of sea water ρ 0 a reference density and h the depth in our study the reference temperature t ref is zero degrees celsius as suggested by skagseth and mork 2012 heat content estimates from the model runs monthly averages are compared to those estimated from the monthly gridded 1 2 grid coriolis ocean dataset for reanalysis cora temperature dataset cabanes et al 2013 the cora dataset is a collection of quality controlled temperature and salinity in situ measurements collected from different sources and provided by the coriolis data center and distributed by cmems szekely et al 2016 the raw data received by the coriolis data center from different sources are put through a set of real or near real time quality control procedures to ensure a consistent dataset coatanoan and de la villeon 2005 to investigate the influence of langmuir turbulence on the sub surface structure the temperature profiles are compared with observations from the en4 dataset good et al 2013 the en4 dataset is a large historical collection of quality controlled ocean temperature and salinity profiles the comparison is performed by first interpolating the model daily averaged fields horizontally to the location of the observed temperature profiles and vertically to z levels where the observed profiles have been sampled the horizontal interpolation is performed using a bilinear technique then the interpolated daily averaged profile is directly compared with the corresponding instantaneous en4 profile therefore no temporal averaging of the observations has been performed in this paper the winter and summer means are computed respectively over january march jfm and july september jas both means are from a three year model average all the observations of sst mld heat content and temperature profiles are absolute values not anomalies relative to a given period this also applies to their model counterparts 3 simulation results it is expected that the parameterized langmuir turbulence enhances upper ocean mixing potentially reducing ocean model biases in regions and seasons in which the mld is underestimated here we assess the impact of lt parameterizations as well as the other wave effects described in section 2 on the forecast model topaz4 the operational version of the topaz4 system 2 2 see http marine copernicus eu and the validation report therein overestimates the winter mld and underestimates it in spring and early summer by about 40 m this behavior is relatively common in ocean models e g griffies et al 2009 sallée et al 2013 williams et al 2018 a synthesis of ocean reanalyses in the arctic uotila et al 2018 has shown that models generally overestimate deep mixing in winter and vice versa in summer the forecast sst is already too cold all year round when compared to in situ buoys by about 0 3 k and satellite sst by about 0 1 k so the wave mixing is probably not the main source of error in the 28 layer configuration of topaz4 in the 50 layer configuration used here without wave effects as will be shown the mld is underestimated in the rest of the domain area south of 50 n referred to as subtrp all year round but still too deep in winter in the nordic and sub polar gyre subplg areas the sst is also overestimated in subtropics in all seasons but underestimated in winter in the areas nordic and subplg so even though some lt parameterizations should in principle degrade the solutions in the subplg and nordic areas there is room for improvement in the subtrp region further south to assess the parameterizations of langmuir turbulence in our 50 layer setup of topaz4 we focus mainly on the effects on the sea surface temperature the ocean heat content and mixed layer depth by running six experiments see table 1 and comparing the results against independent observations additionally a test is performed using the experiment csfsm02 some examples of the range of the langmuir number used here are shown by the daily mean time series at the locations a b c plotted in fig 1 along with the enhancement factors plotted against the langmuir number as can be seen ms00 induces the strongest enhancement factor with the highest mean and variation followed by tk10 sm02 and vr12 while the lasl dependent enhancement factor 21 used in lf17 induced a seasonal variability in which the lt mixing is enhanced during summer and reduced during winter the seasonality of the enhancement factor 21 is due to lasl which as a result of the significant difference between the summer and winter boundary layer thickness becomes small strong wave effects during summer and large during winter fig 1 ii illustrates how the magnitude of enhancement factors varies when plotted against lat while the blue curve represents the enhancement factor 21 plotted against lasl as also seen lasl shows a larger seasonal variability than lat 3 1 influence on mixed layer depth to examine and validate the impact from each of the different parameterizations the model mld is compared with the climatology data of de boyer montégut et al 2004 updated to include argo data to 2012 rodgers et al 2014 where the modeled mld is diagnosed using the same density criterion as used for the climatology the winter jfm and summer jas means of mld from both the climatology and model control run cntl with no wave effects are plotted against each other in fig 2 i moreover maps of the mean mld bias against observation for winter and summer averages computed for the six experiments table 1 are shown in fig 3 this figure indicates that the mld in the cntl run is shallower than observations almost everywhere in summer fig 3 ii a whereas in winter too deep mld can be observed around the labrador and nordic seas as well as shallower mld in the subtropics fig 3 i a similar to the results obtained by fan and griffies 2014 and as shown in fig 3 i b c the predicted mld is significantly degraded with the ms00 scheme in the labrador sea region and to a lesser extent with sm02 see fig 4 in fan and griffies 2014 the shallow mld biases can be seen to be reduced when adding the langmuir mixing effects as given in fig 3 ii c d e f notably the parameterizations from sm02 smyth et al 2002 and tk10 takaya et al 2010 as well as vr12 li et al 2016 yield reductions in summer biases at high latitudes and in the subtropics figs 3 ii and 4 i these improvements are reflected by reduced mld root mean square errors rmse as shown fig 5 i in winter however the parameterized lt effects appear to introduce too strong mixing as a consequence the mld prediction in the labrador and nordic seas is degraded in addition many shallow biases become deep biases in particular when using the ms00 scaling fig 3 i b the percentage increase on mld due to lt mixing is shown in fig 6 the distribution of the zonal mean mld bias given in fig 4 i computed from fig 3 shows that the lt parameterizations by ms00 sm02 tk10 and vr12 exhibit a strong mld deepening during winter at high latitudes and hence the rmses are increased as shown in fig 5 i these results may not be surprising as these four lt parameterizations are based on lat and generally give the strongest enhancement as shown in the middle panel in fig 1 as seen from this figure the lasl based enhancement factor 21 has lower values during winter on the contrary the lf17 scheme which adds the enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux and adopts the surface layer averaged langmuir number lasl appears to be the only scheme which introduces stronger mld deepening in summer than in winter see fig 6 and therefore leading to improvements on mld during both summer winter without exaggerating the existing deep biases fig 5 i in winter as the mld is already deep at high latitudes small improvements are generally south of 50 n figs 4 i and 5 i interestingly with the lf17 scheme a weak shallowing between 50 and 70 n region of strong convection appears during winter see figs 4 i and 5 i this is probably due to shallowing by the modified unresolved shear velocity 20 under strong convective conditions fig 4 i displays large summer negative mld biases between latitudes 3 s and 10 s which can be related to the southern hemisphere winter where the mld deepening increases as shown by the observation in fig 2 i b but not well captured in the cntl run fig 2 i d the model is relaxed to the climatology at the southern open boundary so the difference between this climatology and mld observations see fig 2 could also contribute to these errors adding that the langmuir mixing effect appears to slightly reduce these negative biases the performance of langmuir mixing parameterizations varies depending on regions and regimes all the parameterizations considered in this study tend to deepen the mld compared to the control run table 2 except with the lf17 approach the impact in winter is clearly much stronger than in summer fig 6 in particular the parameterization by ms00 induces too vigorous mixing which leads to excessive mld increase in the winter over large regions table 2 presents the mld percentage increase averaged over the whole region and the three subregions see fig 2 and for both winter and summer means from three year average this illustrates again that there is a clear seasonality of the influence of the langmuir mixing where deepening in winter is more pronounced for instance when averaged over the whole domain however this is not the case for lf17 parameterization for which the percentage increase in mld during summer is larger than during winter the percentage increase on mld induced by the parameterization of lf17 at high latitude fig 6 appears to be roughly close to the ranges 15 20 shown by d asaro et al 2014 who used a completely different turbulence model than kpp to account for the langmuir mixing it should be observed that in table 2 the mean percentage mld deepening due to the ms00 scheme in winter on region subplg is more than double that induced by sm02 smyth et al 2002 while both ms00 and sm02 parameterizations induce approximately an equivalent percentage deepening on this region in summer fig 6 this is due to the inclusion of the stability effects in sm02 scaling which works to suppress the mld deepening under convictive conditions which are favorable during winter over region subplg however still the winter mld is exaggerated with sm02 in this region fig 4 i the excessive mixing induced by the ms00 and sm02 scalings agrees with findings by li et al 2016 when adopting the same schemes in the cesm with pop2 instead of applying a single enhancement factor for both the unresolved shear and the eddy viscosity the vr12 and lf17 use a separate enhancement for the unresolved shear as shown in table 1 the high percentage increase in winter mld with vr12 presented in fig 6 suggests that enhancing the unresolved shear by adding the stokes drift term would overestimate the mld the consideration of the langmuir mixing effects on the entrainment buoyancy flux by lf17 scheme li and fox kemper 2017 is found to restrain the excessive winter deepening fig 6 and therefore appears to be a more adequate approach for enhancing the unresolved turbulent shear our results agree with the findings by li and fox kemper 2017 who showed that their scheme increases the mld deepening in the southern ocean during summer while yielding only a modest impact under strongly convective winter conditions the temporal variability of the mean bias is also analyzed as can be seen from the mean bias time series fig 7 i the mld from the control run cntl black dash line is always shallower than mld from climatology data in summer and in all seasons in the subtropics fig 7 i d nevertheless this shallow bias is significantly decreased when adding langmuir turbulence mixing with the lf17 parameterization yielding the best overall performance fig 7 i a especially during winter in contrast all four schemes involving the original lat number ms00 sm02 tk10 vr12 cause excessive winter time deepening of the mld averaged over the model domain 3 2 influence on ocean temperature the langmuir turbulence enhances upper ocean mixing leading to deepening of the mld and therefore has important effects on the ocean temperature to examine such effects on sst model results are compared against sst observations from ostia the winter jfm and summer jas means of sst from both ostia and cntl run are plotted against each other in fig 2 ii the latitudinal distribution of the zonal mean sst bias fig 4 ii shows that adding langmuir mixing substantially reduces warm sst biases most notably in the summer this is also reflected by the rmse shown in fig 5 ii which displays no noticeable rmse reduction in winter the temporal variability of the mean sst bias is presented in fig 7 ii which indicates that the averaged sst from the control run cntl dash black line is generally warmer than ostia sst except for the winter sst in the nordic and subplg areas this can be seen more clearly in the sst error maps given in figs 8 a overall this warm bias is reduced when including the langmuir mixing effects with the five lt parameterizations in particular the tk10 scaling appears to significantly reduce the mean warm bias over region subtrp fig 7 ii d purple line however the induced mixing appears to be too vigorous causing underestimated sst in the subtrp region as presented in fig 8 ii d in region subplg the vr12 scaling outperforms others in correcting both negative and positive mean sst biases fig 7 ii c cyan line while lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 parameterization introduces a bias reduction approximately similar to that induced by tk10 scaling fig 7 ii c red dash and purple lines the ms00 parameterization induces too large cold sst biases south of 50 n both in winter and summer fig 4 ii red line also shown by the mean bias map given in figs 8b overall the lf17 yields good reductions in the warm sst biases without causing aggressive increase in the cold biases for example see the bias in region subtrp in fig 8 ii f during winter the control run shows large positive sst bias especially around the gulf stream labrador current and in the south east atlantic and negative biases in the middle north atlantic fig 8 i a the exception is the ms00 scaling which mixes excessively the other four parameterizations appear to lead to only a small impact on these biases such biases are often related to the large scale circulation features of the model and the mixing parameterizations cannot directly improve their representations fig 9 shows the time series of the mean ocean heat content down to 700 m depth from experiments cntl with no wave effects and the five langmuir mixing parameterizations in addition the heat content from cora observation cabanes et al 2013 plotted in dash gray line a distinct seasonal cycle is depicted in the heat content of the ocean with maximum in summer and minimum in winter in general the heat content derived from the control run is lower than those estimated from observations fig 9 dash black line the lt parameterizations enhance the mixing of surface water with that in the interior layers mainly leading to a cooling of sst and therefore indirectly increases the air to ocean heat flux that elevates the ocean heat uptake from the beginning of the simulation the ocean heat content starts gradually to increase when adding lt effects relative to the control experiment cntl fig 9 and appears to become more closer to the cora observations however the increase in the heat content introduced by ms00 as well as tk10 parameterizations is too high which is due to the strong enhancement factors associated with the two schemes as shown in fig 1 it is likely that this rapid increase in the heat content could have continued in ever longer simulations the enhancement factor by ms00 causes vigorous mixing and with it a significant injection of heat into the deeper layers conversely it appears that ms00 reduces the heat content excessively on the nordic region relative to the cntl run fig 9b red line contrarily to the sub tropical regions the nordic seas experience a year round influx of warm water which lies underneath relatively cold surface water when more mixing brings it to the surface it can be cooled through heat loss to the atmosphere this heat loss in the nordic region can be explained by the large increase in the cold bias in the temperature profiles by ms00 shown in fig 10 top panels it should be noted that there may exist an offset between the heat content in the control case and the cora dataset as seen for example in region subtrp fig 9d the comparison to the time series of cora observations yields that the phase of the seasonal cycle is late in the cntl run particularly in the nordic and subtrp regions though the subplg region seems to vary in phase fig 9 none of the different langmuir mixing parameterizations does seem to change the phase of the seasonal cycle indicating that the cause of the delays must be elsewhere the change in the ocean heat content due to langmuir induced mixing indicates a change in the subsurface temperature profile fig 10 shows that the different parameterizations generally tend to reduce the biases at the surface but not necessarily the biases at all depths other than the winter in region subplg the profiles mainly show warm near surface biases an explanation for improvement here can be due to the characteristics of lt effects which mainly induce cooling of surface layer and hence warm near surface biases are reduced only in the subplg region do the cold biases reduce at all depths both in summer and winter elsewhere the sub surface biases rather seem exacerbated by the langmuir parameterizations even in the subtrp region where improvements were expected due to the too shallow mld and warm sst biases in the subtrp the strong lt enhancement will cool the sst by mixing warm surface water with relatively cold subsurface water and therefore contribute to warming the interior and to exacerbate existing warm biases the impact due to other wave effects is examined in experiment csfsm02 as shown by the latitudinal distribution of the zonal mean bias plotted in fig 11 ii adding the coriolis stokes force stokes tracer advection and the wave dependent wind stress combined with the langmuir mixing enhancement by sm02 in experiment csfsm02 introduces no noticeable differences in sst biases similar results are also found when computing the mld biases fig 11 i suggesting that langmuir mixing is much more important than these wave processes this agrees with the results by reichl et al 2016a who found under idealized hurricane conditions that the langmuir turbulence has a much greater influence than the coriolis stokes force we have also rerun the same experiment csfsm02 by including the vortex force in the horizontal momentum ignoring the wave induced pressure however we did not find any apparent differences the terms involving the vorticity times stokes drift velocities may have smaller impact than the coriolis stokes force on the basis of the scale of the horizontal grid resolution used in this study and therefore could be one reason for such negligible effects 4 discussion and concluding remarks in this study five different parameterizations table 1 of langmuir turbulence mixing in the north atlantic have been investigated using hycom and wave forcings from a wavewatch iii global hindcast rascle et al 2008 rascle and ardhuin 2013 these parameterizations are proposed to enhance the turbulent vertical kinetic energy and hence the mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer through modification of the kpp scheme of large et al 1994 the impact due to the coriolis stokes force stokes tracer advection and wave modified stress in combination with the langmuir effects have been assessed the estimation of the stokes drift profile based on the phillips spectrum from breivik et al 2016 has now been implemented in hycom the langmuir turbulence parameterization on the boundary layer entrainment by li et al 2016 as well as the enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux by li and fox kemper 2017 have now been implemented in the kpp scheme used in hycom we adopted the definition of the langmuir turbulence number following mcwilliams et al 1997 as a measure of the relative impact of the wind driven shear to the magnitude of the stokes drift at the surface in addition we have also implemented and used the surface layer averaged langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 in the scheme by li and fox kemper 2017 evaluation of the model results were made by comparison with climatologies of the mixed layer and ocean temperature it is found that the parameterized langmuir turbulence has a rapid and significant effect on the mixed layer depth sea surface temperature and ocean heat content in addition the impact is overall much stronger in winter compared to summer except for the parameterization that uses the enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux and the surface layer averaged langmuir number li and fox kemper 2017 in contrast the inclusion of the coriolis stokes force stokes drift tracer advection and the wave dependent wind stress did not introduce noticeable differences in the model results fig 11 the main improvements of our simulations when adding the langmuir mixing are exhibited with the parameterizations by smyth et al 2002 van roekel et al 2012 and li and fox kemper 2017 specifically in regions and season of underpredicted mld and overpredicted sst however the winter mld is strongly degraded with the schemes by smyth et al 2002 and van roekel et al 2012 which is shown by increased rmses fig 5 this is not the case with the parameterization by li and fox kemper 2017 which reduces the rmse in summer while preforms as good as the control run with no wave effects in winter the scaling by takaya et al 2010 is found to introduce substantial improvements on sst and mld in the subtropical region subtrp especially during summer however it appears that the induced mixing is too vigorous which causes excessive warming of deep ocean layers and lead to a rapid increase in ocean heat content figs 9 and 10 purple line this could likely shift the model to an unstable state in longer model runs this strong mixing with the takaya et al 2010 scheme which is based on a vke scaling by grant and belcher 2009 can be due to that takaya et al 2010 did not design and test their enhancement factor for the kpp it was only suggested to improve the prediction of a skin sst model during day time the parameterization by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 is found to introduce the most vigorous mixing which strongly degrades the mld on high latitude areas during winter whereas in summer large biases are found around the equator fig 4 the scaling by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 is shown to cool the sst excessively and to warm the deeper layers leading to a severely exaggerated ocean heat content in particular the abnormal increase in the ocean heat content introduced by the scheme by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 fig 9a red line if continued would shift the model into a new climate state which is clearly unrealistic in the nordic region on the contrary we find a reduction of the heat content under the scaling by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 because the enhanced mixing exposes deep warm waters to the surface and thereby increases the heat loss to the atmosphere smyth et al 2002 extended the ms00 scheme to include stability effects to restrain the excessive mixing in destabilizing convective conditions fig 6 shows that the vigorous mld deepening induced by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 scheme in winter is reduced with scheme by smyth et al 2002 however this also true for the other parameterizations overall there is a reduction of the summertime warm sst bias when adding langmuir mixing effects most pronounced in the subtropical region however with the scalings by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 and takaya et al 2010 the sst cooling is too strong which leads to an excessive and rapid warming of the ocean interior fig 10 the schemes by van roekel et al 2012 and li and fox kemper 2017 preform best in improving sst without increasing their rmses the ocean heat content in the control run cntl is found to be generally smaller than cora observations and is found to increase with langmuir mixing and hence become closer to the observations the smaller heat content in the control case is more pronounced in the subtropical and sub polar gyre regions this may be due to insufficient vertical mixing that reduces air to ocean heat fluxes as these regions show warm sst bias in summer except van roekel et al 2012 and li and fox kemper 2017 all the other lt parameterizations apply a single enhancement factor for the velocity scale of both the eddy diffusivity and unresolved shear velocity this approach is found to overestimate the winter mld at hight latitude fig 4 and therefore it is more adequate to adopt separate enhancements for the two processes e g reichl et al 2016b li and fox kemper 2017 following the suggestion of li et al 2016 the surface stokes drift is added to the unresolved shear in the bulk richardson number 18 in the van roekel et al 2012 experiment however in an experiment where we left out the surface stokes drift from the unresolved shear not shown we found that its addition is actually detrimental to the mld bias similar to li and fox kemper 2017 the modified unresolved shear velocity v t l 2 20 is found to magnify the lt effect under weak surface cooling and presence of wind and wave and to restrain it under strong pure convective conditions in addition and because of its dependency on the ocean mixed layer the surface layer averaged langmuir number becomes small magnifying the wave effects during summer and large suppressing the wave effects during winter this helps to constrain the winter mixing where the enhancement factor 21 approaches one for example in deep convection regions such as the labrador sea moreover the surface layer averaged langmuir number is better in capturing the effects from different wavelength and accurately predicts the value of the vertical turbulent kinetic energy harcourt and d asaro 2008 therefore consideration of the stokes penetration depth hence the surface layer averaged langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 and the stability li and fox kemper 2017 in the parameterized lt effects are important in restraining the excessive lt mixing specially during winter our results with respect to the impact with the scaling by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 agree with findings in similar studies focused on global climate time scale investigation of the impact of parameterized langmuir turbulence on the boundary layer mixing such as fan and griffies 2014 and li et al 2016 fan and griffies 2014 argued that the too strong influence by the mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 scaling exaggerates the wave induced turbulent mixing in weakly stratified winter conditions and underestimates the mixing in stably stratified summer conditions therefore their choice was the smyth et al 2002 scheme finding it to perform better than ms00 for cm2 m with improvement in winter mld around labrador seas it is worth noting that li et al 2016 reported a very high computational cost when using online wave ocean coupling 36 increase in computer time like li et al 2017 our study demonstrates that off line wave ocean coupling if wave forcing is available can be an affordable approach to account for the langmuir turbulence mixing and still introducing similar impacts the model control run without wave effects tends to exhibit both too shallow and too deep wintertime mixed layers at high latitudes but the summertime mld is almost everywhere underestimated the lf17 parameterization yields the best performance in reducing these biases without degrading the existing mld and sst results there is probably still room for more improvement for example the summertime langmuir mixing is not strong enough to sufficiently deepen the mixed layer in the subtropical atlantic ocean 30 n and 40 n as shown in fig 10 in reichl et al 2016b it is possible to increase the impact of lt mixing by considering the enhancement factor 21 but without taking the square root it should be noted that the large biases in the control run without wave mixing cannot be attributed to missing lt effects these shortcomings can be due to other physical processes that affect the mixing in the ocean boundary layer as well as errors in the air sea fluxes the comparisons of the different schemes are always consistent from one year to another moreover the three years of simulation of the north atlantic have experienced a wide variety of combinations of wave regimes and low high heating of the ocean the comparison of the temperature sst and profiles are made for the same three year period as the observations not from climatology however it would probably be interesting to extend the integration time and investigate the long term impact future work could couple the langmuir mixing with re stratification effects such as parameterization of meso and sub mesoscale eddies in the ocean boundary layer fox kemper et al 2011 to reduce the excessive mixing in the control case cntl one may also consider adjusting the critical richardson number as it might have already been tuned to implicitly account for wave effects reichl et al 2016b treating the latter as a free tuning parameter a more fair comparison would have been achieved by adjusting a different value for each lt parameterization so that their median enhancement factor is equal a more accurate assessment of the performance of lt parameterizations would also benefit from a different criterion for determining the mld as reported by noh et al 2016 and ok et al 2017 the comparison of mld diagnosed with the density threshold of 0 03 kg m 3 induces spurious errors at high latitudes during winter due to the different characteristics of the vertical density structures another potential extension would be to consider the lt parameterization by reichl et al 2016b where two separate enhancement factors were suggested including a dependency on the smooth function g z h for the velocity scale and the unresolved shear which were derived using les simulations under tropical cyclone conditions further improvement can probably be achieved by including more wave parameters in the langmuir turbulence parameterization such as the miss alignment between the wind and wave directions van roekel et al 2012 mcwilliams et al 2014 li et al 2016 in this work these effects have been neglected in eqs 17 19 and 21 mcwilliams et al 2014 and reichl et al 2016b have shown the importance of including the lagrangian shear in the parameterization of the turbulent momentum fluxes with lt this is not considered here the lagrangian shear primarily affects the parameterization of the turbulent momentum flux in two ways first by better aligning with the direction of the turbulent stress than when only using the eulerian shear this is however not an issue for us as kpp always imposes a current shear in the direction of the turbulent stress the second effect is that the down gradient mixing associated with stokes drift shear will change the near surface eulerian current which may partially counter the stokes advection term it is also supported by sinha et al 2015 who followed teixeira 2012 and developed an lt parameterization for kpp that includes enhanced velocity scaling non local transport for momentum and local down stokes gradient mixing which they have shown to give good results for full depth langmuir circulation in shallow water their results warrant future consideration of this parameterization in deep water another potentially important wave effect that can be investigated is a contribution of the stokes shear force in the vertical momentum termed wavy hydrostatic by suzuki and fox kemper 2016 however we expect departures from hydrostasy to be small in our model setup since the wavy hydrostatic eq 14 by suzuki and fox kemper 2016 differs from the hydrostatic equation by a term which scales with the rossby number which is small for basin scales we have performed a sensitivity study of the impact of several competing langmuir parameterizations in a realistic basin scale ocean model the study provides upper and lower bounds on the impact that can be expected from including langmuir parameterizations in kpp type turbulence schemes as expected the ms00 parameterization is too strong and indeed ms00 noted that the lack of a stability dependence would limit the usefulness of the parameterization in real settings overall the lt parameterizations exhibit a stronger impact in winter relative to summer except the scheme by lf17 which induces summertime mixing stronger than that during winter thus reducing summer temperature biases without degrading the winter sst lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 thus stands out as the best performing parameterization of the ones tested with this model setup and the only one which improves the overall biases compared with the model control run acknowledgments this research has received support from

24039,five different parameterizations of langmuir turbulence lt effect are investigated in a realistic model of the north atlantic and arctic using realistic wave forcing from a global wave hindcast the parameterizations mainly apply an enhancement to the turbulence velocity scale and or to the entrainment buoyancy flux in the surface boundary layer an additional run is also performed with other wave effects to assess the relative importance of langmuir turbulence namely the coriolis stokes forcing stokes tracer advection and wave modified momentum fluxes the default model without wave effects underestimates the mixed layer depth in summer and overestimates it at high latitudes in the winter the results show that adding lt mixing reduces shallow mixed layer depth mld biases particularly in the subtropics all year around and in the nordic seas in summer there is overall a stronger relative impact on the mld during winter than during summer in particular the parameterization with the most vigorous lt effect causes winter mld increases by more than 50 relative to a control run without langmuir mixing on the contrary the parameterization which assumes lt effects on the entrainment buoyancy flux and accounts for the stokes penetration depth is able to enhance the mixing in summer more than in winter this parameterization is also distinct from the others because it restrains the lt mixing in regions of deep mld biases so it is the preferred choice for our purpose the different parameterizations do not change the amplitude or phase of the seasonal cycle of heat content but do influence its long term trend which means that the lt can influence the drift of ocean models the combined impact on water mass properties from the coriolis stokes force the stokes drift tracer advection and the wave dependent momentum fluxes is negligible compared to the effect from the parameterized langmuir turbulence keywords langmuir mixing parameterization mixed layer depth sea surface temperature ocean heat content stokes penetration depth 1 introduction the interaction between surface waves and ocean circulation is a complex process which involves a wide range of temporal and spatial scales ranging from fast moving waves to the much slower mean flow the influence of wind driven surface waves on the underlying ocean circulation and upper ocean mixing has been recognized to play a critical role in reducing known systematic biases in climate models as discussed by belcher et al 2012 who argued that turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer will be underestimated if the effect of surface waves is not accounted for the feedback to the atmosphere is mostly thermodynamic and a relatively small temperature bias may have large consequences for the deep convection in the atmosphere sheldon and czaja 2014 the ocean primary production is also strongly influenced by the thickness of the mixed layer and therefore accurate predictions of the mixed layer depth mld are crucial for biogeochemical modeling neglecting the near surface effects of whitecapping the main impact of surface waves on upper ocean dynamics is broadly believed to be related to an aggregate drift of water particles known as the stokes drift stokes 1847 the interaction between the stokes drift and the mean current vorticity forces overturning cell like structures known as langmuir circulation cells leibovich 1983 thorpe 2004 which interact with a multitude of small scale processes in the oceanic boundary layer to produce a turbulence regime called langmuir turbulence lt mcwilliams et al 1997 ardhuin and jenkins 2006 suzuki and fox kemper 2016 the oceanic momentum balance is affected by an enhanced veering compared to ekman veering of the currents due to the coriolis stokes force hasselmann 1971 weber 1983 and the advection of tracers by the stokes drift e g van den bremer and breivik 2018 as well as by the interaction of the stokes shear with the eulerian advection of momentum mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 suzuki et al 2016 the latter effect is traditionally represented in the form of a so called vortex force theory and a modified pressure term following the asymptotic theory developed by craik and leibovich 1976 to explain langmuir circulation although potentially important in coastal regions e g uchiyama et al 2010 the significance of the craik leibovich vortex force on the large scale ocean circulation has been questioned on the basis of the higher order nature of the terms in the wave phase averaged momentum equations mellor 2016 the importance of the inclusion of surface wave effects such as langmuir turbulence mixing in general circulation models has been given more attention recently belcher et al 2012 fan and griffies 2014 breivik et al 2015 noh et al 2016 li et al 2016 2017 downwelling jets associated with langmuir circulation may penetrate beyond the stokes depth polton and belcher 2007 and can therefore increase the turbulent mixing down to the base of the surface boundary layer enhancing the deepening of mld li et al 1995 sullivan et al 2007 the downward velocity associated with langmuir cells significantly energizes buoyancy driven overturning circulations at submesoscale fronts when they are aligned with the stokes shear suzuki et al 2016 large eddy simulation les studies of the langmuir circulation using the vortex force have shown considerable enhancement of the turbulent kinetic energy tke in the surface boundary layer e g skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 sullivan et al 2007 mcwilliams and fox kemper 2013 in an investigation to quantify the impact d asaro et al 2014 found an average increase of 15 20 in mld at high latitudes as well as enhancement of the vertical turbulent kinetic energy vke within the mixed layer by approximately a factor of two using les solutions of the wave averaged equations in a weakly convective wind driven surface boundary layer mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 hereafter ms00 were the first to propose a parameterization of the bulk effects of lt in the k profile parameterization turbulence scheme kpp large et al 1994 using the turbulent langmuir number 1 la t u v s 0 1 2 of mcwilliams et al 1997 here u and v s 0 are the water side friction velocity and surface stokes drift respectively the turbulent langmuir number lat can be understood as a measure of the production of the turbulence kinetic energy by current shear relative to the stokes drift production grant and belcher 2009 ms00 themselves noted that their parameterization lacks an explicit stability dependence suggesting that it may not be applicable in realistic applications without further modifications to address this limitation smyth et al 2002 hereafter sm02 extended the ms00 formula to include stratification effects intended to restrain the mixing enhancement under unstable stratification i e in convective conditions and to magnify it under stable stratification harcourt and d asaro 2008 reformulated the langmuir number in terms of a surface layer averaged value of the stokes drift instead of its surface value and have shown it to be successful in capturing the bulk properties of the vke in the mixed layer the surface layer averaged langmuir number is given as 2 la sl u v s sl v ref s 1 2 where v s sl represents the stokes drift magnitude averaged over a thin layer near the surface and its thickness is estimated as the top 20 of the ocean mixed layer harcourt and d asaro 2008 and v ref s is the stokes drift at a reference level considered to be at the base of the mixed layer the averaging over the thin surface layer is introduced to address the importance of the stokes decay scale in influencing the structure and the dynamics of lt the surface layer averaged langmuir number 2 has recently been shown to yield good results in the lt induced mixing enhancement in several studies harcourt and d asaro 2008 van roekel et al 2012 reichl et al 2016b li et al 2016 takaya et al 2010 hereafter tk10 proposed a refinement of a prognostic skin sst model by accounting for langmuir turbulence mixing under stable conditions using a velocity scale by grant and belcher 2009 although they did not test it in kpp they followed the ms00 approach and proposed the scaling by grant and belcher 2009 as an lt enhancement factor applied to the eddy diffusivity in their sst model in such way that it neglects the lt effects under large values of lat they have shown it to be successful in enhancing ocean mixing and reducing the diurnal variability of sst under waves presence van roekel et al 2012 hereafter vr12 using a broadband empirical wave spectrum introduced langmuir mixing parameterization accounting for the misalignment between wind and wave directions which is also based on a surface layer averaged langmuir number here we use their adjusted enhancement factor for the conditions where wind and waves are aligned li et al 2016 in addition we adopt the lt enhancement of the boundary layer entrainment by modifying the bulk richardson number with a stokes drift term li et al 2016 li and fox kemper 2017 hereafter lf17 investigated the lt effects on the entrainment buoyancy flux in the ocean surface boundary layer using les with various combinations of wind waves and destabilizing surface buoyancy flux it is found that the entrainment is enhanced substantially under weakly convective conditions while the effects are moderate under strongly convective turbulence they therefore proposed an lt enhancement estimate of the scaling of the entrainment buoyancy flux at the base of the boundary layer and derived a new expression for the unresolved turbulence shear velocity in the kpp scheme combined with a lasl based enhancement factor from van roekel et al 2012 they have shown that this new modification has improved the mld in the southern ocean in their community earth system model cesm model simulations there have been recent studies where langmuir mixing parameterizations in kpp have been compared in global climate simulations for example fan and griffies 2014 and li et al 2016 using respectively the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl climate model cm2m and cesm both are coupled with wavewatch iii tolman et al 2002 tolman and others 2009 the ocean components for cm2 m and cesm are the modular ocean model mom4 and the parallel ocean program pop2 respectively fan and griffies 2014 found the ms00 parameterization to cause excessive mixing and the sm02 scaling to work best in correcting warm sst and shallow mld biases in cm2m however li et al 2016 found both parameterizations to induce too much mixing suggesting that the effect could be model dependent this motivated them to test with the parameterization from van roekel et al 2012 considering surface layer averaged langmuir number wind wave misalignment as well as boundary layer entrainment enhancement finding these to introduce substantial improvements in mld predictions in the southern ocean in the summer in this study we assess the impact of five parameterizations of lt mixing in the kpp scheme implemented in the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom bleck 2002 described above as ms00 sm02 tk10 vr12 and lf17 with enhancement factors based on the langmuir numbers lat or lasl and in the case of the sm02 and lf17 parameterizations also the stability the wave forcing fields are interpolated from a wavewatch iii global hindcast rascle et al 2008 rascle and ardhuin 2013 langmuir turbulence is considered to be an important wave related mixing process belcher et al 2012 in the open ocean in order to assess its impact relative to other wave effects we have included one experiment csfsm02 where we add the coriolis stokes force hasselmann 1970 the tracer advection by the stokes drift uchiyama et al 2010 and the wave modified stress the latter is a consequence of the growth and decay of waves with changing winds because waves absorb a portion of the wind stress when they grow and conversely the momentum flux to the ocean from breaking waves continues after the wind has died down weber 1983 janssen 2012 breivik et al 2015 a regional configuration of hycom for the north atlantic and the arctic ocean is used here referred to as topaz4 sakov et al 2012 which is providing both the arctic forecast and reanalysis products of the copernicus marine environment services cmems we will try to reconcile the results from previous comparison studies and suggest a practical operational implementation able to improve the topaz4 forecast and reanalysis services for cmems to our knowledge this study is the first time these parameterizations have been compared in a realistic basin scale ocean model as will be shown we find improvements in the reduction of the warm sst and shallow mld biases with langmuir mixing in the subtropical summer with sm02 vr12 and lf17 parameterizations however the sm02 and vr12 scalings appear to degrade the wintertime mld leading to increased root mean square errors rmse at high latitudes the tk10 scaling is also found to reduce mld and sst biases however it appears to introduce an excessive mixing that causes too high heat content and mld deepening in agreement with the findings by fan and griffies 2014 and li et al 2016 we also find the parameterization by ms00 to introduce the most vigorous mixing the control run without lt effects yields a too deep mixed layer at mid high latitudes and underpredicted ssts in the middle of the north atlantic these biases in the control run are found to be exacerbated when adding langmuir mixing particularly with the parameterization of ms00 in agreement with the finding by li and fox kemper 2017 the lt enhanced unresolved shear with the lf17 approach is found to restrain the mld deepening induced by vr12 parameterization in which the stokes drift term v s 0 2 is added to the denominator of the bulk richardson number furthermore the mixing enhancement with the surface layer averaged langmuir number used in lf17 is shown to reduce the lt effects in regions that already overestimate the winter mld while it increases it during summer among the lt parameterizations considered here the lf17 scheme is found to reduce the summer mld rmses the most it also performs as good as the control run during winter this paper is organized as follows a description of the methodology is given in section 2 where the wave averaged equations the stokes drift profile approximation and the parameterization of the langmuir turbulence mixing are outlined in section 3 the results of in total seven experiments as well as a comparison against observations are presented with a focus on the influence on ocean temperature total heat content and mixed layer depth the results are discussed and summarized in section 4 2 methodology in the present study hycom is configured for a domain covering the north atlantic and arctic oceans ranging from 10 km and 16 km horizontal resolution from 1 6 to 1 8 and forced with wind fields from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf there are 50 hybrid vertical layers of which 10 are fixed z layers covering approximately the upper 20 m the model setup is similar to sakov et al 2012 except that data assimilation is not included and the vertical resolution has been increased from 28 to 50 hybrid layers in addition the thickness of the top layer is set to 1 m rather than 3 m which is important in particular for the coriolis stokes force and the stokes tracer advection since the stokes drift decays rapidly with depth at the lateral boundary the model variables are relaxed towards the corresponding monthly climatology using relaxation zones of width equivalent to 20 grid cells in addition a barotropic inflow is imposed through the bering strait to account for the inflow of pacific water this however is balanced by an equivalent outflow at the southern open boundary the thermodynamics fluxes are determined following drange and simonsen 1996 and to better represent the diurnal cycle the estimation of the short wave radiation is updated every three hours the integrated wave parameters are computed from the full wave spectrum where the wave effects on sea ice are neglected the wind forcings used in the wave hindcast are from a combination of ecmwf operational analyses and the climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 the stokes drift profile is reconstructed based on the phillips spectrum approximation following breivik et al 2016 and li et al 2017 here a brief description of the wave averaged equations and the langmuir turbulence mixing parameterizations in the kpp scheme are given at the end of this section the stokes drift profile approximation is presented as well as a description of the experimental setup and the observations used for model validation 2 1 wave terms in the mean flow equations the stokes drift stokes 1847 is defined as the difference between the mean eulerian velocity at a fixed point u w and the mean lagrangian velocity u l w l of a particle subjected to an orbital motion andrews and mcintyre 1978 van den bremer and breivik 2018 and given by the relation 3 u l w l u w u s w s the implementation of the wave averaged equations in hycom following the vortex force formalism based on the generalized lagrangian mean glm see andrews and mcintyre 1978 ardhuin et al 2008 approach is reported by rogers and wallcraft 2013 the glm equations of ardhuin et al 2008 are also presented more explicitly in bennis et al 2011 in an eulerian frame of reference and using the asymptotic theory in which the relation 3 is valid the wave averaged equations craik and leibovich 1976 mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 mcwilliams et al 2004 uchiyama et al 2010 are 4 u t u h u w u z f v 1 ρ p x f m x f v x u y v s w s u z j x f w x v t u h v w v z f u 1 ρ p y f m y f v x u y u s w s v z j y f w y where h is the horizontal differential operator and u s u s v s w s and u u v w represent the 3d stokes and mean eulerian velocities respectively the water density is represented by ρ and the hydrostatic pressure as p the terms f m x f m y represent the non wave source of momentum diffusion and mixing effects j denotes bernoulli head and f w x f w y is the wave induced non conservative force due to for example wave breaking or dissipation due to ocean bottom friction the vortex force including the coriolis stokes force f z u s is given by the first two terms on the right hand side in eq 4 at the surface the boundary condition is modified by the presence of surface waves which reduce the momentum injected to the ocean when they grow and conversely release momentum when they break and dissipate therefore the wind stress τ a is modified by subtracting the part absorbed by wave generation or the atmospheric to wave momentum flux τ aw at the same time the wave to ocean momentum flux τ wo due to wave breaking is added as an additional stress hence the ocean side stress τ oc following jenkins 1989 weber et al 2006 and janssen 2012 is expressed as 5 τ oc τ a τ aw τ wo where 6 τ aw ρ g 0 2 π 0 k ω s in d ω d θ and τ wo ρ g 0 2 π 0 k ω s diss d ω d θ here s in is the wind input source function s diss is the wave dissipation source term k is the wave number ω the angular wave frequency and θ is the wave direction the transport equation for a tracer c with stokes advection u s h is given in the form uchiyama et al 2010 7 c t u h c w c z u s h c w s c z h ν h c z ν z c z where ν ν z are the horizontal and vertical turbulent diffusion coefficients respectively as the main focus of this study is the langmuir mixing we only include the coriolis stokes force the stokes tracer advection and the wave dependent stress in one experiment csfsm02 to assess the importance of these effects relative to the impact of langmuir turbulence general ocean circulation models are mainly assumed hydrostatic typically with o 10 km horizontal grid resolution while turbulence mixing is due to non hydrostatic processes of o 1 m scales these small scale processes must thus be parameterized with turbulence closure schemes an essential goal of these schemes is to produce accurate and efficient parameterizations of the vertical mixing in large scale circulation models an example of such turbulence schemes is the non local k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 which provides a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and resolving boundary layer physics here a number of les based parameterizations proposed to capture the sub grid scale effects of the langmuir turbulence in kpp are investigated 2 2 langmuir mixing parameterization in kpp in the kpp scheme large et al 1994 the parameterization of the turbulent fluxes requires splitting the water column into two regions the surface boundary layer and the ocean interior each of which has a distinct mixing regime the ocean surface boundary layer depth not mld is defined as the shallowest depth h t at which the bulk richardson number rib z reaches a critical number ric here considered to be 0 3 where rib z is defined as 8 ri b z b r b z z u r u z 2 v t 2 z here v t represents the unresolved turbulent velocity shear while b r is the buoyancy and u r the velocity both averaged over a thin surface layer large et al 1994 define the mld as the shallowest depth at which the buoyancy gradient exceeds a threshold and thus their mld in most cases is smaller than the boundary layer depth h the unresolved turbulence shear is parameterized large et al 1994 by the relation 9 v t 2 z c v n z w s z r i c κ 2 β t c s ϵ 1 2 where c v max 2 1 200 0 max 0 n 1 7 danabasoglu et al 2006 w s is the turbulence velocity scale for scalar properties n z is the local buoyancy frequency κ 0 4 is the von kármán constant and c s 98 96 and ϵ 0 1 the parameter β t represents the ratio of the entrainment buoyancy flux w b e at the base of the boundary layer to the surface buoyancy flux which is considered to be approximately a constant here β t 0 2 under pure convection large et al 1994 the turbulent flux of a property x is parameterized by 10 x w k x x z γ x here γ x represents a non local transport large et al 1994 which is assumed to be non zero only for scalar variables in unstable regimes within the surface boundary layer 0 z h the turbulent eddy diffusivity viscosity is parameterized as 11 k x z t h t w x z h t g z h where g is a smooth shape function assumed to be a cubic polynomial and the subscript x refers to a scalar or momentum property the turbulence velocity scale is given as w x κu ϕ where u is the friction velocity and ϕ is the stability function defined by large et al 1994 with the aid of les simulatins of the wave averaged equations mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 proposed a parameterization of the bulk effects of lt mixing in kpp by applying an enhancement factor e la t to the turbulence velocity scale within the surface boundary layer as 12 w x κ u ϕ e la t which means that the lt enhancement factor is applied to the velocity scale for both scalar and momentum quantities enhancing both the unresolved shear and the eddy diffusivity the enhancement factor proposed by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 has the form 13 e la t 1 c w la t 2 α 1 α where c w and α are assumed positive constants in cases with small turbulent langmuir numbers the turbulence velocities become proportional to the surface stokes drift and in the limit of lat the enhancement factor becomes unity meaning that the tke production is dominated by current shear production in addition to amplifying the mixing the enhanced turbulence velocity scale will also deepen the boundary layer h through increasing the unresolved shear velocity in the denominator of the bulk richardson number 8 mcwilliams et al 2014 also suggest that the expression for v t 2 should include the effects of the unresolved lt on the boundary layer thickness in the default kpp implementation in hycom the mixing coefficients at the boundary layer depth h are matched with those of the interior thus the mixing in the interior can influence the mixing within h in the following subsections we look at the choice of the enhancement factor suggested for each of the five lt parameterizations considered in this study 2 2 1 mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 parameterization ms00 from their les experiments of the wave averaged equation on a weakly convective quasi equilibrium turbulent state ms00 proposed an enhancement factor in the form 14 e la t 1 0 080 la t 4 1 2 which they found to give better agreement with their les results their les model was forced by a uniform wind stress and monochromatic surface waves however ms00 admitted that their definition lacks an explicit stability dependency on the convective forcing suggesting that their proposed generalization of the kpp model may not be applicable in a full range of realistic oceanic conditions without further modifications 2 2 2 smyth et al 2002 parameterization sm02 based on analyses of les experiments and observational data of strongly stable daytime warming and strongly unstable nocturnal cooling forcing conditions smyth et al 2002 proposed an extension to the ms00 scaling incorporating a dependence on the convective velocity scale w b f h 1 3 where b f is the surface buoyancy flux the proposed modification makes c w which was assigned a constant value of 0 08 in ms00 s formulation a function of w and the friction velocity u such that the influence of the langmuir mixing is restrained under destabilizing surface forcing b f 0 and is enhanced under stabilizing conditions b f 0 the extended formulation therefore takes the form 15 e la t 1 c w u w la t 4 1 2 where c w u w 0 15 u 3 u 3 0 6 w 3 2 ensures that the enhancement is prevented from attaining unreasonably high levels in strongly convective conditions in addition smyth et al 2002 proposed non local momentum fluxes however these are not considered here following large et al 1994 as well as fan and griffies 2014 2 2 3 takaya et al 2010 parameterization tk10 takaya et al 2010 modified a prognostic skin sst scheme developed by zeng and beljaars 2005 to include a surface wave dependence under stable surface warming forcing conditions in which the standard scheme has been found to overestimate the surface temperature whereas the original scheme parameterized the thermal diffusivity in terms of classical monin obukhov similarity theory the tk10 modification adds an lat dependent enhancement factor to the diffusivity formula as 16 e la t max 1 la t 2 3 here the langmuir enhancement function e la t is defined so that it does not affect the mixing for large lat and is made to fit with the langmuir turbulence velocity scaling by grant and belcher 2009 tk10 found that including the impact of langmuir turbulence in terms of increased mixing improved the model s representation of the diurnal sst variability although not originally designed to parameterize langmuir turbulence in the kpp mixing scheme the lt enhancement function of tk10 has been implemented in the hycom version of kpp in an equivalent manner to the previously described parameterizations i e as a multiplicative enhancement factor for the unresolved turbulent vertical velocity w x 2 2 4 van roekel et al 2012 parameterization vr12 the parameterization by van roekel et al 2012 takes into account a possible mismatch in the direction between waves and the wind neglected in this work and has been tested in global simulations by li et al 2016 it was found to show the optimal mld improvement when combined with an enhancement of the boundary layer entrainment specially in the southern ocean assuming that wind and waves are aligned and hence the definition of lat as a function of only u and v s 0 the enhancement factor van roekel et al 2012 li et al 2016 used in this study takes the from 17 e la t 1 3 1 la t 2 5 4 la t 4 1 2 modification of the parameterization of the boundary layer in kpp following li et al 2016 proposes an enhancement of the entrainment at the base of the surface boundary layer by adding the stokes speed term to account for the lagrangian current in the definition of the bulk richardson number as 18 r i b z b r b z z u r u z 2 v t 2 z v s 0 2 this entrainment enhancement is combined with the van roekel et al 2012 scaling 17 and simply referred to as vr12 see table 1 however to avoid double counting it should be noted that the lt enhancement factor eq 17 is not applied to the velocity scale w s appearing in the expression for the unresolved shear eq 9 the enhancement of the boundary layer entrainment by langmuir turbulence is found to elevate the deepening effects of the vr12 parameterization li et al 2016 2 2 5 li and fox kemper 2017 parameterization lf17 motivated by the work of li et al 2016 with respect to parameterization of the lt influence on the boundary layer entrainment li and fox kemper 2017 proposed a scaling to the entrainment buoyancy flux w b e to account for the effect of lt under a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux in the derivation leading to the expression 9 for the unresolved shear in the default kpp the entrainment buoyancy flux is parameterized using the empirical relation w b e β t b f under pure convection large et al 1994 to account for the langmuir turbulence effects li and fox kemper 2017 proposed that the entrainment buoyancy flux under unstable conditions scales as 19 w b e h u 3 0 17 0 083 la sl 2 0 15 h κ l where l u 3 κb f is the monin obukhov length for the constants appearing in the right hand side see li and fox kemper 2017 their fig 8b and eq 21 also suggested through personal communication with the authors then the unresolved shear given in eq 9 is re derived li and fox kemper 2017 to incorporate the new lt enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux 19 as 20 v tl 2 z c v n z w s z z r i c w b e h w s z 3 1 2 note that this modified turbulent shear by li and fox kemper 2017 is applied only under destabilizing surface buoyancy flux because this is the regime in which their les simulations were conducted under neutral and stabilizing regimes we apply the default unresolved turbulence shear given in eq 9 as illustrated by li and fox kemper 2017 the modified unresolved turbulence shear velocity v tl 2 will make the diagnosed surface boundary layer slightly shallower in the convection limit as v tl 2 becomes slightly smaller than the default v t 2 however it will have deepening effects in the weak surface cooling limit see li and fox kemper 2017 p 2877 this means that the deepening effect will be constrained under pure convection conditions dominant winter conditions for example in the labrador sea while it will be enhanced under weak surface cooling and in the presence of wind and waves in experiment lf17 in addition to including lt effects in the entrainment buoyancy flux in eq 19 and hence adopting the modified unresolved shear in eq 20 the lasl based enhancement factor van roekel et al 2012 li et al 2016 21 e la sl 1 1 5 la sl 2 5 4 la sl 4 1 2 is applied to the velocity scale w x of the turbulence eddy diffusivity in eq 11 it is assumed that the lt affects both the entrainment buoyancy flux and the eddy diffusivity however to avoid double counting it should be noted that the lt enhancement factor 21 is not applied to the velocity scale appearing in the expression for the unresolved shear 20 note also that here the stokes drift term is not added in the denominator of the bulk richardson number see table 1 2 3 estimating the stokes drift velocity profile in deep water the stokes drift velocity profile is computed from the two dimensional wave spectrum e ω θ as 22 u s z 2 g 0 2 π 0 ω 3 k e 2 k z e ω θ d ω d θ where θ is the direction in which the wave component is propagating clockwise from north ω is the angular frequency and k sin θ cos θ is a unit vector in the direction of the wave component this is a costly operation to perform for all model points and often as in this study the full wave spectrum is not available therefore we use an approximate profile based on the parametric spectrum by phillips 1958 integrating over all directions the one dimensional frequency spectrum reads 23 f ω 0 2 π e ω θ d θ substituting eq 23 in eq 22 and using the phillips spectrum phillips 1958 an approximate profile of the stokes drift speed v s u s can be obtained by integrating for all frequencies breivik et al 2016 in the form 24 v s z v s 0 e 2 k z β 2 k π z erfc 2 k z where erfc is the complementary error function the inverse depth scale can be estimated from the surface stokes drift and the stokes transport see eq 23 by breivik et al 2016 k v s 0 2 v 1 2 β 3 where β is a constant and as suggested by breivik et al 2016 it is generally close to unity which is what we assume in this study the stokes transport can be estimated from the mean wave frequency f the mean wave direction and the significant wave height h m 0 v 2 π 16 f h m 0 2 k s breivik et al 2014 however in this study the surface stokes drift and stokes transport are interpolated from the wavewatch iii hindcast computed directly from the full wave energy spectrum these two parameters will be enough to reconstruct the profile 24 however averaging over the instantaneous hybrid coordinate is required in hycom therefore in order to reconstruct the layer averaged profile we use the integrated form of eq 24 that represents the stokes transport between a level z and the surface given in the form li et al 2017 25 v z v s 0 2 k 1 e 2 k z 2 β 3 1 π 2 k z 3 2 erfc 2 k z 1 2 k z e 2 k z thus the stokes drift averaged on a layer with upper interface at z top and lower interface at z bot is estimated as 26 v s v z bot v z top z bot z top where again β 1 using 2d parameters from the wavewatch iii hindcast as input to hycom i e the surface stokes drift velocities and the stokes transport the layer averaged profile is computed online using the depths of the pressure interfaces the direction of stokes drift is chosen to be in the direction of the stokes transport and assumed to be constant with depth the reconstructed and layer averaged stokes profile in hycom has been verified by computing its transport and comparing it against the corresponding stokes transport from wavewatch iii a very good agreement is found therefore the wave momentum is conserved in the layer averaged reconstruction we use the surface layer averaged stokes drift v s sl eq 26 to compute lasl because of the large depth of the mixed layer here the surface boundary layer in this study the impact of the reference stokes drift v ref s is negligible and is therefore taken to be zero similar to the approach by li et al 2016 and reichl et al 2016a 2 4 experimental setup the model has been initialized from a climatology of the world ocean atlas of 2005 locarnini et al 2006 antonov et al 2006 and spun up for 8 years from which the first two years are forced with climatology and the rest with realistic forcing the atmospheric forcing is interpolated from six hourly fluxes from era interim with grid resolution of approximately 79 km dee et al 2011 the wave parameters cover the world oceans to 80 n with three hourly temporal resolution which has been linearly interpolated at every model time step 800 s the spatial resolution of the wave parameters is 1 2 which is interpolated to the topaz4 grid all experiments are integrated for 3 years covering the period 2010 2012 the comparison of the impact of the parameterized langmuir turbulence mixing is performed using six experiments presented in table 1 where column 2 represents the experiment name as well as it refers to the corresponding parameterization and the third column shows the enhancement factor see also fig 1 in addition a separate experiment csfsm02 is conducted where the parameterization of the lt of smyth et al 2002 is combined with the coriolis stokes force stokes tracer advection and the wave modified stress it should be noted that the enhancement factor e la t in the case of the first four parameterizations ms00 sm02 tk10 is also applied to the velocity scale w s of the unresolved shear in shown in eq 9 however this is not the case for the last two parameterization vr12 and lf17 where the unresolved shear is enhanced either by the addition of stokes term in denominator of ri b or by an enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux as in eq 20 to investigate the performance of the different langmuir turbulence parameterizations on different geographical regions we split the domain into three sub regions as shown in fig 2 nordic covering nordic seas subplg covering the sub polar gyre region and subtrp covering the rest of the north atlantic south of 50 n while the whole domain will be referred to as wholed 2 5 validation data in order to assess the wave effects on the surface temperature we use sst from the operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis ostia dataset from the metoffice donlon et al 2012 representing globally interpolated data on 24 h temporal resolution it has been obtained from the cmems server 1 1 http marine copernicus eu and interpolated to the model domain see fig 2 ii the mld climatology data used here comes from de boyer montégut et al 2004 updated to include argo float data to 2012 rodgers et al 2014 gridded in 1 its winter and summer means interpolated to the model domain are plotted in fig 2 i in this data set the mld has been diagnosed using the density profile criterion defined as the depth at which the potential density differs from its surface value by a fixed threshold of 0 03 kg m 3 we use the same density criterion to calculate the mld fields from daily mean profiles then the monthly mean mld fields are obtained by averaging the daily mean mld fields the heat content estimates are computed following skagseth and mork 2012 27 hc c p ρ 0 h 0 t t ref d z where hc is the heat content c p the specific heat capacity of sea water ρ 0 a reference density and h the depth in our study the reference temperature t ref is zero degrees celsius as suggested by skagseth and mork 2012 heat content estimates from the model runs monthly averages are compared to those estimated from the monthly gridded 1 2 grid coriolis ocean dataset for reanalysis cora temperature dataset cabanes et al 2013 the cora dataset is a collection of quality controlled temperature and salinity in situ measurements collected from different sources and provided by the coriolis data center and distributed by cmems szekely et al 2016 the raw data received by the coriolis data center from different sources are put through a set of real or near real time quality control procedures to ensure a consistent dataset coatanoan and de la villeon 2005 to investigate the influence of langmuir turbulence on the sub surface structure the temperature profiles are compared with observations from the en4 dataset good et al 2013 the en4 dataset is a large historical collection of quality controlled ocean temperature and salinity profiles the comparison is performed by first interpolating the model daily averaged fields horizontally to the location of the observed temperature profiles and vertically to z levels where the observed profiles have been sampled the horizontal interpolation is performed using a bilinear technique then the interpolated daily averaged profile is directly compared with the corresponding instantaneous en4 profile therefore no temporal averaging of the observations has been performed in this paper the winter and summer means are computed respectively over january march jfm and july september jas both means are from a three year model average all the observations of sst mld heat content and temperature profiles are absolute values not anomalies relative to a given period this also applies to their model counterparts 3 simulation results it is expected that the parameterized langmuir turbulence enhances upper ocean mixing potentially reducing ocean model biases in regions and seasons in which the mld is underestimated here we assess the impact of lt parameterizations as well as the other wave effects described in section 2 on the forecast model topaz4 the operational version of the topaz4 system 2 2 see http marine copernicus eu and the validation report therein overestimates the winter mld and underestimates it in spring and early summer by about 40 m this behavior is relatively common in ocean models e g griffies et al 2009 sallée et al 2013 williams et al 2018 a synthesis of ocean reanalyses in the arctic uotila et al 2018 has shown that models generally overestimate deep mixing in winter and vice versa in summer the forecast sst is already too cold all year round when compared to in situ buoys by about 0 3 k and satellite sst by about 0 1 k so the wave mixing is probably not the main source of error in the 28 layer configuration of topaz4 in the 50 layer configuration used here without wave effects as will be shown the mld is underestimated in the rest of the domain area south of 50 n referred to as subtrp all year round but still too deep in winter in the nordic and sub polar gyre subplg areas the sst is also overestimated in subtropics in all seasons but underestimated in winter in the areas nordic and subplg so even though some lt parameterizations should in principle degrade the solutions in the subplg and nordic areas there is room for improvement in the subtrp region further south to assess the parameterizations of langmuir turbulence in our 50 layer setup of topaz4 we focus mainly on the effects on the sea surface temperature the ocean heat content and mixed layer depth by running six experiments see table 1 and comparing the results against independent observations additionally a test is performed using the experiment csfsm02 some examples of the range of the langmuir number used here are shown by the daily mean time series at the locations a b c plotted in fig 1 along with the enhancement factors plotted against the langmuir number as can be seen ms00 induces the strongest enhancement factor with the highest mean and variation followed by tk10 sm02 and vr12 while the lasl dependent enhancement factor 21 used in lf17 induced a seasonal variability in which the lt mixing is enhanced during summer and reduced during winter the seasonality of the enhancement factor 21 is due to lasl which as a result of the significant difference between the summer and winter boundary layer thickness becomes small strong wave effects during summer and large during winter fig 1 ii illustrates how the magnitude of enhancement factors varies when plotted against lat while the blue curve represents the enhancement factor 21 plotted against lasl as also seen lasl shows a larger seasonal variability than lat 3 1 influence on mixed layer depth to examine and validate the impact from each of the different parameterizations the model mld is compared with the climatology data of de boyer montégut et al 2004 updated to include argo data to 2012 rodgers et al 2014 where the modeled mld is diagnosed using the same density criterion as used for the climatology the winter jfm and summer jas means of mld from both the climatology and model control run cntl with no wave effects are plotted against each other in fig 2 i moreover maps of the mean mld bias against observation for winter and summer averages computed for the six experiments table 1 are shown in fig 3 this figure indicates that the mld in the cntl run is shallower than observations almost everywhere in summer fig 3 ii a whereas in winter too deep mld can be observed around the labrador and nordic seas as well as shallower mld in the subtropics fig 3 i a similar to the results obtained by fan and griffies 2014 and as shown in fig 3 i b c the predicted mld is significantly degraded with the ms00 scheme in the labrador sea region and to a lesser extent with sm02 see fig 4 in fan and griffies 2014 the shallow mld biases can be seen to be reduced when adding the langmuir mixing effects as given in fig 3 ii c d e f notably the parameterizations from sm02 smyth et al 2002 and tk10 takaya et al 2010 as well as vr12 li et al 2016 yield reductions in summer biases at high latitudes and in the subtropics figs 3 ii and 4 i these improvements are reflected by reduced mld root mean square errors rmse as shown fig 5 i in winter however the parameterized lt effects appear to introduce too strong mixing as a consequence the mld prediction in the labrador and nordic seas is degraded in addition many shallow biases become deep biases in particular when using the ms00 scaling fig 3 i b the percentage increase on mld due to lt mixing is shown in fig 6 the distribution of the zonal mean mld bias given in fig 4 i computed from fig 3 shows that the lt parameterizations by ms00 sm02 tk10 and vr12 exhibit a strong mld deepening during winter at high latitudes and hence the rmses are increased as shown in fig 5 i these results may not be surprising as these four lt parameterizations are based on lat and generally give the strongest enhancement as shown in the middle panel in fig 1 as seen from this figure the lasl based enhancement factor 21 has lower values during winter on the contrary the lf17 scheme which adds the enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux and adopts the surface layer averaged langmuir number lasl appears to be the only scheme which introduces stronger mld deepening in summer than in winter see fig 6 and therefore leading to improvements on mld during both summer winter without exaggerating the existing deep biases fig 5 i in winter as the mld is already deep at high latitudes small improvements are generally south of 50 n figs 4 i and 5 i interestingly with the lf17 scheme a weak shallowing between 50 and 70 n region of strong convection appears during winter see figs 4 i and 5 i this is probably due to shallowing by the modified unresolved shear velocity 20 under strong convective conditions fig 4 i displays large summer negative mld biases between latitudes 3 s and 10 s which can be related to the southern hemisphere winter where the mld deepening increases as shown by the observation in fig 2 i b but not well captured in the cntl run fig 2 i d the model is relaxed to the climatology at the southern open boundary so the difference between this climatology and mld observations see fig 2 could also contribute to these errors adding that the langmuir mixing effect appears to slightly reduce these negative biases the performance of langmuir mixing parameterizations varies depending on regions and regimes all the parameterizations considered in this study tend to deepen the mld compared to the control run table 2 except with the lf17 approach the impact in winter is clearly much stronger than in summer fig 6 in particular the parameterization by ms00 induces too vigorous mixing which leads to excessive mld increase in the winter over large regions table 2 presents the mld percentage increase averaged over the whole region and the three subregions see fig 2 and for both winter and summer means from three year average this illustrates again that there is a clear seasonality of the influence of the langmuir mixing where deepening in winter is more pronounced for instance when averaged over the whole domain however this is not the case for lf17 parameterization for which the percentage increase in mld during summer is larger than during winter the percentage increase on mld induced by the parameterization of lf17 at high latitude fig 6 appears to be roughly close to the ranges 15 20 shown by d asaro et al 2014 who used a completely different turbulence model than kpp to account for the langmuir mixing it should be observed that in table 2 the mean percentage mld deepening due to the ms00 scheme in winter on region subplg is more than double that induced by sm02 smyth et al 2002 while both ms00 and sm02 parameterizations induce approximately an equivalent percentage deepening on this region in summer fig 6 this is due to the inclusion of the stability effects in sm02 scaling which works to suppress the mld deepening under convictive conditions which are favorable during winter over region subplg however still the winter mld is exaggerated with sm02 in this region fig 4 i the excessive mixing induced by the ms00 and sm02 scalings agrees with findings by li et al 2016 when adopting the same schemes in the cesm with pop2 instead of applying a single enhancement factor for both the unresolved shear and the eddy viscosity the vr12 and lf17 use a separate enhancement for the unresolved shear as shown in table 1 the high percentage increase in winter mld with vr12 presented in fig 6 suggests that enhancing the unresolved shear by adding the stokes drift term would overestimate the mld the consideration of the langmuir mixing effects on the entrainment buoyancy flux by lf17 scheme li and fox kemper 2017 is found to restrain the excessive winter deepening fig 6 and therefore appears to be a more adequate approach for enhancing the unresolved turbulent shear our results agree with the findings by li and fox kemper 2017 who showed that their scheme increases the mld deepening in the southern ocean during summer while yielding only a modest impact under strongly convective winter conditions the temporal variability of the mean bias is also analyzed as can be seen from the mean bias time series fig 7 i the mld from the control run cntl black dash line is always shallower than mld from climatology data in summer and in all seasons in the subtropics fig 7 i d nevertheless this shallow bias is significantly decreased when adding langmuir turbulence mixing with the lf17 parameterization yielding the best overall performance fig 7 i a especially during winter in contrast all four schemes involving the original lat number ms00 sm02 tk10 vr12 cause excessive winter time deepening of the mld averaged over the model domain 3 2 influence on ocean temperature the langmuir turbulence enhances upper ocean mixing leading to deepening of the mld and therefore has important effects on the ocean temperature to examine such effects on sst model results are compared against sst observations from ostia the winter jfm and summer jas means of sst from both ostia and cntl run are plotted against each other in fig 2 ii the latitudinal distribution of the zonal mean sst bias fig 4 ii shows that adding langmuir mixing substantially reduces warm sst biases most notably in the summer this is also reflected by the rmse shown in fig 5 ii which displays no noticeable rmse reduction in winter the temporal variability of the mean sst bias is presented in fig 7 ii which indicates that the averaged sst from the control run cntl dash black line is generally warmer than ostia sst except for the winter sst in the nordic and subplg areas this can be seen more clearly in the sst error maps given in figs 8 a overall this warm bias is reduced when including the langmuir mixing effects with the five lt parameterizations in particular the tk10 scaling appears to significantly reduce the mean warm bias over region subtrp fig 7 ii d purple line however the induced mixing appears to be too vigorous causing underestimated sst in the subtrp region as presented in fig 8 ii d in region subplg the vr12 scaling outperforms others in correcting both negative and positive mean sst biases fig 7 ii c cyan line while lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 parameterization introduces a bias reduction approximately similar to that induced by tk10 scaling fig 7 ii c red dash and purple lines the ms00 parameterization induces too large cold sst biases south of 50 n both in winter and summer fig 4 ii red line also shown by the mean bias map given in figs 8b overall the lf17 yields good reductions in the warm sst biases without causing aggressive increase in the cold biases for example see the bias in region subtrp in fig 8 ii f during winter the control run shows large positive sst bias especially around the gulf stream labrador current and in the south east atlantic and negative biases in the middle north atlantic fig 8 i a the exception is the ms00 scaling which mixes excessively the other four parameterizations appear to lead to only a small impact on these biases such biases are often related to the large scale circulation features of the model and the mixing parameterizations cannot directly improve their representations fig 9 shows the time series of the mean ocean heat content down to 700 m depth from experiments cntl with no wave effects and the five langmuir mixing parameterizations in addition the heat content from cora observation cabanes et al 2013 plotted in dash gray line a distinct seasonal cycle is depicted in the heat content of the ocean with maximum in summer and minimum in winter in general the heat content derived from the control run is lower than those estimated from observations fig 9 dash black line the lt parameterizations enhance the mixing of surface water with that in the interior layers mainly leading to a cooling of sst and therefore indirectly increases the air to ocean heat flux that elevates the ocean heat uptake from the beginning of the simulation the ocean heat content starts gradually to increase when adding lt effects relative to the control experiment cntl fig 9 and appears to become more closer to the cora observations however the increase in the heat content introduced by ms00 as well as tk10 parameterizations is too high which is due to the strong enhancement factors associated with the two schemes as shown in fig 1 it is likely that this rapid increase in the heat content could have continued in ever longer simulations the enhancement factor by ms00 causes vigorous mixing and with it a significant injection of heat into the deeper layers conversely it appears that ms00 reduces the heat content excessively on the nordic region relative to the cntl run fig 9b red line contrarily to the sub tropical regions the nordic seas experience a year round influx of warm water which lies underneath relatively cold surface water when more mixing brings it to the surface it can be cooled through heat loss to the atmosphere this heat loss in the nordic region can be explained by the large increase in the cold bias in the temperature profiles by ms00 shown in fig 10 top panels it should be noted that there may exist an offset between the heat content in the control case and the cora dataset as seen for example in region subtrp fig 9d the comparison to the time series of cora observations yields that the phase of the seasonal cycle is late in the cntl run particularly in the nordic and subtrp regions though the subplg region seems to vary in phase fig 9 none of the different langmuir mixing parameterizations does seem to change the phase of the seasonal cycle indicating that the cause of the delays must be elsewhere the change in the ocean heat content due to langmuir induced mixing indicates a change in the subsurface temperature profile fig 10 shows that the different parameterizations generally tend to reduce the biases at the surface but not necessarily the biases at all depths other than the winter in region subplg the profiles mainly show warm near surface biases an explanation for improvement here can be due to the characteristics of lt effects which mainly induce cooling of surface layer and hence warm near surface biases are reduced only in the subplg region do the cold biases reduce at all depths both in summer and winter elsewhere the sub surface biases rather seem exacerbated by the langmuir parameterizations even in the subtrp region where improvements were expected due to the too shallow mld and warm sst biases in the subtrp the strong lt enhancement will cool the sst by mixing warm surface water with relatively cold subsurface water and therefore contribute to warming the interior and to exacerbate existing warm biases the impact due to other wave effects is examined in experiment csfsm02 as shown by the latitudinal distribution of the zonal mean bias plotted in fig 11 ii adding the coriolis stokes force stokes tracer advection and the wave dependent wind stress combined with the langmuir mixing enhancement by sm02 in experiment csfsm02 introduces no noticeable differences in sst biases similar results are also found when computing the mld biases fig 11 i suggesting that langmuir mixing is much more important than these wave processes this agrees with the results by reichl et al 2016a who found under idealized hurricane conditions that the langmuir turbulence has a much greater influence than the coriolis stokes force we have also rerun the same experiment csfsm02 by including the vortex force in the horizontal momentum ignoring the wave induced pressure however we did not find any apparent differences the terms involving the vorticity times stokes drift velocities may have smaller impact than the coriolis stokes force on the basis of the scale of the horizontal grid resolution used in this study and therefore could be one reason for such negligible effects 4 discussion and concluding remarks in this study five different parameterizations table 1 of langmuir turbulence mixing in the north atlantic have been investigated using hycom and wave forcings from a wavewatch iii global hindcast rascle et al 2008 rascle and ardhuin 2013 these parameterizations are proposed to enhance the turbulent vertical kinetic energy and hence the mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer through modification of the kpp scheme of large et al 1994 the impact due to the coriolis stokes force stokes tracer advection and wave modified stress in combination with the langmuir effects have been assessed the estimation of the stokes drift profile based on the phillips spectrum from breivik et al 2016 has now been implemented in hycom the langmuir turbulence parameterization on the boundary layer entrainment by li et al 2016 as well as the enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux by li and fox kemper 2017 have now been implemented in the kpp scheme used in hycom we adopted the definition of the langmuir turbulence number following mcwilliams et al 1997 as a measure of the relative impact of the wind driven shear to the magnitude of the stokes drift at the surface in addition we have also implemented and used the surface layer averaged langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 in the scheme by li and fox kemper 2017 evaluation of the model results were made by comparison with climatologies of the mixed layer and ocean temperature it is found that the parameterized langmuir turbulence has a rapid and significant effect on the mixed layer depth sea surface temperature and ocean heat content in addition the impact is overall much stronger in winter compared to summer except for the parameterization that uses the enhanced entrainment buoyancy flux and the surface layer averaged langmuir number li and fox kemper 2017 in contrast the inclusion of the coriolis stokes force stokes drift tracer advection and the wave dependent wind stress did not introduce noticeable differences in the model results fig 11 the main improvements of our simulations when adding the langmuir mixing are exhibited with the parameterizations by smyth et al 2002 van roekel et al 2012 and li and fox kemper 2017 specifically in regions and season of underpredicted mld and overpredicted sst however the winter mld is strongly degraded with the schemes by smyth et al 2002 and van roekel et al 2012 which is shown by increased rmses fig 5 this is not the case with the parameterization by li and fox kemper 2017 which reduces the rmse in summer while preforms as good as the control run with no wave effects in winter the scaling by takaya et al 2010 is found to introduce substantial improvements on sst and mld in the subtropical region subtrp especially during summer however it appears that the induced mixing is too vigorous which causes excessive warming of deep ocean layers and lead to a rapid increase in ocean heat content figs 9 and 10 purple line this could likely shift the model to an unstable state in longer model runs this strong mixing with the takaya et al 2010 scheme which is based on a vke scaling by grant and belcher 2009 can be due to that takaya et al 2010 did not design and test their enhancement factor for the kpp it was only suggested to improve the prediction of a skin sst model during day time the parameterization by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 is found to introduce the most vigorous mixing which strongly degrades the mld on high latitude areas during winter whereas in summer large biases are found around the equator fig 4 the scaling by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 is shown to cool the sst excessively and to warm the deeper layers leading to a severely exaggerated ocean heat content in particular the abnormal increase in the ocean heat content introduced by the scheme by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 fig 9a red line if continued would shift the model into a new climate state which is clearly unrealistic in the nordic region on the contrary we find a reduction of the heat content under the scaling by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 because the enhanced mixing exposes deep warm waters to the surface and thereby increases the heat loss to the atmosphere smyth et al 2002 extended the ms00 scheme to include stability effects to restrain the excessive mixing in destabilizing convective conditions fig 6 shows that the vigorous mld deepening induced by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 scheme in winter is reduced with scheme by smyth et al 2002 however this also true for the other parameterizations overall there is a reduction of the summertime warm sst bias when adding langmuir mixing effects most pronounced in the subtropical region however with the scalings by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 and takaya et al 2010 the sst cooling is too strong which leads to an excessive and rapid warming of the ocean interior fig 10 the schemes by van roekel et al 2012 and li and fox kemper 2017 preform best in improving sst without increasing their rmses the ocean heat content in the control run cntl is found to be generally smaller than cora observations and is found to increase with langmuir mixing and hence become closer to the observations the smaller heat content in the control case is more pronounced in the subtropical and sub polar gyre regions this may be due to insufficient vertical mixing that reduces air to ocean heat fluxes as these regions show warm sst bias in summer except van roekel et al 2012 and li and fox kemper 2017 all the other lt parameterizations apply a single enhancement factor for the velocity scale of both the eddy diffusivity and unresolved shear velocity this approach is found to overestimate the winter mld at hight latitude fig 4 and therefore it is more adequate to adopt separate enhancements for the two processes e g reichl et al 2016b li and fox kemper 2017 following the suggestion of li et al 2016 the surface stokes drift is added to the unresolved shear in the bulk richardson number 18 in the van roekel et al 2012 experiment however in an experiment where we left out the surface stokes drift from the unresolved shear not shown we found that its addition is actually detrimental to the mld bias similar to li and fox kemper 2017 the modified unresolved shear velocity v t l 2 20 is found to magnify the lt effect under weak surface cooling and presence of wind and wave and to restrain it under strong pure convective conditions in addition and because of its dependency on the ocean mixed layer the surface layer averaged langmuir number becomes small magnifying the wave effects during summer and large suppressing the wave effects during winter this helps to constrain the winter mixing where the enhancement factor 21 approaches one for example in deep convection regions such as the labrador sea moreover the surface layer averaged langmuir number is better in capturing the effects from different wavelength and accurately predicts the value of the vertical turbulent kinetic energy harcourt and d asaro 2008 therefore consideration of the stokes penetration depth hence the surface layer averaged langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 and the stability li and fox kemper 2017 in the parameterized lt effects are important in restraining the excessive lt mixing specially during winter our results with respect to the impact with the scaling by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 agree with findings in similar studies focused on global climate time scale investigation of the impact of parameterized langmuir turbulence on the boundary layer mixing such as fan and griffies 2014 and li et al 2016 fan and griffies 2014 argued that the too strong influence by the mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 scaling exaggerates the wave induced turbulent mixing in weakly stratified winter conditions and underestimates the mixing in stably stratified summer conditions therefore their choice was the smyth et al 2002 scheme finding it to perform better than ms00 for cm2 m with improvement in winter mld around labrador seas it is worth noting that li et al 2016 reported a very high computational cost when using online wave ocean coupling 36 increase in computer time like li et al 2017 our study demonstrates that off line wave ocean coupling if wave forcing is available can be an affordable approach to account for the langmuir turbulence mixing and still introducing similar impacts the model control run without wave effects tends to exhibit both too shallow and too deep wintertime mixed layers at high latitudes but the summertime mld is almost everywhere underestimated the lf17 parameterization yields the best performance in reducing these biases without degrading the existing mld and sst results there is probably still room for more improvement for example the summertime langmuir mixing is not strong enough to sufficiently deepen the mixed layer in the subtropical atlantic ocean 30 n and 40 n as shown in fig 10 in reichl et al 2016b it is possible to increase the impact of lt mixing by considering the enhancement factor 21 but without taking the square root it should be noted that the large biases in the control run without wave mixing cannot be attributed to missing lt effects these shortcomings can be due to other physical processes that affect the mixing in the ocean boundary layer as well as errors in the air sea fluxes the comparisons of the different schemes are always consistent from one year to another moreover the three years of simulation of the north atlantic have experienced a wide variety of combinations of wave regimes and low high heating of the ocean the comparison of the temperature sst and profiles are made for the same three year period as the observations not from climatology however it would probably be interesting to extend the integration time and investigate the long term impact future work could couple the langmuir mixing with re stratification effects such as parameterization of meso and sub mesoscale eddies in the ocean boundary layer fox kemper et al 2011 to reduce the excessive mixing in the control case cntl one may also consider adjusting the critical richardson number as it might have already been tuned to implicitly account for wave effects reichl et al 2016b treating the latter as a free tuning parameter a more fair comparison would have been achieved by adjusting a different value for each lt parameterization so that their median enhancement factor is equal a more accurate assessment of the performance of lt parameterizations would also benefit from a different criterion for determining the mld as reported by noh et al 2016 and ok et al 2017 the comparison of mld diagnosed with the density threshold of 0 03 kg m 3 induces spurious errors at high latitudes during winter due to the different characteristics of the vertical density structures another potential extension would be to consider the lt parameterization by reichl et al 2016b where two separate enhancement factors were suggested including a dependency on the smooth function g z h for the velocity scale and the unresolved shear which were derived using les simulations under tropical cyclone conditions further improvement can probably be achieved by including more wave parameters in the langmuir turbulence parameterization such as the miss alignment between the wind and wave directions van roekel et al 2012 mcwilliams et al 2014 li et al 2016 in this work these effects have been neglected in eqs 17 19 and 21 mcwilliams et al 2014 and reichl et al 2016b have shown the importance of including the lagrangian shear in the parameterization of the turbulent momentum fluxes with lt this is not considered here the lagrangian shear primarily affects the parameterization of the turbulent momentum flux in two ways first by better aligning with the direction of the turbulent stress than when only using the eulerian shear this is however not an issue for us as kpp always imposes a current shear in the direction of the turbulent stress the second effect is that the down gradient mixing associated with stokes drift shear will change the near surface eulerian current which may partially counter the stokes advection term it is also supported by sinha et al 2015 who followed teixeira 2012 and developed an lt parameterization for kpp that includes enhanced velocity scaling non local transport for momentum and local down stokes gradient mixing which they have shown to give good results for full depth langmuir circulation in shallow water their results warrant future consideration of this parameterization in deep water another potentially important wave effect that can be investigated is a contribution of the stokes shear force in the vertical momentum termed wavy hydrostatic by suzuki and fox kemper 2016 however we expect departures from hydrostasy to be small in our model setup since the wavy hydrostatic eq 14 by suzuki and fox kemper 2016 differs from the hydrostatic equation by a term which scales with the rossby number which is small for basin scales we have performed a sensitivity study of the impact of several competing langmuir parameterizations in a realistic basin scale ocean model the study provides upper and lower bounds on the impact that can be expected from including langmuir parameterizations in kpp type turbulence schemes as expected the ms00 parameterization is too strong and indeed ms00 noted that the lack of a stability dependence would limit the usefulness of the parameterization in real settings overall the lt parameterizations exhibit a stronger impact in winter relative to summer except the scheme by lf17 which induces summertime mixing stronger than that during winter thus reducing summer temperature biases without degrading the winter sst lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 thus stands out as the best performing parameterization of the ones tested with this model setup and the only one which improves the overall biases compared with the model control run acknowledgments this research has received support from
