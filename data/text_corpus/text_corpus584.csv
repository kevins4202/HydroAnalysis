2920,lysimeter tests are an ideal supplement to monitoring tests performed in the area of landfills this article presents an interdisciplinary lysimeter experiment that used hydrogeological biochemical and microbiological studies to evaluate the process of leaching pollutants from waste the obtained results of leachate tests indicate that the ec value was as high as 31 ms cm which corresponds to poor water quality additionally high concentrations of chlorides up to 5095 mg l and sulphates up to 10107 mg l were observed the results of microbiological tests confirm the seasonality the statistically significant p 0 05 difference in the number of heterotrophic bacteria was denoted between autumn 1 6 107 cfu cm 3 and winter 1 5 105 cfu cm 3 the analysis of the ability to utilize nitrogen and phosphorus sources showed seasonal differences in the use of substrates containing these biogenic elements it was observed that nitrogen containing compounds were most intensively used in winter and the least in spring while phosphorus compounds were the most intensively oxidized in summer presented results confirm that lysimeter studies can play a valuable role in the construction of landfills for the best method of waste isolation and limiting the growth of microorganisms keywords hydrogeology waste lysimeter biochemistry microbiology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal landfills are real and potential pollution sources for groundwater characterized by toxicity and long distance transmission vaverková et al 2020 lots of contaminants especially xenobiotics are hardly biodegradable and accumulate in the environment which pose a threat waste management forces the use of another method of waste disposal than landfilling esmaeilian et al 2018 in this context recycling such material as metals plastics and glass are obligatory unfortunately landfilling is still the most popular method of waste disposal šourková et al 2020 for instance in the usa around 50 of municipal solid waste is dumped in landfill sites in poland 90 while in taiwan it is 95 mukherjee et al 2014 there are 271 landfill sites in poland cso 2020 because old landfills have no liner systems can be groundwater pollution sources sun et al 2019 the most serious problem in terms of environmental protection associated with the storage of waste is the leaching of the salts and trace elements from it and bringing these substances along with infiltrating water into the surface waters and groundwater deformation of the liner system performed with a geomembrane and geosynthetic clay liner can also pose a threat to groundwater taylor et al 2004 dabrowska et al 2018b feng et al 2019 rykała and dąbrowska 2020 the assessment should primarily cover typical physicochemical pollution indicators dabrowska et al 2018a soltysiak et al 2018 such as electrical conductivity ec and cl so4 2 nitrogen compounds b cr6 cu2 zn2 pb2 hg2 co3 and ni2 bojakowska 1994 slack et al 2005 and also microbiological parameters like faecal coliforms enterococci p aeruginosa and c perfringens yanez et al 2006 unfavourable environmental impacts can be determined using environmental impact assessment methods zhou et al 2018 waste and leachate may vary due to seasons of the year waste origin area wealth and ecological mentality of the local residents aljaradin and persson 2016 assessment of the variability of physicochemical and microbiological parameters as well as the research of leaching of pollutants from waste is tested using static or dynamic leaching tests or the lysimeter experiment ahsan et al 2014 sołtysiak and rakoczy 2019 this kind of tests allows to determine the value of contamination loads and the dynamics of their elution qiang et al 2015 european and world standards impose the obligation to conduct tests on the leaching of pollutants from waste but this applies to static tests kosson et al 2002 menghini et al 2005 hassett 2005 delay et al 2007 arain et al 2008 kim and hesbach 2009 hesbach et al 2010 kosson et al 2014 kalembkiewicz and sitarz palczak 2015 recent studies point to the fact that the employment of generally accepted guidelines for leaching tests does not allow a proper assessment of an actual threat to the soil and aquatic environment due to the underestimation of the test results baba and kaya 2004 cetin et al 2004 izquierdo and querol 2012 tiwari et al 2015 the static tests are complemented by dynamic tests among which the lysimetric tests are the most accurate the lysimeter studies are a perfect combination of hydrogeology and waste management research and they are used for determining the impact of the waste on the environment with the account being taken of the kinetics of physicochemical processes occurring at the landfill site bilgili et al 2006 the assessment of the degree of threat to the groundwater posed by the waste can be performed with the determination of the size and intensity of eluted pollutant loads and their characteristic lysimeter tests on municipal waste are the least frequently performed experiments due to their duration costs and specificity of waste soltysiak 2007 it is also worth mentioning that the difficulties in carrying out the experiments may be caused by unnatural changes in the bulk density of the soil under the influence of the intense insolation of the lysimeters waste from households is highly heterogeneous miezah et al 2015 and it is hard to use it in a lysimeter experiment since they have variable physical characteristics lysimeter studies on municipal waste have the same aim and general outline although the intensity and application of such tests vary between countries dabrowska et al 2018a the simplest lysimeter research aims to determine the leachate quality for the appropriate planning and design of landfills and sewage treatment plants such tests were performed e g in bangladesh ahsan et al 2014 another type of research includes leaching tests for a particular ingredient such as antimony hou et al 2013 lysimeter experiments on municipal waste may also consider the impact of climatic conditions on the composition of leachate xu et al 2019 some of the researchers examine the performance of simulated waste components at different biogas accumulations xu et al 2019 another study simulates anaerobic anaerobic recirculated leachate semi aerobic and aerobic landfills and aims to assess the impact of aeration semi aeration and leachate recirculation on the biological degradation rate top et al 2019 the main purpose of experiments in two scientific centers in poland was to determine the total volume of the obtained effluents the values of specific electrolytic conductivity temperature ph eh and the characteristic indicators and to evaluate changes in the waste leachate and gas as well as to compare the processes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions dabrowska et al 2019 slezak et al 2015 one of the methods of assessing the potential impact of leachate on soil ecosystems is the analysis of changes in structural and functional biodiversity of both the soil and the leachate microbiome due to their important share in biochemical cycles and the decomposition of organic matter the microorganisms present in the leachate from municipal waste are crucial environmental quality indicators fraczek et al 2014 microorganisms are characterized by a quick reaction to adverse environmental changes therefore their biochemical activity is used to assess the state of the ecological environment it is known from the literature that the leachate has the strongest impact on the ecosystems closest to the point of emission but also on places remote due to leachate migration through infiltration into soil and groundwater mannisto et al 2001 mukherjee et al 2014 however some biological processes are observed in most landfills and include hydrolysis sekhohola dlamini and tekere 2020 methanogenesis cardinali rezende et al 2012 wang et al 2017 or fermentation zhou et al 2018 the structure of the landfill microbiome has been extensively studied using various methods both culture dependent but first of all molecular such as pyrosequencing cardinali rezende et al 2016 denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr cardinali rezende et al 2012 or metagenomics wang et al 2017 the literature shows that the most frequently identified microorganisms are bacterial phyla proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes in turn among them the most proliferate are genera clostridium bacillus staphylococcus sterptococcus firmicutes acinetobacter pseudomonas desulfuromonas proteobacteria prevotella flavobacterium cytophaga bacteroidetes however the community structure shifts in time and is connected with the landfill s age and versatile metabolic capabilities of different bacterial species it was reported that in new landfills gammaproteobacteria able to utilize easily metabolized organic material are more abundant than alphaproteobacteria dominating in old landfills due to their ability to metabolize complex carbon sources as polysaccharides or plant derived polymers ximentes et al 2018 apart from determining the structure of the microbial population in a given ecosystem it is equally important to assess their metabolic diversity and its changes over time it is worth noting that microorganisms play a key role in the biogeochemical circulation of nutrients due to their comprehensive metabolism and the ability to biotransform some of compounds both simple and structurally complex therefore monitoring both the activity and general condition of the studied microbiome is crucial in assessing the possible risks that leachate from the landfill may pose one of the frequently used methods of quick assessing these parameters is the biolog method biolog inc hayward usa which usage in environmental studies is well documented in the literature gryta et al 2014 michalska et al 2020 zhen et al 2020 a novelty in these studies is the use of various tests taking into account not only the measurements of the chemical composition of leachate waters but also precipitation the use of modern biochemical tests and statistical analysis for the results obtained the aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of the process of leaching pollutants from municipal waste in an interdisciplinary lysimeter experiment we hypothesized that 1 electrical conductivity values will be at the same level as in landfill leachate 2 changes in the content of individual substances will show a downward trend 3 the chemical composition of rainwater can affect the quality of the leachate 4 seasonal conditions and or waste transformation in time determined the shift in the structure and functioning of leachate microbiome 2 materials and methods 2 1 lysimetric experiment one lysimeter was used in the experiment it was filled with municipal waste with 19 05 99 european waste code this type of waste goes through the d5 disposal process it is stored in landfills in a deliberately designed manner e g placed in sealed separate chambers covered and insulated from each other and the environment etc the lysimeter experiment operated for about 400 days from the end of november 2018 until the end of december 2019 the first months of operation of the test stand consisted of testing the structure and checking the tightness therefore the first chemical analyzes of the leachate were not obtained until march the initial moisture of waste was equal to 69 5 lysimeter construction was based on dabrowska et al 2019 the inner diameter of the lysimeter was 0 4 m height 1 8 m after taking into account the filtration layer of gravel the volume of medium compacted municipal waste was about 130 l the lysimeter was not isolated to prevent the infiltration of precipitation and had complete access to oxygen a stand pipe field lysimeter test was also conducted within the area of the master waste and energy company in tychy urbanowice southern poland fig 1 2 2 chemical analysis of leachate during the experiment the lysimeter was precipitated with natural precipitation and artificially supplied with distilled water data on the size of supply of the lysimeter for the analyzed period considering rainfall mm supply with rain l artificial supply l was summarized in table 1 in each month of the experiment except february the total volume of the obtained effluents was measured and the values of specific electrolytic conductivity temperature ph and eh were determined in addition the characteristic indicators of groundwater pollution in the area of municipal waste

selected parameters were taken for further analysis the concentration of pollutants from individual months has been calculated on the mass of leached pollutants at the same time research on the quality of precipitation was carried out the quality control of the rainwater supplying the lysimeter is a necessary condition in a lysimeter experiment when testing leachability the study of the quality of precipitation consisted in intercepting the precipitation with the help of a rainfall cone located in the vicinity of the lysimeter in total 9 samples of rain were taken the following

distilled water did not affect the chemical composition of the leachate 2 3 microbial characteristics of the leachate the leachate samples were collected seasonally and then subjected to microbiological analyses which included among others the determination of the total number of mesophilic and psychrophilic microorganisms the determination of the total number of escherichia coli and coliforms enterococci pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens all microbiological analyses were carried out in triplicate the samples were transported in the refrigerator analyzed immediately after delivery to the laboratory the total number of cultivated heterotrophic bacteria mesophilic and psychrophilic was determined by serial 10 fold dilutions of leachate samples according

chapter 15 4 90 112 respectively the resulting bacterial colonies were counted after incubating the inoculated media at the appropriate temperature the results are presented as the log number of colony forming units log cfu of the analyzed microorganisms in 1 ml of leachate in the case of a total number of bacteria and in 100 ml of leachate for the other groups of bacteria respectively 2 4 biolog community level physiological profiling of the lysimeter leachate to determine seasonal metabolic changes of microorganisms in the leachate of waste dumps biolog 96 well ecoplatestm biolog inc

office 2019 package microsoft inc usa and morpheus tool https software broadinstitute org morpheus 3 results the lysimeter experiment was conducted from november 2018 to december 2019 during the experiment the leachate water balance was determined in total the lysimeter was supplied with 151 8 l and the lysimeter s output was 96 6 l the amount of total lysimeter supply and the volume of leachates obtained in the following months and the electrolytic conductivity and ph are presented in table 1 the amount of water supply during the whole experiment was greater than the obtained leachate the largest differences between the size of the supply and the volume of leachate were found in march and april which may be related to temperatures that contributed to the freezing of waste and retention of leachate inside the lysimeter in the second half of april and the summer months the amount of leachate was higher in relation to the supply of the lysimeter the most interesting data regarding the diversity in the amount of supply and leachate come from april when the supply was ten times greater than the amount of leachate the chemical composition of the effluent was determined primarily by the high concentrations of bicarbonates chlorides and sulphates fig 2 the dominant cations are ca mg na and k the greatest leachability of these ions can be observed in relation to sulphates and chlorides the content of sulphates in the analyzed research period decreased 21 times and chlorides by 4 times approximately a twofold decrease in the content was observed in relation to sodium and potassium an almost constant decrease can be observed for sodium and potassium the greatest jumps were observed between the samples from july and august in the case of calcium and magnesium no downward trend can be observed throughout the entire research period the downward trend continues until july for calcium and until august for magnesium apart from the march sample the toc content showed a steady decrease the toc content decreased 17 times over the entire research period fig 2 the content of nitrogen compounds is much higher in the initial phase of the experiment content changes have been observed since july fig 2 no significant pb content was observed in the waste maximum 0 15 mg dm3 the source of which could be e g batteries printed wire boards and cathode ray tubes robinson 2009 the content of sb was also below the limit of quantification however the low content of these ions indicates a low content of plastic in the waste townsend et al 2014 all metals ba cr cu ni al mn show a decrease in the content during the experiment the highest leachability was found in the case of copper the content of which decreased 57 times between the first analysis and the last one an approx 6 fold decrease in the content was observed for chromium and nickel it is worth paying attention to the content of al which remained almost all the time at a similar level and whose significant decrease was observed at the last measurement fig 2 an increasing trend has been observed for boron its content was 1 5 times higher in the last sample than in the first measurement fig 2 the content of phosphates showed a very high variability in the entire research process during the individual measurements two large increases in the content were observed april and august 3 1 chemical composition of precipitation the samples of rainfall collected in tychy were characterized by different chemical compositions the electrical conductivity of rainfall samples varied in the range of 15 163 µs cm the ph ranged from 6 04 to 7 59 therefore no acid rain was found data analysis does not show significant differences in main ions depending on the season rather the variability in conductivity should be associated with the intensity of the precipitation the lowest conductivity was found in may after several days of rainfall the highest mineralization of precipitation takes place in its initial phase then after washing out pollutants from the atmosphere the mineralization of precipitation decreases the chemical composition of precipitation was dominated by hco3 4 88 40 00 and so4 2 22 12 54 mg l the concentration of cl was low 0 40 3 03 mg l the dominant cation in precipitation was ca 2 23 14 39 mg l the remaining main ions mg na k were found in concentrations 7 10 times lower with na being the dominant one 0 23 2 10 mg l from the hydrochemical point of view the dominant type of precipitation was hco3 so4 ca in terms of nitrogen content n nh4 dominated in rainfall the concentration of which changed from 0 30 mg l to 3 77 mg l while the concentration of n no3 changed from 0 12 mg l to 1 23 mg l appendix 1 the content of the remaining components metals was very low the highest concentrations were found for mn 0 001 1 584 mg l ba 0 001 0 050 mg l and b 0 001 0 007 mg l in the case of the other components fe cr cu ni al the average concentration was 0 001 mg l appendix 2 3 2 microbial analysis of the leachate from lysimeter microbiological characterization of investigated leachates is presented in fig 3 the conducted microbiological analyses showed that the number of heterotrophic bacteria varied significantly in leachate samples collected in the following seasons fig 3a from spring to autumn the number of mesophils was at the same level 107 cfu cm 3 and was higher than in winter 105 cfu cm 3 similar observations were recorded for psychrophilic microorganisms isolated from the leachate collected in spring and autumn 107 cfu cm 3 with the lowest number in winter 105 cfu cm 3 comparing the number of mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria in particular seasons it can be observed that the number of psychrophiles was higher in spring and winter and in the other two seasons the number of these groups of bacteria was similar both e coli and coliform bacteria were present in the tested leachate samples throughout the experiment fig 3b during spring autumn seasons their number was at the same level and was higher in comparison with winter by approx 38 for e coli and 37 for coliforms respectively enterococcus sp and c perfringens was present in the samples all year round with the lowest number in winter fig 3c in turn p aeruginosa was present in the leachates periodically in summer and autumn taking into account the total number of microorganisms in individual leachate samples it can be seen that it varied depending on the seasons it can be observed that the winter months are characterized by a significant decrease in their number both the number of mesophils psychrophiles coliform bacteria and other analyzed groups strains of bacteria decrease at the end of the year 3 3 the functional capacity of microorganisms in the leachate from the lysimeter the ecoplatetm indices were calculated to compare the microbial activity and functional diversity of the microbiome in the lysimeter in different seasons the kinetic parameters of the oxidation of the substrate showed that the microbiome was the most active in the spring and autumn while its activity decreased in the summer and winter table 2 additionally avt50 pointed out that the metabolic processes of microorganisms slowed down in summer and winter due to the highest values of this parameter the carbon sources utilization profiles were analyzed to define seasonal changes in the metabolism preferences of the microbiome fig 4 it was shown that higher temperatures in summer and the lowest ones in winter reduced the ability of the microbiome to oxidize polymers and amines by 80 and 86 respectively compared to spring and autumn simultaneously the highest capacity for oxidizing carbohydrates 44 19 in the summer and amino acids 35 72 and surfactants 27 19 in winter were observed moreover in spring and autumn an increase in the intensity of the usage of carboxylic acids was recorded it was also observed that microorganisms were rather not able to use phenolic acids as a carbon source the analysis of the ability to utilize nitrogen and phosphorus sources showed seasonal differences in the use of substrates containing these biogenic elements it was observed that nitrogen containing compounds were most intensively used in winter 50 95 and the least in spring 32 31 while phosphorus compounds were the most intensively oxidized in summer 12 23 and the least in winter 1 22 fig 5 the projection of the data set derived from leachate samples was subjected to illustrate the differences and similarities between seasonal samples throughout the experiment the seasons spring and autumn formed one cluster for pc1 while the summer and winter were grouped independently fig 10a at times spring winter the factor analysis showed two factors that explained 52 55 pc1 and 26 59 pc2 of the variance fig 6 based on the pca profiles it was found that the season had an impact on the shift of microbial population and its functioning as well as toc ph and ec in the leachate among them the most correlated with pc1 were a ca s p shannon diversity and eveness indexes awcd n use index the number of heterotrophic bacteria psychrophilic microorganisms e coli and coliform bacteria and ec and toc whereas ch gini coefficient substrate richness and p use index were correlated with pc2 fig 6b 4 discussion leachate from former landfills poses a serious threat to the soil ecosystem and the quality of groundwater in this study the combined approach of both physicochemical and microbiological parameters to monitor leachate quality from municipal unprotected wastes was applied the quantity of obtained leachates was affected mainly by precipitation and artificial distilled water supply table 1 despite the high rate of effective infiltration 63 table 1 the amount of rainwater supplied to the lysimeter in the natural hydrological cycle was insufficient this was due to the small diameter of the lysimeter and the variable amount of precipitation during the experiment for this reason an artificial distilled water supply of lysimeter was necessary to ensure that the appropriate volume of the leachate sample will be obtained the disadvantage of this solution is the possible excess of leachate which resulted from the inability to predict precipitation in the assumed interval of leachate collection time for example in july an artificial power supply turned out to be unnecessary but in august it was fully justified table 1 accurate recording of the leachate volume and averaging of analytical samples representative for the observation period usually monthly made it possible to precisely determine the mass of the leached substances it should be aware that diluting rainwater with distilled water introduces some inaccuracies but it was assumed that this error would be compensated by the evaporation of infiltrating water and would not affect the achievement of the research objective especially since the mineralization of the leachate differed from the mineralization of precipitation by two orders of magnitude the chemical composition of leachates was heterogeneous depending on the number of rainfall episodes with the next pulse of rainwater a smaller load of leached substances was observed fig 2 which was reflected in the decreasing ec values over time table 1 this is a typical phenomenon when examining the leachability of pollutants from the same unmodified lump of waste soltysiak et al 2017 in the case of municipal waste the decomposition of organic substances is important which influences the chemical composition of the leachate and its properties including bod and cod and also results in the formation of biogas youcai and ziyang 2017 temperature is an important factor influencing these processes in the winter months as a result of low temperature it is possible to completely freeze the infiltrating leachates and in the summer the waste placed in the lysimeter is heated more intensively than the waste deposited in the landfill palanivel and sulaiman 2014 the experiment showed decreasing concentrations of substances in leachates but did not provide information on the impact of seasonal temperature changes on the chemical composition of leachates changes in the content of individual parameters had shown a downward trend the electrical conductivity values show a great similarity to leachate from other landfills han et al 2016 touzani et al 2021 the gradual decrease in value is mainly related to the elution of the main ions the increase in the ph value during the experiment is related to the time of waste deposition this is also confirmed by the research presented among others by deng and englehardt 2007 ph values at the level of 7 9 indicate a young landfill lo and liao 2007 this finding is in accordance with przydatek 2019 that the age of landfill influences the heavy metals concentrations in leachate in the leachate from lysimeters high levels of metals were observed compared to the groundwater tested in the monitoring for the rainfall dump located in the area of the lysimeters freshly deposited waste generates higher loads of metal pollution than old waste przydatek 2019 it is related to the presence of lower ph values acidic reaction in relation to the aging landfill high ammonium ion values in the leachate at the beginning of the experiment confirm the presence of reducing conditions however these values are half the data obtained from the p18 piezometer located on the top of a closed landfill dąbrowska et al 2018 landfills have not been extensively studied and are an unknown ecological system making them hard to study because of anthropogenic solid waste selection pressures yang et al 2021 the structure and functioning diversity of leached microbiome were in accordance with the physicochemical parameters from spring to autumn leachate conditions promoted the growth of pathogenic microorganisms characterized by escherichia coli salmonella sp enterobacter sp enterococcus sp and the like common in solid waste sekhohola dlamini and tekere 2020 in general the number of selected bacteria decreased in winter except for c perfringers with stable contribution during the whole experiment so far the microbiome consortia of leachate from solid waste have not been well elucidated our results confirm the increase of microbial activity in spring and autumn these seasons were also characterized by the highest functional diversity and substrate richness indices simultaneously the changes in these parameters were not connected with any of the analyzed microbial groups which was confirmed through pca analysis a significant influence of seasonality on functional differences especially in the decomposition of c substrates was observed in the summer the utilization of labile carbon sources represented mainly by carbohydrates in eco plate was promoted in contrast to the winter season in which the decomposition of more complex carbon sources such as surfactants increased similar functional differences between summer and winter microbial communities in response to the addition of carbon substrates were observed in beech forest soil by koranda et al 2013 they suggested that this trend was connected with the depletion of labile carbon in winter and its intensive supply by plants roots in summer in our experiment the influence of plant root excretions cannot be taken into account but it can be assumed that at higher temperatures the population of microorganisms intensively metabolizing easily degradable carbon sources developed bloomed the analysis of the ability to utilize nitrogen showed the enhanced microbial n use in winter despite the fact that ntot concentration was the lowest this season it was also in accordance with results presented by koranda et al 2013 the analysis of bacterial communities in two large sanitary landfills in beijing and xi an china also indicated that nitrogen content was the most important physicochemical parameter influencing their structure and diversity low temperature conditions create environmental stress on the microorganism bacterial survival to cold temperature conditions and sustain regular metabolic functions are followed by various especially n depended adaptation mechanisms their survival is facilitated through physiological and metabolic changes including the synthesis of cryoprotectants cold acclimation proteins cold shock and antifreeze proteins and ice nucleators these adaptive upregulated mechanisms followed by protein related to stress response solubilization of nutrients biological nitrogen fixation and energy production are known by several cold adopted bacteria such as pseudomonas acinetobacter burkholderia and rhodococcus in turn energy consuming processes and biosynthetic processes under low temperature stress conditions are always downregulated kumar et al 2022 suyal et al 2017 subramanian et al 2011 phosphorus p as po4 3 is the most easily assimilated p form in ecosystems by living organisms and it serves an integral role in aspects of cellular metabolism cellular components phospho lipids and genetic material dna rna and energy transfer atp nadp khanzada 2020 sosa 2018 in this work the highest oxidation of phosphorus compounds in summer was observed this natural phenomenon can be a result of intensive metabolism of phosphate leachate compounds by phosphorus solubilizing bacteria psb psb are able to convert insoluble phosphorus into soluble forms improving p use efficiency yu et al 2022 many bacteria are known for their ability to mobilize phosphorus compounds and belong to pseudomonas agrobacterium bacillus and enterobacter alori et al 2017 an important factor influencing the physicochemical and biological decomposition of waste is acidity in our studies ph was rather stable and slightly increased from spring 7 5 to summer 8 6 which could be connected to our lysimeter being an open system exposed to external weather conditions yang et al 2021 listed ph and bod cod as critical indicators of solid waste decomposition they observed the ph decrease between 13 and 188 day of the experiment in a laboratory polymethyl methacrylate based bioreactor 1 0 m height and 0 2 m inner diameter they correlated this with the accumulation of carboxylic acid as a result of the degradation of biodegradable substrates therefore the presented in situ studies were shown seasonal differences in the level of microbial metabolism and substrate preferences which can be used to more specifically infer the waste decomposition status of leachate in total 9 analyzes of rainwater supplying the lysimeter were performed the comparison of the concentrations of chemical components in the precipitation and in the leachates shows that only the source of cu and ba was the atmospheric precipitation in two cases for this article the extreme values were omitted while discussion the percentage of components in the leachates supplied by precipitation ranged from the first to the third quartile the conductivity of precipitation ranged from 0 015 to 0 163 ms cm and the leachate 30 7 10 ms cm these are sizes varying by 3 4 orders of magnitude the first group of elements consists of components whose percentage share from precipitation does not exceed 0 5 in the leachate these are k na cl n nh4 b and mg the most compact here are rainy k cl na and n nh4 the content of which in the leachate does not exceed 0 2 b ni and mg are characterized by a slightly greater percentage range however it should be noted that their content in the leachate is in practice negligible similarly sulfates concentration from rainwater does not exceed 1 in the leachate al and mn stand out from this group of chemical components the values of the first and third quartiles of the percentage share of precipitation al are respectively 1 6 and 3 0 and in the case of mn 1 1 and 6 2 the median values for both of these metals account for approximately half of the range of these ranges the highest percentages delivered with precipitation were observed in leachates for ca cu and ba the values of the third quartile are 10 2 10 9 and 14 7 respectively this indicates a high content of these components delivered by rainwater while at the same time their low concentrations in the leachate a characteristic phenomenon in lysimeter studies is a decrease in the concentrations of eluted components in the leachate in such situations when the concentration of the component in rainfall is constant the share of supplying with the chemical components from rainfall in the leachates increases the analysis of the relationship between the concentrations of individual components in precipitation and leachate shows that for most of the components the quality of rainwater does not affect the leachate in our experiment the proportion of selected components k na cl n nh4 b mg and so4 2 supplied with rain does not exceed 0 5 1 al and mn contained in rainfall had little influence on the chemical composition of the leachate the average percentage concentration of these metals in the leachate was 2 4 and 4 5 in relation to the concentration in rainfall the highest percentages delivered with precipitation were observed in leachates for ba ca and cu the mean values of their concentration are 9 2 11 1 and 31 7 respectively this indicates a high content of these components delivered by rainwater while at the same time their low concentrations in the leachate a characteristic phenomenon in lysimeter studies is a decrease in the concentrations of eluted components in the leachate in such situations when the concentration of the component in rainfall is constant the share of supplying with the chemical components from rainfall in the leachates increases in our experiment the average content of dissolved substances in rainfall did not exceed 0 035 g l 0 071 g l 0 006 g l while the concentration of dissolved substances in the leachate was initially about 23 g l and at the end of the experiment it dropped to 3 8 g l taking into account the differences in the mineralization of leachate and rainwater as well as very low concentrations of al ba ca and cu in precipitation it was assumed that the influence of the water in the chemical composition of precipitation in the initial period of leaching did not have a significant impact on the chemical composition of the leachate 5 conclusions according to the results of the performed lysimeter experiment the influence of leachates could be concluded in a few aspects like chemical microbiological and biochemical risks this study has shown that for the given study area the lysimeter experiment allows reflecting landfill conditions the value of the electrical conductivity is comparable to the values obtained in the measurements of leachate from landfills however it is impossible to obtain the same type of waste as in the closed old landfill the conducted lysimeter studies showed that the values of most physicochemical parameters decrease with successive washing of the waste this suggests rapid leaching of pollutants from the waste the study identified the benefits the assessment environmental impact of the leachates taking into account the kinetics of physicochemical processes occurring in the solids of the landfill water budget analysis performance and drawbacks cost duration possible measurement errors resulting from strong sunlight on the lysimeter the scale of the experiment of the lysimeter experiment on municipal landfill waste an essential advantage of the interdisciplinary lysimeter experiment is studying the influence of atmospheric factors and oxygen access on the chemical and bacteriological composition and determining seasonal metabolic changes of microorganisms of landfill leachate lysimeter studies can play a

2920,lysimeter tests are an ideal supplement to monitoring tests performed in the area of landfills this article presents an interdisciplinary lysimeter experiment that used hydrogeological biochemical and microbiological studies to evaluate the process of leaching pollutants from waste the obtained results of leachate tests indicate that the ec value was as high as 31 ms cm which corresponds to poor water quality additionally high concentrations of chlorides up to 5095 mg l and sulphates up to 10107 mg l were observed the results of microbiological tests confirm the seasonality the statistically significant p 0 05 difference in the number of heterotrophic bacteria was denoted between autumn 1 6 107 cfu cm 3 and winter 1 5 105 cfu cm 3 the analysis of the ability to utilize nitrogen and phosphorus sources showed seasonal differences in the use of substrates containing these biogenic elements it was observed that nitrogen containing compounds were most intensively used in winter and the least in spring while phosphorus compounds were the most intensively oxidized in summer presented results confirm that lysimeter studies can play a valuable role in the construction of landfills for the best method of waste isolation and limiting the growth of microorganisms keywords hydrogeology waste lysimeter biochemistry microbiology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal landfills are real and potential pollution sources for groundwater characterized by toxicity and long distance transmission vaverková et al 2020 lots of contaminants especially xenobiotics are hardly biodegradable and accumulate in the environment which pose a threat waste management forces the use of another method of waste disposal than landfilling esmaeilian et al 2018 in this context recycling such material as metals plastics and glass are obligatory unfortunately landfilling is still the most popular method of waste disposal šourková et al 2020 for instance in the usa around 50 of municipal solid waste is dumped in landfill sites in poland 90 while in taiwan it is 95 mukherjee et al 2014 there are 271 landfill sites in poland cso 2020 because old landfills have no liner systems can be groundwater pollution sources sun et al 2019 the most serious problem in terms of environmental protection associated with the storage of waste is the leaching of the salts and trace elements from it and bringing these substances along with infiltrating water into the surface waters and groundwater deformation of the liner system performed with a geomembrane and geosynthetic clay liner can also pose a threat to groundwater taylor et al 2004 dabrowska et al 2018b feng et al 2019 rykała and dąbrowska 2020 the assessment should primarily cover typical physicochemical pollution indicators dabrowska et al 2018a soltysiak et al 2018 such as electrical conductivity ec and cl so4 2 nitrogen compounds b cr6 cu2 zn2 pb2 hg2 co3 and ni2 bojakowska 1994 slack et al 2005 and also microbiological parameters like faecal coliforms enterococci p aeruginosa and c perfringens yanez et al 2006 unfavourable environmental impacts can be determined using environmental impact assessment methods zhou et al 2018 waste and leachate may vary due to seasons of the year waste origin area wealth and ecological mentality of the local residents aljaradin and persson 2016 assessment of the variability of physicochemical and microbiological parameters as well as the research of leaching of pollutants from waste is tested using static or dynamic leaching tests or the lysimeter experiment ahsan et al 2014 sołtysiak and rakoczy 2019 this kind of tests allows to determine the value of contamination loads and the dynamics of their elution qiang et al 2015 european and world standards impose the obligation to conduct tests on the leaching of pollutants from waste but this applies to static tests kosson et al 2002 menghini et al 2005 hassett 2005 delay et al 2007 arain et al 2008 kim and hesbach 2009 hesbach et al 2010 kosson et al 2014 kalembkiewicz and sitarz palczak 2015 recent studies point to the fact that the employment of generally accepted guidelines for leaching tests does not allow a proper assessment of an actual threat to the soil and aquatic environment due to the underestimation of the test results baba and kaya 2004 cetin et al 2004 izquierdo and querol 2012 tiwari et al 2015 the static tests are complemented by dynamic tests among which the lysimetric tests are the most accurate the lysimeter studies are a perfect combination of hydrogeology and waste management research and they are used for determining the impact of the waste on the environment with the account being taken of the kinetics of physicochemical processes occurring at the landfill site bilgili et al 2006 the assessment of the degree of threat to the groundwater posed by the waste can be performed with the determination of the size and intensity of eluted pollutant loads and their characteristic lysimeter tests on municipal waste are the least frequently performed experiments due to their duration costs and specificity of waste soltysiak 2007 it is also worth mentioning that the difficulties in carrying out the experiments may be caused by unnatural changes in the bulk density of the soil under the influence of the intense insolation of the lysimeters waste from households is highly heterogeneous miezah et al 2015 and it is hard to use it in a lysimeter experiment since they have variable physical characteristics lysimeter studies on municipal waste have the same aim and general outline although the intensity and application of such tests vary between countries dabrowska et al 2018a the simplest lysimeter research aims to determine the leachate quality for the appropriate planning and design of landfills and sewage treatment plants such tests were performed e g in bangladesh ahsan et al 2014 another type of research includes leaching tests for a particular ingredient such as antimony hou et al 2013 lysimeter experiments on municipal waste may also consider the impact of climatic conditions on the composition of leachate xu et al 2019 some of the researchers examine the performance of simulated waste components at different biogas accumulations xu et al 2019 another study simulates anaerobic anaerobic recirculated leachate semi aerobic and aerobic landfills and aims to assess the impact of aeration semi aeration and leachate recirculation on the biological degradation rate top et al 2019 the main purpose of experiments in two scientific centers in poland was to determine the total volume of the obtained effluents the values of specific electrolytic conductivity temperature ph eh and the characteristic indicators and to evaluate changes in the waste leachate and gas as well as to compare the processes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions dabrowska et al 2019 slezak et al 2015 one of the methods of assessing the potential impact of leachate on soil ecosystems is the analysis of changes in structural and functional biodiversity of both the soil and the leachate microbiome due to their important share in biochemical cycles and the decomposition of organic matter the microorganisms present in the leachate from municipal waste are crucial environmental quality indicators fraczek et al 2014 microorganisms are characterized by a quick reaction to adverse environmental changes therefore their biochemical activity is used to assess the state of the ecological environment it is known from the literature that the leachate has the strongest impact on the ecosystems closest to the point of emission but also on places remote due to leachate migration through infiltration into soil and groundwater mannisto et al 2001 mukherjee et al 2014 however some biological processes are observed in most landfills and include hydrolysis sekhohola dlamini and tekere 2020 methanogenesis cardinali rezende et al 2012 wang et al 2017 or fermentation zhou et al 2018 the structure of the landfill microbiome has been extensively studied using various methods both culture dependent but first of all molecular such as pyrosequencing cardinali rezende et al 2016 denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr cardinali rezende et al 2012 or metagenomics wang et al 2017 the literature shows that the most frequently identified microorganisms are bacterial phyla proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes in turn among them the most proliferate are genera clostridium bacillus staphylococcus sterptococcus firmicutes acinetobacter pseudomonas desulfuromonas proteobacteria prevotella flavobacterium cytophaga bacteroidetes however the community structure shifts in time and is connected with the landfill s age and versatile metabolic capabilities of different bacterial species it was reported that in new landfills gammaproteobacteria able to utilize easily metabolized organic material are more abundant than alphaproteobacteria dominating in old landfills due to their ability to metabolize complex carbon sources as polysaccharides or plant derived polymers ximentes et al 2018 apart from determining the structure of the microbial population in a given ecosystem it is equally important to assess their metabolic diversity and its changes over time it is worth noting that microorganisms play a key role in the biogeochemical circulation of nutrients due to their comprehensive metabolism and the ability to biotransform some of compounds both simple and structurally complex therefore monitoring both the activity and general condition of the studied microbiome is crucial in assessing the possible risks that leachate from the landfill may pose one of the frequently used methods of quick assessing these parameters is the biolog method biolog inc hayward usa which usage in environmental studies is well documented in the literature gryta et al 2014 michalska et al 2020 zhen et al 2020 a novelty in these studies is the use of various tests taking into account not only the measurements of the chemical composition of leachate waters but also precipitation the use of modern biochemical tests and statistical analysis for the results obtained the aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of the process of leaching pollutants from municipal waste in an interdisciplinary lysimeter experiment we hypothesized that 1 electrical conductivity values will be at the same level as in landfill leachate 2 changes in the content of individual substances will show a downward trend 3 the chemical composition of rainwater can affect the quality of the leachate 4 seasonal conditions and or waste transformation in time determined the shift in the structure and functioning of leachate microbiome 2 materials and methods 2 1 lysimetric experiment one lysimeter was used in the experiment it was filled with municipal waste with 19 05 99 european waste code this type of waste goes through the d5 disposal process it is stored in landfills in a deliberately designed manner e g placed in sealed separate chambers covered and insulated from each other and the environment etc the lysimeter experiment operated for about 400 days from the end of november 2018 until the end of december 2019 the first months of operation of the test stand consisted of testing the structure and checking the tightness therefore the first chemical analyzes of the leachate were not obtained until march the initial moisture of waste was equal to 69 5 lysimeter construction was based on dabrowska et al 2019 the inner diameter of the lysimeter was 0 4 m height 1 8 m after taking into account the filtration layer of gravel the volume of medium compacted municipal waste was about 130 l the lysimeter was not isolated to prevent the infiltration of precipitation and had complete access to oxygen a stand pipe field lysimeter test was also conducted within the area of the master waste and energy company in tychy urbanowice southern poland fig 1 2 2 chemical analysis of leachate during the experiment the lysimeter was precipitated with natural precipitation and artificially supplied with distilled water data on the size of supply of the lysimeter for the analyzed period considering rainfall mm supply with rain l artificial supply l was summarized in table 1 in each month of the experiment except february the total volume of the obtained effluents was measured and the values of specific electrolytic conductivity temperature ph and eh were determined in addition the characteristic indicators of groundwater pollution in the area of municipal waste

selected parameters were taken for further analysis the concentration of pollutants from individual months has been calculated on the mass of leached pollutants at the same time research on the quality of precipitation was carried out the quality control of the rainwater supplying the lysimeter is a necessary condition in a lysimeter experiment when testing leachability the study of the

microbiological analyses which included among others the determination of the total number of mesophilic and psychrophilic microorganisms the determination of the total number of escherichia coli and coliforms enterococci pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens all microbiological analyses were carried out in triplicate the samples were transported in the refrigerator analyzed immediately after delivery to the laboratory the total number of cultivated heterotrophic bacteria mesophilic and psychrophilic was determined by serial 10 fold dilutions of leachate samples according to pn en iso 6222 2004 water quality enumeration of culturable microorganisms colony count by inoculation in a nutrient agar culture medium iso 6222 1999 then a milliliter of the leachate was taken

chapter 15 4 90 112 respectively the resulting bacterial colonies were counted after incubating the inoculated media at the appropriate temperature the results are presented as the log number of colony forming units log cfu of the analyzed microorganisms in 1 ml of leachate in the case of a total number of bacteria and in 100 ml of leachate for the other groups of bacteria respectively 2 4

office 2019 package microsoft inc usa and morpheus tool https software broadinstitute org morpheus 3 results the lysimeter experiment was conducted from november 2018 to december 2019 during the experiment the leachate water balance was determined in total the lysimeter was supplied with 151 8 l and the lysimeter s output was 96 6 l the amount of total lysimeter supply and the volume of leachates obtained in the following months and the electrolytic conductivity and ph are presented in table 1 the amount of water supply during the whole experiment was greater than the obtained leachate the largest differences between the size of the supply and the volume of leachate were found in march and april which may be related to temperatures that contributed to the freezing of waste and retention of leachate inside the lysimeter in the second half of april and the summer months the amount of leachate was higher in relation to the supply of the lysimeter the most interesting data regarding the diversity in the amount of supply and leachate come from april when the supply was ten times greater than the amount of leachate the chemical composition of the effluent was determined primarily by the high concentrations of bicarbonates chlorides and sulphates fig 2 the dominant cations are ca mg na and k the greatest leachability of these ions can be observed in relation to sulphates and chlorides the content of sulphates in the analyzed research period decreased 21 times and chlorides by 4 times approximately a twofold decrease in the content was observed in relation to sodium and potassium an almost constant decrease can be observed for sodium and potassium the greatest jumps were observed between the samples from july and august in the case of calcium and magnesium no downward trend can be observed throughout the entire research period the downward trend continues until july for calcium and until august for magnesium apart from the march sample the toc content showed a steady decrease the toc content decreased 17 times over the entire research period fig 2 the content of nitrogen compounds is much higher in the initial phase of the experiment content changes have been observed since july fig 2 no significant pb content was observed in the waste maximum 0 15 mg dm3 the source of which could be e g batteries printed wire boards and cathode ray tubes robinson 2009 the content of sb was also below the limit of quantification however the low content of these ions indicates a low content of plastic in the waste townsend et al 2014 all metals ba cr cu ni al mn show a decrease in the content during the experiment the highest leachability was found in the case of copper the content of which decreased 57 times between the first analysis and the last one an approx 6 fold decrease in the content was observed for chromium and nickel it is worth paying attention to the content of al which remained almost all the time at a similar level and whose significant decrease was observed at the last measurement fig 2 an increasing trend has been observed for boron its content was 1 5 times higher in the last sample than in the first measurement fig 2 the content of phosphates showed a very high variability in the entire research process during the individual measurements two large increases in the content were observed april and august 3 1 chemical composition of precipitation the samples of rainfall collected in tychy were characterized by different chemical compositions the electrical conductivity of rainfall samples varied in the range of 15 163 µs cm the ph ranged from 6 04 to 7 59 therefore no acid rain was found data analysis does not show significant differences in main ions depending on the season rather the variability in conductivity should be associated with the intensity of the precipitation the lowest conductivity was found in may after several days of rainfall the highest mineralization of precipitation takes place in its initial phase then after washing out pollutants from the atmosphere the mineralization of precipitation decreases the chemical composition of precipitation was dominated by hco3 4 88 40 00 and so4 2 22 12 54 mg l the concentration of cl was low 0 40 3 03 mg l the dominant cation in precipitation was ca 2 23 14 39 mg l the remaining main ions mg na k were found in concentrations 7 10 times lower with na being the dominant one 0 23 2 10 mg l from the hydrochemical point of view the dominant type of precipitation was hco3 so4 ca in terms of nitrogen content n nh4 dominated in rainfall the concentration of which changed from 0 30 mg l to 3 77 mg l while the concentration of n no3 changed from 0 12 mg l to 1 23 mg l appendix 1 the content of the remaining components metals was very low the highest concentrations were found for mn 0 001 1 584 mg l ba 0 001 0 050 mg l and b 0 001 0 007 mg l in the case of the other components fe cr cu ni al the average concentration was 0 001 mg l appendix 2 3 2 microbial analysis of the leachate from lysimeter microbiological characterization of investigated leachates is presented in fig 3 the conducted microbiological analyses showed that the number of heterotrophic bacteria varied significantly in leachate samples collected in the following seasons fig 3a from spring to autumn the number of mesophils was at the same level 107 cfu cm 3 and was higher than in winter 105 cfu cm 3 similar observations were recorded for psychrophilic microorganisms isolated from the leachate collected in spring and autumn 107 cfu cm 3 with the lowest number in winter 105 cfu cm 3 comparing the number of mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria in particular seasons it can be observed that the number of psychrophiles was higher in spring and winter and in the other two seasons the number of these groups of bacteria was similar both e coli and coliform bacteria were present in the tested leachate samples throughout the experiment fig 3b during spring autumn seasons their number was at the same level and was higher in comparison with winter by approx 38 for e coli and 37 for coliforms respectively enterococcus sp and c perfringens was present in the samples all year round with the lowest number in winter fig 3c in turn p aeruginosa was present in the leachates periodically in summer and autumn taking into account the total number of microorganisms in individual leachate samples it can be seen that it varied depending on the seasons it can be observed that the winter months are characterized by a significant decrease in their number both the number of mesophils psychrophiles coliform bacteria and other analyzed groups strains of bacteria decrease at the end of the year 3 3 the functional capacity of microorganisms in the leachate from the lysimeter the ecoplatetm indices were calculated to compare the microbial activity and functional diversity of the microbiome in the lysimeter in different seasons the kinetic parameters of the oxidation of the substrate showed that the microbiome was the most active in the spring and autumn while its activity decreased in the summer and winter table 2 additionally avt50 pointed out that the metabolic processes of microorganisms slowed down in summer and winter due to the highest values of this parameter the carbon sources utilization profiles were analyzed to define seasonal changes in the metabolism preferences of the microbiome fig 4 it was shown that higher temperatures in summer and the lowest ones in winter reduced the ability of the microbiome to oxidize polymers and amines by 80 and 86 respectively compared to spring and autumn simultaneously the highest capacity for oxidizing carbohydrates 44 19 in the summer and amino acids 35 72 and surfactants 27 19 in winter were observed moreover in spring and autumn an increase in the intensity of the usage of carboxylic acids was recorded it was also observed that microorganisms were rather not able to use phenolic acids as a carbon source the analysis of the ability to utilize nitrogen and phosphorus sources showed seasonal differences in the use of substrates containing these biogenic elements it was observed that nitrogen containing compounds were most intensively used in winter 50 95 and the least in spring 32 31 while phosphorus compounds were the most intensively oxidized in summer 12 23 and the least in winter 1 22 fig 5 the projection of the data set derived from leachate samples was subjected to illustrate the differences and similarities between seasonal samples throughout the experiment the seasons spring and autumn formed one cluster for pc1 while the summer and winter were grouped independently fig 10a at times spring winter the factor analysis showed two factors that explained 52 55 pc1 and 26 59 pc2 of the variance fig 6 based on the pca profiles it was found that the season had an impact on the shift of microbial population and its functioning as well as toc ph and ec in the leachate among them the most correlated with pc1 were a ca s p shannon diversity and eveness indexes awcd n use index the number of heterotrophic bacteria psychrophilic microorganisms e coli and coliform bacteria and ec and toc whereas ch gini coefficient substrate richness and p use index were correlated with pc2 fig 6b 4 discussion leachate from former landfills poses a serious threat to the soil ecosystem and the quality of groundwater in this study the combined approach of both physicochemical and microbiological parameters to monitor leachate quality from municipal unprotected wastes was applied the quantity of obtained leachates was affected mainly by precipitation and artificial distilled water supply table 1 despite the high rate of effective infiltration 63 table 1 the amount of rainwater supplied to the lysimeter in the natural hydrological cycle was insufficient this was due to the small diameter of the lysimeter and the variable amount of precipitation during the experiment for this reason an artificial distilled water supply of lysimeter was necessary to ensure that the appropriate volume of the leachate sample will be obtained the disadvantage of this solution is the possible excess of leachate which resulted from the inability to predict precipitation in the assumed interval of leachate collection time for example in july an artificial power supply turned out to be unnecessary but in august it was fully justified table 1 accurate recording of the leachate volume and averaging of analytical samples representative for the observation period usually monthly made it possible to precisely determine the mass of the leached substances it should be aware that diluting rainwater with distilled water introduces some inaccuracies but it was assumed that this error would be compensated by the evaporation of infiltrating water and would not affect the achievement of the research objective especially since the mineralization of the leachate differed from the mineralization of precipitation by two orders of magnitude the chemical composition of leachates was heterogeneous depending on the number of rainfall episodes with the next pulse of rainwater a smaller load of leached substances was observed fig 2 which was reflected in the decreasing ec values over time table 1 this is a typical phenomenon when examining the leachability of pollutants from the same unmodified lump of waste soltysiak et al 2017 in the case of municipal waste the decomposition of organic substances is important which influences the chemical composition of the leachate and its properties including bod and cod and also results in the formation of biogas youcai and ziyang 2017 temperature is an important factor influencing these processes in the winter months as a result of low temperature it is possible to completely freeze the infiltrating leachates and in the summer the waste placed in the lysimeter is heated more intensively than the waste deposited in the landfill palanivel and sulaiman 2014 the experiment showed decreasing concentrations of substances in leachates but did not provide information on the impact of seasonal temperature changes on the chemical composition of leachates changes in the content of individual parameters had shown a downward trend the electrical conductivity values show a great similarity to leachate from other landfills han et al 2016 touzani et al 2021 the gradual decrease in value is mainly related to the elution of the main ions the increase in the ph value during the experiment is related to the time of waste deposition this is also confirmed by the research presented among others by deng and englehardt 2007 ph values at the level of 7 9 indicate a young landfill lo and liao 2007 this finding is in accordance with przydatek 2019 that the age of landfill influences the heavy metals concentrations in leachate in the leachate from lysimeters high levels of metals were observed compared to the groundwater tested in the monitoring for the rainfall dump located in the area of the lysimeters freshly deposited waste generates higher loads of metal pollution than old waste przydatek 2019 it is related to the presence of lower ph values acidic reaction in relation to the aging landfill high ammonium ion values in the leachate at the beginning of the experiment confirm the presence of reducing conditions however these values are half the data obtained from the p18 piezometer located on the top of a closed landfill dąbrowska et al 2018 landfills have not been extensively studied and are an unknown ecological system making them hard to study because of anthropogenic solid waste selection pressures yang et al 2021 the structure and functioning diversity of leached microbiome were in accordance with the physicochemical parameters from spring to autumn leachate conditions promoted the growth of pathogenic microorganisms characterized by escherichia coli salmonella sp enterobacter sp enterococcus sp and the like common in solid waste sekhohola dlamini and tekere 2020 in general the number of selected bacteria decreased in winter except for c perfringers with stable contribution during the whole experiment so far the microbiome consortia of leachate from solid waste have not been well elucidated our results confirm the increase of microbial activity in spring and autumn these seasons were also characterized by the highest functional diversity and substrate richness indices simultaneously the changes in these parameters were not connected with any of the analyzed microbial groups which was confirmed through pca analysis a significant influence of seasonality on functional differences especially in the decomposition of c substrates was observed in the summer the utilization of labile carbon sources represented mainly by carbohydrates in eco plate was promoted in contrast to the winter season in which the decomposition of more complex carbon sources such as surfactants increased similar functional differences between summer and winter microbial communities in response to the addition of carbon substrates were observed in beech forest soil by koranda et al 2013 they suggested that this trend was connected with the depletion of labile carbon in winter and its intensive supply by plants roots in summer in our experiment the influence of plant root excretions cannot be taken into account but it can be assumed that at higher temperatures the population of microorganisms intensively metabolizing easily degradable carbon sources developed bloomed the analysis of the ability to utilize nitrogen showed the enhanced microbial n use in winter despite the fact that ntot concentration was the lowest this season it was also in accordance with results presented by koranda et al 2013 the analysis of bacterial communities in two large sanitary landfills in beijing and xi an china also indicated that nitrogen content was the most important physicochemical parameter influencing their structure and diversity low temperature conditions create environmental stress on the microorganism bacterial survival to cold temperature conditions and sustain regular metabolic functions are followed by various especially n depended adaptation mechanisms their survival is facilitated through physiological and metabolic changes including the synthesis of cryoprotectants cold acclimation proteins cold shock and antifreeze proteins and ice nucleators these adaptive upregulated mechanisms followed by protein related to stress response solubilization of nutrients biological nitrogen fixation and energy production are known by several cold adopted bacteria such as pseudomonas acinetobacter burkholderia and rhodococcus in turn energy consuming processes and biosynthetic processes under low temperature stress conditions are always downregulated kumar et al 2022 suyal et al 2017 subramanian et al 2011 phosphorus p as po4 3 is the most easily assimilated p form in ecosystems by living organisms and it serves an integral role in aspects of cellular metabolism cellular components phospho lipids and genetic material dna rna and energy transfer atp nadp khanzada 2020 sosa 2018 in this work the highest oxidation of phosphorus compounds in summer was observed this natural phenomenon can be a result of intensive metabolism of phosphate leachate compounds by phosphorus solubilizing bacteria psb psb are able to convert insoluble phosphorus into soluble forms improving p use efficiency yu et al 2022 many bacteria are known for their ability to mobilize phosphorus compounds and belong to pseudomonas agrobacterium bacillus and enterobacter alori et al 2017 an important factor influencing the physicochemical and biological decomposition of waste is acidity in our studies ph was rather stable and slightly increased from spring 7 5 to summer 8 6 which could be connected to our lysimeter being an open system exposed to external weather conditions yang et al 2021 listed ph and bod cod as critical indicators of solid waste decomposition they observed the ph decrease between 13 and 188 day of the experiment in a laboratory polymethyl methacrylate based bioreactor 1 0 m height and 0 2 m inner diameter they correlated this with the accumulation of carboxylic acid as a result of the degradation of biodegradable substrates therefore the presented in situ studies were shown seasonal differences in the level of microbial metabolism and substrate preferences which can be used to more specifically infer the waste decomposition status of leachate in total 9 analyzes of rainwater supplying the lysimeter were performed the comparison of the concentrations of chemical components in the precipitation and in the leachates shows that only the source of cu and ba was the atmospheric precipitation in two cases for this article the extreme values were omitted while discussion the percentage of components in the leachates supplied by precipitation ranged from the first to the third quartile the conductivity of precipitation ranged from 0 015 to 0 163 ms cm and the leachate 30 7 10 ms cm these are sizes varying by 3 4 orders of magnitude the first group of elements consists of components whose percentage share from precipitation does not exceed 0 5 in the leachate these are k na cl n nh4 b and mg the most compact here are rainy k cl na and n nh4 the content of which in the leachate does not exceed 0 2 b ni and mg are characterized by a slightly greater percentage range however it should be noted that their content in the leachate is in practice negligible similarly sulfates concentration from rainwater does not exceed 1 in the leachate al and mn stand out from this group of chemical components the values of the first and third quartiles of the percentage share of precipitation al are respectively 1 6 and 3 0 and in the case of mn 1 1 and 6 2 the median values for both of these metals account for approximately half of the range of these ranges the highest percentages delivered with precipitation were observed in leachates for ca cu and ba the values of the third quartile are 10 2 10 9 and 14 7 respectively this indicates a high content of these components delivered by rainwater while at the same time their low concentrations in the leachate a characteristic phenomenon in lysimeter studies is a decrease in the concentrations of eluted components in the leachate in such situations when the concentration of the component in rainfall is constant the share of supplying with the chemical components from rainfall in the leachates increases the analysis of the relationship between the concentrations of individual components in precipitation and leachate shows that for most of the components the quality of rainwater does not affect the leachate in our experiment the proportion of selected components k na cl n nh4 b mg and so4 2 supplied with rain does not exceed 0 5 1 al and mn contained in rainfall had little influence on the chemical composition of the leachate the average percentage concentration of these metals in the leachate was 2 4 and 4 5 in relation to the concentration in rainfall the highest percentages delivered with precipitation were observed in leachates for ba ca and cu the mean values of their concentration are 9 2 11 1 and 31 7 respectively this indicates a high content of these components delivered by rainwater while at the same time their low concentrations in the leachate a characteristic phenomenon in lysimeter studies is a decrease in the concentrations of eluted components in the leachate in such situations when the concentration of the component in rainfall is constant the share of supplying with the chemical components from rainfall in the leachates increases in our experiment the average content of dissolved substances in rainfall did not exceed 0 035 g l 0 071 g l 0 006 g l while the concentration of dissolved substances in the leachate was initially about 23 g l and at the end of the experiment it dropped to 3 8 g l taking into account the differences in the mineralization of leachate and rainwater as well as very low concentrations of al ba ca and cu in precipitation it was assumed that the influence of the water in the chemical composition of precipitation in the initial period of leaching did not have a significant impact on the chemical composition of the leachate 5 conclusions according to the results of the performed lysimeter experiment the influence of leachates could be concluded in a few aspects like chemical microbiological and biochemical risks this study has shown that for the given study area the lysimeter experiment allows reflecting landfill conditions the value of the electrical conductivity is comparable to the values obtained in the measurements of leachate from landfills however it is impossible to obtain the same type of waste as in the closed old landfill the conducted lysimeter studies showed that the values of most physicochemical parameters decrease with successive washing of the waste this suggests rapid leaching of pollutants from the waste the study identified the benefits the assessment environmental impact of the leachates taking into account the kinetics of physicochemical processes occurring in the solids of the landfill water budget analysis performance and drawbacks cost duration possible measurement errors resulting from strong sunlight on the lysimeter the scale of the experiment of the lysimeter experiment on municipal landfill waste an essential advantage of the interdisciplinary lysimeter experiment is studying the influence of atmospheric factors and oxygen access on the chemical and bacteriological composition and determining seasonal metabolic changes of microorganisms of landfill leachate lysimeter studies can play a valuable role in the construction of landfills for the best method of waste isolation as well as limiting the growth of microorganisms funding the article was prepared on the basis of funding under

2921,rain gauge networks are not adequate to capture the complex spatial structure of rainfall for meaningful urban flood studies while radar and satellite precipitation products spps are being developed to alleviate the limitations of rain gauge networks they need to be evaluated for regional applications this study compared radar against 3 spps of imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation and persiann ccs precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system that have sub daily records for southeast queensland australia based on the spatial structure identified through the structural similarity index ssi and two dimensional correlogram at the daily timescale the spps were downscaled to 1 km 1 km grid resolution to conform with the radar dataset using inverse distance weighting and bilinear interpolation all three spps that are freely available reflected very well the similarity 90 in the spatial pattern with that of the radar although imerg was marginally better however mswep appeared to be the closest to the gauge dataset better than even the expensive radar dataset stemming from its much better similarity in the mean similarity statistic nevertheless there could be some atmospheric climatic factors that may cause one to select one spp over the others for a given wet day and this needs to be explored for the possibility of selecting different spps for different wet days keywords rainfall precipitation satellite radar spatial structure rain gauge networks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall is considered as a natural phenomenon that is characterised by high spatial and temporal variability at the same time rainfall controls environmental processes and is key to agriculture industry and human habitat thus the spatial heterogeneity in rainfall should be captured for a plethora of studies including floods and droughts however rain gauge stations are normally installed in densely populated areas particularly in coastal regions li and shao 2010 and complete records are rarely available due to problems such as topography accessibility and equipment malfunction villarini et al 2008 aguilera et al 2020 kidd et al 2017 it is an accepted fact that rain gauge network density is not enough to capture the intrinsic heterogeneity in rainfall even within the developed world gyasi agyei 2020 maier et al 2020 also rain gauges sample a small area 200 mm in diameter and are irregularly spaced making it difficult to extrapolate to several km2 without introducing undue uncertainty huff 1970 radar rainfall technology is being used to improve the understanding of the spatial structure but it has its own problems stemming from the algorithms used in the conversion of reflectivity to rainfall the nature of the topography and signal attenuation among others e g krajewski et al 2010 also radar technology is cost prohibitive particularly for developing countries and very few countries can afford full coverage over their air space the past two decades have seen development of satellite derived precipitation products that cover nearly the whole world thus helping to address the inadequacy of rain gauge networks examples of satellite precipitation products spps are tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 2020 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2019 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 and climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 as with radar datasets spps also have their problems a major one being the dependence of rainfall rate on the cloud top properties and path integrated hydrometeor content janowiak et al 2001 huffman et al 2007 while most of the available radars and spps have been bias corrected using some rain gauge data it is important to also evaluate them for specific regions before their usage most of the studies on the comparison or evaluation of spps are carried out at coarse spatial and temporal scales comparing tmpa 3b43 with gridded rain gauge data sets at the monthly and 0 25 25 km temporal and spatial scales respectively fleming et al 2011 recommended using this product for climate studies in australia particularly for the austral summer daily and monthly 1 100 km spatial resolution values of trmm 3b43 and 3b42 products were compared with gridded global precipitation climatology centre gpcc data over thailand by chokngamwong and chiu 2008 islam et al 2020 compared five spps imerg trmm tmpa cmorph persiann against the queensland department of environment and science silo https www longpaddock qld gov au silo gauge based gridded daily rainfall dataset over the whole of australia using a grid size of 0 50 50 km from their analysis imerg emerged as the best satellite precipitation product spp guo and liu 2016 evaluated versions of trmm products at daily monthly and annual temporal scales and at 0 25o 2 km and 1 100 km grid resolutions and also at the basin scale they observed that in general the performance of the spps improved with increasing spatial scale logah et al 2021 evaluated five spps over the black volta basin of west africa their analysis was based on point comparison of collocated spps values with the gauge data and did not involve evaluation of the rainfall spatial structure bulovic et al 2020 evaluated imerg at 30 min temporal resolution over the tropical andes mountainous setting using 15 rain gauges located within 1 grid of size 0 1 by 0 1 they observed that imerg generally underestimated rainfall depths asong et al 2017 also evaluated imerg over southern canada at the grid scale and at the 6 hourly daily and monthly timescales other researchers have used spps in hydrological applications examples include li et al 2015 who used spps for real time flood forecasting xue et al 2013 for streamflow simulation and brunetti et al 2018 for landslide forecasting the objective of this study was to select the best of the freely available spps for southeast queensland australia by comparing them with an expensive radar rainfall product at the daily and 1 km grid temporal and spatial scales respectively of particular interest were those spps that have sub daily records that could be used for urban flood studies imerg mswep and persiann ccs persiann cloud classification system spps met the sub daily temporal scale requirements and were downscaled to a 1 km grid to conform with the 1 km resolution of the radar dataset the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the study area and the datasets used this is followed by the methodology in section 3 section 4 presents the results and discussion before concluding in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the same as used in gyasi agyei 2020 noting that part of this area was also used previously in gyasi agyei 2016 2018 2019 it is the landfall area of the mt stapylton weather radar station in southeast queensland which covers an area of 28 371 km2 with its centroid located at 476 8 km easting and 6921 4 northing fig 1 left panel the radar station is managed by the australian bureau of meteorology http www bom gov au australia radar about calculating rainfall accumulations shtml a 3 arc second 90 shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of the study area obtained from australia geoscience gallant et al 2009 https ecat ga gov au geonetwork srv eng catalog search metadata 69888 was aggregated by a factor of 11 to obtain a 33 arc second 990 m grid and the coordinates were transformed from longitude and latitude system to eastings m and northings m system then the inverse distance weighting idw method with 4 nearest neighbours was used to interpolate the 33 arc second 990 m grid to the 1 km grid centres of the radar data discussed in the next section to generate the dem shown in fig 1 right panel as observed from the dem the study area is characterised by a very complex terrain stretching from the coastline elevation 0 m to the hilly areas in the southwest direction that reaches 1300 m the study area is in a subtropical region and the climate is classified as temperate without dry season and hot summer summer temperatures can occasionally exceed 29 c but the average temperature is about 26 5 c summer months from december to march are generally wet and thunderstorms are common contributing to the majority of the average annual rainfall of 990 mm july to september experience low rainfall with monthly averages less than 40 mm 2 2 daily rainfall gauge and radar data the mt stapylton radar data from 2009 to 01 01 to 2015 06 30 has a spatial grid size of 1 km 1 km and of 6 min temporal resolution the radar is a 1500 s band doppler type located at 523 8 km easting and 6934 km northing shown as r in fig 1 left panel a z r power law relationship with different constants for convective and stratiform rainfall was used to convert the reflectivity z measurements into a rainfall intensity r mm h and processed to 6 min temporal scale accumulation depth the radar rainfall data have been adjusted using some rain gauge datasets within the range of the radar https www bom gov au australia radar about calculating rainfall accumulations shtml and commercially available there are 324 rainfall gauges located within the study area also managed by the australian bureau of meteorology since the data analysis was carried out on the radar spatial grid each rain gauge was assigned to the nearest grid centre and multiple rain gauges within the same grid were averaged thus the number of grid centres with a rain gauge station was reduced to 315 fig 1 left panel giving an average inter gauge distance of 9 5 km to be on the same temporal resolution as the daily rain gauge data the radar data were aggregated from 9am to 9am the queensland department of environment and science https www longpaddock qld gov au silo has infilled the missing records within the daily rainfall data and the complete records were used collocated data sets refer to the radar grid cells data at the 315 rain gauge locations 2 3 satellite precipitation products spps three spps imerg mswep persiann ccs covering the study area for the period of the radar records were used imerg precipitation satellite data is a product of the gpm mission which is an extension of trmm the gpm 3imerghh 06 product has a temporal resolution of 0 5 h and a spatial precision of 0 1 x 0 1 10 km 10 km and available from 2000 to 06 01 to date https disc gsfc

climate analytics persiann ccs is the third spp it uses pattern recognition and computer image processing techniques to classify clouds and estimate precipitation based on satellite images this product developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine has a spatial precision of 0 04 0 04 4 km 4 km a temporal resolution of 1 h and is available from 2003 03 01 to date https chrsdata eng uci edu only the persiann ccs satellite product of the three is not bias corrected using observed gauged data the rain gauge data used for this study are in the public domain so there is a significant overlap with those used to bias correct the radar and the spps for example the data overlap with those used by mswep is over 80 h beck personal communication 16 december 2021 the idw method with 4 nearest neighbours was used to interpolate the imerg and mswep datasets to a 10 km 10 km regular grid and the persiann ccs dataset to a 4 km 4 km regular grid i e to their nearest integer km these outputs were further disaggregated to a 1 km 1 km grid to conform with the radar dataset using bilinear interpolation the 10 km grid centres of the radar aggregation from the 1 km 1 km original data do not conform to the 0 1 10 km grid centres of the spps datasets after the conversion of the longitude and latitude coordinate system to the eastings and northings system therefore there was a need to standardise the grid centres of the spps to that of the radar note that the spatial disaggregation of the 10 km grid centres maps to the 1 km grid centres of the radar data used for the analysis allowing the radar and spps to be compared using the same 1 km 1 km grid centres using only 4 closest neighbours for the idw ensures that each is not more than 10 km from the central grid of interest also the sub daily satellite data were subjected to temporal aggregation into daily timescale of the rain gauge data in all 626 wet days having gauge radar imerg and mswep data were considered only 480 out of the 626 wet days 76 7 have persiann ccs data 3 methodology the radar and the spps were evaluated and compared based on two spatial structure concepts structural similarity and correlogram the spatial pattern can be assessed visually from rainfield maps but quantitative measures are required in order to eliminate subjectivity also the spatial scale has a role to play in identifying the spatial heterogeneity which decreases as the spatial scale increases the intrinsic property of spatial correlation or dependence of the neighbouring grid cells of rainfall needs to be captured in identifying the spatial structure 3 1 structural similarity index ssi the structural similarity index ssi was originally developed in computer science for assessing the quality of image compression wang et al 2004 jones et al 2016 enhanced the ssi by incorporating uncertainty from the underlying spatial models and also corrected edge effects a moving local window of spatial extent was used to calculate independent statistics relating to local similarity in the local mean variance and spatial covariance between a pair of rainfields under comparison this concept was used to compare the daily rainfields from the gauge collocated and full radar and the spps one condition is that the two rainfields should be compared on the same regular grid let n be the size of the n n window total number of cells being n2 of the neighbouring grid cell centred on grid cell k noting that n takes only odd integers with a minimum value of 3 it is assumed that the n n neighbours have equal weights the sum of the weights being unity the n 2 cells with the local moving window were used to calculate the local means μ k and variances σ k 2 for each rainfield as 1 μ k i 1 n 2 m i r i 2 σ k 2 i 1 n 2 m i r i μ k 2 where mi and ri are the weights and rainfall amounts of the grid cells within the local window k being the central cell the local means and variances of the two rainfields were then used to develop the covariance c k between the two rainfields as 3 c k i 1 n 2 m i r i a μ k a r i b μ k b where subscripts a and b refer to the two different rainfields being compared ssi statistics representing similarity in spatial mean simk variance sivk and pattern sipk of the local measures were next computed as 4 si m k 2 μ k a μ k b c 1 μ k a 2 μ k b 2 c 1 5 si v k 2 σ k a σ k b c 2 σ k a 2 σ k b 2 c 2 6 si p k c k c 3 σ k a σ k b c 3 wang et al 2004 suggested that the constants in the above three equations required for stability in cases where the denominators are close to zero be estimated from the range r defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum rainfall amounts of the rainfields being compared as c1 0 01r 2 c2 0 03r 2 and c3 c2 2 values of eqns 4 6 were used to estimate the overall measure of similarity ssim for each grid cell as a product of the multiplication of sim siv and sip given as 7 ssi m k s i m k s i v k s i p k the ssim value ranges between 1 complete similarity and 1 complete dissimilarity for the pair of rainfields being compared sim and siv have values between 0 one has high values and the other low values and 1 complete similarity it is difficult to visualise the differences between the spatial pattern of two rainfields this difficulty is alleviated by the sip since its value towards 1 indicates significant differences in the spatial pattern with the low and high values occurring in different areas sip values close to 1 are an indication of close similarity in spatial pattern the low and high values occurring in similar areas overall single value statistics were obtained by taking the mean of simk sivk sipk and ssimk over all the 28 371 of the 1 km 1 km grid cells of the study region and designated simply as sim siv sip and ssim thus ssim offers an opportunity to examine rainfields for structural similarity by calculating a single value over the pair of rainfields being compared fine scale differences are smoothed out as the neighbourhood window size increases starting from 3 by 3 grid cells the reflection algorithm presented by jones et al 2016 to correct edge effects was implemented it generates artificial buffers around the study region in order to preserve the spatial extent of the map rainfield comparison values of the reflected grid cells within the buffer zone are computed using values of the neighbouring grids sensitivity analysis of the window size was carried out by n taking on values within the set of 3 5 7 9 and 11 setting the upper limit of n to just above the maximum spatial scale 10 km of the original spps the ssi indices were calculated for each window size independently for the pair of rainfields being compared rainfields were generated for the gauges and collocated radar datasets each gauge was assigned to the nearest 1 km 1 km grid of the study region and the remaining cells were assigned na not available interpretation of missing values in r programming language values for each window only real values were used in the calculations discarding windows having less than 2 real valued grid cells these settings allowed comparison of the gauged data with the radar and the satellite rainfields 3 2 correlogram correlogram estimation follows the methodology presented in gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 and gyasi agyei 2020 2016 it involves determination of the daily rainfall correlogram spatial structure in the gaussian domain suited for kriging interpolation hence the first step is to transform the daily data greater than zero into gaussian n 0 1 quantiles using one of the standard two parameter right skewed distributions weibull kappa gamma gumbel generalized pareto log logistic log normal based on the anderson darling statistic the dry zero rainfall amounts were assigned values depending on their distance from a wet gauge given as 8 r s k r 0 1 exp d sk d where sk is the dry grid cell k located at a distance of d sk from a wet grid d is the average over all dry grids and 0 1 is the minimum daily rainfall amount given po as the proportion of dry grids for the day the gaussian quantiles w sk were expressed as 9 w s k φ 1 f r r s k 1 p 0 p 0 r s k 0 1 φ 1 p 0 exp d s k d r s k 0 1 where n 0 1 is represented as φ with its inverse as φ 1 and f r is the fitted marginal distribution to the wet rainfall amounts φ 1 equation 9 is inverted to yield rainfall amounts from the gaussian quantiles as 10 r s k f r 1 φ w s k p 0 1 p 0 φ w s k p 0 0 φ w s k p 0 the empirical correlogram first introduced by yao and journel 1998 is developed from the gaussian quantiles as 11 r x y 1 n h k 1 n h w s k w s k h m 0 m h s k s k h h x 1 y 1 where and y are the easting and northern direction separation distances km respectively from the origin 0 0 of the empirical correlogram r x y the correlogram value at the grid point x y includes pair grid locations at separation distance h within the bounded region of x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 n h is the number of pair gauges and m o m 0 and m h m h represent the means of the pair of tail w s k w s k and head w s k h w s k h values m h respectively a two dimensional 2d exponential model that gives analytical elliptical contours is fitted to the empirical data of eqn 11 as 12 r θ x y r θ u v exp u l u 2 v l v 2 1 2 u y sin θ x cos θ v y cos θ x sin θ in eqn 12 v and u are the separation distances in the direction of the minor and major axes respectively along an elliptical contour and and y are as defined in eqn 11 lv and lu are the minor and major axis lengths respectively lv lu is the anisotropy ratio η and θ is the angle between the major axis and the horizontal direction measured anticlockwise the three parameters of the 2d exponential model lv lu θ were optimised to match the empirical and the analytical elliptical correlogram contours fig 2 explains the notations used in eqn 12 for example parameters of lu 30 km lv 21 km and θ 70 contours of correlations of 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 are also displayed the 2d correlogram parameters were estimated separately for the gauge collocated radar radar imerg mswep and persiann ccs datasets for each wet day following gyasi agyei 2020 the 6 different sources of the 2d correlogram parameters were used in ordinary kriging ly et al 2011 cressie 1993 to perform leave one out cross validation loocv for the gauge and collocated datasets with the r package gstat pebesma 2004 in loocv prediction of each grid cell data with its standard deviation is made one at a time using the remaining grid cell data points for the ordinary kriging interpolation note that normal scores standard normal quantiles were used in the loocv and the results were converted into rainfall amounts using eqn 10 the following performance statistics were used to evaluate the performance of the 6 different sources of the 2d correlogram root mean square error rmse 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n v o i v p i 2 mean absolute bias mab 14 mab 1 n i 1 n v o i v p i and mean bias mb 15 mb 1 n i 1 n v o i v p i where the observed and predicted values for the ith data point are respectively vo i and vp i and n is the number of data points another very important statistic is the standard deviation sd that is estimated with the mean m in the gaussian domain by ordinary kriging sd defines the uncertainty associated with the kriging estimates and the higher the sd value the higher the errors at the interpolated location the 95 prediction limits pl in the gaussian domain were estimated as 16 pl 0 975 m 1 96 s d pl 0 025 m 1 96 s d which were converted into rainfall amounts using eqn 10 as r0 025 and r0 0975 the difference of these values pd95 r0 0975 r0 025 and the sd were averaged over all data points for a given wet day and used in the performance evaluation presented in the next section 4 results and discussion because radar data is expensive and only available in a few countries including australia for a limited selection of regions while satellite precipitation rainfall covers nearly the whole world we searched for the best spp that is closest to the radar precipitation dataset in terms of the spatial structure it is well known that radar rainfall varies very much with range thus there is lack of homogeneity the spatial structure was identified through the structural similarity index ssi and the correlogram required for kriging interpolation 4 1 structural similarity index ssi the ssi indices of a pair of radar and spps at the 1 km 1 km spatial scale are compared in fig 3 for 3 different window sizes 3 7 and 11 km the points are values for individual wet day data and the solid lines are lines of perfect agreement also demarcated in fig 3 are the 5 quantiles that 95 of the data are greater than a moving window size of 11 km is closest to the maximum spatial scale of the original imerg and mswep spps all the similarity indices are positive indicating similarity across all the datasets it is observed that the spread of the data points along the line of perfect match increases with the moving window size and is more widespread towards the centre of the data range indicating loss of similarity with moving window size which is more apparent in the siv and sip statistics for the siv and sip the range of values were 0 65 to 1 for n 3 and 0 4 to 1 for n 11 this demonstrates that the variance and spatial pattern of the spps are similar to those of the radar and it is the mean statistic that exhibits a high degree of disparity between 0 and 1 the disparity in the mean is reflected in the overall similarity of ssim however positive values of the overall similarity are an indication of spatial structure of the different data sources resembling each other jones et al 2016 to get a sense of overall similarity indices the values were averaged over all wet days for a pair of rainfields comparison statistics in fig 4 shown in fig 4 are the results comparing radar with the collocated rd cl gauge rd ga imerg rd im mswep rd ms and persiann ccs rd ps datasets collocated data results are presented for comparison and as expected have an over 0 96 mean similarity index not shown in fig 4 to improve readability of the other lines that have smaller values comparing with the full radar followed by gauge data with a mean similarity index over 0 54 both imerg and mswep have very good mean similarity indices of over 0 52 although the mean similarity index between the radar and persiann ccs is around 0 48 it is still considered to be satisfactory this is not surprising as it is only the persiann ccs spp that is not bias corrected with rain gauge data in terms of the variance similarity index the gauge and imerg performed closely having an siv value of nearly 0 9 at the 3 km moving window size and a slight decline as the moving window size increased mswep yielded the least values of siv slightly above 0 5 though this can still be considered as good while there is no clear set threshold value for classifying the ssi indices as good one may consider above 0 25 as satisfactory above 0 5 as good and above 0 75 as excellent however the essence is to select an spp with the highest similarity index value all three spps reflect very well the similarity in spatial pattern with that of the radar with values of sip in excess of 0 9 at the moving window size of 3 km although imerg is marginally better the spps outperforming both the collocated and gauges in terms of the spatial pattern similarity is expected as the number of gauges is far below the optimum value to reflect the spatial pattern gyasi agyei 2020 girons lopez et al 2015 villarini et al 2008 combining the mean variance and pattern similarity indices the overall similarity of ssim identified imerg as the best alternative to the radar dataset followed by mswep and then persiann ccs however the similarity of all three spps to the radar data is quite good a similar analysis was carried out comparing the gauge dataset and all the other datasets as presented in fig 5 mswep emerged as the closest to the gauge dataset in terms of the similarity in the mean and variance but slightly lower than imerg and persiann ccs in terms of the similarity in the spatial pattern considering the overall similarity ssim mswep appears to be the closest to the gauge dataset than even the radar dataset stemming from its much better similarity in the mean similarity statistic this is not surprising as mswep has been bias corrected using over 80 of the rain gauges in the study area beck et al 2019 have indicated that mswep tends to exhibit better performance than other precipitation products in both densely gauged and ungauged regions however prakash 2019 found chirps and tmpa to be better than mswep when evaluating spps over india at the monthly timescale it is interesting to note that persiann ccs is marginally better than the gridded datasets in terms of sip with the gauges it seems that adjustments of the radar and spps with gauged data significantly improves the mean and variance similarity but may cause some reduction in the spatial pattern similarity this may be a plausible reason for the persiann ccs being the best in terms of the spatial pattern similarity but the worst in terms of the other similarity indices because it is not gauge adjusted table 1 presents the rates of change for each line in figs 4 and 5 it indicates that the rates of change as a result of increasing the moving window size from 3 km to 11 km is very small for the mean similarity average 2 43 followed by the variance similarity and then the spatial pattern similarity the average decline in the overall similarity is about 23 the over 0 65 value for sip similarity indicates that the high and low rainfall in the locations are captured by the different products this means that with an appropriate bias correction method any of the spps could be adopted in lieu of the expensive radar dataset the ssi is ideal for comparing several sources of rainfall data that exhibit spatial heterogeneity its application is quite simple and easy to implement most importantly it allows comparison of local mean variance and covariances between two sources of rainfall data increasing the spatial scale window size causes the fine scale spatial difference to disappear as a result of the smoothing effect causing reductions in the variance and spatial pattern as observed in figs 4 and 5 varying the local neighbourhood size within the limits of the original data sources wu 2004 jones et al 2016 helps to alleviate the effect of the different spatial scale of the data sources islam et al 2020 used the ssi methodology to compare and evaluate five spps over the whole of australia but at a much coarser scale of 0 5 50 km they identified imerg as the best among the five spps as has also been the case for our analysis but they did not include mswep and persiann ccs in their study our objective was to identify spps that generate sub daily rainfall records and at the 1 km grid spatial scale for urban flood modelling given the very high values of sip the spps could be used to define the correlogram spatial structure required by kriging interpolation methods for generating rainfields conditioned on the limited gauge data that represent the true rainfall for a given day gyasi agyei 2018 4 2 correlogram the major axis lengths of the correlograms generated by the different products for the wet days are compared in fig 6 points under the line of perfect agreement indicate that the variable on the vertical axis underestimates the major axis length compared with the horizontal axis variable in general the gauge and collocated data sources underestimate the major axis length and also the minor axis length given the over 0 91 correlation between the correlogram axis lengths in comparison with the radar gyasi agyei 2018 and satellite products pairs of radar and satellite data sources display nearly equal under and over estimation of the correlogram axis lengths in comparison with each other the poor correlation between the correlogram axis lengths generated by the different products is an indication that they may each yield different spatial structures for a given wet day an implication is that one product may be preferred over the others to represent the spatial structure of a given wet day that have limited number of rain gauges over the region of interest boxplots of some performance statistics of the loocv of the gauge and collocated datasets using the 2d correlograms derived from the different products are shown in fig 7 overlapping of the notches of the boxplots is an indication that the medians do not differ much for sd imerg and mswep recorded the lowest values and their medians are similar even though imerg values are more spread out compared with the mswep values both imerg and mswep seem to perform slightly better than the radar the radar being better than the persiann ccs though in terms of sd the radar and satellite products performed better than the gauge and the collocated datasets these observations are also true for the 95 prediction range pd95 which relies on the values of sd the boxplots of rmse of the products are similar to each other with the exception of persian ccs that yielded the highest values mab and mb performance statistics not shown here displayed similar trends as rmse the high values of rmse and extent of spread for all products could be attributed to the fact each product may not provide an adequate spatial structure for all wet days hence there is a need to screen the products for the best outcome for each wet day meaning each wet day may be represented by a different product for a better understanding of the variability of the performance statistics over the rainfall products ranks were used in lieu of the actual values for each wet day the performance statistics of the gauge radar and the spps values were ranked from 1 the lowest value and the best to 5 the highest and the worst tie values were given the lowest rank number in order to have integer ranks only this was repeated for the group but with gauge replaced with collocated table 2 shows the distribution of the number of wet days each product achieved a particular rank for sd and rmse performance statistics imerg recorded the highest number of rank 1 for sd and rmse followed by radar radar before mswep for the gauge predictions for the collocated predictions imerg recorded the most rank 1 outcomes followed by mswep and then radar for sd the gauge gauge ga in fig 7 and collocated colloc co in fig 7 correlograms performed poorly with respect to sd but yielded better results in terms of rmse weighted averages of the ranks were calculated for overall assessment as presented in table 3 for all the performance statistics from table 3 pd95 is a reflection of sd and so is mab of rmse because they have the same overall rankings this is also true for mb and rmse particularly for the collocated predictions it is interesting to observe that imerg and mswep are marginally better than radar in terms of sd for both gauge and collocated prediction and also for rmse for the collocated predictions persiann ccs is the poorest performer of the gridded products although it yielded better results for sd compared with the gauge and collocated spatial structures because the rmse does not vary very much over the data sources it is better to use sd for screening the products even the gauge and collocated spatial structures predicted marginally better than the gridded products for rmse in general both imerg and mswep could be used in lieu of radar the worst performance by persiann ccs could be due to the fact that it is the only product that is not bias corrected using rain gauge data as pointed out by gyasi agyei 2018 a correlogram data source that yields smaller sd values is preferred because the uncertainty associated with conditional simulations through kriging is reduced this means multiple simulation of rainfields to be used for urban flood studies with the same correlogram will look similar hence imerg or mswep products could be used to augment gauge rainfall records for hydrological modelling and analysis at fine temporal and spatial scales both approaches for the comparison and evaluation of the radar and spps yielded similar outcomes imerg combines information from both pmw passive microwave and ir infrared data from the satellite constellation operated by gpm and rainfall estimates are adjusted using monthly gauge data the final run version evaluated has latency of about 3 5 months and it is a significant improvement over the early and late run versions that have latency of about 4 h and 14 h respectively mswep merges several satellites with pmw and ir information gauge over 80 overlap with the gauge data used and reanalysis products therefore it is expected to outperform the other spps and the radar in comparison with the gauged data particularly the mean and variance similarity while the gauge adjustment improves the mean and variance similarity the spatial pattern similarity seems to be somehow degraded compared to the other spps persiann ccs is a near real time latency 1 h product using ir imagery from global geosynchronous satellites to estimate rainfall without gauge adjustment hence it is not expected to outperform the other spps however it has demonstrated its ability to better capture the spatial pattern similarity very well compared to the other spps 4 3 selection of satellite precipitation products for hydrological applications the main goal of this paper was to evaluate three spps against the expensive radar dataset not necessarily comparing the spps against each other to demonstrate the methodology for comparing two rainfields however the methodology could be used to screen several spps for a given region if the hydrological application does not require near real time data such as drought and flood modelling any available spps could be evaluated for use note that the quality of the short latency near real time spps could be lower than the long latency research quality products but for real time flood forecasting applications one should select spps that give near real time dataset with a short latency such as he hydro estimator satellite https www ospo noaa gov products atmosphere ghe latency 15 30 min and pdir now persiann dynamic infrared rain rate https chrsdata eng uci edu latency 15 60 min comparing ssps of different latency is not uncommon but it all depends on the hydrological application for example the six ssps compared by tan and santo 2018 with different latency were imerg early run 4h imerg late run 14 h imerg final run 3 5 months tmpa 3b42 2 months tmpa 3b42rt 8h and persiann cdr 3 months 5 concluding remarks this paper evaluates 3 freely available spps satellite precipitation products of imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation and persiann ccs precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system against the expensive radar precipitation dataset from the mt stapylton station southeast queensland australia the spps have different spatial resolutions but they were downscaled to 1 km grids to conform with the 1 km grid centres of the radar dataset using inverse distance weighting and bilinear interpolation methods interpolating the spps from 0 1 and 0 04 grids to 10 km and 4 km grids respectively and then to 1 km grids introduces additional uncertainties despite using only 4 nearest grid neighbours the introduced uncertainties could vary across the spps due to the different pmw and ir sensors and retrieval algorithms employed and also be exacerbated by the complex terrain consisting of land coast and ocean land uses each rain gauge station was assigned to a radar grid centre and grid centres with more than 1 rain gauge were averaged most studies on evaluation of spps are carried out at monthly and coarse spatial scales such as 0 25 and 1 grids e g chokngamwong and chiu 2008 fleming et al 2011 logah et al 2021 but our interest is in daily temporal and 1 km grid spatial scales of prime importance of this study was to capture the spatial structure of rainfall at the daily and fine spatial scale hence two approaches that describe the spatial structure of rainfall were used to evaluate and compare the expensive radar dataset and the three spps that also have sub daily records the first approach is the structural similarity index ssi that has been developed for image compression wang et al 2004 it uses a moving window of size selected to conform to the spatial scale of the original datasets i e 3 km to 11 km ssi offers an opportunity to compute single value similarity in the mean variance spatial pattern and an overall index for a pair of rainfields being compared the second approach is based on estimation of a 2d correlogram in the gaussian domain that is used in loocv kriging interpolation gyasi agyei 2020 2016 performance statistics of root mean square error rmse mean absolute bias mab mean bias mb standard deviation sd and 95 prediction range pd95 were used to evaluate the different rainfall data sources all the ssi indices were positive which were the first indication that there is similarity among the different rainfall products with the indices for variance and spatial pattern declining as the window size increased ssi identified imerg as the satellite product that is closest to the radar dataset with mswep not far behind and persiann ccs having the least resemblance to radar but still considered reasonable in comparison with the gauge data mswep emerged as the best product even marginally better than the radar dataset because persiann ccs is not bias corrected with gauge data it performed poorly with respect to the mean similarity but was marginally better with respect to similarity in spatial pattern therefore persiann ccs could be improved with an appropriate bias correction with local gauge data the gauge and collocated data sources yielded lower values of axis lengths of the correlogram compared with the radar and satellite products an implication of this is that the gauge and collocated correlogram will yield higher values of sd when used for kriging interpolation as reported imerg and mswep yielded the lowest values of the sd performance statistic and thus they are preferred over even the expensive radar dataset however the radar performed better than persiann ccs with regard to the sd performance statistic rmse performance statistics could not differentiate between the different products it is observed that sd is a better discriminating performance statistic than rmse mab and mb as pointed out in gyasi agyei 2018 this is particularly so when the objective is to simulate similar multiple rainfields using the same correlogram for urban flood studies in the end both approaches for the comparison of the radar dataset against the spps have yielded similar outcomes as the results show any of the three satellite precipitation datasets could be used with some form of bias correction as a source of correlograms for gauge rainfall data interpolation for hydrological modelling and analysis at fine temporal and spatial scales within the study area while the spps have performed comparatively well against the radar dataset there could be some atmospheric climatic factors that may preference one spp over the others for a given wet day and this needs to be explored to take advantage of using multiple spp combinations in a clever manner there are differences in the techniques algorithms and observational satellite sensors infrared and or passive microwave employed by each spp therefore the sources of errors of the spps are not the same the skills of the spps may thus depend on topography rainfall type and the climatic factors of the day nevertheless one should consider only near real time spps with short latency for flood forecasting applications credit authorship contribution statement yeboah gyasi agyei conceptualization data curation formal analysis

2921,rain gauge networks are not adequate to capture the complex spatial structure of rainfall for meaningful urban flood studies while radar and satellite precipitation products spps are being developed to alleviate the limitations of rain gauge networks they need to be evaluated for regional applications this study compared radar against 3 spps of imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation and persiann ccs precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system that have sub daily records for southeast queensland australia based on the spatial structure identified through the structural similarity index ssi and two dimensional correlogram at the daily timescale the spps were downscaled to 1 km 1 km grid resolution to conform with the radar dataset using inverse distance weighting and bilinear interpolation all three spps that are freely available reflected very well the similarity 90 in the spatial pattern with that of the radar although imerg was marginally better however mswep appeared to be the closest to the gauge dataset better than even the expensive radar dataset stemming from its much better similarity in the mean similarity statistic nevertheless there could be some atmospheric climatic factors that may cause one to select one spp over the others for a given wet day and this needs to be explored for the possibility of selecting different spps for different wet days keywords rainfall precipitation satellite radar spatial structure rain gauge networks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall is considered as a natural phenomenon that is characterised by high spatial and temporal variability at the same time rainfall controls environmental processes and is key to agriculture industry and human habitat thus the spatial heterogeneity in rainfall should be captured for a plethora of studies including floods and droughts however rain gauge stations are normally installed in densely populated areas particularly in coastal regions li and shao 2010 and complete records are rarely available due to problems such as topography accessibility and equipment malfunction villarini et al 2008 aguilera et al 2020 kidd et al 2017 it is an accepted fact that rain gauge network density is not enough to capture the intrinsic heterogeneity in rainfall even within the developed world gyasi agyei 2020 maier et al 2020 also rain gauges sample a small area 200 mm in diameter and are irregularly spaced making it difficult to extrapolate to several km2 without introducing undue uncertainty huff 1970 radar rainfall technology is being used to improve the understanding of the spatial structure but it has its own problems stemming from the algorithms used in the conversion of reflectivity to rainfall the nature of the topography and signal attenuation among others e g krajewski et al 2010 also radar technology is cost prohibitive particularly for developing countries and very few countries can afford full coverage over their air space the past two decades have seen development of satellite derived precipitation products that cover nearly the whole world thus helping to address the inadequacy of rain gauge networks examples of satellite precipitation products spps are tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 2020 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2019 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 and climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 as with radar datasets spps also have their problems a major one being the dependence of rainfall rate on the cloud top properties and path integrated hydrometeor content janowiak et al 2001 huffman et al 2007 while most of the available radars and spps have been bias corrected using some rain gauge data it is important to also evaluate them for specific regions before their usage most of the studies on the comparison or evaluation of spps are carried out at coarse spatial and temporal scales comparing tmpa 3b43 with gridded rain gauge data sets at the monthly and 0 25 25 km temporal and spatial scales respectively fleming et al 2011 recommended using this product for climate studies in australia particularly for the austral summer daily and monthly 1 100 km spatial resolution values of trmm 3b43 and 3b42 products were compared with gridded global

environment and science silo https www longpaddock qld gov au silo gauge based gridded daily rainfall dataset over the whole of australia using a grid size of 0 50 50 km from their analysis imerg emerged as the best satellite precipitation product spp guo and liu 2016 evaluated versions of trmm products at daily monthly and annual temporal scales and at 0 25o 2 km and 1 100 km grid resolutions and also at the basin scale they observed that in general the performance of the spps improved with increasing spatial scale logah et al 2021 evaluated five spps over the black volta basin of west africa their analysis was based on point comparison of collocated spps values with the gauge data and did not involve evaluation of the rainfall spatial structure bulovic et al 2020 evaluated imerg at 30 min temporal resolution over the tropical andes mountainous setting using 15 rain gauges located within 1 grid of size 0 1 by 0 1 they observed that imerg generally underestimated rainfall depths asong et al 2017 also evaluated imerg over southern canada at the grid scale and at the 6 hourly daily and monthly timescales other researchers have used spps in hydrological applications examples include li et al 2015 who used spps for real time flood forecasting xue et al 2013 for streamflow simulation and brunetti et al 2018 for landslide forecasting the objective of this study was to select the best of the freely available spps for southeast queensland australia by comparing them with an expensive radar rainfall product at the daily and 1 km grid temporal and spatial scales respectively of particular interest were those spps that have sub daily records that could be used for urban flood studies imerg mswep and persiann ccs persiann cloud classification system spps met the sub daily temporal scale requirements and were downscaled to a 1 km grid to conform with the 1 km resolution of the radar dataset the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the study area and the datasets used this is followed by the methodology in section 3 section 4 presents the results and discussion before concluding in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the same as used in gyasi agyei 2020 noting that part of this area was also used previously in gyasi agyei 2016 2018 2019 it is the landfall area of the mt stapylton weather radar station in southeast queensland which covers an area of 28 371 km2 with its centroid located at 476 8 km easting and 6921 4 northing fig 1 left panel the radar station is managed by the australian bureau of meteorology

australia geoscience gallant et al 2009 https ecat ga gov au geonetwork srv eng catalog search metadata 69888 was aggregated by a factor of 11 to obtain a 33 arc second 990 m grid and the coordinates were transformed from longitude and latitude system to eastings m and northings m system then the inverse distance weighting idw method with 4 nearest neighbours was used to interpolate the 33 arc second 990 m grid to the 1 km grid centres of the radar data discussed in the next section to generate the dem shown in fig 1 right panel as observed from the dem the study area is characterised by a very complex terrain stretching from the coastline elevation 0 m to the hilly areas in the southwest direction that reaches 1300 m the study area is in a subtropical region and the climate is classified as temperate without dry season and hot summer summer temperatures can occasionally exceed 29 c but the average temperature is about 26 5 c summer months from december to march are generally wet and thunderstorms are common contributing to the majority of the average annual rainfall of 990 mm july to september experience low rainfall with monthly averages less than 40 mm 2 2 daily rainfall gauge and radar data the mt stapylton radar data from 2009 to 01 01 to 2015 06 30 has a spatial grid size of 1 km 1 km and of 6 min temporal resolution the radar is a 1500 s band doppler type located at 523 8 km easting and 6934 km northing shown as r in fig 1 left panel a z r power law relationship with different constants for convective and stratiform rainfall was used to convert the reflectivity z measurements into a rainfall intensity r mm h and processed to 6 min temporal scale accumulation depth the radar rainfall data have been adjusted using some rain gauge datasets within the range of the radar https www bom gov au australia radar about calculating rainfall accumulations shtml and commercially available there are 324 rainfall gauges located within the study area also managed by the australian bureau of meteorology since the data analysis was carried out on the radar spatial grid each rain gauge was assigned to the nearest grid centre and multiple rain gauges within the same grid were averaged thus the number of grid centres with a rain gauge station was reduced to 315 fig 1 left panel giving an average inter gauge distance of 9 5 km to be on the same temporal resolution as the daily rain gauge data the radar data were aggregated from 9am to 9am the queensland department of environment and science https www longpaddock qld gov au silo has infilled the missing records within the daily rainfall data and the complete records were used collocated data sets refer to the radar grid cells data at the 315 rain gauge locations 2 3 satellite precipitation products spps three spps imerg mswep persiann ccs covering the study area for the period of the radar records were used imerg precipitation satellite data is a product of the gpm mission which is an extension of trmm the gpm 3imerghh 06 product has a temporal resolution of 0 5 h and a spatial precision of 0 1 x 0 1 10 km 10 km and available from 2000 to 06 01 to date https disc gsfc

reanalyses data sources include the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf interim reanalysis era interim and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 this dataset is hosted by princeton climate analytics persiann ccs is the third spp it uses pattern recognition and computer image processing techniques to classify clouds and estimate precipitation based on satellite images this product developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine has a spatial precision of 0 04 0 04 4 km 4 km a temporal resolution of 1 h and is available from 2003 03 01 to date https chrsdata eng uci edu only the persiann ccs satellite product of the three is not bias corrected using observed gauged data the rain gauge data used for this study are in the public domain so there is a significant overlap with those used to bias correct the radar and the spps for example the data overlap with those used by mswep is over 80 h beck personal communication 16 december 2021 the idw method with 4 nearest neighbours was used to interpolate the imerg and mswep datasets to a 10 km 10 km regular grid and the persiann ccs dataset to a 4 km 4 km regular grid i e to their nearest integer km these outputs were further disaggregated to a 1 km 1 km grid to conform with the radar dataset using bilinear interpolation the 10 km grid centres of the radar aggregation from the 1 km 1 km original data do not conform to the 0 1 10 km grid centres of the spps datasets after the conversion of the longitude and latitude coordinate system to the eastings and northings system therefore there was a need to standardise the grid centres of the spps to that of the radar note that the spatial disaggregation of the 10 km grid centres maps to the 1 km grid centres of the radar data used for the analysis allowing the radar and spps to be compared using the same 1 km 1 km grid centres using only 4 closest neighbours for the idw ensures that each is not more than 10 km from the central grid of interest also the sub daily satellite data were subjected to temporal aggregation into daily timescale of the rain gauge data in all 626 wet days having gauge radar imerg and mswep data were considered only 480 out of the 626 wet days 76 7 have persiann ccs data 3 methodology the radar and the spps were evaluated and compared based on two spatial structure concepts structural similarity and correlogram the spatial pattern can be assessed visually from rainfield maps but quantitative measures are required in order to eliminate subjectivity also the spatial scale has a role to play in identifying the spatial heterogeneity which decreases as the spatial scale increases the intrinsic property of spatial correlation or dependence of the neighbouring grid cells of rainfall needs to be captured in identifying the spatial structure 3 1 structural similarity index ssi the structural similarity index ssi was originally developed in computer science for assessing the quality of image compression wang et al 2004 jones et al 2016 enhanced the ssi by incorporating uncertainty from the underlying spatial models and also corrected edge effects a moving local window of spatial extent was used to calculate independent statistics relating to local similarity in the local mean variance and spatial covariance between a pair of rainfields under comparison this concept was used to compare the daily rainfields from the gauge collocated and full radar and the spps one condition is that the two rainfields should be compared on the same regular grid let n be the size of the n n window total number of cells being n2 of the neighbouring grid cell centred on grid cell k noting that n takes only odd integers with a minimum value of 3 it is assumed that the n n neighbours have equal weights the sum of the weights being unity the n 2 cells with the local moving window were used to calculate the local means μ k and variances σ k 2 for each rainfield as 1 μ k i 1 n 2 m i r i 2 σ k 2 i 1 n 2 m i r i μ k 2 where mi and ri are the weights and rainfall amounts of the grid cells within the local window k being the central cell the local means and variances of the two rainfields were then used to develop the covariance c k between the two rainfields as 3 c k i 1 n 2 m i r i a μ k a r i b μ k b where subscripts a and b refer to the two different rainfields being compared ssi statistics representing similarity in spatial mean simk variance sivk and pattern sipk of the local measures were next computed as 4 si m k 2 μ k a μ k

stability in cases where the denominators are close to zero be estimated from the range r defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum rainfall amounts of the rainfields being compared as c1 0 01r 2 c2 0 03r 2 and c3 c2 2 values of eqns 4 6 were used to estimate the overall measure of similarity ssim for each grid cell as a product of the multiplication of sim siv and sip given as 7 ssi m k s i m k s i v k s i p k the ssim value ranges between 1 complete similarity and 1 complete dissimilarity for the pair of rainfields being compared sim and siv have values between 0 one has high values and the other low values and 1 complete similarity it is difficult to visualise the differences between the spatial pattern of two rainfields this difficulty is alleviated by the sip since its value towards 1 indicates significant differences in the spatial pattern with the low and high values occurring in different areas sip values close to 1 are an indication of close similarity in spatial pattern the low and high values occurring in similar areas overall single value statistics were obtained by taking the mean of simk sivk sipk and ssimk over all the 28 371 of the 1 km 1 km grid cells of the study region and designated simply as sim siv sip and ssim thus ssim offers an opportunity to examine rainfields for structural similarity by calculating a single value over the pair of rainfields being compared fine scale differences are smoothed out as the neighbourhood window size increases starting from 3 by 3 grid cells the reflection algorithm presented by jones et al 2016 to correct edge effects was implemented it generates artificial buffers around the study region in order to preserve the spatial extent of the map rainfield comparison values of the reflected grid cells within the buffer zone are computed using values of the neighbouring grids sensitivity analysis of the window size was carried out by n taking on values within the set of 3 5 7 9 and 11 setting the upper limit of n to just above the maximum spatial scale 10 km of the original spps the ssi indices were calculated for each window size independently for the pair of rainfields being compared rainfields were generated for the gauges and collocated radar datasets each gauge was assigned to the nearest 1 km 1 km grid of the study region and the remaining cells were assigned na not available interpretation of missing values in r programming language values for each window only real values were used in the calculations discarding windows having less than 2 real valued grid cells these settings allowed comparison of the gauged data with the radar and the satellite rainfields 3 2 correlogram correlogram estimation follows the methodology presented in gyasi agyei and pegram 2014 and gyasi agyei 2020 2016 it involves determination of the daily rainfall correlogram spatial structure in the gaussian domain suited for kriging interpolation hence the first step is to transform the daily data greater than zero into gaussian n 0 1 quantiles using one of the standard two parameter right skewed distributions weibull kappa gamma gumbel generalized pareto log logistic log normal based on the anderson darling statistic the dry zero rainfall amounts were assigned values depending on their distance from a wet gauge given as 8 r s k r 0 1 exp d sk d where sk is the dry grid cell k located at a distance of d sk from a wet grid d is the average over all dry grids and 0 1 is the minimum daily rainfall amount given po as the proportion of dry grids for the day the gaussian quantiles w sk were expressed as 9 w s k φ 1 f r r s k 1 p 0 p 0 r s k 0 1 φ 1 p 0 exp d s k d r s k 0 1 where n 0 1 is represented as φ with its inverse as φ 1 and f r is the fitted marginal distribution to the wet rainfall amounts φ 1 equation 9 is inverted to yield rainfall amounts from the gaussian quantiles as 10 r s k f r 1 φ w s k p 0 1 p 0 φ w s k p 0 0 φ w s k p 0 the empirical correlogram first introduced by yao and journel 1998 is developed from the gaussian quantiles as 11 r x y 1 n h k 1 n h w s k w s k h m 0 m h s k s k h h x 1 y 1 where and y are the easting and northern direction separation distances km respectively from the origin 0 0 of the empirical correlogram r x y the correlogram value at the grid point x y includes pair grid locations at separation

respectively a two dimensional 2d exponential model that gives analytical elliptical contours is fitted to the empirical data of eqn 11 as 12 r θ x y r θ u v exp u l u 2 v l v 2 1 2 u y sin θ x cos θ v y cos θ x sin θ in eqn 12 v and u are the separation distances in the direction of the minor and major axes respectively along an elliptical contour and and y are as defined in eqn 11 lv and lu are the minor and major axis lengths respectively lv lu is the anisotropy ratio η and θ is the angle between the major axis and the horizontal direction measured anticlockwise the three parameters of the 2d exponential model lv lu θ were optimised to match the empirical and the analytical elliptical correlogram contours fig 2 explains the notations used in eqn 12 for example parameters of lu 30 km lv 21 km and θ 70 contours of correlations of 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 are also displayed the 2d correlogram parameters were estimated separately for the gauge collocated radar radar imerg mswep and persiann ccs datasets for each wet day following gyasi agyei 2020 the 6 different sources of the 2d correlogram parameters were used in ordinary kriging ly et al 2011 cressie 1993 to perform leave one out cross validation loocv for the gauge and collocated datasets with the r package gstat pebesma 2004 in loocv prediction of each grid cell data with its standard deviation is made one at a time using the remaining grid cell data points for the ordinary kriging interpolation note that normal scores standard normal quantiles were used in the loocv and the results were converted into rainfall amounts using eqn 10 the following performance statistics were used to evaluate the performance of the 6 different sources of the 2d correlogram root mean square error rmse 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n v o i v p i 2 mean absolute bias mab 14 mab 1 n i 1 n v o i v p i and mean bias mb 15 mb 1 n i 1 n v o i v p i where the observed and predicted values for the ith data point are respectively vo i and vp i and n is the number of data points another very important statistic is the standard deviation sd that is estimated with the mean m in the gaussian domain by ordinary kriging sd defines the uncertainty associated with the kriging estimates and the higher the sd value the higher the errors at the interpolated location the 95 prediction limits pl in the gaussian domain were estimated as 16 pl 0 975 m 1 96 s d pl 0 025 m 1 96 s d which were converted into rainfall amounts using eqn 10 as r0 025 and r0 0975 the difference of these values pd95 r0 0975 r0 025 and the sd were averaged over all data points for a given wet day and used in the performance evaluation presented in the next section 4 results and discussion because radar data is expensive and only available in a few countries including australia for a limited selection of regions while satellite precipitation rainfall covers nearly the whole world we searched for the best spp that is closest to the radar precipitation dataset in terms of the spatial structure it is well known that radar rainfall varies very much with range thus there is lack of homogeneity the spatial structure was identified through the structural similarity index ssi and the correlogram required for kriging interpolation 4 1 structural similarity index ssi the ssi indices of a pair of radar and spps at the 1 km 1 km spatial scale are compared in fig 3 for 3 different window sizes 3 7 and 11 km the points are values for individual wet day data and the solid lines are lines of perfect agreement also demarcated in fig 3 are the 5 quantiles that 95 of the data are greater than a moving window size of 11 km is closest to the maximum spatial scale of the original imerg and mswep spps all the similarity indices are positive indicating similarity across all the datasets it is observed that the spread of the data points along the line of perfect match increases with the moving window size and is more widespread towards the centre of the data range indicating loss of similarity with moving window size which is more apparent in the siv and sip statistics for the siv and sip the range of values were 0 65 to 1 for n 3 and 0 4 to 1 for n 11 this demonstrates that the variance and spatial pattern of the spps are similar to those of the radar and it is the mean statistic that exhibits a high degree of disparity between 0 and 1 the disparity in the mean is reflected in the overall similarity of ssim however positive values of the overall similarity are an indication of spatial structure of the different data sources resembling each other jones et al 2016 to get a sense of overall similarity indices the values were averaged over all wet days for a pair of rainfields comparison statistics in fig 4 shown in fig 4 are the results comparing radar with the collocated rd cl gauge rd ga imerg rd im mswep rd ms and persiann ccs rd ps datasets collocated data results are presented for comparison and as expected have an over 0 96 mean similarity index not shown in fig 4 to improve readability of the other lines that have smaller values comparing with the full radar followed by gauge data with a mean similarity index over 0 54 both imerg and mswep have very good mean similarity indices of over 0 52 although the mean similarity index between the radar and persiann ccs is around 0 48 it is still considered to be satisfactory this is not surprising as it is only the persiann ccs spp that is not bias corrected with rain gauge data in terms of the variance similarity index the gauge and imerg performed closely having an siv value of nearly 0 9 at the 3 km moving window size and a slight decline as the moving window size increased mswep yielded the least values of siv slightly above 0 5 though this can still be considered as good while there is no clear set threshold value for classifying the ssi indices as good one may consider above 0 25 as satisfactory above 0 5 as good and above 0 75 as excellent however the essence is to select an spp with the highest similarity index value all three spps reflect very well the similarity in spatial pattern with that of the radar with values of sip in excess of 0 9 at the moving window size of 3 km although imerg is marginally better the spps outperforming both the collocated and gauges in terms of the spatial pattern similarity is expected as the number of gauges is far below the optimum value to reflect the spatial pattern gyasi agyei 2020 girons lopez et al 2015 villarini et al 2008 combining the mean variance and pattern similarity indices the overall similarity of ssim identified imerg as the best alternative to the radar dataset followed by mswep and then persiann ccs however the similarity of all three spps to the radar data is quite good a similar analysis was carried out comparing the gauge dataset and all the other datasets as presented in fig 5 mswep emerged as the closest to the gauge dataset in terms of the similarity in the mean and variance but slightly lower than imerg and persiann ccs in terms of the similarity in the spatial pattern considering the overall similarity ssim mswep appears to be the closest to the gauge dataset than even the radar dataset stemming from its much better similarity in the mean similarity statistic this is not surprising as mswep has been bias corrected using over 80 of the rain gauges in the study area beck et al 2019 have indicated that mswep tends to exhibit better performance than other precipitation products in both densely gauged and ungauged regions however prakash 2019 found chirps and tmpa to be better than mswep when evaluating spps over india at the monthly timescale it is interesting to note that persiann ccs is marginally better than the gridded datasets in terms of sip with the gauges it seems that adjustments of the radar and spps with gauged data significantly improves the mean and variance similarity but may cause some reduction in the spatial pattern similarity this may be a plausible reason for the persiann ccs being the best in terms of the spatial pattern similarity but the worst in terms of the other similarity indices because it is not gauge adjusted table 1 presents the rates of change for each line in figs 4 and 5 it indicates that the rates of change as a result of increasing the moving window size from 3 km to 11 km is very small for the mean similarity average 2 43 followed by the variance similarity and then the spatial pattern similarity the average decline in the overall similarity is about 23 the over 0 65 value for sip similarity indicates that the high and low rainfall in the locations are captured by the different products this means that with an appropriate bias correction method any of the spps could be adopted in lieu of the expensive radar dataset the ssi is ideal for comparing several sources of rainfall data that exhibit spatial heterogeneity its application is quite simple and easy to implement most importantly it allows comparison of local mean variance and covariances between two sources of rainfall data increasing the spatial scale window size causes the fine scale spatial difference to disappear as a result of the smoothing effect causing reductions in the variance and spatial pattern as observed in figs 4 and 5 varying the local neighbourhood size within the limits of the original data sources wu 2004 jones et al 2016 helps to alleviate the effect of the different spatial scale of the data sources islam et al 2020 used the ssi methodology to compare and evaluate five spps over the whole of australia but at a much coarser scale of 0 5 50 km they identified imerg as the best among the five spps as has also been the case for our analysis but they did not include mswep and persiann ccs in their study our objective was to identify spps that generate sub daily rainfall records and at the 1 km grid spatial scale for urban flood modelling given the very high values of sip the spps could be used to define the correlogram spatial structure required by kriging interpolation methods for generating rainfields conditioned on the limited gauge data that represent the true rainfall for a given day gyasi agyei 2018 4 2 correlogram the major axis lengths of the correlograms generated by the different products for the wet days are compared in fig 6 points under the line of perfect agreement indicate that the variable on the vertical axis underestimates the major axis length compared with the horizontal axis variable in general the gauge and collocated data sources underestimate the major axis length and also the minor axis length given the over 0 91 correlation between the correlogram axis lengths in comparison with the radar gyasi agyei 2018 and satellite products pairs of radar and satellite data sources display nearly equal under and over estimation of the correlogram axis lengths in comparison with each other the poor correlation between the correlogram axis lengths generated by the different products is an indication that they may each yield different spatial structures for a given wet day an implication is that one product may be preferred over the others to represent the spatial structure of a given wet day that have limited number of rain gauges over the region of interest boxplots of some performance statistics of the loocv of the gauge and collocated datasets using the 2d correlograms derived from the different products are shown in fig 7 overlapping of the notches of the boxplots is an indication that the medians do not differ much for sd imerg and mswep recorded the lowest values and their medians are similar even though imerg values are more spread out compared with the mswep values both imerg and mswep seem to perform slightly better than the radar the radar being better than the persiann ccs though in terms of sd the radar and satellite products performed better than the gauge and the collocated datasets these observations are also true for the 95 prediction range pd95 which relies on the values of sd the boxplots of rmse of the products are similar to each other with the exception of persian ccs that yielded the highest values mab and mb performance statistics not shown here displayed similar trends as rmse the high values of rmse and extent of spread for all products could be attributed to the fact each product may not provide an adequate spatial structure for all wet days hence there is a need to screen the products for the best outcome for each wet day meaning each wet day may be represented by a different product for a better understanding of the variability of the performance statistics over the rainfall products ranks were used in lieu of the actual values for each wet day the performance statistics of the gauge radar and the spps values were ranked from 1 the lowest value and the best to 5 the highest and the worst tie values were given the lowest rank number in order to have integer ranks only this was repeated for the group but with gauge replaced with collocated table 2 shows the distribution of the number of wet days each product achieved a particular rank for sd and rmse performance statistics imerg recorded the highest number of rank 1 for sd and rmse followed by radar radar before mswep for the gauge predictions for the collocated predictions imerg recorded the most rank 1 outcomes followed by mswep and then radar for sd the gauge gauge ga in fig 7 and collocated colloc co in fig 7 correlograms performed poorly with respect to sd but yielded better results in terms of rmse weighted averages of the ranks were calculated for overall assessment as presented in table 3 for all the performance statistics from table 3 pd95 is a reflection of sd and so is mab of rmse because they have the same overall rankings this is also true for mb and rmse particularly for the collocated predictions it is interesting to observe that imerg and mswep are marginally better than radar in terms of sd for both gauge and collocated prediction and also for rmse for the collocated predictions persiann ccs is the poorest performer of the gridded products although it yielded better results for sd compared with the gauge and collocated spatial structures because the rmse does not vary very much over the data sources it is better to use sd for screening the products even the gauge and collocated spatial structures predicted marginally better than the gridded products for rmse in general both imerg and mswep could be used in lieu of radar the worst performance by persiann ccs could be due to the fact that it is the only product that is not bias corrected using rain gauge data as pointed out by gyasi agyei 2018 a correlogram data source that yields smaller sd values is preferred because the uncertainty associated with conditional simulations through kriging is reduced this means multiple simulation of rainfields to be used for urban flood studies with the same correlogram will look similar hence imerg or mswep products could be used to augment gauge rainfall records for hydrological modelling and analysis at fine temporal and spatial scales both approaches for the comparison and evaluation of the radar and spps yielded similar outcomes imerg combines information from both pmw passive microwave and ir infrared data from the satellite constellation operated by gpm and rainfall estimates are adjusted using monthly gauge data the final run version evaluated has latency of about 3 5 months and it is a significant improvement over the early and late run versions that have latency of about 4 h and 14 h respectively mswep merges several satellites with pmw and ir information gauge over 80 overlap with the gauge data used and reanalysis products therefore it is expected to outperform the other spps and the radar in comparison with the gauged data particularly the mean and variance similarity while the gauge adjustment improves the mean and variance similarity the spatial pattern similarity seems to be somehow degraded compared to the other spps persiann ccs is a near real time latency 1 h product using ir imagery from global geosynchronous satellites to estimate rainfall without gauge adjustment hence it is not expected to outperform the other spps however it has demonstrated its ability to better capture the spatial pattern similarity very well compared to the other spps 4 3 selection of satellite precipitation products for hydrological applications the main goal of this paper was to evaluate three spps against the expensive radar dataset not necessarily comparing the spps against each other to demonstrate the methodology for comparing two rainfields however the methodology could be used to screen several spps for a given region if the hydrological application does not require near real time data such as drought and flood modelling any available spps could be evaluated for use note that the quality of the short latency near real time spps could be lower than the long latency research quality products but for real time flood forecasting applications one should select spps that give near real time dataset with a short latency such as he hydro estimator satellite https www ospo noaa gov products atmosphere ghe latency 15 30 min and pdir now persiann dynamic infrared rain rate https chrsdata eng uci edu latency 15 60 min comparing ssps of different latency is not uncommon but it all depends on the hydrological application for example the six ssps compared by tan and santo 2018 with different latency were imerg early run 4h imerg late run 14 h imerg final run 3 5 months tmpa 3b42 2 months tmpa 3b42rt 8h and persiann cdr 3 months 5 concluding remarks this paper evaluates 3 freely available spps satellite precipitation products of imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation and persiann ccs precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system against the expensive radar precipitation dataset from the mt stapylton station southeast queensland australia the spps have different spatial resolutions but they were downscaled to 1 km grids to conform with the 1 km grid centres of the radar dataset using inverse distance weighting and bilinear interpolation methods interpolating the spps from 0 1 and 0 04 grids to 10 km and 4 km grids respectively and then to 1 km grids introduces additional uncertainties despite using only 4 nearest grid neighbours the introduced uncertainties could vary across the spps due to the different pmw and ir sensors and retrieval algorithms employed and also be exacerbated by the complex terrain consisting of land coast and ocean land uses each rain gauge station was assigned to a radar grid centre and grid centres with more than 1 rain gauge were averaged most studies on evaluation of spps are carried out at monthly and coarse spatial scales such as 0 25 and 1 grids e g chokngamwong and chiu 2008 fleming et al 2011 logah et al 2021 but our interest is in daily temporal and 1 km grid spatial scales of prime importance of this study was to capture the spatial structure of rainfall at the daily and fine spatial scale hence two approaches that describe the spatial structure of rainfall were used to evaluate and compare the expensive radar dataset and the three spps that also have sub daily records the first approach is the structural similarity index ssi that has been developed for image compression wang et al 2004 it uses a moving window of size selected to conform to the spatial scale of the original datasets i e 3 km to 11 km ssi offers an opportunity to compute single value similarity in the mean variance spatial pattern and an overall index for a pair of rainfields being compared the second approach is based on estimation of a 2d correlogram in the gaussian domain that is used in loocv kriging interpolation gyasi agyei 2020 2016 performance statistics of root mean square error rmse mean absolute bias mab mean bias mb standard deviation sd and 95 prediction range pd95 were used to evaluate the different rainfall data sources all the ssi indices were positive which were the first indication that there is similarity among the different rainfall products with the indices for variance and spatial pattern declining as the window size increased ssi identified imerg as the satellite product that is closest to the radar dataset with mswep not far behind and persiann ccs having the least resemblance to radar but still considered reasonable in comparison with the gauge data mswep emerged as the best product even marginally better than the radar dataset because persiann ccs is not bias corrected with gauge data it performed poorly with respect to the mean similarity but was marginally better with respect to similarity in spatial pattern therefore persiann ccs could be improved with an appropriate bias correction with local gauge data the gauge and collocated data sources yielded lower values of axis lengths of the correlogram compared with the radar and satellite products an implication of this is that the gauge and collocated correlogram will yield higher values of sd when used for kriging interpolation as reported imerg and mswep yielded the lowest values of the sd performance statistic and thus they are preferred over even the expensive radar dataset however the radar performed better than persiann ccs with regard to the sd performance statistic rmse performance statistics could not differentiate between the different products it is observed that sd is a better discriminating performance statistic than rmse mab and mb as pointed out in gyasi agyei 2018 this is particularly so when the objective is to simulate similar multiple rainfields using the same correlogram for urban flood studies in the end both approaches for the comparison of the radar dataset against the spps have yielded similar outcomes as the results show any of the three satellite precipitation datasets could be used with some form of bias correction as a source of correlograms for gauge rainfall data interpolation for hydrological modelling and analysis at fine temporal and spatial scales within the study area while the spps have performed comparatively well against the radar dataset there could be some atmospheric climatic factors that may preference one spp over the others for a given wet day and this needs to be explored to take advantage of using multiple spp combinations in a clever manner there are differences in the techniques algorithms and observational satellite sensors infrared and or passive microwave employed by each spp therefore the sources of errors of the spps are not the same the skills of the spps may thus depend on topography rainfall type and the climatic factors of the day nevertheless one should consider only near real time spps with short latency for flood forecasting applications credit authorship contribution statement yeboah gyasi agyei conceptualization data curation formal analysis

2922,in the current era of rapid environmental changes more rivers are projected to dry up and transition to disconnected systems in unprecedented duration and frequency however river groundwater interactions including connectivity remain a challenge to characterize especially for managed ephemeral rivers such as the lower rio grande in southern new mexico where conjunctive use for irrigated agriculture is prevalent this investigation used a noninvasive and spatially distributed geophysical method for mapping the disconnection connection of groundwater with the rio grande river which has been validated with ancillary data that includes river flow water levels in the river and adjacent wells and river and groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity time lapse monitoring of electrical resistivity before during and after the river flooding season was used to characterize the transient and spatial connectivity of the water table with the rio grande from disconnection to connection and back to disconnection the relationships between electrical conductivity from the geophysical analysis versus the large array of ancillary data helped to narrow down the driver of observed temporal changes in connectivity after the transition from disconnection to connection the results convey that water temperature is potentially the main influence on the changing electrical conductivity after the connectivity transition the surface water temperature showed a direct and strong correlation to the electrical conductivity of shallow sediments which was similar to the river stage groundwater elevation drivers of infiltration time lapse electrical resistivity can be used to monitor river groundwater connectivity throughout the intermittency cycle due to its sensitivity to changes in both water saturation and temperature keywords electrical resistivity intermittent non perennial ephemeral stream disconnected groundwater rio grande data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river groundwater interactions are often ignored in hydrological measurements winter et al 1998 even though they are critical for understanding issues of water quality and quantity findlay 1995 banks et al 2011 harvey and gooseff 2015 brunner et al 2017 ikard et al 2021 interest in characterizing and monitoring these interactions has significantly increased over the last few decades because it is now known that the spatial distribution of infiltration and seepage through a surface water source depends on the state of connection brunner et al 2009a 2009b fuchs et al 2019 which can be paramount to understanding biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and pollutants within the hyporheic zone e g findlay 1995 shabaga and hill 2010 krause et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 some rivers oscillate between a gaining and losing system wroblicky et al 1998 and a single stream can be comprised of both gaining and losing stretches a system is connected when the area beneath a riverbed is fully saturated with groundwater and disconnected when the river and groundwater are separated by an unsaturated portion of soil sediment or another divider such as a lower permeability clogging layer fuchs et al 2019 the differentiation and transition between these depend on the hydraulic head of both the river and groundwater which drives the hydraulic gradient direction when predicting the impacts of groundwater development on surface water resources the river and groundwater in gaining systems are typically assumed to be fully connected losing systems are also typically assumed to be fully connected brunner et al 2011 fuchs et al 2019 this over simplification of riverbed connectivity can amount to significant error in water volume quantification over long river reaches singha et al 2008 irvine et al 2012 fuchs et al 2018 measurements of connectivity have shown spatial variability with some locations connected and others disconnected along the length of a reach fuchs et al 2019 models have also shown the possibility of partial connection or disconnection between rivers and groundwater e g irvine et al 2012 where the connected part of the river and underlying groundwater would be spatially variable due to groundwater mounding local recharge or riverbed conformation specific locations of partial connection of stretches of water are often unknown due to challenges in monitoring and characterization the uncertainty in the state of river groundwater connectivity affirms the need for improved techniques to verify the state of connection that exhibits spatial and temporal complexities sophocleous 2002 brunner et al 2011 fuchs et al 2019 however the geological hydrological and biogeochemical heterogeneity in the surface water groundwater interface makes it difficult to characterize with only direct observation techniques which are generally spatially discontinuous and data limited yeh et al 2015 mclachlan et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021a brunner et al 2009a further emphasize that many more documented field studies are required to demonstrate ways in which the transition to disconnection can be quantified in practice and that the development of field techniques to identify disconnection remains one of the most significant practical challenges for the field of surface water and groundwater investigation hammond et al 2021 and zipper et al 2021 both confirmed that aridity is a primary driver of non perennial flow occurrences and global climate change is predicted to enhance the severity and extent of drought in many regions around the world with hotspots of significant drying that include the southwest united states of america u s cook et al 2020 this has been realized recently with the greatest 20 year period 2001 2020 of wet east to dry west aridity spatial gradient in the last 600 years bishop et al 2021 many basins are predicted to have increased future water shortages associated with the combined effects of population growth and climate change in the u s heidari et al 2021 which could further decrease river flows and increase intermittency in the u s and around the globe even though intermittent and ephemeral streams and rivers are some of the most common and dynamic of hydrologic systems that occur on every continent and contribute 50 of the world s river network and discharge gutiérrez jurado et al 2019 messager et al 2021 hammond et al 2021 price et al 2021 there is a general lack of information on river groundwater connectivity especially for systems that experience intermittent and or ephemeral connectivity since most intermittent systems are commonly ungauged there is typically a lack of characterization and monitoring data which has limited the advancement of our understanding of the processes and controls impacting river groundwater interactions constantz et al 2008 shanafield and cook 2014 gutiérrez jurado et al 2019 shanafield et al 2020 even when a state of connection or disconnection between surface water and groundwater is known the temporal and spatial distribution of that connection is often still unknown geophysics includes noninvasive indirect methods for investigating the subsurface and has been increasingly used to characterize subsurface property spatial and temporal variability with supporting ground truth or validation data geophysics is an effective tool for characterizing numerous hydrogeologic properties and parameters crook et al 2008 mclachlan et al 2017 the use of geophysics has an advantage over other direct measurement methods for mapping partial disconnection for example it offers large scale spatially distributed imaging is noninvasive and is able to image the subsurface from the land surface rucker 2009 mclachlan et al 2017 the qualities of geophysical characterization approaches are unlike piezometer drilling groundwater well installation and other direct observation techniques that may be limited by environmental protection or unfavorable site conditions mclachlan et al 2017 electrical resistivity tomography ert is an accomplished geophysical method to map river groundwater interactions since changes in water content can impact resistivity measurements e g acworth and dasey 2003 mansoor and slater 2007 nyquist et al 2008 singha et al 2008 ward et al 2010 karan et al 2013 rucker et al 2021 whereas other impacts on resistivity measurements need to also be considered as another approach callegary et al 2007 also used frequency domain electromagnetic induction to map the relative amount of fine textured material in the subsurface and support ephemeral recharge estimation more recently shanafield et al 2020 used electromagnetic conductivity to survey intermittent stream infiltration mclachlan et al 2020 recently applied electrical resistivity time lapse monitoring of river groundwater interactions in a chalk river which was effective for characterization of transient interactions including up and down welling exchanges koehn et al 2019 2020 also recently used time lapse electrical resistivity monitoring along three sites on the arkansas river to demonstrate potential areas of river groundwater interactions however this characterization method has not previously been fully developed for monitoring intermittency transitions of ephemeral streams and rivers from disconnection to connection clearly there are large gaps in knowledge in connectivity transitions of intermittent and ephemeral streams and rivers and deeper understanding would be critical to sustainable river management harvey and gooseff 2015 the objective of this paper is to develop a river groundwater connectivity monitoring approach using a time lapse ert monitoring survey over a period of one year along an ephemeral portion of the lower rio grande in southern new mexico to investigate the variability of temporal and spatial river groundwater connectivity throughout the 2020 river flooding season a secondary objective is to demonstrate that connectivity occurs rapidly between measurement cycles and that changes in bulk resistivity impacting geophysical monitoring are attributable to changes in river and groundwater parameters such as temperature and water levels this study provides a framework for detailed monitoring of intermittent ephemeral streams undergoing a range of river groundwater connectivity changes 2 site description the rio grande flows from north to south through new mexico u s and along the border with mexico following the rio grande rift the lower rio grande is part of and recharges into the mesilla basin conejos médanos mesilla basin aquifer system hawley et al 2001 hawley and lozinsky 1992 teeple 2017 robertson et al 2022 and the reach studied herein is under the jurisdiction of the u s international boundary and water commission ibwc as part of the canalization project within the u s bureau of reclamation rio grande project the new mexico portion of the rio grande project features the elephant butte irrigation district ebid which is the largest irrigated agricultural producer in the region fuchs et al 2018 the mesilla basin aquifer system is the main source of water for agricultural industrial and municipal use in el paso texas las cruces new mexico and ciudad juárez chihuahua mexico and is at the center of ongoing adjudication over the apportionment of flows of the rio grande between new mexico and texas robertson et al 2022 the particular cross section of the rio grande studied in this project is outside of mesquite new mexico seen in fig 1 adapted from teeple 2017 and downstream from the mesilla caballo and elephant butte dams as well as the city of las cruces new mexico field observations at the catchment scale showed that portions of the lower rio grande transition from gaining to losing while some sections transition from losing to completely disconnected fuchs et al 2019 making it an ideal area to observe river groundwater connection transitions there are pecan orchards that practice flood irrigation on both sides of the river site using surface water and groundwater conjunctively and differently throughout the irrigation season local protracted drought conditions have prompted a greater dependence on groundwater resources to meet crop requirements fuchs et al 2018 the lower rio grande river is ephemeral and intermittent within the study area there is no flow for approximately half the year and moderate flow during river flooding irrigation season generally lasting from march to september depending on water availability flooding is entirely controlled by the manual release of water from the mesilla dam and the upstream elephant butte and caballo dams there is no river flow except during dam release times confirming that this stretch of the lower rio grande is a disconnected stream for at least half of the year without river flooding because no baseflow is discharged from groundwater into the rio grande however the sustained dam release where the river stage is maintained at a near constant height over several months during irrigation season could allow river groundwater connection to occur each year the mesilla basin geology and hydrogeology is dominated by the rio grande rift largely defined by the presence of basin fill sediments within the valley and the bounding and uplifted bedrock mountain blocks trending north to south the basin is filled with generally unconsolidated alluvial deposits consisting of two main geologic units of the alluvial aquifer including the more recent deposits of the rio grande formation generally 18 3 to 24 4 m thick which unconformably overlies the older santa fe group less than but up to 370 m thick hawley 1975 hawley 2020 hawley et al 2001 hawley and kennedy 2004 hawley and lozinsky 1992 robertson et al 2022 the rio grande alluvium is located within the central part of the basin within the incised portion of the santa fe group and both deposits of alluvium are comprised of clay silt sand and gravel nickerson 1986 usibwc 2014 the mesilla basin aquifer is includes the generally unconsolidated connected and continuous alluvial deposits within both formations king et al 1971 nickerson 1986 teeple 2017 ikard et al 2021 sediment texture and grain size analyses were carried out by humberson personal communication january 19 2021 in the shallow subsurface rio grande alluvium on the banks of the river at the same location as this investigation the sediment is mainly comprised of sandy textured grains with minor amounts of clay and silt on average for all of the samples no significant variability in grain size analysis results were observed as a function of depth suggesting that the rio grande alluvium at the site is relatively homogeneous in grain size and hydraulic properties these observations are consistent with the available drilling and geologic descriptions from well installation reports nickerson 1986 usibwc 2014 alluvial and fluvial unconsolidated sediment deposits can be spatially variable i e heterogeneous in grain size and hydraulic properties yeh et al 2015 however significant spatial variability was not nor has historically been observed at this location 3 materials and methods 3 1 electrical resistivity monitoring for resistivity acquisition the supersting r8 electrical resistivity meter advanced geosciences inc austin tx was used for periodic measurements of apparent resistivity before during and after the presence of water in the rio grande the supersting can acquire up to eight simultaneous measurements of voltage during transmission of current on two adjacent electrodes e g saribudak et al 2020 haas et al 2022 the four pole alt3 wenner array cubbage et al 2017 was used which has the advantage of high resolution high signal to noise and significantly more data than the traditional wenner array because it adds gradient type measurements to unused channels in the multi channel system dahlin and zhou 2006 generally each dataset had about 3 400 resistance measurements data collection configuration at the site included the burial of 56 electrodes at one meter spacing in the channel and shallow banks of the river photo in fig 2 a each electrode had contact with a wire that was connected to a breakout panel photo in fig 2 b the breakout panel was connected to a multiplexor which was connected to the supersting an additional 28 electrodes at one meter spacing were added to the northern bank for a total of 84 electrodes fig 2 c shows the resistivity line configuration across the river perpendicular relative to the river channel and locations of nearby groundwater wells acquisition included the collection of at least two complete datasets for every field day to help with noise reduction all electrodes and surrounding wells were surveyed using a leica total station ts02 6 mm along with gps topcon hyperlite 3 mm to determine field site topography and georeference the electrodes between march 11 and december 4 2020 resistivity data was acquired on 57 days immediately following the initial river flooding march 15 2020 and ramping down of flow september 24 2020 acquisition was approximately every day ert monitoring data collection transitioned to weekly then bimonthly acquisition during long periods of little to no change with the exception of april 22 to may 18 when equipment was sent to the manufacturer for repair 3 2 resistivity inversion inversion is an iterative mathematical procedure that calculates the optimized spatial distribution of a physical property e g resistance measurement combination by minimizing the difference between the measurements and a modeled response res2dinvx64 loke et al 2013 was used for inversion modeling which incorporated the smoothness constrained least squares method degroot hedlin and constable 1990 sasaki 1992 loke at al 2003 the time lapse algorithm invoked a temporal roughness filter that minimizes the difference in the resistivity of each model cell and the corresponding cell for the next temporal model rucker et al 2011 guaranteeing that the model was smooth across time and space when presenting the inversion results logarithmically transformed electrical conductivity reciprocal of resistivity sections are shown for several snapshots as well as a percent difference in conductivity dc where the difference at time i is compared to the baseline snapshot time 0 collected on march 11 2020 prior to water flooding the river channel using the following equation 1 dc i ec bulk 0 ec bulk i ec bulk 0 100 where ecbulk is the bulk ec calculated at snapshot i 3 3 groundwater well and river data there were two nested with three screened interval depths monitoring wells adjacent to the rio grande which were installed operated by the usgs including m2 well 76 m away from the northern bank and m1 well 28 m off the south bank this work focused exclusively on the shallow wells at m1 and m2 named m1c and m2c respectively the wells allowed verification of the water table location at the time of resistivity data acquisition from the wells groundwater elevation data were manually obtained using a water level meter measuring tape or water level sounder water salinity measured as electrical conductivity ec was evaluated by ec probe measurements conducted on river and groundwater samples collected with a bailer additional monitoring data included publicly available groundwater level data from the usgs and river ec and river flowrate data from the ebid monitoring station at the site nwis u s geological survey 2022 ebid 2022 ec and temperature data were also obtained from upstream caballo and leasburg dams from ebid 4 results and discussion 4 1 time lapse ert fig 3 presents example sets of resistance of the subsurface measured on two distinct combinations of the four pole array in the middle of the river channel which are labeled resistance combos 1 and 2 arbitrarily selected to illustrate transient behavior with combo 1 closer to the surface and with a smaller geometric factor than combo 2 with larger geometric factor the resistance values are high before and after river water flooding and low during flooding resistance decreases in march were coincident with the timing of water arrival and increases in resistance in the fall were just after the initiation of decreasing river discharge from upstream dams resistance decreases were expected with increased water saturation in pores and transition of the river and groundwater as they became connected combo 1 shows more variability in resistance during flooding likely due to its low geometric factor and hence relative closeness of the four electrodes that focus more on sediments nearest the surface combo 2 with a larger geometric factor will have a broader and deeper focus of the resistance measure and its data was dampened relative to combo 1 in general the transient changes in resistance corresponded in time to the river flooding arrival which included a decreased resistance with the presence of river water and increased resistance upon removal of water within the riverbed we attribute these changes in resistance to filling of unsaturated pore spaces with water during river flow conditions and this suggests the potential for monitoring transition from disconnection to connection for ephemeral or intermittent streams and rivers the time lapse inversion results are shown in fig 4 including in fig 4 a the modeled data presented as logarithmically transformed values of the reciprocal of electrical resistivity in ec units of μs cm to directly compare to other datasets from wells and surface water sources in fig 4 b the percent change in bulk ec are presented as a matter of nomenclature ec values from the inversion models will be referred to as bulk ec and ec data from other sources as water ec of the 57 geophysical snapshots acquired ten cross section snapshots are presented in the figure and snapshots are shown in several figures that present time series data the first snapshot collected on march 11 represents baseline conditions prior to water arrival at the mesquite site added onto the snapshot is the representation of the groundwater elevation from well m2c which is approximately 50 m north of the first northernmost electrode the water table is illustrated as flat for simplification water arrived at mesquite on or just before march 15 and immediately the resistivity in the upper layer of the subsurface became more conductive fig 4 consistent with results from fig 3 with the arrival of river water the immediate subsurface below the riverbed became more conductive than on march 11th due to a change in multiple possible influencing parameters including water saturation water ec and temperature of the river water the conductive layer is approximately 2 m thick at the same time a slight increase in groundwater elevation in m2c is observed more appropriately the water table should be drawn as a mound with its highest level as the river stage at this point the transition from disconnected to a connected river groundwater system is suspected below the conductive layer the sediments became slightly resistive relative to baseline from march 11 this general trend continues throughout the active river flow period with minimal changes from one snapshot to the next the geophysical observations suggest rapid mixing and cycling within the hyporheic zone establishing full connectivity within as little as 24 h of the river water reaching this site this is evident in the data acquired on march 17 where there is little appreciable change from march 15 for the rest of the river flooding irrigation period on september 24 river flow reduced significantly due to the cessation of water release from the upstream dams and by september 29 flow receded to less than 20 compared to the summer average on this date the very near surface became less conductive in a short period of time and the drop in conductivity is likely related to decreased porewater saturation at this point a transition from connected to a disconnected river groundwater system is suspected after river water was drained and no longer present on december 4th the bulk ec of the near surface returned to similar background conditions observed on march 11th overall the bulk ec response captured at and just below the riverbed using ert increased when water was present in the river and infiltrating into the groundwater and bulk ec decreased when water was no longer present in the river and was draining from the groundwater in the shallow subsurface the groundwater elevation of m2c also rose and fell with the river water elevation and presence of water for the 2020 irrigation season the intermittent river transition from dry background conditions disconnected to the arrival of water connected and back was captured using the time lapse ert characterization in general the transient changes in ert response at the river flooding arrival decreased resistivity and increased bulk ec with increased water saturation of the riverbed and at river flooding recession increased resistivity and decreased bulk ec with decreased water saturation of the riverbed are attributed to the transition to connection and then transition back to disconnection respectively for this particular location these transitions occur rapidly although the transition occurs more slowly for the river flooding recession these results confirm that time lapse ert can be used to monitor and assess the connectivity transitions for ephemeral or intermittent streams and rivers however subsurface resistance is not a direct measure of water saturation and other impacts on this geophysical measurement response should also be considered the shallow sandy sediments that comprise the rio grande alluvium appeared to become saturated and also drain water quickly the deeper sediments became more conductive than the shallower sediments and the water table began to drop based on rapid changes in both the near surface and deeper materials it is clear there is a strong hydraulic connection despite the direction of bulk ec changes through time ikard et al 2021 also noted the hydraulic connections between upper and lower formations with a floating self potential array conducted in july 2020 near the study site 1 9 km up gradient and just below the mesilla dam they noted a change in condition from a net losing condition upstream to a relative mild gaining condition immediately downstream as groundwater was conveyed beneath the mesilla dam and back into the channel downstream these observations may partly explain the distinct bulk ec patterns in the near surface versus deeper sands 4 2 ancillary hydrologic data groundwater data were obtained from the m1c and m2c wells and stream data were acquired during the rio grande flooding including water elevations ec and temperature fig 5 a shows the time series elevation relative to mean sea level of river stage at mesquite in response to the river stage increasing early in the season water level increases were observed in both shallow groundwater wells m1c and m2c correspondingly at the end of the season river stage and groundwater elevation drops were observed there was no flow in the river before the river water arrival from the dam release which verifies the state of disconnection when the river was not flowing the transition from disconnection to connection between river and groundwater likely occurred within hours after river water arrival as confirmed by the consistency in the hydraulic responses and variations between them the groundwater elevations in these shallow wells increased simultaneously with river infiltration indicating a hydraulic connection without an unsaturated zone separating layer or clogging layer between them the shallow wells are screened within the portion of the same rio grande alluvium aquifer that interacts with the river the river drained after the cessation of the dam release and the system transitioned back to a disconnected river and groundwater system which illustrates the reversibility of the disconnection process this reversibility of the disconnection process is consistent with a prior publication that focused on drought in an upstream sub basin fuchs et al 2019 the transient ec data from a range of sources are shown in fig 5 b unlike the groundwater elevations the water ec from m1c and m2c on opposite banks did not correlate possibly due to the pecan orchard south of the river that utilizes flood irrigation another observation showed that the river ec is fairly unchanging until after cessation of the dam release there is a spike in the river ec after mid september fig 5 b the river ec increased from 600 µs cm similar to water ec from m1c to that of a similar ec of well m2c which was an almost constant 1000 µs cm the ec of upstream source water from caballo dam was relatively steady at 600 µs cm throughout 2020 as well this suggests that while the dam is releasing water from the upstream reservoir the reservoir water is the primary source of water discharge at the mesquite site consistency of the water ec values when the dam was closed around mid september the flow declined with the removal of that source of water and the ec of the remaining river water increased to match the ec of the groundwater this suggests that the primary source of water to the river at this mesquite site changed with ec from the upstream reservoir to that of the groundwater at the end of the season when the flooding receded the spike occurred in river water ec the spike could be the result of saline waters stored in the banks flowing back in the river as the hydraulic gradient reverses direction back towards the riverbed this is caused by saline groundwater seepage into the rio grande only in the later time of the irrigation season and not earlier in the season when there was a larger amount of river water supplied from the upstream reservoir dam releases the river water ec equilibrated with the groundwater at the shallow well late in the irrigation season but the shallow groundwater ec was relatively constant due to infiltration in the early part of the season in addition to the disconnection transitions of this intermittent river system during river flooding arrival and recession transitions occurred during the period of river flooding since it was a losing stream during the early and middle time of the irrigation season it then briefly transitioned to a weakly gaining stream system i e return flow at the end of the season when the dam discharge ended in fig 5 b the bulk ec data were extracted from the middle of the river at a distance of 55 5 m from the beginning of the geophysical line shallow bulk ec was extracted at an elevation of 1173 5 m approximately 1 5 m below stream bed and the deep bulk ec was taken at 1169 5 m approximately 5 5 m below stream bed both elevations above mean sea level the shallow bulk ec shows high variability between 139 and 1036 μs cm given that the data were very near the land surface some variability may be expected the deep bulk ec shows much less variability with values between 138 and 264 μs cm this suggests that most of the bulk ec variation was in the shallow riverbed where the river infiltration and connection transition occurred which was attributed to ec changes due to increased water saturation within the pores these results support ert for monitoring variations in these processes over time during transitions in and out of connectivity based on the ability of the method to measure and map variations over a larger spatial extent relative to groundwater wells or discrete surface water measurements lastly fig 5 c shows rio grande river water temperature at the mesilla dam these data are compared to that of leasburg dam approximately 36 km up gradient from mesilla the two temperature data sets are very similar and it is expected that the temperature would be virtually identical at mesquite with a relatively short transport distance 3 2 km down gradient of mesilla throughout most of the flooding season the surface water temperature rose to over 25 c until about mid august after which the temperature started to fall coinciding with the seasonal changes in new mexico the groundwater temperature from m2c however shows a relatively stable temperature profile ranging from 18 1 to 18 8 c the maximum groundwater temperatures occurred from april 5 to may 11 2020 potentially indicating a time lag delay in the groundwater temperature pulse from the previous summer s high temperature the nearly 7 c difference in temperature between river and groundwater may have impacted the ert results as river water infiltration after river groundwater connection occurred would tend to increase the shallow groundwater temperature relative to periods when the river was not flowing and groundwater was disconnected with negligible infiltration 4 3 correlation of time lapse ert with ancillary hydrologic data direct comparisons of the ancillary data with bulk ec are presented in fig 6 in fig 6 a the time series of shallow bulk ec values rise at onset of flooding and decrease when the water recedes attributed to river water infiltration and groundwater mounding causing connectivity between the river and groundwater the bulk ec decreased concurrent with the river flow cessation which was the timing of transition back to disconnection between the river and groundwater with the deep bulk ec there was significantly less variability compared to the shallow bulk ec the correlation coefficient between bulk ec and river stage was calculated to quantitatively understand the relationship between the time lapse ert and ancillary data in fig 6 b the correlation coefficient between the river water ec well m2c groundwater ec and river stage with bulk ec was calculated at all depths in the middle of the river and across time the standard ms excel function correl was used for the operation for each of the geophysical snapshots there was a corresponding ancillary data value making a pair we applied this correlation coefficient calculation with each depth in the bulk ec model for reference the shallow and deep bulk depths presented in fig 6 a are highlighted with a line through their respective depths on fig 6 b fig 6 b shows that the correlation coefficient data were variable with depth in the shallow subsurface above 1172 m the river stage was positively correlated with bulk ec and negatively correlated below until an elevation of 1166 m below which it returned positive again the opposite was observed for river water ec where the near surface had a negative correlation with bulk ec and the deep bulk ec was positively correlated the correlation of bulk ec with m2c ec has similar structure but with lower correlation coefficient values interestingly the depth of zero correlation was the same for all data which defines where the shallow sediments separate from the deeper sediments the transition between the shallow and deeper subsurface responses may be attributed to variations between primarily vertical to lateral fluid flow but confirmation of this is beyond the scope of this investigation spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient between the bulk ec and ancillary data that includes water ec water elevations and water temperature are presented in fig 7 for example in the upper left corner the correlation between river ec and bulk ec was plotted cell by cell for these data the shallower subsurface materials in the riverbed show a strong negative correlation coefficient as high as 0 8 and a strong positive correlation for deeper subsurface materials these observations are consistent with those of fig 6 b moving through the remaining correlation plots the groundwater ec measured at the two wells did not appear to have as strong of a correlation either negative or positive across the profile compared to other datasets likely due to the elevated and relatively stable values the river temperature groundwater elevations in the two wells and river stage had a positive correlation coefficient in the shallow subsurface and negative in the deeper subsurface the river stage and groundwater elevation variations directly impact the hydraulic gradient which controls river water groundwater exchange the consistency in these correlations with bulk ec supports the application of time lapse ert for monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of intermittent river infiltration the similarity in the correlation pattern and behavior for river temperature river stage and groundwater elevations may suggest that temperature impacts on bulk ec are sensitive to temperature changes in the subsurface associated with infiltration of the warmer river water we hypothesize that ert can be used to not only monitor infiltration impacts on water saturation during transition from disconnection to connection but also to monitor infiltration when it causes variations in temperature in the groundwater by directly affecting the value of electrical conductivity similar to ec we are not the first to note this in hydrological studies as differential temperature measurements have been used as a method to estimate groundwater surface water interaction for over 60 years stallman 1965 sorey 1971 it would seem counterintuitive that river water ec has a negative correlation coefficient for the shallow subsurface given the direct exposure of river water flowing through the coarse shallow sediments we examined this further in fig 8 where scatter plots were created between bulk ec and several of the ancillary variables these are the same data presented in the correlation plots of figs 6 and 7 but with greater detail here to understand the values comprising the correlation deep and shallow data were separated consistent with the definitions of deep and shallow above the scatter in fig 8 a shows that the trend in river water ec with shallow bulk ec is primarily controlled by two groups of data appearing in opposite corners when considered together they form a strong negative correlation however the low values of river water ec were recorded throughout the active flooding season less than700 μs cm and high values recorded after the end of the dam release and during return flow to the river from bank storage the lower values for shallow bulk ec follow the trend of the deep bulk ec suggesting that high values recorded after or during return flow are generally relevant to groundwater ec and not representative of typical river water if the high river ec data are removed from the correlation coefficient calculations the values are significantly less strong and near zero with an r2 of 0 03 therefore we suggest that the river water chemistry as monitored by river ec variability is not significantly affecting bulk ec observations or contributing much in the understanding of intermittent connectivity and disconnectivity of the rio grande river for the remaining variables in fig 8 b 8 d the trend in scatter between bulk ec and either groundwater elevation or river temperature appear to be consistent across the entire range of data values therefore it is likely that the bulk ec is being driven more by these particlar variables we hypothesize that since temperature has a direct control on ec values it is one of the most important variables river stage and groundwater elevations are more likely to have indirect control on the bulk ec by providing a driving force for river water infiltration which is also the cause of temperature changes in general the ec values also rise with temperature and many others have also noted the effects of temperature on subsurface conductivity e g hayley et al 2007 herring et al 2021 fig 8 d shows that the river temperature exhibits a relatively strong positive correlation with bulk ec in the shallow subsurface while the deeper subsurface shows a stronger negative correlation again we hypothesize that the negative correlation could be attributed to the existing shallow groundwater sourced upstream from the mesilla dam ikard et al 2021 noted a transition from losing to gaining neutral just upstream of the site to validate these assertions we would need more direct observations of temperature below the streambed between mesquite and the mesilla dam the losing surface water to groundwater upstream of the site along with lateral groundwater flows in the direction of the river would cause a time lag in the deeper groundwater response if it is impacted by the upstream infiltration more than the minor amount of infiltration that occurs at the site this may suggest that the negative correlation simply represents the lag time between high and low seasonal temperatures if for example the losing surface water to groundwater starts 3 2 km upgradient at mesilla dam and it takes 180 days to reach the mesquite site this would represent a 0 02 cm s horizontal velocity which is a reasonable value given the composition of sandy sediments at the site the depth of the transition from shallow to deep changed from 2 m as observed in fig 4 a to 3 5 m in fig 7 this may further suggest that the groundwater temperature is being affected by mixing with warmer river water lastly the elevation of the river and well water is correlated to the temperature given their overall similarities in the bulk ec correlation plots from these series of correlations results suggest that it is feasible to use temperature as a tracer to see changes in electrical resistivity which can then be used to assess the temporal and spatial nature of surface water and groundwater connectivity after connection to groundwater occurs the negligible change in water saturations could limit application of ert for monitoring variations in river infiltration musgrave and binley 2010 suggested this approach where assuming no change in water saturation monitoring of riverbed temperature through geoelectrical surveys could be used for the study of surface groundwater interaction monitoring results presented herein confirm that while water saturation is constant time lapse ert may be used to monitor temperature changes induced by river water infiltration in addition the sediment profile at mesquite is shallow and comprising coarse sands allowing the temperature to remain unchanged for the short time period during the transitions from disconnection to connection thus this connection transition part of the intermittency may also be monitored by time lapse ert as the primary changes are associated with changes in water saturation 5 conclusions a river groundwater intermittent connectivity monitoring approach using a time lapse ert monitoring was developed and implemented for one year along an intermittent ephemeral portion of the lower rio grande river in southern new mexico to investigate temporal and spatial river groundwater connectivity variability a cross section transect perpendicular to the channel length was used for ert monitoring along with ancillary hydrologic data including river groundwater ec river groundwater elevation and surface water temperature collected periodically at the lower rio grande downstream from the mesilla dam near mesquite nm all data were acquired during the 2020 flood release from the elephant butte reservoir between march and december 2020 resistivity correlation analyses were then developed with the ancillary data to elucidate the primary drivers behind the resistivity changes ultimately leading to a greater understanding of connectivity along this very important riparian system time lapse ert changes were used to characterize the transient and spatial connectivity transitions temporally the electrical resistivity geophysics showed that at the onset of river flow and throughout the active flooding season the shallow materials became very conductive in the top two meters the change to conductive sediments was attributed to the transition from disconnection to connection and saturation of the pore space with river water that warmed throughout the season below this layer the conductivity of deeper sediments changed to a lesser degree and out of phase with the upper sediments ert changes were able to characterize the transition from disconnection to connection and back to disconnection since the ert response during that short time period was primarily attributed to changes in water saturation during the majority of the monitoring and when the river groundwater system was connected we hypothesized that the most likely dominant control of the observations of connectivity was through the changes in surface water temperature which acted as a tracer for resistivity throughout the flooding season the river water warmed until late august during the same period the bulk ec in the shallow sediments increased after august both datasets showed declining values an inverse relation was observed for the deeper sediments within the groundwater we explained these observations by noting the direct impact of warming surface water on shallow bulk ec for the deeper groundwater the results likely show a lag in arrival of the temperature signature of upwards to 180 days but further evidence is needed our hypothesis fits within the framework of research by ikard et al 2021 which mapped losing and gaining reaches along the lower rio grande at the mesilla dam the stream was considered losing in july 2020 and transitioned to gaining closer to mesquite further influences of warming groundwater at the top of the water table within the conductivity analyses were observed providing evidence of mixing surface water with groundwater and the temporal nature of observing their connectivity through temperature after connection occurred while water saturation was constant time lapse ert changes were likely dominated by temperature which allows for infiltration monitoring using heat as a tracer e g anderson 2005 constantz 2008 mohamed et al 2021b leroux et al 2021 we recommend that electrical resistivity geophysics be incorporated in long term studies of shallow river systems to further our understanding of intermittent river groundwater connectivity the method provides broad coverage over multiple spatial scales and is inexpensive to deploy this investigation showed that the parameter of electrical resistivity is sensitive to hydrogeological parameters that are important for understanding the seasonality of connected and disconnected waters this work also highlights that the connectivity along this portion of the rio grande occurs in a short time period the spatiotemporal intermittent river groundwater connectivity assessment presented herein advances our process

2922,in the current era of rapid environmental changes more rivers are projected to dry up and transition to disconnected systems in unprecedented duration and frequency however river groundwater interactions including connectivity remain a challenge to characterize especially for managed ephemeral rivers such as the lower rio grande in southern new mexico where conjunctive use for irrigated agriculture is prevalent this investigation used a noninvasive and spatially distributed geophysical method for mapping the disconnection connection of groundwater with the rio grande river which has been validated with ancillary data that includes river flow water levels in the river and adjacent wells and river and groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity time lapse monitoring of electrical resistivity before during and after the river flooding season was used to characterize the transient and spatial connectivity of the water table with the rio grande from disconnection to connection and back to disconnection the relationships between electrical conductivity from the geophysical analysis versus the large array of ancillary data helped to narrow down the driver of observed temporal changes in connectivity after the transition from disconnection to connection the results convey that water temperature is potentially the main influence on the changing electrical conductivity after the connectivity transition the surface water temperature showed a direct and strong correlation to the electrical conductivity of shallow sediments which was similar to the river stage groundwater elevation drivers of infiltration time lapse electrical resistivity can be used to monitor river groundwater connectivity throughout the intermittency cycle due to its sensitivity to changes in both water saturation and temperature keywords electrical resistivity intermittent non perennial ephemeral stream disconnected groundwater rio grande data availability data will be made

quality and quantity findlay 1995 banks et al 2011 harvey and gooseff 2015 brunner et al 2017 ikard et al 2021 interest in characterizing and monitoring these interactions has significantly increased over the last few decades because it is now known that the spatial distribution of infiltration and seepage through a surface water source depends on the state of connection brunner et al 2009a 2009b

al 2014 some rivers oscillate between a gaining and losing system wroblicky et al 1998 and a single stream can be comprised of both gaining and losing stretches a system is connected when the area beneath a riverbed is fully saturated with groundwater and disconnected when the river and groundwater are separated by an unsaturated portion of soil sediment or another divider such as a lower permeability clogging layer fuchs et al 2019 the differentiation and transition between these depend on the hydraulic head of both the river and groundwater which drives the hydraulic gradient direction when predicting the impacts of groundwater development on surface water resources the river and groundwater in gaining systems are typically assumed to be fully connected losing systems are also typically assumed to be fully connected brunner et al 2011 fuchs et al 2019 this over simplification of riverbed connectivity can amount to significant error in water volume quantification over long river reaches singha et al 2008 irvine et al 2012 fuchs et al 2018 measurements of connectivity have shown spatial variability with some locations connected and others disconnected along the length of a reach fuchs et al 2019 models have also shown the possibility of partial connection or disconnection between rivers and groundwater e g irvine et al 2012 where the connected part of the river and underlying groundwater would be spatially variable due to groundwater mounding local recharge or riverbed conformation specific locations of partial connection of stretches of water are often unknown due to challenges in monitoring and characterization the uncertainty in the state of river groundwater connectivity affirms the need for improved techniques to verify the state of connection that exhibits spatial and temporal complexities sophocleous 2002 brunner et al 2011 fuchs et al 2019 however the geological hydrological and biogeochemical heterogeneity in the surface water groundwater interface makes it difficult to characterize with only direct observation techniques which are generally spatially discontinuous and data limited yeh et al 2015 mclachlan et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021a brunner et al 2009a further emphasize that many more documented field studies are required to demonstrate ways in which the transition to disconnection can be quantified in practice and that the development of field techniques to identify disconnection remains one of the most significant practical challenges for the field of surface water and groundwater investigation hammond et al 2021 and zipper et al 2021 both confirmed that aridity is a primary driver of non perennial flow occurrences and global climate change is predicted to enhance the severity and extent of drought in many regions around the world with hotspots of significant drying that include the southwest united states of america u s cook et al 2020 this has been realized recently with the greatest 20 year period 2001 2020 of wet east to dry west aridity spatial gradient in the last 600 years bishop et al 2021 many basins are predicted to have increased future water shortages associated with the combined effects of population growth and climate change in the u s heidari et al 2021 which could further decrease river flows and increase intermittency in the u s and around the globe even though intermittent and ephemeral streams and rivers are some of the most common and dynamic of hydrologic systems that occur on every continent and contribute 50 of the world s river network and discharge gutiérrez jurado et al 2019 messager et al 2021 hammond et al 2021 price et al 2021 there is a general lack of information on river groundwater connectivity especially for systems that experience intermittent and or ephemeral connectivity since most intermittent systems are commonly ungauged there is typically a lack of characterization and monitoring data which has limited the advancement of our understanding of the processes and controls impacting river groundwater interactions constantz et al 2008 shanafield and cook 2014 gutiérrez jurado et al 2019 shanafield et al 2020 even when a state of connection or disconnection between surface water and groundwater is known the temporal and spatial distribution of that connection is often still unknown geophysics includes noninvasive indirect methods for investigating the subsurface and has been increasingly used to characterize subsurface property spatial and temporal variability with supporting ground truth or validation data geophysics is an effective tool for characterizing numerous hydrogeologic properties and parameters crook et al 2008 mclachlan et al 2017 the use of geophysics has an advantage over other direct measurement methods for mapping partial disconnection for example it offers large scale spatially distributed imaging is noninvasive and is able to image the subsurface from the land surface rucker 2009 mclachlan et al 2017 the qualities of geophysical characterization approaches are unlike piezometer drilling groundwater well installation and other direct observation techniques that may be limited by environmental protection or unfavorable site conditions mclachlan et al 2017 electrical resistivity tomography ert is an accomplished geophysical method to map river groundwater interactions since changes in water content can impact resistivity measurements e g acworth and dasey 2003 mansoor and slater 2007 nyquist et al 2008 singha et al 2008 ward et al 2010 karan et al 2013 rucker et al 2021 whereas other impacts on resistivity measurements need to also be considered as another approach callegary et al 2007 also used frequency domain electromagnetic induction to map the relative amount of fine textured material in the subsurface and support ephemeral recharge estimation more recently shanafield et al 2020 used electromagnetic conductivity to survey intermittent stream infiltration mclachlan et al 2020 recently applied electrical resistivity time lapse monitoring of river groundwater interactions in a chalk river which was effective for characterization of transient interactions including up and down welling exchanges koehn et al 2019 2020 also recently used time lapse electrical resistivity monitoring along three sites on the arkansas river to demonstrate potential areas of river groundwater interactions however this characterization method has not previously been fully developed for monitoring intermittency transitions of ephemeral streams and rivers from disconnection to connection clearly there are large gaps in knowledge in connectivity transitions of intermittent and ephemeral streams and rivers and deeper understanding would be critical to sustainable river management harvey and gooseff 2015 the objective of this paper is to develop a river groundwater connectivity monitoring approach using a time lapse ert monitoring survey over a period of one year along an ephemeral portion of the lower rio grande in southern new mexico to investigate the variability of temporal and spatial river groundwater connectivity throughout the 2020 river flooding season a secondary objective is to demonstrate that connectivity occurs rapidly between measurement cycles and that changes in bulk resistivity impacting geophysical monitoring are attributable to changes in river and groundwater parameters such as temperature and water levels this study provides a framework for detailed monitoring of intermittent ephemeral streams undergoing a range of river groundwater connectivity changes 2 site description the rio grande flows from north to south through new mexico u s and along the border with mexico following the rio grande rift the lower rio grande is part of and recharges into the mesilla basin conejos médanos mesilla basin aquifer system hawley et al 2001 hawley and lozinsky 1992 teeple 2017 robertson et al 2022 and the reach studied herein is under the jurisdiction of the u s international boundary and water commission ibwc as part of the canalization project within the u s bureau of reclamation rio grande project the new mexico portion of the rio grande project features the elephant butte irrigation district ebid which is the largest irrigated agricultural producer in the region fuchs et al 2018 the mesilla basin aquifer system is the main source of water for agricultural industrial and municipal use in el paso texas las cruces new mexico and ciudad juárez chihuahua mexico and is at the center of ongoing adjudication over the apportionment of flows of the rio grande between new mexico and texas robertson et al 2022 the particular cross section of the rio grande studied in this project is outside of mesquite new mexico seen in fig 1 adapted from teeple 2017 and downstream from the mesilla caballo and elephant butte dams as well as the city of las cruces new mexico field observations at the catchment scale showed that portions of the lower rio grande transition from gaining to losing while some sections transition from losing to completely disconnected fuchs et al 2019 making it an ideal area to observe river groundwater connection transitions there are pecan orchards that practice flood irrigation on both sides of the river site using surface water and groundwater conjunctively and differently throughout the irrigation season local protracted drought conditions have prompted a greater dependence on groundwater resources to meet crop requirements fuchs et al 2018 the lower rio grande river is ephemeral and intermittent within the study area there is no flow for approximately half the year and moderate flow during river flooding irrigation season generally lasting from march to september depending on water availability flooding is entirely controlled by the manual release of water from the mesilla dam and the upstream elephant butte and caballo dams there is no river flow except during dam release times confirming that this stretch of the lower rio grande is a disconnected stream for at least half of the year without river flooding because no baseflow is discharged from groundwater into the rio grande however the sustained dam release where the river stage is maintained at a near constant height over several months during irrigation season could allow river groundwater connection to occur each year the mesilla basin geology and hydrogeology is dominated by the rio grande rift largely defined by the presence of basin fill sediments within the valley and the bounding and uplifted bedrock mountain blocks trending north to south the basin is filled with generally unconsolidated alluvial deposits consisting of two main geologic units of the alluvial aquifer including the more recent deposits of the rio grande formation generally 18 3 to 24 4 m thick which unconformably overlies the older santa fe group less than but up to 370 m thick hawley 1975 hawley 2020 hawley et al 2001 hawley and kennedy 2004 hawley and lozinsky 1992 robertson et al 2022 the rio grande alluvium is located within the central part of the basin within the incised portion of the santa fe group and both deposits of alluvium are comprised of clay silt sand and gravel nickerson 1986 usibwc 2014 the mesilla basin aquifer is includes the generally unconsolidated connected and continuous alluvial deposits within both formations king et al 1971 nickerson 1986 teeple 2017 ikard et al 2021 sediment texture and grain size analyses were carried out by humberson personal communication january 19 2021 in the shallow subsurface rio grande alluvium on the banks of the river at the same location as this investigation the sediment is mainly comprised of sandy textured grains with minor amounts of clay and silt on average for all of the samples no significant variability in grain size analysis results were observed as a function of depth suggesting that the rio grande alluvium at the site is relatively homogeneous in grain size and hydraulic properties these observations are consistent with the available drilling and geologic descriptions from well installation reports nickerson 1986 usibwc 2014 alluvial and fluvial unconsolidated sediment deposits can be spatially variable i e heterogeneous in grain size and hydraulic properties yeh et al 2015 however significant spatial variability was not nor has historically been observed at this location 3 materials and methods 3 1 electrical resistivity monitoring for resistivity acquisition the supersting r8 electrical resistivity meter advanced geosciences inc austin tx was used for periodic measurements of apparent resistivity before during and after the presence of water in the rio grande the supersting can acquire up to eight simultaneous measurements of voltage during transmission of current on two adjacent electrodes e g saribudak et al 2020 haas et al 2022 the four pole alt3 wenner array cubbage et al 2017 was used which has the advantage of high resolution high signal to noise and significantly more data than the traditional wenner array because it adds gradient type measurements to unused channels in the multi channel system dahlin and zhou 2006 generally each dataset had about 3 400 resistance measurements data collection configuration at the site included the burial of 56 electrodes at one meter spacing in the channel and shallow banks of the river photo in fig 2 a each electrode had contact with a wire that was connected to a breakout panel photo in fig 2 b the breakout panel was connected to a multiplexor which was connected to the supersting an additional 28 electrodes at one meter spacing were added to the northern bank for a total of 84 electrodes fig 2 c shows the resistivity line configuration across the river perpendicular relative to the river channel and locations of nearby groundwater wells acquisition included the collection of at least two complete datasets for every field day to help with noise reduction all electrodes and surrounding wells were surveyed using a leica total station ts02 6 mm along with gps topcon hyperlite 3 mm to determine field site topography and georeference the electrodes between march 11 and december 4 2020 resistivity data was acquired on 57 days immediately following the initial river flooding march 15 2020 and ramping down of flow september 24 2020 acquisition was approximately every day ert monitoring data collection transitioned to weekly then bimonthly acquisition during long periods of little to no change with the exception of april 22 to may 18 when equipment was sent to the manufacturer for repair 3 2 resistivity inversion inversion is an iterative mathematical procedure that calculates the optimized spatial distribution of a physical property e g resistance measurement combination by minimizing the difference between the measurements and a modeled response res2dinvx64 loke et al 2013 was used for inversion modeling which incorporated the smoothness constrained least squares method degroot hedlin and constable 1990 sasaki 1992 loke at al 2003 the time lapse algorithm invoked a temporal roughness filter that minimizes the difference in the resistivity of each model cell and the corresponding cell for the next temporal model rucker et al 2011 guaranteeing that the model was smooth across time and space when presenting the inversion results logarithmically transformed electrical conductivity reciprocal of resistivity sections are shown for several snapshots as well as a percent difference in conductivity dc where the difference at time i is compared to the baseline snapshot time 0 collected on march 11 2020 prior to water flooding the river channel using the following equation 1 dc i ec bulk 0 ec bulk i ec bulk 0 100 where ecbulk is the bulk ec calculated at snapshot i 3 3 groundwater well and river data there were two nested with three screened interval depths monitoring wells adjacent to the rio grande which were installed operated by the usgs including m2 well 76 m away from the northern bank and m1 well 28 m off the south bank this work focused exclusively on the shallow wells at m1 and m2 named m1c and m2c respectively the wells allowed verification of the water table location at the time of resistivity data acquisition from the wells groundwater elevation data were manually obtained using a water level meter measuring tape or water level sounder water salinity measured as electrical conductivity ec was evaluated by ec probe measurements conducted on river and groundwater samples collected with a bailer additional monitoring data included publicly available groundwater level data from the usgs and river ec and river flowrate data from the ebid monitoring station at the site nwis u s geological survey 2022 ebid 2022 ec and temperature data were also obtained from upstream caballo and leasburg dams from ebid 4 results and discussion 4 1 time lapse ert fig 3 presents example sets of resistance of the subsurface measured on two distinct combinations of the four pole array in the middle of the river channel which are labeled resistance combos 1 and 2 arbitrarily selected to illustrate transient behavior with combo 1 closer to the surface and with a smaller geometric factor than combo 2 with larger geometric factor the resistance values are high before and after river water flooding and low during flooding resistance decreases in march were coincident with the timing of water arrival and increases in resistance in the fall were just after the initiation of decreasing river discharge from upstream dams resistance decreases were expected with increased water saturation in pores and transition of the river and groundwater as they became connected combo 1 shows more variability in resistance during flooding likely due to its low geometric factor and hence relative closeness of the four electrodes that focus more on sediments nearest the surface combo 2 with a larger geometric factor will have a broader and deeper focus of the resistance measure and its data was dampened relative to combo 1 in general the transient changes in resistance corresponded in time to the river flooding arrival which included a decreased resistance with the presence of river water and increased resistance upon removal of water within the riverbed we attribute these changes in resistance to filling of unsaturated pore spaces with water during river flow conditions and this suggests the potential for monitoring transition from disconnection to connection for ephemeral or intermittent streams and rivers the time lapse inversion results are shown in fig 4 including in fig 4 a the modeled data presented as logarithmically transformed values of the reciprocal of electrical resistivity in ec units of μs cm to directly compare to other datasets from wells and surface water sources in fig 4 b the percent change in bulk ec are presented as a matter of nomenclature ec values from the inversion models will be referred to as bulk ec and ec data from other sources as water ec of the 57 geophysical snapshots acquired ten cross section snapshots are presented in the figure and snapshots are shown in several figures that present time series data the first snapshot collected on march 11 represents baseline conditions prior to water arrival at the mesquite site added onto the snapshot is the representation of the groundwater elevation from well m2c which is approximately 50 m north of the first northernmost electrode the water table is illustrated as flat for simplification water arrived at mesquite on or just before march 15 and immediately the resistivity in the upper layer of the subsurface became more conductive fig 4 consistent with results from fig 3 with the arrival of river water the immediate subsurface below the riverbed became more conductive than on march 11th due to a change in multiple possible influencing parameters including water saturation water ec and temperature of the river water the conductive layer is approximately 2 m thick at the same time a slight increase in groundwater elevation in m2c is observed more appropriately the water table should be drawn as a mound with its highest level as the river stage at this point the transition from disconnected to a connected river groundwater system is suspected below the conductive layer the sediments became slightly resistive relative to baseline from march 11 this general trend continues throughout the active river flow period with minimal changes from one snapshot to the next the geophysical observations suggest rapid mixing and cycling within the hyporheic zone establishing full connectivity within as little as 24 h of the river water reaching this site this is evident in the data acquired on march 17 where there is little appreciable change from march 15 for the rest of the river flooding irrigation period on september 24 river flow reduced significantly due to the cessation of water release from the upstream dams and by september 29 flow receded to less than 20 compared to the summer average on this date the very near surface became less conductive in a short period of time and the drop in conductivity is likely related to decreased porewater saturation at this point a transition from connected to a disconnected river groundwater system is suspected after river water was drained and no longer present on december 4th the bulk ec of the near surface returned to similar background conditions observed on march 11th overall the bulk ec response captured at and just below the riverbed using ert increased when water was present in the river and infiltrating into the groundwater and bulk ec decreased when water was no longer present in the river and was draining from the groundwater in the shallow subsurface the groundwater elevation of m2c also rose and fell with the river water elevation and presence of water for the 2020 irrigation season the intermittent river transition from dry background conditions disconnected to the arrival of water connected and back was captured using the time lapse ert characterization in general the transient changes in ert response at the river flooding arrival decreased resistivity and increased bulk ec with increased water saturation of the riverbed and at river flooding recession increased resistivity and decreased bulk ec with decreased water saturation of the riverbed are attributed to the transition to connection and then transition back to disconnection respectively for this particular location these transitions occur rapidly although the transition occurs more slowly for the river flooding recession these results confirm that time lapse ert can be used to monitor and assess the connectivity transitions for ephemeral or intermittent streams and rivers however subsurface resistance is not a direct measure of water saturation and other impacts on this geophysical measurement response should also be considered the shallow sandy sediments that comprise the rio grande alluvium appeared to become saturated and also drain water quickly the deeper sediments became more conductive than the shallower sediments and the water table began to drop based on rapid changes in both the near surface and deeper materials it is clear there is a strong hydraulic connection despite the direction of bulk ec changes through time ikard et al 2021 also noted the hydraulic connections between upper and lower formations with a floating self potential array conducted in july 2020 near the study site 1 9 km up gradient and just below the mesilla dam they noted a change in condition from a net losing condition upstream to a relative mild gaining condition immediately downstream as groundwater was conveyed beneath the mesilla dam and back into the channel downstream these observations may partly explain the distinct bulk ec patterns in the near surface versus deeper sands 4 2 ancillary hydrologic data groundwater data were obtained from the m1c and m2c wells and stream data were acquired during the rio grande flooding including water elevations ec and temperature fig 5 a shows the time series elevation relative to mean sea level of river stage at mesquite in response to the river stage increasing early in the season water level increases were observed in both shallow groundwater wells m1c and m2c correspondingly at the end of the season river stage and groundwater elevation drops were observed there was no flow in the river before the river water arrival from the dam release which verifies the state of disconnection when the river was not flowing the transition from disconnection to connection between river and groundwater likely occurred within hours after river water arrival as confirmed by the consistency in the hydraulic responses and variations between them the groundwater elevations in these shallow wells increased simultaneously with river infiltration indicating a hydraulic connection without an unsaturated zone separating layer or clogging layer between them the shallow wells are screened within the portion of the same rio grande alluvium aquifer that interacts with the river the river drained after the cessation of the dam release and the system transitioned back to a disconnected river and groundwater system which illustrates the reversibility of the disconnection process this reversibility of the disconnection process is consistent with a prior publication that focused on drought in an upstream sub basin fuchs et al 2019 the transient ec data from a range of sources are shown in fig 5 b unlike the groundwater elevations the water ec from m1c and m2c on opposite banks did not correlate possibly due to the pecan orchard south of the river that utilizes flood irrigation another observation showed that the river ec is fairly unchanging until after cessation of the dam release there is a spike in the river ec after mid september fig 5 b the river ec increased from 600 µs cm similar to water ec from m1c to that of a similar ec of well m2c which was an almost constant 1000 µs cm the ec of upstream source water from caballo dam was relatively steady at 600 µs cm throughout 2020 as well this suggests that while the dam is releasing water from the upstream reservoir the reservoir water is the primary source of water discharge at the mesquite site consistency of the water ec values when the dam was closed around mid september the flow declined with the removal of that source of water and the ec of the remaining river water increased to match the ec of the groundwater this suggests that the primary source of water to the river at this mesquite site changed with ec from the upstream reservoir to that of the groundwater at the end of the season when the flooding receded the spike occurred in river water ec the spike could be the result of saline waters stored in the banks flowing back in the river as the hydraulic gradient reverses direction back towards the riverbed this is caused by saline groundwater seepage into the rio grande only in the later time of the irrigation season and not earlier in the season when there was a larger amount of river water supplied from the upstream reservoir dam releases the river water ec equilibrated with the groundwater at the shallow well late in the irrigation season but the shallow groundwater ec was relatively constant due to infiltration in the early part of the season in addition to the disconnection transitions of this intermittent river system during river flooding arrival and recession transitions occurred during the period of river flooding since it was a losing stream during the early and middle time of the irrigation season it then briefly transitioned to a weakly gaining stream system i e return flow at the end of the season when the dam discharge ended in fig 5 b the bulk ec data were extracted from the middle of the river at a distance of 55 5 m from the beginning of the geophysical line shallow bulk ec was extracted at an elevation of 1173 5 m approximately 1 5 m below stream bed and the deep bulk ec was taken at 1169 5 m approximately 5 5 m below stream bed both elevations above mean sea level the shallow bulk ec shows high variability between 139 and 1036 μs cm given that the data were very near the land surface some variability may be expected the deep bulk ec shows much less variability with values between 138 and 264 μs cm this suggests that most of the bulk ec variation was in the shallow riverbed where the river infiltration and connection transition occurred which was attributed to ec changes due to increased water saturation within the pores these results support ert for monitoring variations in these processes over time during transitions in and out of connectivity based on the ability of the method to measure and map variations over a larger spatial extent relative to groundwater wells or discrete surface water measurements lastly fig 5 c shows rio grande river water temperature at the mesilla dam these data are compared to that of leasburg dam approximately 36 km up gradient from mesilla the two temperature data sets are very similar and it is expected that the temperature would be virtually identical at mesquite with a relatively short transport distance 3 2 km down gradient of mesilla throughout most of the flooding season the surface water temperature rose to over 25 c until about mid august after which the temperature started to fall coinciding with the seasonal changes in new mexico the groundwater temperature from m2c however shows a relatively stable temperature profile ranging from 18 1 to 18 8 c the maximum groundwater temperatures occurred from april 5 to may 11 2020 potentially indicating a time lag delay in the groundwater temperature pulse from the previous summer s high temperature the nearly 7 c difference in temperature between river and groundwater may have impacted the ert results as river water infiltration after river groundwater connection occurred would tend to increase the shallow groundwater temperature relative to periods when the river was not flowing and groundwater was disconnected with negligible infiltration 4 3 correlation of time lapse ert with ancillary hydrologic data direct comparisons of the ancillary data with bulk ec are presented in fig 6 in fig 6 a the time series of shallow bulk ec values rise at onset of flooding and decrease when the water recedes attributed to river water infiltration and groundwater mounding causing connectivity between the river and groundwater the bulk ec decreased concurrent with the river flow cessation which was the timing of transition back to disconnection between the river and groundwater with the deep bulk ec there was significantly less variability compared to the shallow bulk ec the correlation coefficient between bulk ec and river stage was calculated to quantitatively understand the relationship between the time lapse ert and ancillary data in fig 6 b the correlation coefficient between the river water ec well m2c groundwater ec and river stage with bulk ec was calculated at all depths in the middle of the river and across time the standard ms excel function correl was used for the operation for each of the geophysical snapshots there was a corresponding ancillary data value making a pair we applied this correlation coefficient calculation with each depth in the bulk ec model for reference the shallow and deep bulk depths presented in fig 6 a are highlighted with a line through their respective depths on fig 6 b fig 6 b shows that the correlation coefficient data were variable with depth in the shallow subsurface above 1172 m the river stage was positively correlated with bulk ec and negatively correlated below until an elevation of 1166 m below which it returned positive again the opposite was observed for river water ec where the near surface had a negative correlation with bulk ec and the deep bulk ec was positively correlated the correlation of bulk ec with m2c ec has similar structure but with lower correlation coefficient values interestingly the depth of zero correlation was the same for all data which defines where the shallow sediments separate from the deeper sediments the transition between the shallow and deeper subsurface responses may be attributed to variations between primarily vertical to lateral fluid flow but confirmation of this is beyond the scope of this investigation spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient between the bulk ec and ancillary data that includes water ec water elevations and water temperature are presented in fig 7 for example in the upper left corner the correlation between river ec and bulk ec was plotted cell by cell for these data the shallower subsurface materials in the riverbed show a strong negative correlation coefficient as high as 0 8 and a strong positive correlation for deeper subsurface materials these observations are consistent with those of fig 6 b moving through the remaining correlation plots the groundwater ec measured at the two wells did not appear to have as strong of a correlation either negative or positive across the profile compared to other datasets likely due to the elevated and relatively stable values the river temperature groundwater elevations in the two wells and river stage had a positive correlation coefficient in the shallow subsurface and negative in the deeper subsurface the river stage and groundwater elevation variations directly impact the hydraulic gradient which controls river water groundwater exchange the consistency in these correlations with bulk ec supports the application of time lapse ert for monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of intermittent river infiltration the similarity in the correlation pattern and behavior for river temperature river stage and groundwater elevations may suggest that temperature impacts on bulk ec are sensitive to temperature changes in the subsurface associated with infiltration of the warmer river water we hypothesize that ert can be used to not only monitor infiltration impacts on water saturation during transition from disconnection to connection but also to monitor infiltration when it causes variations in temperature in the groundwater by directly affecting the value of electrical conductivity similar to ec we are not the first to note this in hydrological studies as differential temperature measurements have been used as a method to estimate groundwater surface water interaction for over 60 years stallman 1965 sorey 1971 it would seem counterintuitive that river water ec has a negative correlation coefficient for the shallow subsurface given the direct exposure of river water flowing through the coarse shallow sediments we examined this further in fig 8 where scatter plots were created between bulk ec and several of the ancillary variables these are the same data presented in the correlation plots of figs 6 and 7 but with greater detail here to understand the values comprising the correlation deep and shallow data were separated consistent with the definitions of deep and shallow above the scatter in fig 8 a shows that the trend in river water ec with shallow bulk ec is primarily controlled by two groups of data appearing in opposite corners when considered together they form a strong negative correlation however the low values of river water ec were recorded throughout the active flooding season less than700 μs cm and high values recorded after the end of the dam release and during return flow to the river from bank storage the lower values for shallow bulk ec follow the trend of the deep bulk ec suggesting that high values recorded after or during return flow are generally relevant to groundwater ec and not representative of typical river water if the high river ec data are removed from the correlation coefficient calculations the values are significantly less strong and near zero with an r2 of 0 03 therefore we suggest that the river water chemistry as monitored by river ec variability is not significantly affecting bulk ec observations or contributing much in the understanding of intermittent connectivity and disconnectivity of the rio grande river for the remaining variables in fig 8 b 8 d the trend in scatter between bulk ec and either groundwater elevation or river temperature appear to be consistent across the entire range of data values therefore it is likely that the bulk ec is being driven more by these particlar variables we hypothesize that since temperature has a direct control on ec values it is one of the most important variables river stage and groundwater elevations are more likely to have indirect control on the bulk ec by providing a driving force for river water infiltration which is also the cause of temperature changes in general the ec values also rise with temperature and many others have also noted the effects of temperature on subsurface conductivity e g hayley et al 2007 herring et al 2021 fig 8 d shows that the river temperature exhibits a relatively strong positive correlation with bulk ec in the shallow subsurface while the deeper subsurface shows a stronger negative correlation again we hypothesize that the negative correlation could be attributed to the existing shallow groundwater sourced upstream from the mesilla dam ikard et al 2021 noted a transition from losing to gaining neutral just upstream of the site to validate these assertions we would need more direct observations of temperature below the streambed between mesquite and the mesilla dam the losing surface water to groundwater upstream of the site along with lateral groundwater flows in the direction of the river would cause a time lag in the deeper groundwater response if it is impacted by the upstream infiltration more than the minor amount of infiltration that occurs at the site this may suggest that the negative correlation simply represents the lag time between high and low seasonal temperatures if for example the losing surface water to groundwater starts 3 2 km upgradient at mesilla dam and it takes 180 days to reach the mesquite site this would represent a 0 02 cm s horizontal velocity which is a reasonable value given the composition of sandy sediments at the site the depth of the transition from shallow to deep changed from 2 m as observed in fig 4 a to 3 5 m in fig 7 this may further suggest that the groundwater temperature is being affected by mixing with warmer river water lastly the elevation of the river and well water is correlated to the temperature given their overall similarities in the bulk ec correlation plots from these series of correlations results suggest that it is feasible to use temperature as a tracer to see changes in electrical resistivity which can then be used to assess the temporal and spatial nature of surface water and groundwater connectivity after connection to groundwater occurs the negligible change in water saturations could limit application of ert for monitoring variations in river infiltration musgrave and binley 2010 suggested this approach where assuming no change in water saturation monitoring of riverbed temperature through geoelectrical surveys could be used for the study of surface groundwater interaction monitoring results presented herein confirm that while water saturation is constant time lapse ert may be used to monitor temperature changes induced by river water infiltration in addition the sediment profile at mesquite is shallow and comprising coarse sands allowing the temperature to remain unchanged for the short time period during the transitions from disconnection to connection thus this connection transition part of the intermittency may also be monitored by time lapse ert as the primary changes are associated with changes in water saturation 5 conclusions a river groundwater intermittent connectivity monitoring approach using a time lapse ert monitoring was developed and implemented for one year along an intermittent ephemeral portion of the lower rio grande river in southern new mexico to investigate temporal and spatial river groundwater connectivity variability a cross section transect perpendicular to the channel length was used for ert monitoring along with ancillary hydrologic data including river groundwater ec river groundwater elevation and surface water temperature collected periodically at the lower rio grande downstream from the mesilla dam near mesquite nm all data were acquired during the 2020 flood release from the elephant butte reservoir between march and december 2020 resistivity correlation analyses were then developed with the ancillary data to elucidate the primary drivers behind the resistivity changes ultimately leading to a greater understanding of connectivity along this very important riparian system time lapse ert changes were used to characterize the transient and spatial connectivity transitions temporally the electrical resistivity geophysics showed that at the onset of river flow and throughout the active flooding season the shallow materials became very conductive in the top two meters the change to conductive sediments was attributed to the transition from disconnection to connection and saturation of the pore space with river water that warmed throughout the season below this layer the conductivity of deeper sediments changed to a lesser degree and out of phase with the upper sediments ert changes were able to characterize the transition from disconnection to connection and back to disconnection since the ert response during that short time period was primarily attributed to changes in water saturation during the majority of the monitoring and when the river groundwater system was connected we hypothesized that the most likely dominant control of the observations of connectivity was through the changes in surface water temperature which acted as a tracer for resistivity throughout the flooding season the river water warmed until late august during the same period the bulk ec in the shallow sediments increased after august both datasets showed declining values an inverse relation was observed for the deeper sediments within the groundwater we explained these observations by noting the direct impact of warming surface water on shallow bulk ec for the deeper groundwater the results likely show a lag in arrival of the temperature signature of upwards to 180 days but further evidence is needed our hypothesis fits within the framework of research by ikard et al 2021 which mapped losing and gaining reaches along the lower rio grande at the mesilla dam the stream was considered losing in july 2020 and transitioned to gaining closer to mesquite further influences of warming groundwater at the top of the water table within the conductivity analyses were observed providing evidence of mixing surface water with groundwater and the temporal nature of observing their connectivity through temperature after connection occurred while water saturation was constant time lapse ert changes were likely dominated by temperature which allows for infiltration monitoring using heat as a tracer e g anderson 2005 constantz 2008 mohamed et al 2021b leroux et al 2021 we recommend that electrical resistivity geophysics be incorporated in long term studies of shallow river systems to further our understanding of intermittent river groundwater connectivity the method provides broad coverage over multiple spatial scales and is inexpensive to deploy this investigation showed that the parameter

2923,land surface temperature lst derived from satellite thermal infrared tir remote sensing is widely used in estimating land surface evapotranspiration et through energy balance theory however as satellite tir remote sensing is frequently affected by clouds the derived lst with spatial missing makes it impossible to estimate seamless et for large areas in this study based on the all weather lst awlst generated through the synergistic use of tir and passive microwave pmw remote sensing we propose an estimation scheme of all weather et awet for the river source region of southwest china rsr sc with complex environmental characteristics of frequent clouds and fog specifically the parameters of the surface energy balance system sebs which have high impact on the model results are first accurately determined by a global sensitivity analysis second the parametric calculation schemes of turbulent exchange such as surface roughness heights for momentum z0m and heat z0h transfer and soil heat flux g0 of the sebs model are refined third the daily et temporal upscaling method is developed then a long term awet product for the rsr sc is generated comparison against ground measurements from 12 eddy covariance ec sites indicates a good accuracy of the awet product the mean absolute percent error mape and root mean square error rmse of the daily et estimates are 36 and 0 88 mm d respectively from aspects of temporal variation of daily et monthly spatiotemporal distribution patterns interannual variation of different land covers and spatial distribution comparison with other et products the generated awet exhibits to be realistic reflecting relatively subtle variations further investigation indicates that the response of surface et to the warming temperatures exhibits the spatial heterogeneity of the change trend this study highlights the importance of estimating daily awet at a modis like scale using awlst data to significantly benefit water resource monitoring and conduct runoff prediction over large areas and watershed scales keywords evapotranspiration land surface temperature all weather remote sensing warming temperatures river source region of southwest china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface evapotranspiration et is an essential link between energy and water circulation in the soil vegetationatmosphere system which has a significant impact on precipitation and surface temperature and is also the link for carbon water coupling process monteith 1965 shukla and mintz 1982 zhang et al 2001 fisher et al 2011 accurate et and its reliable trends with a long term record full spatial coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution is one of the crucial factors for better understanding the global warmer climate change under the influence of human activities jiang and ryu 2016 and for determining the changing characteristics of runoffs zhang et al 2009 goulden and bales 2014 and for adapting the future climate change and the scientific ecosystem managements goulden and bales 2014 fisher et al 2017 surface energy balance seb modeling based on thermal infrared tir which has been shown to be an effective tool to monitor consumptive water over a large range in multi spatial scales is one of the main models for estimating surface et based on satellite remote sensing chen and liu 2020 anderson et al 2021 this type of model does not consider the energy transport caused by advection and considers that the surface net radiation rn obtained is converted into sensible heat flux h latent heat flux le and soil heat flux g0 without considering the storage term xu et al 2017 the residual method is used to determine the instantaneous le and then one can calculate the land surface et by temporal upscaling method practical seb models include single source model double source model and multi source model the single source model treats soil and vegetation as a whole big leaf without distinguishing these two components energy flux evaporation is estimated by combining meteorological data land surface physical parameters i e albedo emissivity land surface temperature and vegetation coverage and aerodynamic parameters through a single source aerodynamic impedance among them sebal surface energy balance algorithm for land model bastiaanssen et al 1998a b and sebs surface energy balance system model su 2002 are two classical and widely used single source models in recent years many studies have developed new models based on the principles of these two models allen et al 2005 bastiaanssen et al 1998b chen et al 2013a jia et al 2003 liu et al 2007 and combined with data fusion methods to estimate surface et with high spatial and temporal resolution which can serve the research of agricultural irrigation and ecological water demand li et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the two source model treats the underlying soil and vegetation canopy separately and considers them as turbulent sources superlaid up and down and continuous with each other the total heat flux is the sum of the heat fluxes of each layer which is more reasonable in theory and closer to the actual situation than the single source model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 norman et al 1995 kustas et al 1996 anderson et al 1997 at present the two source model is also widely used in regional surface et monitoring anderson et al 2021 song et al 2016a b 2018 zhang et al 2021 the multi source model is seldom used at large watershed scales due to its complex mechanism and difficulty in obtaining input parameters as descried previously the surface energy balance system sebs model is one of the most widely used energy balance models into estimating et through using a sequence of meteorological physical mechanism equations su et al 2001 su 2002 and modifications of this model are required for implementation at a local or regional scale chen et al 2013a b gökmen et al 2012 it has achieved relatively successful applications at global scale regional scale and single station scale for example global chen et al 2019b europe s iberian peninsula gonzález dugo et al 2021 southeast africa shoko et al 2015 coleambally irrigation area of australia ma et al 2013 south asia zhao et al 2014 mainland china chen et al 2014 heihe river basin hrb in northwest china ma et al 2015 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 qilian mountains in northwest china tian et al 2015 qinghai tibet plateau ma et al 2003 2011 oku et al 2007 chen et al 2013b peng et al 2016 and single station scale jia et al 2003 chen et al 2013a timmermans et al 2013 nevertheless in using the sebs model three problems generally exist first users usually face the lack of input parameters based on remote sensing data such as the lack of land surface temperature lst caused by cloud contamination second the applicability of the parameterization scheme of the model in a large area with obvious spatial heterogeneity needs to examine third as the model input it is still difficult to obtain large scale refined meteorological driving data wind temperature humidity radiation etc for example when sebs model is widely applied around the world the sensible heat flux is prone to be underestimated and satellite thermal infrared lst is usually missing chen et al 2013a chirouze et al 2014 mccabe and wood 2006 pardo et al 2014 timmermans et al 2013 van der kwast et al 2009 satellite thermal infrared remote sensing has been demonstrated to be an effective way to obtain land surface le et as a key input variable in many remote sensing estimation models because of its advantages of space coverage and continuous observation allen et al 2011 gan et al 2019 gan and gao 2015 kalma et al 2008 li et al 2009 long et al 2020 wang and dickinson 2012 however it is vulnerable to weather resulting in the inability to obtain lst in cloudy conditions thus it is hard to obtain spatiotemporally continuous le and et fortunately passive microwave pmw remote sensing can overcome the limitations of cloud contamination making it possible to generate the daily all weather lst awlst li et al 2013a liao et al 2022 which provides an opportunity to estimate all weather et recently the scientific communities have focused on removal of the lst systematic deviation in the pmw remote sensing and tir remote sensing to integrate these two sources to generate awlst holmes et al 2013 2015 kou et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 furthermore based on the spatiotemporal fusion of instantaneous observations provided by multiple satellites optical sensors microwave sensors the all weather surface instantaneous le et estimated is usually expanded to the daily scale or to many days and then the surface et for ten day month and year long periods can be calculated for the practical application requirements of hydrologic cycle and other fields the river source region in southwest china rsr sc occupies the south central region of the qinghai tibet plateau region is known as the third pole and water tower of asia in recent years it has attracted much attention and has become a hot spot of research on climate change and water cycle under the background of global warming xu et al 2008 yang et al 2014 qiu 2016 gao et al 2019 han et al 2021 ma et al 2003 2011 2020 have carried out a large number of long term and systematic studies of surface energy fluxes in the tibetan plateau rsr sc focusing on the development of models based on experimental observations besides there are also some studies for the qinghai tibet plateau using the sebs model for example oku et al 2007 calculated the surface heat flux over the qinghai tibet plateau and the rmse of g 0 h and le were 44 2 w m2 79 6 w m2 and 112 5 w m2 respectively chen et al 2013a developed a tesebs model considering the topography based on sebs model and applied it to the calculation of surface heat flux in the mount everest area and reduced the average error of h and le by 5 9 w m2 and 3 4 w m2 compared with the original sebs model although the scientific communities have carried out a lot of studies on remote sensing of surface energy flux in the rsr sc however since rsr sc has extremely complex terrain and challenging environmental characteristics and most existing research use only a few or single source remote sensing platform data surface et products with full spatial coverage long term record and high spatial resolution have not yet been created precisely this means that the urgently needed runoff research in this area has a significant gap in terms of et data therefore the surface et research in this area is currently facing new and greater requirements as an exemplification study the research framework here could be transferable to a wide range of other climate regions and our findings could also inform runoff researchers in those regions in this paper we present the implementation of the sebs adjusted parameterization schemes using awlst and associated land surface products and its validation at 12 sites across a region with a vast aridity wetness gradient in the rsr sc and its surrounding areas from the perspective of spatiotemporal patterns et estimates from the adjusted sebs are further compared with other et products and the precipitation data the objectives of this study include 1 using awlst the performances of the adjusted sebs model and the improved temporal upscaling methods are investigated during application over a dozen years 2 the spatiotemporal variations in the et estimates are analyzed and et data of this study is compared with other et products 3 the adjusted parameterization schemes and the factors that cause their differences with different underlying surfaces are discussed in terms of sebs sensitivity and 4 to assess the varying trends of et in the rsr sc from the perspective of global regional warming 2 study area and ground measurements 2 1

preprocessing 3 1 satellite data and preprocessing multisource remote sensing data of modis and all weather land surface temperature awlst are used in this study the temporal and spatial resolution information for these data is presented in table 2 the details are outlined below the modis products including lst myd11a1 vegetation index myd13q1 and surface albedo mcd43a3 and mcd43c3 were collected from the atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov the awlst products were generated with a new method to integrate the satellite tir and pmw observations specifically the method was applied to modis and amsr e amsr2 data to generate the 1000 m all weather awlst on a regional scale the awlst is not only highly consistent with the modis lst in terms of spatial pattern but also fills the gap in the lst data caused by cloud contamination zhang et al 2019 the time of the awlst products is consistent with that of the myd11a1 product the data set was published on the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn note the awlst data gaps in 2011 and 2012 due to the absence of pmw data the surface broadband albedo albedo was generated from the 500 m mcd43a3 and gap filled based on 5000 m mcd43c3 products these albedo maps were resampled to 1000 m using the pixel aggregation method the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product myd13q1 is synthetic data with a spatial resolution of 250 m and a period of 16 days the interference of clouds and rain can be removed to a certain extent using the synthesis strategy however if all images have clouds within a synthesis period the strategy will still result in missing data in the products for example in the southern part of the rsr sc area the vegetation index is missing due to the cloudy conditions here the no data values for myd13q1 ndvi were filled in with the new values from the spline interpolation of before and after measurement in addition the values of the multiyear average ndvi were filled using the geographically weighted regression gwr method when there were no data values for 16 days these ndvi were resampled to 1000 m through pixel aggregation the quality of the leaf area index lai data is crucial in estimated et because it can primarily affect the computational accuracy of parameterization schemes an 8 day lai dataset glass lai http glass product bnu edu cn recommend by xiao et al 2013 2016 was used to replace myd15a2h because of the missing value of the lai from modis product in the southern area the fractional vegetation cover fvc was then calculated from the lai nilson 1971 the surface canopy height h for the growing season is essential to the sensible heat simulations chen et

to the size of the city the short canopy e g farming fields and vegetables height hcs usually has seasonal variation every year the hcs was calculated based on the ndvi using max hcsmax and min hcsmin short canopy heights from chen et al 2013a finally hch hb and hcs were integrated together to generate h maps additionally some et products are used in the indirect validation including mod16a3 mu et

http data tpdc ac cn here to more accurately estimate the surface flux in the study area meteorological variables that match the remote sensing images with a 1000 m spatial resolution are required half hourly atmospheric forcing data were produced using the quadratic spline interpolating function based on the cmfd the air temperature of the spatial distribution was downscaled to the same spatial resolution of the thermal lst products of modis with 1000 m spatial resolution using the gwr method based on the cmfd of 0 1 and two auxiliary data ndvi and dem other meteorological parameters were resampled to 1000 m using the nearest neighbor interpolation nni the daily precipitation volume was obtained with the hourly precipitation he et al 2020 3 3 preprocessing of ground measurements the flux data were collected from heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater at the heihe plan science data center https www heihedata org li et al 2013b liu et al 2016a 2018 ma et

from the ec to validate the estimated results a quality assessment and control process was applied to the ground measurements the ec raw records were used at a 10 hz sampling frequency to calculate the half hourly le and h using the edire software package liu et al 2011 moreover to control the quality of the flux data ec data processing including spike detection lag correction for h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component 2 d coordinate rotation sonic virtual temperature correction frequency response correction and density fluctuation correction was applied in addition the flux data gaps were filled by using gap filling methods liu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 to obtain robust flux data the bowen ratio closure method was used to force the energy balance with a 30 min average flux twine et al 2000 all meteorological data of the aws were measured at 10 min intervals and resampled to 30 min intervals and the abnormal data obtained were rejected the details of the data quality assessment and control and postprocessing procedures are described in liu et al 2011 2013 and yu et al 2006 3 4 auxiliary data the global land cover by national mapping organizations glcnmo tateishi et al 2011 kobayashi et al 2017 https globalmaps github io glcnmo html 15 arc second approximately 500 m spatial resolution land use land cover lucc data was collected from the global map data archives websites https globalmaps github io which is used in the remotely sensed et model glcnmo2013 has 20 land cover classes kobayashi et al 2017 and the overall accuracy with the weight of the mapped area coverage is 81 2 in this study the agricultural area and sparse vegetation areas of glcnmo2013 were updated based on the land cover classification from mcd12q1 because there were areas where the interannual variations in the two classes was relatively large due to the changes in natural climate or human farming activities from 2003 to 2016 the final classification results were visually checked and modified transformed into universal transverse mercator projection wgs 84 utm zone 47 n and resampled to 1000 m by using nni algorithm aster global digital elevation model gdem https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp data with approximately 30 m spatial resolution was used to downscale the cmfd temperature 4 methods integrated multisource remote sensing data acquired by optical and pmw remote sensors onboard polar satellite platforms are used as model inputs to overcome the frequent cloudy characteristics of the study area then estimation scheme for all weather evapotranspiration is applied to derive the daily et at the modis scale 1000 m based on the awlst in the rsr sc 4 1 estimation scheme for all weather evapotranspiration es awet aiming at the natural environmental characteristics of high altitude and cloudy conditions in the rsr sc and the scarcity of ground stations this study focuses on the advantages of the multisource remote sensing collaborative inversion and a remotely sensed et model with temporal and spatial heterogeneity is developed specifically the sebs model with a specific physical mechanism is based on various types of land cover first the parameters that have high impact on the et estimation are determined through a global sensitivity analysis second we adjust the calculation scheme of the surface roughness heights for momentum z0m and heat z0h transfer and g0 in the sebs model among them the most important is that the vertical structural shape of the vegetation and the effects of different canopy surface types on the drag and shelter of wind speed are considered in the parametric calculation scheme of turbulent exchange at the same time temporal upscaling methods from instantaneous to daily scales are developed for all weather conditions thus improving the estimation accuracy of the daily et in addition luccs and surface albedo data are combined to accurately identify the special underlying surface e g water body lake ice and glacier in the rsr sc then the traditional p t equation priestley and taylor 1972 and the kuzmin formula jia et al 2017 are used to calculate evaporation from water bodies and the sublimation of ice and snow respectively note that the awlst data can overcome the shortage of tir data caused by cloud contamination based on the above research the remote sensing estimation et model has been developed and the instantaneous daily monthly and yearly et products are generated for a long term record 2003 2010 2013 2016 for the rsr sc the flowchart of the monitoring scheme of awet is shown in fig 2 4 2 adjusted parameterization schemes for the sebs model ignoring advection and storage of heat in the land surface vegetated layer the surface energy balance equation is usually composed of rn h le and g0 su 2002 1 r n h l e g 0 where rn is surface net radiation flux h is sensible heat flux le is latent heat flux and g0 is surface ground heat flux the sebs model was proposed by su 2002 for computing turbulent heat fluxes using satellite remote sensing data over large areas sebs determines h by solving the similarity relationships for the wind speed profile u m s and the difference between the potential temperature θ 0 k at the surface and the potential air temperature θa k based on the monin obukhov similarity theory most at a reference height z m 2 h k u z 0

hurk et al 1997 brutsaert 1999 and l is the obukhov length m further details for sebs can be found in su 2002 here this study aims to explore a uniform z0h z0m and g0 parameterization scheme which is robust for heat flux calculations for complex landform and changeable high low vegetable canopies a detailed explanation of these revisions is discussed below table a1 in appendix a provides a list of parameters and variables used in the adjusted parameterization schemes in this study 4 2 1 adjusted z0m parameterization scheme z0m can be determined by acquiring surface physical factors through observations monteith 1973 nicholas and lewis 1980 shaw and pereira 1982 colin 2010 zhang et al 2004 nakai et al 2008 liu et al 2016 chu et al 2018 in practical applications particularly for pixel scale remote sensing estimation models it is difficult to estimate the heterogeneous surface roughness heights our previous research has established the features of the aerodynamic roughness and surface roughness elements such as canopy height and vegetation index and the parametric relationships among these elements ma et al 2018 however such parameterized schemes are limited to local or watershed environments while a wider range of applicable schemes requires physics based models in order to estimate of turbulent heat flux over different type of canopy cover a new solution for z0m needs to be developed following thom 1972 shaw and pereira 1982 massman 1997 and massman et al 2017 more physically analytical methods for z0m h and d0 h are used to calculate z0m with both the canopy profiles of wind speed u z u h and reynolds stress u 2 z u 2 h which can apply for any arbitrary canopy or stand distribution and structure characteristics 3 z 0 m h λ rs 1 d 0 h exp k u h u h 4 d 0 h

empirical coefficient nec is the with canopy wind speed extinction coefficient ξ is nondimensional in terms of the canopy height and expressed as ξ z h 0 ξ 1 or 0 z h the parameterization of the ratio u h u h is a function of the cumulative drag area index ζ h here it is adapted from massman 1997 massman et al 2017 and wang 2012 7 u h u h c 1 c 2 exp c 3 ζ h where c1 0 38 c3 15 c2 c1 k log ξ0g ξ0g

density distribution function again following massman 1997 and massman et al 2017 ha ξ is constructed as 9 ha ξ l a i f a ξ 0 1 f a ξ d ξ where fa ξ dimensionless is an asymmetric gaussian method of

where ξmax is the height of the maximum leaf area density and σu and σl are the standard deviations of the leaf area density above of ξmax and below of ξmax respectively more details can be found in massman et al 2017 and hu et al 2020 hereby cd ξ is constructed by the ensemble of surface foliage leaf elements method of massman 1997 and massman et al 2017 at any given height ξ 11 c d ξ c d e d 1

sheltering and the term 1 p1ha ξ with p1 0 is the shelter factor whenever the canopy elements shelter or block other neighboring elements from direct exposure to the wind here we conduct a sensitivity analysis for parameters d1 and p1 usually as model constants using one variable at a time approach oat cho et al 2016 the results indicate that values of d1 and p1 for different luccs can obtain adequate h estimations the sensitivity performance of values of d1 and p1 are discussed in details in section 6 4 2 2 adjusted z0h parameterization scheme the roughness length for heat transfer z0h can be formulated to use momentum transfer z0m against the dimensionless parameter kb 1 as follows 12 z 0 h z 0 m exp k b 1 where k is the von karman constant b is the stanton number and kb 1 is the difference in turbulent momentum and heat transfer efficiency excess resistance in sebs kb 1 developed by su et al 2001 is constructed from based on the localized near field lnf lagrangian theory

model however the sebs model version su 2002 uses ζ h cd lai to calculate the ratio u h u h in equation 7 for k b c 1 namely equation 11 in the case of p1 0 and d1 0 means that ζ h cd lai here a column canopy air turbulent transfer mode chen et al 2019a is introduced and adjusted to calculate ζ h in section 4 2 1 besides in our previous work by ma et al 2018 the parameterization method of yang et al 2002 2008 is introduced into the k b s 1 equation for heat transfer over bare soil surfaces 14 k b s 1 ln z 0 m 70 ϑ u exp β u 0 5 θ 0 25 where ϑ is the kinematic viscosity of air 1 5x10 5

and van den hurk 1995 bosveld et al 1999 timmermans et al 2013 based on ground observation data and empirical analysis a new z0h combination parameterization scheme is proposed based on the dynamic information of the vegetation e g fvc lai and luccs from the forms of the su s scheme su 2002 bosveld s scheme bosveld et al 1999 and yang s scheme yang et al 2008 as follows 15 z 0 h z 0 m exp fck b

where c is the coefficient of γ for the bare soil coefficient τ is the extinction coefficient which varies with vegetation type and solar zenith angle monteith 1973 hereby considering the particularity of permafrost absorbing and releasing heat and plateau vegetation in the study area an adjusted scheme of stratified classification estimation based on lai and dem data is adopted the schemes of comparative estimation are presented in table 3 4 3 modifications to the temporal upscaling methods from instantaneous et to daily et instantaneous et which is estimated by the adjusted sebs model must be upscale to daily scales to obtain the daily et cammalleri et al 2014 xu et al 2015 the intraday variation characteristics similar to et are used such as downward shortwave radiation net radiation and solar radiation at the top of atmosphere that is the radiation energy ratio remains constant for the instantaneous to daily scale transformation for example jackson et al 1983 used the sine function variation in solar radiation in the cloudless sky with the daily scale expansion method afterward the ratio of instantaneous le to downward solar radiation was expanded to a daily scale by many studies sun et al 2009 delogu et al 2012 van niel et al 2011 2012 in addition solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere ryu et al 2012 and net radiation brutsaert and sugita 1992 were also found to have similar intraday variation characteristics as et and were used to construct a daily scale expansion of et the constant solar radiation ratio consolrad is defined as the ratio of daily le to daily et equal to the ratio of instantaneous le to the daily solar radiation 17 l e d l e i sw d i s w d d where led is the daily et lei is the instantaneous et swdi is the instantaneous downward shortwave radiation and swdd is the daily downward shortwave radiation previous studies have shown that the radiant energy invariance method yields slight change in accuracy under various underlying surface conditions and the method has good robustness ryu et al 2012 however because the method does not consider the influence factors such as temperature humidity wind speed water and vapor pressure deficit vpd in the calculation process there are significant limitations to the practical applications to overcome the application difficulties and inherent defects of this method et is constrained using vapor pressure relative shortwave radiation and different land covers to represent biophysical constraints the specific modified calculation formula is outlined as follows 18 l e d l

cloudy days ead is the daily actual vapor pressure θ is the empirical coefficient in this study for bare land type its value is defined as 0 85 and the corresponding value of η is kp 0 85 for other surface types θ is defined as 0 35 and the corresponding η equals kp 0 35 ω d e m is the shadow constraint factor 5 results 5 1 model performance in the rsr sc 5 1 1 comparison of observed instantaneous rn h and le with adjusted sebs the observed values of instantaneous net radiation rn instantaneous sensible heat flux h and instantaneous latent heat flux le measured on the ground at 12 stations during different periods with different underlying surfaces are selected at the same time the estimated values of instantaneous rn instantaneous h and instantaneous le are selected by using the pixel where the field site observation position is located then a comparative verification is carried out on forests grasslands crops corn wetlands swamps shrubs and bare ground underlying surfaces fig 3 and table 4 overall in the last row of table 4 comparing the estimated values with the ground measured values the total accuracy is shown as follows for instantaneous rn mbe is 3 05 w m2 mape is 17 93 rmse is 78 26 w m2 and r is 0 89 the accuracy of this result can meet the requirements of remote sensing to estimate the net radiation of surface et for instantaneous h mbe is 5 06 w m2 mape is 44 45 rmse is 75 45 w m2 and r is 0 56 for instantaneous le mbe is 0 45 w m2 mape is 42 30 rmse is 86 14 w m2 and r is 0 78 the estimated instantaneous rn h and le of the remote sensing data are basically distributed near the 1 1 line and there is good consistency between the estimated instantaneous surface flux and the measured ec value in addition we use the measured ground values of 12 stations to verify the model estimation results the verification results show fig 3 and table 4 that the mbe variation range of the estimated instantaneous rn and the measured value is 60 90 w m2 47 15 w m2 the mape variation range is 12 33 26 45 the variation range of rmse is 45 31 w m2 110 06 w m2 and the variation range of r is 0 83 0 93 the mbe variation range of the estimated instantaneous h and the measured value is 57 76 w m2 34 82 w m2 the mape variation range is 22 68 73 75 the variation range of rmse is 48 83 w m2 109 36 w m2 and the variation range of r is 0 13 0 81 the mbe variation range of the estimated instantaneous le and the measured value is 42 67 w m2 50 00 w m2 the mape variation range is 32 85 61 20 the rmse variation range is 56 25 w m2 113 67 w m2 and the variation range of r is 0 28 0 88 from the above results the rmse value of instantaneous h is equivalent to that of instantaneous le however the mape value and r value of instantaneous h are lower than those of instantaneous le one of the reasons is that for the vegetation surface the magnitude of sensible heat flux is generally very smaller and close to the observational error in the growing season the estimation result may not be as accurate as the estimation result using only meteorological station observation data because the spatial resolution of the driving data is relatively low 10 km and it is assumed that the selected pixel in the validation is pure in fact most pixels are mixed pixels such as those at the lz site all these factors decrease the verification accuracy although the accuracy of the verification results of some stations is relatively low it is still useful to carry out surface et monitoring on a broad range of regional scales furthermore it is worth noting that not all statistical indicators of estimation in clear days are necessarily better than those in cloudy days see table 4 and table 5 in black font in contrast some statistical indicators perform better in cloudy conditions which may also indirectly confirm the reliability of the awlst data but further examination is needed 5 1 2 comparison of the observed daily et with the estimates of the adjusted sebs the estimated awet is compared with ec measurements from the 12 stations fig 4 statistical results of the comparisons between the modeled and measured et are listed in table 5 in general the validation results demonstrate that the es awet performs well in reproducing the daily et over different landcover surfaces with a nse value of 0 56 a mbe value of 0 17 mm d a mape value of 36 25 a rmse value of 0 88 mm d and a r value of 0 86 with samples scatter around the 1 1 line fig 4 and table 5 show the measured et values and estimated values for different land cover types and most of the observed values are consistent with the estimated values except for the significant deviation in some observation points in general the validation results indicated that the awet reliably reproduced the daily et in the rsr sc however during some periods in some underlying surface types remote sensing estimation deviations still exist for example the mixed pixels with substantial heterogeneity induce the difference between the remote sensing estimation and the observed value more evident furthermore fig 4 and table 5 show better correspondence for the sites in the middle and upper reaches of the hrb than others between the estimated et and the ec measurements the total nse between the estimated values of the five stations in the middle and upper reaches of the heihe river basin and the ground measured values is 0 58 mbe is 0 12 mm d mape is 35 97 rmse is 0 77 mm d r is 0 87 and the verification accuracy is relatively ideal however the total nse of the estimated et and ground measured values at the other seven stations is 0 36 mbe is 0 11 mm d mape is 40 61 rmse is 0 93 mm d r is 0 74 and the accuracy is slightly lower the verification result of the latter is not as good as that of the former which may be caused by some deviations or model problems caused by high altitude or complex terrain during validation in addition we note that like instantaneous rn h and le the statistical index in clear days is not necessarily better than that in cloudy and rainy days to be specific we can find that the estimation accuracy is better in cloudy conditions on bare or desert underlying surface such as mape values of the ssw and qoc sites see table 5 in black font 5 1 3 comparison with other remote sensing et products fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of mod16a3 gleam etmonitor globalet et eb v2 annual precipitation and awet estimated in this study in 2013 fig 5 rows 1 and 2 like precipitation et shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest the annual et of the subtropical monsoon climate and tropical monsoon climate area in the southeast of the rsr sc is above 1000 mm and the annual et of the center of the rsr sc is between 400 and 600 mm in the northwest there is drought and little rain all year round and the annual et is 200 mm the spatial distribution pattern of each remote sensing et product has the same trend but the annual ets of gleam and et eb are lower than those of other et products fig 5 row 3 especially in the northwest which is approximately 30 50 lower than the others to be specific the spatial distribution details of several remote sensing et products are still different from fig 5 row 2 the detailed characteristics of the et spatial distribution obtained by es awet are apparent that is more subtle differences can be found on the underlying surface awet products reflect the spatial heterogeneity characteristics of surface et caused by the difference in surface structure for example valleys and mountains can be seen in the central rsr sc furthermore awet products can more clearly present the annual et spatial differences of some particular land cover types such as lakes permanent glaciers and oases zhangye oasis in addition the gleam and mod16a3 products are capable of reflecting the effects of low precipitation on the et in the two low precipitation spots in the southeast region fig 5 row 1 whereas other products cannot including the awet of this study actually it is challenging to compare the differences between different et products in depth because it is impossible to strictly verify et on a regional scale here we compare the spatial distribution of all with awet fig 5 rows 3 and 4 and the results show that annual precipitation mod16a3 etmonitor globalet and awet have relatively good spatial consistency especially in the eastern and southern areas of the rsr sc furthermore the comparison results also show the vast differences between different et products although the probability of distribution is generally low in bivariate histogram areas with large deviations fig 5 row 4 it is very challenging to further explain the reasons for this difference the inherent deviation of different et monitoring models may be one of the reasons 5 2 spatiotemporal variations of et in the rsr sc 5 2 1 temporal and spatial distribution pattern of et for individual stations and regional scale fig 6 shows the time series comparison of daily et red line daily precipitation blue histogram daily average air temperature black line lai green and edi light purple red dotted line for different land cover types from the 12 stations from 2003 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016 it is evident that the change patterns of et at all stations are different they present the distribution form of sinusoid the et is relatively low in january and december and the values are relatively high in june and july which is mainly caused by a large amount of solar radiation in summer and a small amount in winter arora 2002 daily et has a good response to the seasonal variation in daily air temperature when the air temperature is lower than 0 c the daily et of all stations is relatively small in addition compared with colder areas warmer areas usually have longer et peak durations for example comparing zyw with hpb and als with lz respectively the daily et peak duration of the former is longer than that of the latter although their underlying surface types are similar the dem of the former is much lower than that of the latter in other words the climate of the former is warmer than that of the latter therefore many et models take air temperature as one of the critical control parameters of the model for example the different commonly used factors between lst and air temperature whether for the single source model e g sebal sebs or the dual source model kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 2000 confirm this point lai is an essential structural parameter of the vegetation ecosystem and is used to quantify the changes in plant leaf surface quantity and canopy structure many studies have shown that the dynamic information of the vegetation e g lai is closely related to et arora 2002 li et al 2006 gan et al 2021a in general in the vegetation distribution area the higher the lai is the higher the biomass is and the higher the et is and vice versa this study also shows that there is a good positive correlation between et and lai fig 6 under normal circumstances precipitation determines the magnitude of daily et in rsr sc especially for an underlying vegetation free or sparse vegetation surface for example each peak value of daily et in the time series distribution for bjt and ssw is a direct response to rainfall events however it is worth noting that dms zyw and nmc still have large daily et with less precipitation during the growing season because there are other sources of water supply at these stations in addition to precipitation for example dms uses irrigation water zyw has sufficient surface water storage and nmc is close to namtso lake which has a shallow surface water supply the edi evaporative drought index is the difference between one and the ratio of actual et and potential et yao 2010 the variation range of edi is from 0 to 1 when edi is 0 it means that the actual et equals the potential et at this time the soil moisture is the most sufficient and the underlying surface is very wet in the contrast when edi is 1 the actual et is 0 and there is no vegetation transpiration and soil water evaporation and the underlying surface is dry in fig 6 with more precipitation in summer edi is generally lower while with less precipitation in winter edi is higher moreover in the continuous precipitation period such as hbb hbp ars lz and als the edi values are relatively low it is worth noting that in areas with little precipitation and other supplementary water supplies such as dms and zyw the edi values are low which shows that edi can effectively monitor the dry and wet conditions of the surface in addition edi changes vary significantly in different regions for example for bjt and ssw the edi of the whole year is relatively high which is mainly because the annual precipitation here is rare in arid areas in contrast edi of als is relatively low year round and the main reason is that als is located in a relatively humid area with abundant rain year round in semiarid areas the edi values of hbb hbp ars lz nq and nmc are between those of arid and humid areas which also show changes with changes in precipitation furthermore the daily edi is severely affected by clouds for example in the same area over two days without precipitation there is a dry and wet mutation which is contradictory to the drought phenomenon under normal conditions and the reliability of drought monitoring is relatively low generally to eliminate the impact of clouds on wet and dry monitoring regional wet and dry monitoring can be carried out by expanding the time scale it is particularly important to note that for different land cover types from the 12 stations besides qoc and nq for the annual average edi there is no fluctuation over these ten years fig 6 lavender line there are also abnormal situations for example for nq the edi has a high low fluctuation every 2 3 years but the fluctuation range is not large and the changing trend of et is also not apparent for qoc the changing trend of edi is undeniable edi is relatively stable before 2008 maintained at 0 82 and the annual et is also relatively stable from 2008 to 2014 edi shows an apparent downward trend decreasing to 0 60 and et shows an increasing trend from 2014 to 2016 edi shows an increasing trend again increasing to 0 72 and et still shows an increasing trend the increasing trend of et of qoc in the past ten years is noticeable and the reason for the increase may be from the annual increase in precipitation blue bar and maximum temperature with a slight increase solid black line represents the daily temperature and a black dotted line represents the daily temperature equal to 273 15 k however the annual average edi shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing it is still very challenging to accurately explain this problem a direct and straightforward explanation cannot be found future works on edi and et variabilities at different time scales are still needed fig 7 illustrates the spatial variability of the monthly et at a 1000 m resolution from the cumulative daily values during january to december from 2003 to 2010 and 2013 2016 as shown in fig 7 the monthly maps are found no meaningful differences during the non growing season for different years for example in the early season january and february and later season november and december et values are all relatively uniformly distributed from southeast to northwest furthermore the spatial patterns of monthly et from march to october are varied and spatial heterogeneity for example in july and august the vegetation water consumption and biomass increase rapidly and vary widely since over these two months different coupling between climate seasonality maximum precipitation and net radiation and vegetation dynamic information at the month scale song et al 2018 gan et al 2021a in addition the trends of the seasonal variation in monthly et remain relatively consistent from 2003 to 2016 5 2 2 statistical analysis of et for different land cover types by observing the high and low values of annual et the spatial pattern of annual et is correlated highly with land cover type the spatial heterogeneity of et is considerable ranging from 200 mm in bare land to 1000 mm in vegetation areas dominated by evergreen broad leaved forest to quantitatively compare the et of different land cover types regional statistics are carried out on the ets of different land cover types year by year fig 8 colored bar and multiyear average et fig 8 black frame in rsr sc as expected among all land cover types the annual average et 994 69 mm of the water body is the highest followed by evergreen broad leaved forest with an annual average et of 933 32 mm the main reasons are that the water body is at a high altitude and high latitude but the area has strong sunshine in summer and water evaporation in rsr sc for the broad leaved forest region precipitation is abundant and the annual temperature is almost higher than 273 15 k the annual et of rice planting areas and farmland areas are also relatively high 888 49 mm and 737 56 mm respectively the annual average et 711 51 mm of evergreen coniferous forest is close to that of deciduous coniferous forest 663 27 mm and the deciduous broad leaved forest 798 85 mm is higher than that of deciduous coniferous forest because lower air temperature leads to shorter phenological periods the annual average et of grassland and sparse vegetation are 510 00 mm and 319 50 mm respectively the average et of permanent snow is 419 17 mm of which the sublimation part accounts for approximately 80 the annual average et 146 04 mm of bare land e g desert is the lowest because the annual precipitation on the underlying surface is relatively low in fig 8 from the interannual variation in et over the ten years under examination the variation trend of different underlying surfaces is slightly different which can be divided into the following three categories first it shows an increasing trend for example evergreen broad leaved forest deciduous broad leaved forest evergreen coniferous forest deciduous coniferous forest mixed forest sparse forest 40 grassland farmland rice field and snow ice second it shows a stable and unchanged trend for example the sparse vegetation and bare land surface show a stable and unchanged trend the third one is a decreasing trend such as urban built up areas and water bodies as shown in fig 8 the standard deviation of the multiyear average et of different land cover types does not differ significantly and its absolute value varies from 7 to 45 mm for example evergreen broad leaved forest 45 07 mm and paddy fields 45 55 mm have more considerable variability while bare land 7 62 mm and sparse vegetation land 9 31 mm have small variability the coefficients of variation cv of different land cover types are further calculated fig 8 red star line the most significant cv is construction land 0 072 followed by snow ice 0 053 forestland and other surface types in the middle and the water body 0 022 has the lowest coefficient of variation the interannual variability in surface types is greatly affected by human activities or a relatively weak ecological environment in addition overall et has shown a slightly increasing trend in rsr sc over the ten years under examination but further analysis is needed in combination with global climate change to explain this reason 5 2 3 variation trend of monthly et with a significantly warmer climate the significant trend in the monthly et for rsr sc from 2003 to 2016 presented obviously temporal spatial difference distribution characteristics fig 9 the largest increase appears in the south of this study area i e hengduan mountain area and its southern region during january to may and october to november followed by along the himalayan region during june to september and north qinghai tibet plateau during june to september the significantly decreasing trends of monthly et appears in the whole area in december followed by smaller regions in central and eastern rsr sc during june july and september as well as northwest during january to may more general the results of the trend show that the mean monthly et is significantly elevated for sparse vegetation covers at high altitudes or low altitudes and in humid areas and slight decreasing trend in the summer in some densely vegetated areas p 0 05 6 discussion 6 1 adjusted parameterization schemes for the sebs model a relatively simple way to parameterize land atmosphere heat transfer can be more easily defined from the bulk transfer equation based on the most chen et al 2019a however it is usually more difficult to determinate the values of suitable roughness parameters z0m z0h and kb 1 since it cannot be measured directly the calculation of surface roughness heights for momentum z0m and heat z0h transfer of the model is involved in many surface flux estimation models at present for regional surface flux estimation the calculation of surface roughness heights based on remote sensing data has the same characteristics but there is no widely accepted effective calculation method for example many empirical studies have shown that the relationship between the vegetation index ndvi and lai obtained from remote sensing data and surface roughness heights is universally applicable however for different study areas due to the differences in the surface climate environment spatial heterogeneity of surface variables and land cover types the forms of this relationship are various with different empirical coefficients for regional surface flux estimation many studies have relatively rough calculation schemes for surface roughness heights for instance chen et al 2019a showed that a more physical expression of the key parameters of surface roughness heights such as vertical leaf density leaf drag coefficient leaf heat transfer efficiency leaf shelter factor and subroughness correction solved the underestimation problem of sensible heat flux over forest canopies therefore we further investigate and adjust the submodel of the wind speed profile extinction coefficient massman et al 2017 and momentum transfer within the canopy chen et al 2019a using within canopy wind profile information explicitly the values for d1 in the drag coefficient term e d1 1 ξ and p1 in the shelter factor term 1 p1ha ξ are adjusted over very low canopies e g desert ssw desert bjt and swamp hbp medium canopies e g grassland nq grassland nmc grassland ars and maize dms and tall canopies e g shrub hbb and forest als sensitivity in fig 10 shows that for different canopies the performance of the turbulent heat flux model with the new updated scheme is reduced or enhanced along with adjusting d1 and p1 as expected among all the canopies the desert and swamp show minimal sensitivity almost constant values for mbe mape rmse and r by adjusting d1 and p1 grassland and cropland maize appear to have strong sensitivity however shrub and forest canopies show relatively low sensitivity and their essential causes need further investigation and analysis in the future nevertheless the corresponding d1 and p1 values can be selected through optimization and thus satisfactory h estimation results can be obtained over various land types with different roughness lengths therefore our research on both the mechanism and application practice has high value and significance as we all know since the surface roughness heights are the result of the combined action of the surface roughness element dynamics and thermodynamic factors in the wind and wave areas the influencing factors include the canopy surface of vegetation the leaf structure inside vegetation and the distribution structure among plants terrain surface temperature air temperature wind speed and wind direction with the in depth study of regional surface flux there is a strong demand for rapid and accurate estimation of the surface roughness heights for the regional heterogeneity underlying the surface liu et al 2021 for example it is worth noting that our adjusted z0h scheme is promising for bare land fig 3 ssw and fig 3 bjt in the future to achieve a new breakthrough studies on the parametric scheme of surface roughness heights must perform research across multiple disciplines and methods such as using various earth observation techniques different spatial statistical methods spatial scale conversion scale up and scale down methods and collaborative inversion of multisource remote sensing data as well as the most which are also essential g0 is an important component of surface energy balance due to the drastic change of soil temperature in surface heat flow g0 generally decreases exponentially with soil depth bhumralkar 1975 at present it is a basic method to calculate g0 by integrating the multi layer soil moisture and temperature observation data with the heat diffusion equation tanaka et al 2001 gao et al 2003 another empirical method is to approximate g0 by establishing the ratio γ of g0 rn however the relationship varies from region to region and there are some errors in the phase of the obtained g0 fuchs and hadas 1972 choudhury et al 1987 clothier et al 1986 bastiaanssen et al 2000 ma et al 2003 su 2002 this empirical strategy scheme is usually combined with remote sensing data to estimate g0 the empirical coefficient γ is closely related to surface characteristics for example the existing studies confirmed that the variability of γ was partially caused by variations in soil moisture idso et al 1975 clothier et al 1986 ogée et al 2001 however soil moisture is difficult to obtain in large areas and lst is often used as an alternative for heterogeneous surface in large regions although lst is sensitive to soil water it cannot wholly replace soil water and lst based schemes tend to have more empirical coefficients and poor regional applicability which limits their applicability over an extensive range moreover unlike the underlying surfaces where g0 takes up a relatively low proportion 0 35 of rn g0 of surfaces e g water bodies wetland and early rice paddy field usually takes up a higher proportion gan et al 2020 gan et al 2021b due to the heat storage effect of water gan et al 2020 however we note that the value of exact proportion here relies on local calibration using observational data from ground stations if widely applicable it needs greatly simplify the estimation of regional g0 with satellite remote sensing kustas et al 1993 in addition on the daily scale γ is small and the sign of soil heat in day and night is opposite which can be ignored the accurate estimation of g0 on different underlying surfaces still needs to be further examined in the future 6 2 instantaneous to daily temporal upscaling methods as described previously the regional surface et estimated by satellite tir remote sensing data is almost instantaneous et at present to meet the scientific research and practical application requirements in the fields of ecology hydrology and agriculture the temporal upscaling method from remotely sensed instantaneous observations is used to gain daily ten day monthly and yearly et with accurate long term record that are fully covered in general temporal upscaling includes two steps the first step is to directly use the temporal upscaling method of daily et from remotely sensed instantaneous observations for clear sky days and the second step is for cloudy days where the temporal reconstruction method is required from day to day however in this study the awlst data are innovatively used to completely overcome the defect in the lack of satellite tir data caused by cloud contamination zhou et al 2015 duan et al 2017 temporal upscaling from day to day is avoided to improve the estimation accuracy for example alfieri et al 2017 suggested that the use of temporal reconstruction is limited and a return interval of no more than five days is necessary for accurate daily et estimates thus a significant error introduced by using awlst products is completely avoided if the gap size is large at present the representative temporal upscaling methods of instantaneous to daily scales include constant evaporative fraction conef corrected conef coref diurnal evaporative fraction dief constant solar radiation ratio solrad constant reference evaporative fraction conetrf constant decoupling factor method and data assimilation jackson et al 1983 anderson et al 1997 van niel et al 2011 delogu et al 2012 tang et al 2017 xu et al 2015 there are significant differences in the process of temporal upscaling for daily et and its verification the estimation using the temporal upscaling method varies greatly for different climatic conditions and underlying surfaces different temporal upscaling methods also have different estimation accuracies during different seasons in a comparison of existing methods such as conef and dief the estimation accuracy is controversial the uncertainty of the field observation data also leads to an accuracy difference for the temporal upscaling method therefore due to the spatial heterogeneity and the differences in the regional environment it is difficult to evaluate a universal temporal upscaling method for daily et from instantaneous observations in this study based on the existing research and consolrad which requires fewer input parameters and is very stable two restrictions are added to the original method and a temporal upscaling method with more reliable accuracy that is suitable for all weather is developed for daily et therefore the estimation accuracy of surface et is improved fig 11 specifically the modified scheme has improved the accuracy for different land types especially in non growing seasons and the systematic overestimation of the original method was better corrected in addition it is worth noting that the modified scheme also presents better effects for typical rainy days such as dms doy207 and 230 ars doy207 220 and 227 and als doy207 224 226 and 258 however in this extreme case it is sunny at the overpass of the satellite while it is cloudy at other times in this scenario it is evident that the instantaneous value cannot wholly represent the daily value and thus it remains this is only a preliminary explanation of the error in the future it is still necessary to carry out in depth mechanism exploration and develop a temporal upscaling method from instantaneous to daily by remotely sensed observations which is suitable for all weather with more robust stability higher accuracy and stronger operability 6 3 variation trends of et with a significantly warmer climate the gistemp team 2020 had reported that average global temperatures rose by 0 51 c in the 30 years from the 1970 s to the end of the last century xu et al 2019 reported that under the condition of global warming the increasing trend of et can further enhance water vapor supply to some extent and the increase of water vapor content may alleviate the rapid depletion of glaciers and snow caused by global warming furthermore in the sensitive region of climate change kuang and jiao 2016 lapenis 2020 the response of land surface et to warming temperatures is still inconclusive ma et al 2019 and it shows the spatial heterogeneity of the change trend han et al 2021 et is an important part of hydrological cycle and plays an important role in regulating climate change especially in high altitude and cold regions zhang et al 2009 han et al 2021 in general the increase of air temperature can increase the dryness of the air which will lead to the increase of vpd and eventually lead to the increase of et however in the real natural environment such as the qinghai tibet plateau region the rise of temperature is accompanied by the increase of cloud coverage due to the influence of clouds the downward short wave radiation reaching the land surface decrease rapidly even exceeding the effect of the rise of air temperature roderick and farquhar 2002 and vice versa for example in fig 12 the temperature in the central part of rsr sc increases significantly from may to august while the et trend is not obvious and even shows a decreasing trend see fig 9 from may to august in addition the bare land ice and snow ecosystems may be more sensitive to warming with increasing altitude responding more quickly and feeding back into the regional hydrological cycle as shown in fig 9 and fig 12 the trends of temperature rises and et increase in the high altitude rsr sc from may to september shows obvious consistency the study of liu et al 2015 also shows this point nevertheless it can be seen from fig 9 and fig 12 that the variation trend of air temperature and et both present a decreasing trend in january and december in short under the background of significant global warming it is of great practical and scientific significance to strengthen the quantitative study of et variability in the rsr sc as the asian water tower and the birthplace of many rivers to examine its influence mechanism as well as to explore the impact of human activities 7 conclusion an accurate estimation of the spatially and temporally continuous et is essential in the monitoring of water resources and for conducting runoff prediction in large areas or at watershed scales in this study we develop a more physically realistic monitoring scheme of awet based on awlst by adjusting parameterization to monitor the et and its trends for a region with a vast aridity wetness gradient area the river source region in west china the awet is compared to in situ ec measurement and other et datasets and the validation results show that our dataset can reasonably capture the spatio temporal variation characteristics over rugged hybrid land surface types additionally we find that during construction of the instantaneous aerodynamic roughness parameterization scheme consideration of aerodynamic factors such as wind speed the three dimensional structure of the canopy and occlusion between canopies was indispensable the seasonal variations and spatio temporal patterns of the awet tend to be realistic reflecting the subtle variations among rivers valleys and farmland e g the zhangye oasis area in northwestern china can be seen in fig 5 top row besides a revised constant solar radiation ratio consolrad of the temporal upscaling method is further applied to estimate daily et from remotely sensed instantaneous observations in all weather conditions furthermore the response of variation trends of et to global the qinghai tibet plateau warming is obvious and positive in the high altitude himalayan region while it is not significant because of the negative feedback effect of cloud cover on radiation in the middle of the rsr sc this underscores the need for future research on the internal physical mechanism of et variation trends to enhance the addressing future climate change the awet estimation scheme in this study can also be used in global et studies based on multisource remote sensing data future work will focus on integrating the geostationary satellite lsts to further improve the accuracy of

2923,land surface temperature lst derived from satellite thermal infrared tir remote sensing is widely used in estimating land surface evapotranspiration et through energy balance theory however as satellite tir remote sensing is frequently affected by clouds the derived lst with spatial missing makes it impossible to estimate seamless et for large areas in this study based on the all weather lst awlst generated through the synergistic use of tir and passive microwave pmw remote sensing we propose an estimation scheme of all weather et awet for the river source region of southwest china rsr sc with complex environmental characteristics of frequent clouds and fog specifically the parameters of the surface energy balance system sebs which have high impact on the model results are first accurately determined by a global sensitivity analysis second the parametric calculation schemes of turbulent exchange such as surface roughness heights for momentum z0m and heat z0h transfer and soil heat flux g0 of the sebs model are refined third the daily et temporal upscaling method is developed then a long term awet product for the rsr sc is generated comparison against ground measurements from 12 eddy covariance ec sites indicates a good accuracy of the awet product the mean absolute percent error mape and root mean square error rmse of the daily et estimates are 36 and 0 88 mm d respectively from aspects of temporal variation of daily et monthly spatiotemporal distribution patterns interannual variation of different land covers and spatial distribution comparison with other et products the generated awet exhibits to be realistic reflecting relatively subtle variations further investigation indicates that the response of surface et to the warming temperatures exhibits the spatial heterogeneity of the change trend this study highlights the importance of estimating daily awet at a modis like scale using awlst data to significantly benefit water resource monitoring and conduct runoff prediction over large areas and watershed scales keywords evapotranspiration land surface temperature all weather remote sensing warming temperatures river source region of southwest china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface evapotranspiration et is an essential link between energy and water circulation in the soil vegetationatmosphere system which has a significant impact on precipitation and surface temperature and is also the link for carbon water coupling process monteith 1965 shukla and mintz 1982 zhang et al 2001 fisher et al 2011 accurate et and its reliable trends with a long term record full spatial coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution is one of the crucial factors for better understanding the global warmer climate change under the influence of human activities jiang and ryu 2016 and for determining the changing characteristics of runoffs zhang et al 2009 goulden and bales 2014 and for adapting the future climate change and the scientific ecosystem managements goulden and bales 2014 fisher et al 2017 surface energy balance seb modeling based on thermal infrared tir which has been shown to be an effective tool to monitor consumptive water over a large range in multi spatial scales is one of the main models for estimating surface et based on satellite remote sensing chen and liu 2020 anderson et al 2021 this type of model does not consider the energy transport caused by advection and considers that the surface net radiation rn obtained is converted into sensible heat flux h latent heat flux le and soil heat flux g0 without considering the storage term xu et al 2017 the residual method is used to determine the instantaneous le and then one can calculate the land surface et by temporal upscaling method practical seb models include single source model double source model and multi source model the single source model treats soil and vegetation as a whole big leaf without distinguishing these two components energy flux evaporation is estimated by combining meteorological data land surface physical parameters i e albedo emissivity land surface temperature and vegetation coverage and aerodynamic parameters through a single source aerodynamic impedance among them sebal surface energy balance algorithm for land model bastiaanssen et al 1998a b and sebs surface energy balance system model su 2002 are two classical and widely used single source models in recent years many studies have developed new models based on the principles of these two models allen et al 2005 bastiaanssen et al 1998b chen et al 2013a jia et al 2003 liu et al 2007 and combined with data fusion methods to estimate surface et with high spatial and temporal resolution which can serve the research of agricultural irrigation and ecological water demand li et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the two source model treats the underlying soil and vegetation canopy separately and considers them as turbulent sources superlaid up and down and continuous with each other the total heat flux is the sum of the heat fluxes of each layer which is more reasonable in theory and closer to the actual situation than the single source model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 norman et al 1995 kustas et al 1996 anderson et al 1997 at present the two source model is also widely used in regional surface et monitoring anderson et al 2021 song et al 2016a b 2018 zhang et al 2021 the multi source model is seldom used at large watershed scales due to its complex mechanism and difficulty in obtaining input parameters as descried previously the surface energy balance system sebs model is one of the most widely used energy balance models into estimating et through using a sequence of meteorological physical mechanism equations su et al 2001 su 2002 and modifications of this model are required for implementation at a local or regional scale chen et al 2013a b gökmen et al 2012 it has achieved relatively successful applications at global scale regional scale and single station scale for example global chen et al 2019b europe s iberian peninsula gonzález dugo et al 2021 southeast africa shoko et al 2015 coleambally irrigation area of australia ma et al 2013 south asia zhao et al 2014 mainland china chen et al 2014 heihe river basin hrb in northwest china ma et al 2015 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 qilian mountains in northwest china tian et al 2015 qinghai tibet plateau ma et al 2003 2011 oku et al 2007 chen et al 2013b peng et al 2016 and single station scale jia et al 2003 chen et al 2013a timmermans et al 2013 nevertheless in using the sebs model three problems generally exist first users usually face the lack of input parameters based on remote sensing data such as the lack of land surface temperature lst caused by cloud contamination second the applicability of the parameterization scheme of the model in a large area with obvious spatial heterogeneity needs to examine third as the model input it is still difficult to obtain large scale refined meteorological driving data wind temperature humidity radiation etc for example when sebs model is widely applied around the world the sensible heat flux is prone to be underestimated and satellite thermal infrared lst is usually missing chen et al 2013a chirouze et al 2014 mccabe and wood 2006 pardo et al 2014 timmermans et al 2013 van der kwast et al 2009 satellite thermal infrared remote sensing has been demonstrated to be an effective way to obtain land surface le et as a key input variable in many remote sensing estimation models because of its advantages of space coverage and continuous observation allen et al 2011 gan et al 2019 gan and gao 2015 kalma et al 2008 li et al 2009 long et al 2020 wang and dickinson 2012 however it is vulnerable to weather resulting in the inability to obtain lst in cloudy conditions thus it is hard to obtain spatiotemporally continuous le and et fortunately passive microwave pmw remote sensing can overcome the limitations of cloud contamination making it possible to generate the daily all weather lst awlst li et al 2013a liao et al 2022 which provides an opportunity to estimate all weather et recently the scientific communities have focused on removal of the lst systematic deviation in the pmw remote sensing and tir remote sensing to integrate these two sources to generate awlst holmes et al 2013 2015 kou et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 furthermore based on the spatiotemporal fusion of instantaneous observations provided by multiple satellites optical sensors microwave sensors the all weather surface instantaneous le et estimated is usually expanded to the daily scale or to many days and then the surface et for ten day month and year long periods can be calculated for the practical application requirements of hydrologic cycle and other fields the river source region in southwest china rsr sc occupies the south central region of the qinghai tibet plateau region is known as the third pole and water tower of asia in recent years it has attracted much attention and has become a hot spot of research on climate change and water cycle under the background of global warming xu et al 2008 yang et al 2014 qiu 2016 gao et al 2019 han et al 2021 ma et al 2003 2011 2020 have carried out a large number of long term and systematic studies of surface energy fluxes in the tibetan plateau rsr sc focusing on the development of models based on experimental observations besides there are also some studies for the qinghai tibet plateau using the sebs model for example oku et al 2007 calculated the surface heat flux over the qinghai tibet plateau and the rmse of g 0 h and le were 44 2 w m2 79 6 w m2 and 112 5 w m2 respectively chen et al 2013a developed a tesebs model considering the topography based on sebs model and applied it to the calculation of surface heat flux in the mount everest area and reduced the average error of h and le by 5 9 w m2 and 3 4 w m2 compared with the original sebs model although the scientific communities have carried out a lot of studies on remote sensing of surface energy flux in the rsr sc however since rsr sc has extremely complex terrain and challenging environmental characteristics and most existing research use only a few or single source remote sensing platform data surface et products with full spatial coverage long term record and high spatial resolution have not yet been created precisely this means that the urgently needed runoff research in this area has a significant gap in terms of et data therefore the surface et research in this area is currently facing new and greater requirements as an exemplification study the research framework here could be transferable to a wide range of other climate regions and our findings could also inform runoff researchers in those regions in this paper we present the implementation of the sebs adjusted parameterization schemes using awlst and associated land surface products and its validation at 12 sites across a region with a vast aridity wetness gradient in the rsr sc and its surrounding areas from the perspective of spatiotemporal patterns et estimates from the adjusted sebs are further compared with other et products and the precipitation data the objectives of this study include 1 using awlst the performances of the adjusted sebs model and the improved temporal upscaling methods are investigated during application over a dozen years 2 the spatiotemporal variations in the et estimates are analyzed and et data of this study is compared with other et products 3 the adjusted parameterization schemes and the factors that cause their differences with different underlying surfaces are discussed in terms of sebs sensitivity and 4 to assess the varying trends of et in the rsr sc from the perspective of global regional warming 2 study area and ground measurements 2 1

preprocessing 3 1 satellite data and preprocessing multisource remote sensing data of modis and all weather land surface temperature awlst are used in this study the temporal and spatial resolution information for these data is presented in table 2 the details are outlined below the modis products including lst myd11a1 vegetation index myd13q1 and surface albedo mcd43a3 and mcd43c3 were collected from the atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov the awlst products were generated with a new method to integrate the satellite tir and pmw observations specifically the method was applied to modis and amsr e amsr2 data to generate the 1000 m all weather awlst on a regional scale the awlst is not only highly consistent with the modis lst in terms of spatial pattern but also fills the gap in the lst data caused by cloud contamination zhang et al 2019 the time of the awlst products is consistent with that of the myd11a1 product the data set was published on the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn note the awlst data gaps in 2011 and 2012 due to the absence of pmw data the surface broadband albedo albedo was generated from the 500 m mcd43a3 and gap filled based on 5000 m mcd43c3 products these albedo maps were resampled to 1000 m using the pixel aggregation method the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product myd13q1 is synthetic data with a spatial resolution of 250 m and a period of 16 days the interference of clouds and rain can be removed to a certain extent using the synthesis strategy however if all images have clouds within a synthesis period the strategy will still result in missing data in the products for example in the southern part of the rsr sc area the vegetation index is missing due to the cloudy conditions here the no data values for myd13q1 ndvi were filled in with the new values from the spline interpolation of before and after measurement in addition the values of the multiyear average ndvi were filled using the geographically weighted regression gwr method when there were no data values for 16 days these ndvi were resampled to 1000 m through pixel aggregation the quality of the leaf area index lai data is crucial in estimated et because it can primarily affect the computational accuracy of parameterization schemes an 8 day lai dataset glass lai http glass product bnu edu cn recommend by xiao et al 2013 2016 was used to replace myd15a2h because of the missing value of the lai from modis product in the southern area the fractional vegetation cover fvc was then calculated from the lai nilson 1971 the surface canopy height h for the growing season is essential to the sensible heat simulations chen et

to the size of the city the short canopy e g farming fields and vegetables height hcs usually has seasonal variation every year the hcs was calculated based on the ndvi using max hcsmax and min hcsmin short canopy heights from chen et al 2013a finally hch hb and hcs were integrated together to generate h maps additionally some et products are used in the indirect validation including mod16a3 mu et

http data tpdc ac cn here to more accurately estimate the surface flux in the study area meteorological variables that match the remote sensing images with a 1000 m spatial resolution are required half hourly atmospheric forcing data were produced using the quadratic spline interpolating function based on the cmfd the air temperature of the spatial distribution was downscaled to the same spatial resolution of the thermal lst products of modis with 1000 m spatial resolution using the gwr method based on the cmfd of 0 1 and two auxiliary data ndvi and dem other meteorological parameters

from the ec to validate the estimated results a quality assessment and control process was applied to the ground measurements the ec raw records were used at a 10 hz sampling frequency to calculate the half hourly le and h using the edire software package liu et al 2011 moreover to control the quality of the flux data ec data processing including spike detection lag correction for h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component 2 d coordinate rotation sonic virtual temperature correction frequency response correction and density fluctuation correction was applied in addition the flux data gaps were filled by using gap filling methods liu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 to obtain robust flux data the bowen ratio closure method was used to force the energy balance with a 30 min average flux twine et al 2000 all meteorological data of the aws were measured at 10 min intervals and resampled to 30 min intervals and the abnormal data obtained were rejected the details of the data

tateishi et al 2011 kobayashi et al 2017 https globalmaps github io glcnmo html 15 arc second approximately 500 m spatial resolution land use land cover lucc data was collected from the global map data archives websites https globalmaps github io which is used in the remotely sensed et model glcnmo2013 has 20 land cover classes kobayashi et al 2017 and the overall accuracy with the weight of the mapped area coverage is 81 2 in this study the agricultural area and sparse vegetation areas of glcnmo2013 were updated based on the land cover classification from mcd12q1 because there were areas where the interannual variations in the two classes was relatively large due to the changes in natural climate or human farming activities from 2003 to 2016 the final classification results were visually checked and modified transformed into universal transverse mercator projection wgs 84 utm zone 47 n and resampled to 1000 m by using nni algorithm aster global digital elevation model gdem

and pmw remote sensors onboard polar satellite platforms are used as model inputs to overcome the frequent cloudy characteristics of the study area then estimation scheme for all weather evapotranspiration is applied to derive the daily et at the modis scale 1000 m based on the awlst in the rsr sc 4 1 estimation scheme for all weather evapotranspiration es awet aiming at the natural environmental characteristics of high altitude and cloudy conditions in the rsr sc and the scarcity of ground stations this study focuses on the advantages of the multisource remote sensing collaborative inversion and a remotely sensed et model with temporal and spatial heterogeneity is developed specifically the sebs model with a specific physical mechanism is based on various types of land cover first the parameters that have high impact on the et estimation are determined through a global sensitivity analysis second we adjust the calculation scheme of the surface roughness heights for momentum z0m and heat z0h transfer and g0 in the sebs model among them the most important is that the vertical structural shape of the vegetation and the effects of different canopy surface types on the drag and shelter of wind speed are considered in the parametric calculation scheme of turbulent exchange at the same time temporal upscaling methods from instantaneous to daily scales are developed for all weather conditions thus improving the estimation accuracy of the daily et in addition luccs and surface albedo data are combined to accurately identify the special underlying surface e g water body lake ice and glacier in the rsr sc then the traditional p t equation priestley and taylor 1972 and the kuzmin formula jia et al 2017 are used to calculate evaporation from water bodies and the sublimation of ice and snow respectively note that the awlst data can overcome the shortage of tir data caused by cloud contamination based on the above research the remote sensing estimation et model has been developed and the instantaneous daily monthly and yearly et products are generated for a long term record 2003 2010 2013 2016 for the rsr sc the flowchart of the monitoring scheme of awet is shown in fig 2 4 2 adjusted parameterization schemes for the sebs model ignoring advection and storage of heat in the land surface vegetated layer the surface energy balance equation is usually composed of rn h le and g0 su 2002 1 r n h l e g 0 where rn is surface net radiation flux h is sensible heat flux le is latent heat flux and g0 is surface ground heat flux the sebs model was proposed by su 2002 for computing turbulent heat fluxes using satellite remote sensing data over large areas sebs determines h by solving the similarity relationships for the wind speed profile u m s and the difference between the potential temperature θ 0 k at the surface and the potential air temperature θa k based on the monin obukhov similarity theory most at a reference height z m 2 h k u z 0

hurk et al 1997 brutsaert 1999 and l is the obukhov length m further details for sebs can be found in su 2002 here this study aims to explore a uniform z0h z0m and g0 parameterization scheme which is robust for heat flux calculations for complex landform and changeable high low vegetable canopies a detailed explanation of these revisions is discussed below table a1 in appendix a provides a list of parameters and variables used in the adjusted parameterization schemes in this study 4 2 1 adjusted z0m parameterization scheme z0m can be determined by acquiring surface physical factors through observations monteith 1973 nicholas and lewis 1980 shaw and pereira 1982 colin 2010 zhang et al 2004 nakai et al 2008 liu et al 2016 chu et al 2018 in practical applications particularly for pixel scale remote sensing estimation models it is difficult to estimate the heterogeneous surface roughness heights our previous research has established the features of the aerodynamic roughness and surface roughness elements such as canopy height and vegetation index and the parametric relationships among these elements ma et al 2018 however such parameterized schemes are limited to local or watershed environments while a wider range of applicable schemes requires physics based models in order to estimate of turbulent heat flux over different type of canopy cover a new solution for z0m needs to be developed following thom 1972 shaw and pereira 1982 massman 1997 and massman et al 2017 more physically analytical methods for z0m h and d0 h are used to calculate z0m with both the canopy

where ξmax is the height of the maximum leaf area density and σu and σl are the standard deviations of the leaf area density above of ξmax and below of ξmax respectively more details can be found in massman et al 2017 and hu et al 2020 hereby cd ξ is constructed by the ensemble of surface foliage leaf elements method of massman 1997 and massman et al 2017 at any given height ξ 11 c d ξ c d e d 1

sheltering and the term 1 p1ha ξ with p1 0 is the shelter factor whenever the canopy elements shelter or block other neighboring elements from direct exposure to the wind here we conduct a sensitivity analysis for parameters d1 and p1 usually as model constants using one variable at a time approach oat cho et al 2016 the results indicate that values of d1 and p1 for different luccs can obtain adequate h estimations the sensitivity performance of values of d1 and p1 are discussed in details in section 6 4 2 2 adjusted z0h parameterization scheme the roughness length for heat transfer z0h

column canopy air turbulent transfer mode chen et al 2019a is introduced and adjusted to calculate ζ h in section 4 2 1 besides in our previous work by ma et al 2018 the parameterization method of yang et al 2002 2008 is introduced into the k b s 1 equation for heat transfer over bare soil surfaces 14 k b s 1 ln z 0 m 70 ϑ u exp β u 0 5 θ 0 25 where ϑ is the kinematic viscosity of air 1 5x10 5

and van den hurk 1995 bosveld et al 1999 timmermans et al 2013 based on ground observation data and empirical analysis a new z0h combination parameterization scheme is proposed based on the dynamic information of the vegetation e g fvc lai and luccs from the forms of the su s scheme su 2002 bosveld s scheme bosveld et al 1999 and yang s scheme yang et al 2008 as follows 15 z 0 h z 0 m exp fck b

where c is the coefficient of γ for the bare soil coefficient τ is the extinction coefficient which varies with vegetation type and solar zenith angle monteith 1973 hereby considering the particularity of permafrost absorbing and releasing heat and plateau vegetation in the study area an adjusted scheme of stratified classification estimation based on lai and dem data is adopted the schemes of comparative estimation are presented in table 3 4 3 modifications to the temporal upscaling methods from instantaneous et to daily et instantaneous et which is estimated by the adjusted sebs model must be upscale to daily scales to obtain the daily et cammalleri et al 2014 xu et al 2015 the intraday variation characteristics similar to et are used such as downward shortwave radiation net radiation and solar radiation at the top of atmosphere that is the radiation energy ratio remains constant for the instantaneous to daily scale transformation for example jackson et al 1983 used the sine function variation in solar radiation in the cloudless sky with the daily scale expansion method afterward the ratio of instantaneous le to downward solar radiation was expanded to a daily scale by many studies sun et al 2009 delogu et al 2012 van niel et al 2011 2012 in addition solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere ryu et al 2012 and net radiation brutsaert and sugita 1992 were also found to have similar intraday variation characteristics as et and were used to construct a daily scale expansion of et the constant solar radiation ratio consolrad is defined as the ratio of daily le to daily et equal to the ratio of instantaneous le to the daily solar radiation 17 l e d l e i sw d i s w d d where led is the daily et lei is the instantaneous et swdi is the instantaneous downward shortwave radiation and swdd is the daily downward shortwave radiation previous studies have shown that the radiant energy invariance method yields slight change in accuracy under various underlying surface conditions and the method has good robustness ryu et al 2012 however because the method does not consider the influence factors such as temperature humidity wind speed water and vapor pressure deficit vpd in the calculation process there are significant limitations to the practical applications to overcome the application difficulties and inherent defects of this method et is constrained using vapor pressure relative shortwave radiation and different land covers to represent biophysical constraints the specific modified calculation formula is outlined as follows 18 l e d l

cloudy days ead is the daily actual vapor pressure θ is the empirical coefficient in this study for bare land type its value is defined as 0 85 and the corresponding value of η is kp 0 85 for other surface types θ is defined as 0 35 and the corresponding η equals kp 0 35 ω d e m is the shadow constraint factor 5 results 5 1 model performance in the rsr sc 5 1 1 comparison of observed instantaneous rn h and le with adjusted sebs the observed values of instantaneous net radiation rn instantaneous sensible heat flux h and instantaneous latent heat flux le measured on the ground at 12 stations during different periods with different underlying surfaces are selected at the same time the estimated values of instantaneous rn instantaneous h and instantaneous le are selected by using the pixel where the field site observation position is located then a comparative verification is carried out on forests grasslands crops corn wetlands swamps shrubs and bare ground underlying surfaces fig 3 and table 4 overall in the last row of table 4 comparing the estimated values with the ground measured values the total accuracy is shown as follows for instantaneous rn mbe is 3 05 w m2 mape is 17 93 rmse is 78 26 w m2 and r is 0 89 the accuracy of this result can meet the requirements of remote sensing to estimate the net radiation of surface et for instantaneous h mbe is 5 06 w m2 mape is 44 45 rmse is 75 45 w m2 and r is 0 56 for instantaneous le mbe is 0 45 w m2 mape is 42 30 rmse is 86 14 w m2 and r is 0 78 the estimated instantaneous rn h and le of the remote sensing data are basically distributed near the 1 1 line and there is good consistency between the estimated instantaneous surface flux and the measured ec value in addition we use the measured ground values of 12 stations to verify the model estimation results the verification results show fig 3 and table 4 that the mbe variation range of the estimated instantaneous rn and the measured value is 60 90 w m2 47 15 w m2 the mape variation range is 12 33 26 45 the variation range of rmse is 45 31 w m2 110 06 w m2 and the variation range of r is 0 83 0 93 the mbe variation range of the estimated instantaneous h and the measured value is 57 76 w m2 34 82 w m2 the mape variation range is 22 68 73 75 the variation range of rmse is 48 83 w m2 109 36 w m2 and the variation range of r is 0 13 0 81 the mbe variation range of the estimated instantaneous le and the measured value is 42 67 w m2 50 00 w m2 the mape variation range is 32 85 61 20 the rmse variation range is 56 25 w m2 113 67 w m2 and the variation range of r is 0 28 0 88 from the above results the rmse value of instantaneous h is equivalent to that of instantaneous le however the mape value and r value of instantaneous h are lower than those of instantaneous le one of the reasons is that for the vegetation surface the magnitude of sensible heat flux is generally very smaller and close to the observational error in the growing season the estimation result may not be as accurate as the estimation result using only meteorological station observation data because the spatial resolution of the driving data is relatively low 10 km and it is assumed that the selected pixel in the validation is pure in fact most pixels are mixed pixels such as those at the lz site all these factors decrease the verification accuracy although the accuracy of the verification results of some stations is relatively low it is still useful to carry out surface et monitoring on a broad range of regional scales furthermore it is worth noting that not all statistical indicators of estimation in clear days are necessarily better than those in cloudy days see table 4 and table 5 in black font in contrast some statistical indicators perform better in cloudy conditions which may also indirectly confirm the reliability of the awlst data but further examination is needed 5 1 2 comparison of the observed daily et with the estimates of the adjusted sebs the estimated awet is compared with ec measurements from the 12 stations fig 4 statistical results of the comparisons between the modeled and measured et are listed in table 5 in general the validation results demonstrate that the es awet performs well in reproducing the daily et over different landcover surfaces with a nse value of 0 56 a mbe value of 0 17 mm d a mape value of 36 25 a rmse value of 0 88 mm d and a r value of 0 86 with samples scatter around the 1 1 line fig 4 and table 5 show the measured et values and estimated values for different land cover types and most of the observed values are consistent with the estimated values except for the significant deviation in some observation points in general the validation results indicated that the awet reliably reproduced the daily et in the rsr sc however during some periods in some underlying surface types remote sensing estimation deviations still exist for example the mixed pixels with substantial heterogeneity induce the difference between the remote sensing estimation and the observed value more evident furthermore fig 4 and table 5 show better correspondence for the sites in the middle and upper reaches of the hrb than others between the estimated et and the ec measurements the total nse between the estimated values of the five stations in the middle and upper reaches of the heihe river basin and the ground measured values is 0 58 mbe is 0 12 mm d mape is 35 97 rmse is 0 77 mm d r is 0 87 and the verification accuracy is relatively ideal however the total nse of the estimated et and ground measured values at the other seven stations is 0 36 mbe is 0 11 mm d mape is 40 61 rmse is 0 93 mm d r is 0 74 and the accuracy is slightly lower the verification result of the latter is not as good as that of the former which may be caused by some deviations or model problems caused by high altitude or complex terrain during validation in addition we note that like instantaneous rn h and le the statistical index in clear days is not necessarily better than that in cloudy and rainy days to be specific we can find that the estimation accuracy is better in cloudy conditions on bare or desert underlying surface such as mape values of the ssw and qoc sites see table 5 in black font 5 1 3 comparison with other remote sensing et products fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of mod16a3 gleam etmonitor globalet et eb v2 annual precipitation and awet estimated in this study in 2013 fig 5 rows 1 and 2 like precipitation et shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest the annual et of the subtropical monsoon climate and tropical monsoon climate area in the southeast of the rsr sc is above 1000 mm and the annual et of the center of the rsr sc is between 400 and 600 mm in the northwest there is drought and little rain all year round and the annual et is 200 mm the spatial distribution pattern of each remote sensing et product has the same trend but the annual ets of gleam and et eb are lower than those of other et products fig 5 row 3 especially in the northwest which is approximately 30 50 lower than the others to be specific the spatial distribution details of several remote sensing et products are still different from fig 5 row 2 the detailed characteristics of the et spatial distribution obtained by es awet are apparent that is more subtle differences can be found on the underlying surface awet products reflect the spatial heterogeneity characteristics of surface et caused by the difference in surface structure for example valleys and mountains can be seen in the central rsr sc furthermore awet products can more clearly present the annual et spatial differences of some particular land cover types such as lakes permanent glaciers and oases zhangye oasis in addition the gleam and mod16a3 products are capable of reflecting the effects of low precipitation on the et in the two low precipitation spots in the southeast region fig 5 row 1 whereas other products cannot including the awet of this study actually it is challenging to compare the differences between different et products in depth because it is impossible to strictly verify et on a regional scale here we compare the spatial distribution of all with awet fig 5 rows 3 and 4 and the results show that annual precipitation mod16a3 etmonitor globalet and awet have relatively good spatial consistency especially in the eastern and southern areas of the rsr sc furthermore the comparison results also show the vast differences between different et products although the probability of distribution is generally low in bivariate histogram areas with large deviations fig 5 row 4 it is very challenging to further explain the reasons for this difference the inherent deviation of different et monitoring models may be one of the reasons 5 2 spatiotemporal variations of et in the rsr sc 5 2 1 temporal and spatial distribution pattern of et for individual stations and regional scale fig 6 shows the time series comparison of daily et red line daily precipitation blue histogram daily average air temperature black line lai green and edi light purple red dotted line for different land cover types from the 12 stations from 2003 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016 it is evident that the change patterns of et at all stations are different they present the distribution form of sinusoid the et is relatively low in january and december and the values are relatively high in june and july which is mainly caused by a large amount of solar radiation in summer and a small amount in winter arora 2002 daily et has a good response to the seasonal variation in daily air temperature when the air temperature is lower than 0 c the daily et of all stations is relatively small in addition compared with colder areas warmer areas usually have longer et peak durations for example comparing zyw with hpb and als with lz respectively the daily et peak duration of the former is longer than that of the latter although their underlying surface types are similar the dem of the former is much lower than that of the latter in other words the climate of the former is warmer than that of the latter therefore many et models take air temperature as one of the critical control parameters of the model for example the different commonly used factors between lst and air temperature whether for the single source model e g sebal sebs or the dual source model kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 2000 confirm this point lai is an essential structural parameter of the vegetation ecosystem and is used to quantify the changes in plant leaf surface quantity and canopy structure many studies have shown that the dynamic information of the vegetation e g lai is closely related to et arora 2002 li et al 2006 gan et al 2021a in general in the vegetation distribution area the higher the lai is the higher the biomass is and the higher the et is and vice versa this study also shows that there is a good positive correlation between et and lai fig 6 under normal circumstances precipitation determines the magnitude of daily et in rsr sc especially for an underlying vegetation free or sparse vegetation surface for example each peak value of daily et in the time series distribution for bjt and ssw is a direct response to rainfall events however it is worth noting that dms zyw and nmc still have large daily et with less precipitation during the growing season because there are other sources of water supply at these stations in addition to precipitation for example dms uses irrigation water zyw has sufficient surface water storage and nmc is close to namtso lake which has a shallow surface water supply the edi evaporative drought index is the difference between one and the ratio of actual et and potential et yao 2010 the variation range of edi is from 0 to 1 when edi is 0 it means that the actual et equals the potential et at this time the soil moisture is the most sufficient and the underlying surface is very wet in the contrast when edi is 1 the actual et is 0 and there is no vegetation transpiration and soil water evaporation and the underlying surface is dry in fig 6 with more precipitation in summer edi is generally lower while with less precipitation in winter edi is higher moreover in the continuous precipitation period such as hbb hbp ars lz and als the edi values are relatively low it is worth noting that in areas with little precipitation and other supplementary water supplies such as dms and zyw the edi values are low which shows that edi can effectively monitor the dry and wet conditions of the surface in addition edi changes vary significantly in different regions for example for bjt and ssw the edi of the whole year is relatively high which is mainly because the annual precipitation here is rare in arid areas in contrast edi of als is relatively low year round and the main reason is that als is located in a relatively humid area with abundant rain year round in semiarid areas the edi values of hbb hbp ars lz nq and nmc are between those of arid and humid areas which also show changes with changes in precipitation furthermore the daily edi is severely affected by clouds for example in the same area over two days without precipitation there is a dry and wet mutation which is contradictory to the drought phenomenon under normal conditions and the reliability of drought monitoring is relatively low generally to eliminate the impact of clouds on wet and dry monitoring regional wet and dry monitoring can be carried out by expanding the time scale it is particularly important to note that for different land cover types from the 12 stations besides qoc and nq for the annual average edi there is no fluctuation over these ten years fig 6 lavender line there are also abnormal situations for example for nq the edi has a high low fluctuation every 2 3 years but the fluctuation range is not large and the changing trend of et is also not apparent for qoc the changing trend of edi is undeniable edi is relatively stable before 2008 maintained at 0 82 and the annual et is also relatively stable from 2008 to 2014 edi shows an apparent downward trend decreasing to 0 60 and et shows an increasing trend from 2014 to 2016 edi shows an increasing trend again increasing to 0 72 and et still shows an increasing trend the increasing trend of et of qoc in the past ten years is noticeable and the reason for the increase may be from the annual increase in precipitation blue bar and maximum temperature with a slight increase solid black line represents the daily temperature and a black dotted line represents the daily temperature equal to 273 15 k however the annual average edi shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing it is still very challenging to accurately explain this problem a direct and straightforward explanation cannot be found future works on edi and et variabilities at different time scales are still needed fig 7 illustrates the spatial variability of the monthly et at a 1000 m resolution from the cumulative daily values during january to december from 2003 to 2010 and 2013 2016 as shown in fig 7 the monthly maps are found no meaningful differences during the non growing season for different years for example in the early season january and february and later season november and december et values are all relatively uniformly distributed from southeast to northwest furthermore the spatial patterns of monthly et from march to october are varied and spatial heterogeneity for example in july and august the vegetation water consumption and biomass increase rapidly and vary widely since over these two months different coupling between climate seasonality maximum precipitation and net radiation and vegetation dynamic information at the month scale song et al 2018 gan et al 2021a in addition the trends of the seasonal variation in monthly et remain relatively consistent from 2003 to 2016 5 2 2 statistical analysis of et for different land cover types by observing the high and low values of annual et the spatial pattern of annual et is correlated highly with land cover type the spatial heterogeneity of et is considerable ranging from 200 mm in bare land to 1000 mm in vegetation areas dominated by evergreen broad leaved forest to quantitatively compare the et of different land cover types regional statistics are carried out on the ets of different land cover types year by year fig 8 colored bar and multiyear average et fig 8 black frame in rsr sc as expected among all land cover types the annual average et 994 69 mm of the water body is the highest followed by evergreen broad leaved forest with an annual average et of 933 32 mm the main reasons are that the water body is at a high altitude and high latitude but the area has strong sunshine in summer and water evaporation in rsr sc for the broad leaved forest region precipitation is abundant and the annual temperature is almost higher than 273 15 k the annual et of rice planting areas and farmland areas are also relatively high 888 49 mm and 737 56 mm respectively the annual average et 711 51 mm of evergreen coniferous forest is close to that of deciduous coniferous forest 663 27 mm and the deciduous broad leaved forest 798 85 mm is higher than that of deciduous coniferous forest because lower air temperature leads to shorter phenological periods the annual average et of grassland and sparse vegetation are 510 00 mm and 319 50 mm respectively the average et of permanent snow is 419 17 mm of which the sublimation part accounts for approximately 80 the annual average et 146 04 mm of bare land e g desert is the lowest because the annual precipitation on the underlying surface is relatively low in fig 8 from the interannual variation in et over the ten years under examination the variation trend of different underlying surfaces is slightly different which can be divided into the following three categories first it shows an increasing trend for example evergreen broad leaved forest deciduous broad leaved forest evergreen coniferous forest deciduous coniferous forest mixed forest sparse forest 40 grassland farmland rice field and snow ice second it shows a stable and unchanged trend for example the sparse vegetation and bare land surface show a stable and unchanged trend the third one is a decreasing trend such as urban built up areas and water bodies as shown in fig 8 the standard deviation of the multiyear average et of different land cover types does not differ significantly and its absolute value varies from 7 to 45 mm for example evergreen broad leaved forest 45 07 mm and paddy fields 45 55 mm have more considerable variability while bare land 7 62 mm and sparse vegetation land 9 31 mm have small variability the coefficients of variation cv of different land cover types are further calculated fig 8 red star line the most significant cv is construction land 0 072 followed by snow ice 0 053 forestland and other surface types in the middle and the water body 0 022 has the lowest coefficient of variation the interannual variability in surface types is greatly affected by human activities or a relatively weak ecological environment in addition overall et has shown a slightly increasing trend in rsr sc over the ten years under examination but further analysis is needed in combination with global climate change to explain this reason 5 2 3 variation trend of monthly et with a significantly warmer climate the significant trend in the monthly et for rsr sc from 2003 to 2016 presented obviously temporal spatial difference distribution characteristics fig 9 the largest increase appears in the south of this study area i e hengduan mountain area and its southern region during january to may and october to november followed by along the himalayan region during june to september and north qinghai tibet plateau during june to september the significantly decreasing trends of monthly et appears in the whole area in december followed by smaller regions in central and eastern rsr sc during june july and september as well as northwest during january to may more general the results of the trend show that the mean monthly et is significantly elevated for sparse vegetation covers at high altitudes or low altitudes and in humid areas and slight decreasing trend in the summer in some densely vegetated areas p 0 05 6 discussion 6 1 adjusted parameterization schemes for the sebs model a relatively simple way to parameterize land atmosphere heat transfer can be more easily defined from the bulk transfer equation based on the most chen et al 2019a however it is usually more difficult to determinate the values of suitable roughness parameters z0m z0h and kb 1 since it cannot be measured directly the calculation of surface roughness heights for momentum z0m and heat z0h transfer of the model is involved in many surface flux estimation models at present for regional surface flux estimation the calculation of surface roughness heights based on remote sensing data has the same characteristics but there is no widely accepted effective calculation method for example many empirical studies have shown that the relationship between the vegetation index ndvi and lai obtained from remote sensing data and surface roughness heights is universally applicable however for different study areas due to the differences in the surface climate environment spatial heterogeneity of surface variables and land cover types the forms of this relationship are various with different empirical coefficients for regional surface flux estimation many studies have relatively rough calculation schemes for surface roughness heights for instance chen et al 2019a showed that a more physical expression of the key parameters of surface roughness heights such as vertical leaf density leaf drag coefficient leaf heat transfer efficiency leaf shelter factor and subroughness correction solved the underestimation problem of sensible heat flux over forest canopies therefore we further investigate and adjust the submodel of the wind speed profile extinction coefficient massman et al 2017 and momentum transfer within the canopy chen et al 2019a using within canopy wind profile information explicitly the values for d1 in the drag coefficient term e d1 1 ξ and p1 in the shelter factor term 1 p1ha ξ are adjusted over very low canopies e g desert ssw desert bjt and swamp hbp medium canopies e g grassland nq grassland nmc grassland ars and maize dms and tall canopies e g shrub hbb and forest als sensitivity in fig 10 shows that for different canopies the performance of the turbulent heat flux model with the new updated scheme is reduced or enhanced along with adjusting d1 and p1 as expected among all the canopies the desert and swamp show minimal sensitivity almost constant values for mbe mape rmse and r by adjusting d1 and p1 grassland and cropland maize appear to have strong sensitivity however shrub and forest canopies show relatively low sensitivity and their essential causes need further investigation and analysis in the future nevertheless the corresponding d1 and p1 values can be selected through optimization and thus satisfactory h estimation results can be obtained over various land types with different roughness lengths therefore our research on both the mechanism and application practice has high value and significance as we all know since the surface roughness heights are the result of the combined action of the surface roughness element dynamics and thermodynamic factors in the wind and wave areas the influencing factors include the canopy surface of vegetation the leaf structure inside vegetation and the distribution structure among plants terrain surface temperature air temperature wind speed and wind direction with the in depth study of regional surface flux there is a strong demand for rapid and accurate estimation of the surface roughness heights for the regional heterogeneity underlying the surface liu et al 2021 for example it is worth noting that our adjusted z0h scheme is promising for bare land fig 3 ssw and fig 3 bjt in the future to achieve a new breakthrough studies on the parametric scheme of surface roughness heights must perform research across multiple disciplines and methods such as using various earth observation techniques different spatial statistical methods spatial scale conversion scale up and scale down methods and collaborative inversion of multisource remote sensing data as well as the most which are also essential g0 is an important component of surface energy balance due to the drastic change of soil temperature in surface heat flow g0 generally decreases exponentially with soil depth bhumralkar 1975 at present it is a basic method to calculate g0 by integrating the multi layer soil moisture and temperature observation data with the heat diffusion equation tanaka et al 2001 gao et al 2003 another empirical method is to approximate g0 by establishing the ratio γ of g0 rn however the relationship varies from region to region and there are some errors in the phase of the obtained g0 fuchs and hadas 1972 choudhury et al 1987 clothier et al 1986 bastiaanssen et al 2000 ma et al 2003 su 2002 this empirical strategy scheme is usually combined with remote sensing data to estimate g0 the empirical coefficient γ is closely related to surface characteristics for example the existing studies confirmed that the variability of γ was partially caused by variations in soil moisture idso et al 1975 clothier et al 1986 ogée et al 2001 however soil moisture is difficult to obtain in large areas and lst is often used as an alternative for heterogeneous surface in large regions although lst is sensitive to soil water it cannot wholly replace soil water and lst based schemes tend to have more empirical coefficients and poor regional applicability which limits their applicability over an extensive range moreover unlike the underlying surfaces where g0 takes up a relatively low proportion 0 35 of rn g0 of surfaces e g water bodies wetland and early rice paddy field usually takes up a higher proportion gan et al 2020 gan et al 2021b due to the heat storage effect of water gan et al 2020 however we note that the value of exact proportion here relies on local calibration using observational data from ground stations if widely applicable it needs greatly simplify the estimation of regional g0 with satellite remote sensing kustas et al 1993 in addition on the daily scale γ is small and the sign of soil heat in day and night is opposite which can be ignored the accurate estimation of g0 on different underlying surfaces still needs to be further examined in the future 6 2 instantaneous to daily temporal upscaling methods as described previously the regional surface et estimated by satellite tir remote sensing data is almost instantaneous et at present to meet the scientific research and practical application requirements in the fields of ecology hydrology and agriculture the temporal upscaling method from remotely sensed instantaneous observations is used to gain daily ten day monthly and yearly et with accurate long term record that are fully covered in general temporal upscaling includes two steps the first step is to directly use the temporal upscaling method of daily et from remotely sensed instantaneous observations for clear sky days and the second step is for cloudy days where the temporal reconstruction method is required from day to day however in this study the awlst data are innovatively used to completely overcome the defect in the lack of satellite tir data caused by cloud contamination zhou et al 2015 duan et al 2017 temporal upscaling from day to day is avoided to improve the estimation accuracy for example alfieri et al 2017 suggested that the use of temporal reconstruction is limited and a return interval of no more than five days is necessary for accurate daily et estimates thus a significant error introduced by using awlst products is completely avoided if the gap size is large at present the representative temporal upscaling methods of instantaneous to daily scales include constant evaporative fraction conef corrected conef coref diurnal evaporative fraction dief constant solar radiation ratio solrad constant reference evaporative fraction conetrf constant decoupling factor method and data assimilation jackson et al 1983 anderson et al 1997 van niel et al 2011 delogu et al 2012 tang et al 2017 xu et al 2015 there are significant differences in the process of temporal upscaling for daily et and its verification the estimation using the temporal upscaling method varies greatly for different climatic conditions and underlying surfaces different temporal upscaling methods also have different estimation accuracies during different seasons in a comparison of existing methods such as conef and dief the estimation accuracy is controversial the uncertainty of the field observation data also leads to an accuracy difference for the temporal upscaling method therefore due to the spatial heterogeneity and the differences in the regional environment it is difficult to evaluate a universal temporal upscaling method for daily et from instantaneous observations in this study based on the existing research and consolrad which requires fewer input parameters and is very stable two restrictions are added to the original method and a temporal upscaling method with more reliable accuracy that is suitable for all weather is developed for daily et therefore the estimation accuracy of surface et is improved fig 11 specifically the modified scheme has improved the accuracy for different land types especially in non growing seasons and the systematic overestimation of the original method was better corrected in addition it is worth noting that the modified scheme also presents better effects for typical rainy days such as dms doy207 and 230 ars doy207 220 and 227 and als doy207 224 226 and 258 however in this extreme case it is sunny at the overpass of the satellite while it is cloudy at other times in this scenario it is evident that the instantaneous value cannot wholly represent the daily value and thus it remains this is only a preliminary explanation of the error in the future it is still necessary to carry out in depth mechanism exploration and develop a temporal upscaling method from instantaneous to daily by remotely sensed observations which is suitable for all weather with more robust stability higher accuracy and stronger operability 6 3 variation trends of et with a significantly warmer climate the gistemp team 2020 had reported that average global temperatures rose by 0 51 c in the 30 years from the 1970 s to the end of the last century xu et al 2019 reported that under the condition of global warming the increasing trend of et can further enhance water vapor supply to some extent and the increase of water vapor content may alleviate the rapid depletion of glaciers and snow caused by global warming furthermore in the sensitive region of climate change kuang and jiao 2016 lapenis 2020 the response of land surface et to warming temperatures is still inconclusive ma et al 2019 and it shows the spatial heterogeneity of the change trend han et al 2021 et is an important part of hydrological cycle and plays an important role in regulating climate change especially in high altitude and cold regions zhang et al 2009 han et al 2021 in general the increase of air temperature can increase the dryness of the air which will lead to the increase of vpd and eventually lead to the increase of et however in the real natural environment such as the qinghai tibet plateau region the rise of temperature is accompanied by the increase of cloud coverage due to the influence of clouds the downward short wave radiation reaching the land surface decrease rapidly even exceeding the effect of the rise of air temperature roderick and farquhar 2002 and vice versa for example in fig 12 the temperature in the central part of rsr sc increases significantly from may to august while the et trend is not obvious and even shows a decreasing trend see fig 9 from may to august in addition the bare land ice and snow ecosystems may be more sensitive to warming with increasing altitude responding more quickly and feeding back into the regional hydrological cycle as shown in fig 9 and fig 12 the trends of temperature rises and et increase in the high altitude rsr sc from may to september shows obvious consistency the study of liu et al 2015 also shows this point nevertheless it can be seen from fig 9 and fig 12 that the variation trend of air temperature and et both present a decreasing trend in january and december in short under the background of significant global warming it is of great practical and scientific significance to strengthen the quantitative study of et variability in the rsr sc as the asian water tower and the birthplace of many rivers to examine its influence mechanism as well as to explore the impact of human activities 7 conclusion an accurate estimation of the spatially and temporally continuous et is essential in the monitoring of water resources and for conducting runoff prediction in large areas or at watershed scales in this study we develop a more physically realistic monitoring scheme of awet based on awlst by adjusting parameterization to monitor the et and its trends for a region with a vast aridity wetness gradient area the river source region in west china the awet is compared to in situ ec measurement and other et datasets and the validation results show that our dataset can reasonably capture the spatio temporal variation characteristics over rugged hybrid land surface types additionally we find that during construction of the instantaneous aerodynamic roughness parameterization scheme consideration of aerodynamic factors such as wind speed the three dimensional structure of the canopy and occlusion between canopies was indispensable the seasonal variations and spatio temporal patterns of the awet tend to be realistic reflecting the subtle variations among rivers valleys and farmland e g the zhangye oasis area in northwestern china can be seen in fig 5 top row besides a revised constant solar radiation ratio consolrad of the temporal upscaling method is further applied to estimate daily et from remotely sensed instantaneous observations in all weather conditions furthermore the response of variation trends of et to global the qinghai tibet plateau warming is obvious and positive in the high altitude himalayan region while it is not significant because of the negative feedback effect of cloud cover on radiation in the middle of the rsr sc this underscores the need for future research on the internal physical mechanism of et variation trends to enhance the addressing future climate change the awet estimation scheme in this study can also be used in global et studies based on multisource remote sensing data future work will focus on integrating the geostationary satellite lsts to further improve the accuracy of the all sky and all time et estimations from remotely sensed instantaneous observations by short period repeated observations author contributions y ma j zhou and s liu conceptualized the idea j zhou

2924,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is recognized as one of the most significant pathways for terrestrial nutrient entry into coastal systems however sgd derived nutrient fluxes particularly organic nutrients have not yet been considered in the management of mariculture areas we quantified both saline 12 5 cm day 1 and fresh 1 8 cm day 1 sgd and related nutrient fluxes using the radium quartet and water mass balance model respectively and then reassessed nutrient budgets in a typical mariculture bay although fresh sgd accounts for 13 of the total sgd it carries 7 4 80 5 of the total sgd nutrients suggesting that fresh sgd was an important source of new nutrients with high nitrogen to phosphorus n p ratios 585 into the coastal waters based on the rebuilt nutrient budgets total sgd and mariculture discharge were the two major nutrient sources into the coastal water providing 2 8 21 2 and 1 9 13 9 times more nutrients than local rivers respectively the nutrient speciation results revealed that sgd derived organic nutrients which are typically ignored were dominant i e dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus through sgd contributed about 22 9 and 41 5 of all nutrient resources furthermore china wide upscaling showed that sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the mariculture area along the coast of china are comparable those of the rivers in china therefore we suggest that sgd derived inorganic and organic nutrient fluxes should be incorporated into the ecosystem management of mariculture areas keywords submarine groundwater discharge mariculture nutrient speciation radium isotopes fresh groundwater primary productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ocean is considered a blue granary providing marine food of sustainable quality and yields that is of significant long term demand to humanity sun and ji 2022 over the last 40 years mariculture has grown at an average annual growth rate of 8 7 contributing nearly half of the total global food output production li et al 2016 nadarajah and flaaten 2017 fao 2020 as the world s largest mariculture producer chinese mariculture is recognized as a rapidly developing sustainable fishery model that is beneficial to effective restoration and improvement of the marine ecological environment conservation and enhancement of fishery stocks and sustainable development of the marine fishery economy yu and zhang 2020 qin et al 2021 in addition to topographic and hydrological factors the distributions and sources of nutrients in coastal waters play vital roles in the species structure and resource density in mariculture areas zhou et al 2019 previous studies on nutrient budgets and biogeochemical cycles in mariculture regions have primarily focused on the contribution of local riverine inputs and atmospheric deposition nhan et al 2008 bouwman et al 2013a yang et al 2021 as an important process occurring between land and ocean submarine groundwater discharge sgd and associated nutrient fluxes in mariculture regions have long been overlooked santos et al 2021 sgd is defined as all the water flow on the continental margin from the seabed to the coastal ocean regardless of fluid composition or driving force which includes fresh groundwater fresh sgd and recirculated seawater saline sgd burnett et al 2003 moore 2010 fresh sgd is driven by the terrestrial hydraulic gradient and originates from shallow or deep aquifers which intersect the coastline while saline sgd sometimes referred to as recirculated seawater is defined as saline subsurface water zzexchange through intertidal sediments or coastal seafloor and advective pore water exchange on a scale greater than 1 m burnett et al 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 santos et al 2021 sgd has been widely recognized as a significant transport pathway of dissolved solutes e g nutrients carbon and trace metals into coastal waters maher et al 2013 trezzi et al 2016 liu et al 2021 santos et al 2021 as a result marine scientists have been concerned about sgd and related dissolved substances which may alter the composition and structure of nutrients in coastal waters leading to environmental problems such as eutrophication hypoxia and harmful algae outbreaks hwang et al 2005a hu et al 2006 liu et al 2017a montiel et al 2019 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 douglas et al 2021a but may also sustain many ecosystems and ecosystem services in coastal areas hwang et al 2005b liu et al 2018 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 although fresh sgd contributes only a small percentage of the total sgd it may provide large amounts of new terrestrial nutrients to coastal waters and significantly impacts the coastal ecosystem lecher and mackey 2018 luijendijk et al 2020 santos et al 2021 however the relevant studies on the nutrient contribution of sgd in mariculture are still scarce wang et al 2018b peng et al 2021 several methods have been used to quantify sgd in coastal areas such as seepage meters e g taniguchi et al 2003 duque et al 2020 hydrogeological models e g oberdorfer 2003 luijendijk et al 2020 geophysical studies e g stieglitz et al 2008 dimova et al 2012 bighash and murgulet 2015 remote sensing e g johnson et al 2008 danielescu et al 2009 kelly et al 2013 and geochemical tracers e g cable et al 1996 swarzenski 2007 jiang et al 2021 with the development of radionuclide measurement the applications of radioactive isotope tracers in estimating sgd fluxes are gradually increasing burnett and dulaiova 2003 moore et al 2008 taniguchi et al 2019 in particular naturally occurring radium ra isotopes can be used as powerful tracers for identifying and quantifying sgd because they are widely enriched in coastal groundwater moore 1996 garcia orellana et al 2021 the main advantage of using ra isotopes is that it provides a comprehensive signal related to different groundwater pathways in coastal aquifers a combination of different ra isotopes can be used to concurrently determine water flows from different pathways origins and temporal scales charette et al 2008 tamborski et al 2017 in addition ra has been commonly used to estimate total sgd burnett et al 2006 garcia orellana et al 2021 therefore a combination of ra isotopes and hydrogeological models is generally applied to access the total and fresh sgd fluxes in local regions wang et al 2015 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2021a to date although there have been a large number of studies conducted on sgd and related nutrients worldwide santos et al 2021 studies directly related to fishery resources and aquaculture regions are still limited liu and du 2022 utsunomiya et al 2017 first reported that sgd derived nutrients could increase primary productivity in obama bay japan thereby directly increasing fish and invertebrate richness then fujita et al 2019 confirmed that sgd supplied high dissolved inorganic nutrient levels for p yokohamae providing direct evidence that sgd could improve fish feeding and growth in mariculture areas similarly previous findings suggested that sgd associated dissolved inorganic nutrients are also important in the typical chinese mariculture areas wang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 peng et al 2021 all these studies demonstrated that sgd derived nutrients have the potential to affect the mariculture ecosystem but few showed the potential impacts of fresh sgd which also promotes the growth of species in coastal mariculture areas starke et al 2020 moreover except for dissolved inorganic nutrients the importance of dissolved organic nutrients delivered by sgd has been confirmed in coastal waters kroeger et al 2006 santos et al 2012 2021 douglas et al 2021b and therefore should be considered in the nutrient biogeochemical cycles of mariculture regions most previous sgd studies have focused on inorganic nutrients while few studies have been done on organic nutrients douglas et al 2021b santos et al 2021 the nitrogen n cycle forms the basis of the food chain and is an important pathway for material transfer especially in mariculture systems bushaw et al 1996 yu et al 2012 lu et al 2020 eutrophication derived from increased land based n loading is probably the biggest factor altering coastal waters howarth et al 2002 lu et al 2020 recently rapid population growth and economic development in estuaries and coastal areas have led to the input of terrestrial n pollutants into rivers and groundwater and eventually into the coastal ocean resulting in outbreaks of hypoxia harmful algal blooms and eutrophication boyer et al 2006 lu et al 2016 jani and toor 2018 chen et al 2020a in coastal groundwater n is mainly presented as dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved organic nitrogen don however conversion between different n species can occur through several bacterial derived biogeochemical processes adyasari et al 2019 chen et al 2020b such as ammonification mineralization nitrification denitrification anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra an and gardner 2002 galloway and cowling 2002 mortimer et al 2004 jiao et al 2010 dan et al 2019 wong et al 2020 many studies have focused on din but relatively little information is available on the impact of other n species on the nutrient structure in coastal waters longnecker and kujawinski 2011 lu et al 2017 li et al 2019 douglas et al 2021a douglas et al 2021b in recently years n contamination has become widespread in coastal groundwater and surface water which has led to an awareness of the effects of don on nutrient structure qin et al 2015 knapp et al 2018 as a non conservative form of nitrogen don can be converted into din through biological and photochemical processes and released into coastal ecosystems resulting in changes in seawater quality sipler and bronk 2015 lu et al 2017 therefore don not only affects the function of the aquatic environment but also leads to shifts in the coastal nutrient structure phytoplankton species composition and primary production monchamp et al 2014 lu et al 2020 in this study we hypothesized that sgd derived nutrient fluxes are an important component of the nutrient budgets in mariculture bays ra isotopes and nutrients in seawater and coastal groundwater of a typical mariculture bay were investigated quantitatively estimate sgd and associated nutrient fluxes from fresh and saline components we attempted to estimate the total sgd fluxes by identifying all ra sources and sinks i e ra mass balance model and to obtain fresh sgd flux through a hydrogeological model the purpose of this study was to assess the significance of sgd in nutrient budgets and to evaluate the potential influence of sgd derived nutrients on the ecosystems of this mariculture bay 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dongshan bay dsb 23 68 23 96 n 117 33 117 65 e is a semi enclosed bay in fujian province china located in the southwestern part of the east china sea adjacent to the taiwan strait fig 1 a the total area of the bay is approximately 250 km2 with an average water depth of 5 8 m pan et al 2021 the annual average temperature and precipitation are 21 2 c and 1575 mm respectively li et al 2018 the dsb is characterized by an irregular semidiurnal tide with an average tidal range of 2 32 m chen et al 2010 the zhangjiang river has the largest runoff in the study area flowing into the bay from the north with an average annual freshwater discharge and suspended sediment of approximately 1 01 109 m3 and 4 19 105 t respectively xu et al 2017 the bay has abundant water resources and habitats that provide excellent mariculture grounds for a variety of fish shrimp shellfish and algae gao et al 2014 the mariculture area in dsb is approximately 73 8 km2 gao et al 2014 du et al 2016 xu et al 2021 and has become one of the main marine breeding bases in fujian province in recent years the rapid development of the dsb mariculture has not only promoted local socio economic growth but has also posed various problems such as the degradation in environmental quality and the occupation of other sea spaces liu et al 2019 consequently in order to manage mariculture production activities and facilitate the green development of fisheries in the dsb it is important to scientifically evaluate its carrying capacity and ecosystem previous studies in the dsb have primarily concentrated on other nutrients input chen et al 2014 xu et al 2017 but sgd one of its potential crucial sources has been long overlooked 2 2 sampling strategy fieldwork was conducted in september 2019 surface seawater n 26 30 l was collected for ra isotope measurements using a submersible pump at a depth of approximately 0 5 m below the air water interface groundwater samples were obtained from wells and pore water in the beaches around the coast of the dsb porewater samples n 5 15 l were collected with a push point piezometer using a peristaltic pump moore et al 2006 while well water n 17 50 l was collected as close to the bay as possible from the freshwater aquifer after draining the well using a submersible pump the water depths to water ranged from 0 8 to 30 m and most of the wells completely screened with caps so the samples collected would not be diluted directly by rainfall river water samples n 6 30 l were collected from the zhangjiang river to the dsb by salinity gradient 0 13 8 hydrological parameters such as salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen do in surface seawater groundwater and river water were measured in situ using a conductance temperature depth sensor multi 3430 wtw germany while salinity and temperature in seawater along the transect t1 were obtained from a calibrated multi parameter data logger aquatroll 600 in situ inc the ra samples were immediately filtered through columns filled with 20 g mn coated acrylic fibers at a flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 moore 1976 after using milli q water to wash the mn fiber for removing salt and loosely bound mno2 the water content of the mn fiber is adjusted to be approximately 75 by compressed air drying to ensure maximum emanation of rn from the mn fiber and obtain higher measurement efficiency moore 2008 the mn fiber was then brought back to the laboratory for measurement corresponding to the ra samples nutrient samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles that had been cleaned with hydrochloric acid and rinsed with milli q water after rinsing the bottle three times approximately 60 ml of the filtrate was collected after filtration through acid preconditioned acetate cellulose filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm saturated hgcl2 solution was added to the nutrient samples and were then stored in the dark until analysis in the laboratory 2 3 ra sediment diffusion experiment to simulate the ra process of bottom sediment diffusion 6 8 kg of surface sediment in the bay was used evenly covering the bottom of a 25 l polyethylene bucket from our observation the distribution of bottom sediments in the dsb was dominated by mud and sand so we conducted the diffusion indoor experiment by these two types of sediment and two parallel samples were set for each type sediment ra free seawater s 30 7 25 l was injected several times in small quantities 1 l each time to prevent agitations of the bottom sediments after leaving to sit untouched for more than 60 days to ensure an equilibrium between sediment diffusion and decay the water overlying the sediment was then extracted and passed through mno2 fiber columns as described in detail by beck et al 2007 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 radium analysis in the laboratory the short lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra were measured by radecc moore and arnold 1996 each sample has been measured three times in one month using the radecc system and the 224ra and 223ra data was described as excess 224ra and 223ra which are obtained by subtracting their parent radionuclides 228th and 227ac respectively moore 2008 the radecc detectors were calibrated by repeatedly measuring the 227ac and 232th standards the quantification of the 223ra and 224ra activities was performed according to the limits and guidelines provided by diego feliu et al 2020 the uncertainties in 223ra and 224ra were estimated to be approximately 20 and 5 respectively garcia solsona et al 2008 the long lived isotopes 226ra and 228ra were measured using gamma spectrometry ortec gwl 120 15 xlb awj briefly the fiber was burned at 800 c for approximately 8 h the ash was added to a 7 ml plastic vial and sealed with an epoxy sealant to achieve secular equilibrium between ra and its gamma daughters the ingrowth period was at least three weeks 226ra activities were obtained using 214pb 295 and 352 kev and 214bi 609 kev peaks while 228ra activities were obtained using the 338 and 911 kev peaks of 228ac the gamma spectrometry detector was calibrated using certified reference materials batch number 08121 obtained from the national institute of metrology china to ensure its accuracy liu et al 2017b 2 4 2 nutrient analysis nutrient samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic nutrients no2 no3 nh4 po4 3 and si oh 4 total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp using an auto analyzer skalar sanplus the no2 was measured using diazo azo method and the no3 was measured using the cadmium copper reduction method thereafter liu et al 2009 nh4 was measured using the sodium hypobromite oxidation method liu et al 2009 po4 3 and si oh 4 were measured using phosphomolybdenum blue method and the silicomolybdic complex method liu et al 2009 the din concentration was expressed as the sum of the no2 no3 and nh4 concentrations while nox is expressed as the sum of the no3 and no2 the tdn and tdp were measured using high temperature combustion methods sharp et al 2002 lee and westerhoff 2005 the concentrations of don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop are obtained by subtracting the dissolved inorganic nutrients from the total dissolved nutrients the analytical precisions of no2 no3 nh4 po4 3 don and dop were all better than 5 and the detection limits were 0 01 0 05 0 05 0 01 0 05 and 0 05 μmol l 1 respectively liu et al 2022 2 5 water age estimation water age can provide an available timescale for material to accumulate in the coastal bay and it usually must be known before estimating sgd flux firstly a physical method was adopted to estimate the flushing time which refers to the time it takes for the entire volume of a particular body of water to be removed through its open boundaries monsen et al 2002 this method is based on the following two assumptions 1 the influence of the wind in the bay can be ignored and 2 the bay water is well mixed this method is mainly based on the physical renewal ability of the bay water and is expressed as followed sanford et al 1992 moore et al 2006 1 t f v bay 1 b p t q r where t f is the flushing time in the dsb v bay is the volume of the dsb of 1 65 109 m3 q r is river discharge during our sampling period t is the time of one tidal period of 0 517 d p is the tidal prism which is 5 36 108 m3 at neap tide qin et al 2020 and b is reflow factor another method was used to calculate the water age namely residence time here is the time it takes for each material in the system to reach the outlet zimmerman 1976 the dsb water was assumed in the steady state and the increase and decrease of ra isotopes are constant and the equation can be written as moore et al 2006 2 τ f 224 r a 223 r a i 224 r a 223 r a λ 224 i 224 r a 223 r a λ 223 f 224 r a 223 r a where τ represents the residence time of dsb f 224 r a 223 r a is initial activity ratio input of the total flux of 224ra and 223ra in dsb i 224 r a 223 r a is the activity ratio of 224ra and 223ra inventories in measurement in surface water λ 224 and λ 223 are the decay constants of 224ra and 223ra which were 0 189 d 1 and 0 0608 d 1 respectively 2 6 sgd estimations 2 6 1 three endmembers mixing model due to the low regeneration rates of 226ra and 228ra the contribution from sediment diffusion is relatively low and assumed that this source could be negligible therefore the major sources of 226ra and 228ra in the surface water of dsb are rivers open sea water and groundwater the three endmembers mixing model is proposed using radium isotope and salinity to separate the fractions of river water groundwater and open sea water and then to estimate sgd flux the model was constructed by 228ra or 226ra salinity and water balance and can be expressed as follows moore et al 2006 3 f gw f r f o 1 4 r a r f r r a gw f gw r a o f o r a e 5 s r f r s gw f gw s o f o s e where subscripts gw r o and e represent coastal groundwater river water open seawater and bay water respectively f ra and s indicate the fraction radium activities and salinity respectively then the sgd flux m3 d 1 was obtained by the following equation 6 sgd v f gw t f 2 6 2 ra mass balance model there is usually a large amount of excess radium isotopes in dsb the radium masses balance model was established in the steady state system which was adapted from moore et al 2008 after all other radium sources and sinks have been estimated details were shown in appendix a radium isotopes fluxes attributed to sgd could be obtained the radium isotope sinks include decay f decay and mixing loss with open seawater f mix the sources include sediment diffusion f diff river input f river sgd f sgd and desorption of suspended particles f susp the eq 6 for the ra mass balance model can be written as follows 7 f mix f decay f diff f susp f river f sgd using the radium activity in the coastal groundwater endmember entering the system c gw dpm m 3 and ra fluxes through sgd f sgd dpm d 1 the sgd flux v m3 d 1 of the dsb was calculated by the following equation 8 v f sgd c gw 2 6 3 fresh sgd estimation following the method of wang et al 2015 a water salt mass balance model was established to estimate fresh sgd in the dsb the inputs of bay water include fresh sgd q sfgd river input q r precipitation q p wastewater discharge q w and inflow from the open sea q s the outputs of bay water include outflow to the open sea q o and evaporation q e assuming that the water body of dsb is in a stable state in which the total water inflow is equal to the water outflow then the water mass balance can be represented as follows 9 q s q r q fsgd q w q p q o q e 10 q o v bay t f the inventory of salt in dsb is the result of mixing between freshwater and seawater from outside the bay it can be represented as follows 11 m s s f v f s s v s where m s is the total salt mass stored in dsb s s and s f are the salinity of seawater from outside dsb and freshwater respectively v f and v s are the volumes of freshwater and seawater from outside dsb respectively the salinity of freshwater is zero so the equation can be simplified as follows 12 v s m s s s based on the definition of flushing time t f q s v s t f the following formula can be obtained 13 q s m s t f s s combined with the equations above q fsgd can be represented by 14 q fsgd 1 t f v bay m s s s q e q p q r 3 results 3 1 basic hydrological parameters in the dsb in the surface water of the dsb the temperature ranged from 28 0 to 33 7 c fig 2 a in contrast salinity ranged from 18 4 to 33 7 and showed a gradually increasing trend from the head to the mouth of the bay fig 2b to explore the vertical mixing of water column transect t1 s profile was selected for observation fig 3 the results indicated that the water of the dsb is well mixed in the coastal groundwater salinity ranged from 0 1 to 5 7 in coastal well water and 27 2 to 31 0 in porewater while temperature in coastal well water 23 5 to 28 5 c and porewater 23 9 to 25 8 c were more consistent supplementary table s1 the do ranged from 3 80 to 6 69 mg l 1 in well water and 0 35 to 1 54 mg l 1 in porewater in river water the salinity ranged from 0 to 13 8 and the temperature ranged from 30 5 to 32 5 c in open sea water the salinity was 34 5 and temperature was 28 3 c 3 2 spatial distributions of radium isotopes in surface water

table s1 contrary to salinity the concentrations of ra quartets decreased from the embayment to the open sea the relationship between salinity and ra in surface water showed that ra activities were higher than those derived from conservative mixing between the zhangjiang river and open seawater fig 4 in coastal groundwater 223ra and 224ra activities varied from 0 9 to 257 0 dpm 100 l 1 x 38 4 5

surface water were selected as the coastal groundwater endmembers n 16 in particular the sampling level was deep for sites gw 5 and gw 6 which was not considered as endmember for fresh sgd as a result the median values of ra activities dpm 100 l 1 were 8 9 1 7 for 223ra 254 5 9 6 for 224ra 91 4 4 1 for 226ra and 317 9 4 4 for 228ra in the river water 224ra and 223ra activities varied from 19 2 to 144 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 5 9 0 9 dpm 100 l 1 n 6 and 0 7 to 22 4 dpm 100 l 1 x 81 0 3 4 dpm 100 l 1 n 6 respectively fig 5a b 226ra and 228ra activities ranged from 23 3 to 43 1 dpm 100 l 1 x 35 4 1 9 dpm 100 l 1 n 6 and 46 6 to 157 4 dpm 100 l 1 x 98 8 3 3 dpm 100 l 1 n 6 respectively fig 5c d here the highest value was selected as river water endmember and the ra desorbed completely from suspended particulate matter in the river at the salinity of 13 8 radium activity in coastal groundwater was significantly higher than that in surface water and river water 3 3 spatial distributions of nutrient in surface water and coastal groundwater in the surface water of the dsb the no3 concentration varied from 4 5 to 102 2 µmol l 1 x 31 5 29 6 µmol l 1 n 25 the nh4 concentration varied from 2 8 to 27 8 µmol l 1 x 9 6 6 5 µmol l 1 n 25 and the no2 concentration varied from 0 2 to 8 5 µmol l 1 x 3 6 1 5 µmol l 1 n 25 the din concentration varied from 9 1 to 127 0 µmol l 1 x 44 6 34 2 µmol l 1 n 25 the dip concentration ranged from 0 3 to 2 6 µmol l 1 x 1 3 0 8 µmol l 1 n 25 the don concentration varied from 0 3 to 60 2 µmol l 1 x 29 0 16 3 µmol l 1 n 25 and the dop concentration varied from 0 04 to 5 7 µmol l 1 x 2 3 1 1 µmol l 1 n 25 table s1 fig 6 the distribution of nutrients in surface water showed an increasing trend from land to ocean the concentrations of nutrients in the coastal groundwater of the dsb exhibited a wide range table s1 fig 7 the no3 concentration varied from 5 1 to 3370 3 µmol 1 with an average of 811 5 933 0 µmol l 1 n 25 the nh4 concentration varied from 1 1 to 485 9 µmol l 1with an average of 48 8 110 4 µmol l 1 n 25 and the no2 concentration varied from 0 1 to 47 9 µmol l 1 with an average of 3 4 10 2 µmol l 1 n 25 the din concentration ranged from 26 5 to 3506 0 µmol l 1 x 860 7 924 7 n 22 while the dip concentration varied from 0 5 to 16 6 µmol l 1 x 7 5 12 5 n 22 the don concentration varied from 23 5 to 115 6 µmol l 1 x 65 8 29 9 n 10 and the dop concentration varied from 0 1 to 78 4 µmol l 1 x 12 0 22 3 n 10 the nutrient concentrations in the coastal groundwater are generally higher than those in surface seawater which may also indicate that groundwater carries a large amount of nutrients into the bay 3 4 water ages and sgd flux in the dsb based on the physical model with the parameters table a1 the flushing time in dsb is 13 0 1 8 days moreover radium isotopes imported into our study system mainly came from coastal groundwater input with an average 224ra 223ra ratio of 35 2 22 1 the 224ra 223ra ratio at each station was used to estimate the residence time at each station resulting in a mean residence time of 13 8 8 4 days in the dsb the calculated result is very close to the flushing time value it showed that the results calculated by the two methods are reliable therefore we took the average of the two methods 13 4 5 1 d for subsequent calculations in the three endmembers mixing model the salinity of the coastal groundwater endmember was 9 87 and the average 228ra and 226ra activities were 679 0 6 3 dpm 100 l 1 and 223 0 3 6 dpm 100 l 1 respectively at the sampling period the river endmember had a mean salinity of 13 8 and the averaged 228ra and 226ra activities were 157 4 3 2 dpm 100 l 1 and 43 1 1 6 dpm 100 l 1 the open seawater endmember had a mean salinity of 34 5 and the average activities were 15 7 1 8 dpm 100 l 1 for 228ra and 41 1 2 9 dpm 100 l 1 for 226ra the average salinity of surface water was 29 3 and the average concentrations of 228ra and 226ra were 679 0 6 3 dpm 100 l 1 and 223 0 3 6 dpm 100 l 1 respectively the constants and calculated values used in this model were shown in table a1 according to eqs 3 5 the average proportion of open seawater reflux factor coastal groundwater and river water during sampling period was 76 5 18 9 8 3 5 9 and 15 2 21 8 based on 226ra while those values were 76 9 18 7 10 3 8 4 and 12 8 21 1 based on 228ra therefore the estimated sgd flux m3 d 1 was 1 3 1 0 107 4 5 3 7 cm d 1 for 228ra and 1 0 0 7 107 3 6 2 6 cm d 1 for 226ra based on eq 6 fig 8 furthermore the sources and sinks of the four radium isotopes was estimated and the details were presented in the appendix appendix a2 based on eq 7 the radium fluxes through sgd were estimated to be 7 7 5 5 109 dpm d 1 for 223ra 2 4 0 1 1011 dpm d 1 for 224ra 6 1 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 for 228ra and 1 8 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 for 226ra dpm d 1 comparing all sources and sinks of radium in the study area table a1 we suggest that sgd was the dominant source for ra accounting for 51 4 93 5 generally speaking the ra activity in groundwater is higher than that of surface seawater and to obtain a conservative sgd flux we excluded those values that are lower than the mean value of surface seawater and then took the median value for the rest which were 254 5 9 6 for 224ra 8 9 1 7 for 223ra 317 8 4 4 for 228ra and 91 4 4 1 for 226ra sgd fluxes m3 d 1 via radium mass balance models were calculated to be 8 6 6 2 107 for 223ra 30 4 21 8 cm d 1 9 6 0 3 107 for 224ra 33 8 1 0 cm d 1 1 9 0 1 107 for 228ra 6 8 0 1 cm d 1 and 1 9 0 1 107 for 226ra 6 8 0 3 cm d 1 fig 8 moreover from the combined conceptual water mass and salt mass balance models which showed in eq 9 each input and output of water terms was calculated and summarized table a1 resulting in the fresh sgd flux in the dsb of 5 1 1 9 106 m3 d 1 1 8 0 7 cm d 1 3 5 sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the dsb the nutrient fluxes from sgd were conventionally estimated by multiplying the total sgd flux by the concentration of the coastal groundwater endmember e g moore et al 2006 rodellas et al 2015 however because of the selection of coastal groundwater endmembers considerable uncertainty existed in the sgd derived nutrient flux estimation and it might have been overestimated if we did not distinguish between the fresh sgd and saline sgd luo et al 2018 tamborski et al 2018 liu et al 2021 for the fresh sgd we assumed that salinity in groundwater endmembers was less than 5 which collected from well water and the median concentrations of endmember were 1105 5 µmol l 1 for din 1 7 µmol l 1 for dip 64 9 μmol 1 for don and 6 1 µmol l 1 for dop while for the saline sgd the endmembers were collected from coastal tidal flat with a salinity of more than 5 it is worth noting that when dealing with rsgd fluxes the concentration in overlying waters need to be subtracted from the concentration in the saline gw endmember cook et al 2018 resulting in 35 0 µmol l 1 for din 3 1 μmol l 1 for dip 39 1 for don and 3 6 µmol l 1 for dop consequently fresh sgd derived nutrient fluxes mol d 1 were estimated to be 5 1 2 0 106 for din 8 8 3 3 103 for dip 3 3 1 3 105 for don and 3 1 1 2 104 for dop saline sgd derived nutrient fluxes mol d 1 were estimated to be 1 2 0 4 106 for din 1 1 0 4 105 for dip 1 4 0 5 106 for don and 1 3 0 4 105 for dop as a result total sgd derived nutrient fluxes mol d 1 were 6 4 2 4 106 for din 1 2 0 4 105 for dip 1 7 0 6 106 for don and 1 6 0 5 105 for dop 3 6 nutrient budgets in the dsb for better understanding the significance of sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the dsb ecosystem the din and dip budgets were estimated generally in such mariculture coastal bay the din and dip sources include riverine input sediment release atmospheric deposition wastewater mariculture discharge and sgd while sinks come from phytoplankton mixing loss to the open sea shellfish and fish aquaculture harvest and organic detrital degradation when summarizing all the sources and sinks of nutrient the total din and dip fluxes input to the dsb were 1 0 107 mol d 1 and 2 0 105 mol d 1 respectively while fluxes output from the dsb were 3 4 107 mol d 1 and 1 1 107 mol d 1 respectively the details are presented in the appendix a3 4 discussion 4 1 sgd fluxes comparisons and uncertainty analysis comparing the sgd fluxes obtained by the three endmembers model and ra mass balance models the sgd rates ranged from 3 6 to 33 8 cm d 1 the 224ra and 223ra based models lead to the highest sgd fluxes fig 8 because of their short half lives 224ra and 223ra reach secular equilibrium with the sediment derived parent nuclides more quickly than 228ra and 226ra luo and jiao 2016 while the lowest sgd rates were yielded from three endmembers models which were mostly based on water mass balance and did not include a component of recirculated seawater like the mass balance models luo and jiao 2016 overall the sgd fluxes were in good agreement among the different sgd models fig 8 and we thought that the weighted average sgd rate of the six models may represent the full extent of the fluids discharging into the dsb therefore the sgd flux ranged from 1 0 107 m3 d 1 to 9 6 107 m3 d 1 and the average sgd flux in the dsb was estimated to be 4 1 1 4 107 m3 d 1 14 3 4 9 cm d 1 approximately 14 6 times that of the zhangjiang river discharge 2 77 106 m3 d 1 during our sampling period generally fresh sgd represents a net water source in the coastal bay in the dsb fresh sgd contributes approximately 13 of the total sgd but was two times the zhangjiang river discharge into the dsb indicating that fresh sgd was one of the significant freshwater sources entering the dsb the saline sgd flux was estimated to be 3 5 1 2 107 m3 d 1 it follows that saline sgd flux contributes approximately 87 of the total sgd and is the dominant component of sgd in the dsb usually saline sgd is considered to be driven by tidal and wave pumping which force seawater through the sediment seawater interface and exchange with porewater due to the long coastline and high tidal range in the dsb saline sgd occurs ubiquitous along the coastline where seawater exchange with coastal porewater resulting in a high saline sgd flux in the dsb moreover as reviewed by taniguchi et al 2019 saline sgd process may also include additional advective processes like wave setup bioturbation or gas bubble upwelling which could drive water and nutrient fluxes from the land to the coastal water in this study all uncertainties in sgd flux quantifications were estimated based on the errors of the measurement and followed the basic rules of error propagation gonneea et al 2014 sadat noori et al 2015 from the ra isotope mass balance model there are many factors affecting sgd calculation a variation of 10 in residence time would cause a change of 2 1 12 9 in sgd flux estimation indicating that the residence time of the water body in the dsb is still sensitive to sgd flux calculation for the diffusion of bottom sediments the uncertainties of 226ra and 228ra are small on account of its long half lives and low regeneration ability while the uncertainties of 223ra and 224ra are relatively larger on account of the short regeneration time and a 20 error of diffusion flux can lead to 11 6 17 3 in sgd flux uncertainty furthermore river inputs and ra decay losses are low and do not strongly influence the ra mass balance model for the three endmembers model eqs 3 5 the uncertainty for sgd calculation is mainly caused by the activity of 226ra and 228ra in the coastal groundwater end member the activities of 226ra and 228ra in coastal groundwater endmembers produced an uncertainty of 20 which resulted in an uncertainty of 16 7 36 0 for sgd for the water mass balance model the main factor that affects the sgd calculation is the flushing time a variation of 20 in residence time would result in 21 8 26 6 change in the fresh sgd flux estimation it is worth noting that the collection and selection of coastal groundwater endmembers would also cause uncertainty in sgd calculation here the average value of groundwater endmember is used for sgd estimation so the total sgd flux can be calculated to be 1 4 0 6 107 m3 d 1 therefore the use of the average value for sgd estimation will lead to 66 reduction in sgd flux which may be due to the abnormal value in groundwater endmember values so the median value of groundwater endmember was used for calculation actually although the strategy of groundwater collection and the endmember selections of radium in our study are the most popular ways in such sgd studies it is still based on an assumption that no transformation on the radium signature of groundwater from the sampling point to the discharge point 4 2 din and dip fluxes and budgets sgd derived nutrients are usually crucial nutrient sources in coastal regions e g hwang et al 2005b kim and kim 2011 wang et al 2018b in the dsb although fresh sgd flux represented only a small fraction of total sgd fresh sgd derived nutrients were equally important especially for din fresh sgd can contribute up to 80 5 of the din flux carried by total sgd if we applied the conventional estimation based on the total sgd flux and all nutrient samples in coastal groundwater to obtain nutrient flux via sgd of the results would be 3 3 1 1 107 mol d 1 1 4 0 5 105 mol d 1 2 7 0 9 106 mol d 1 and 4 8 1 7 105 mol d 1 which were elevated by 422 19 55 and 204 for din dip don and dop respectively compared to our above calculation the results of comparison highlighted the necessity of distinguishing the components of sgd and estimating nutrient fluxes through fresh sgd and saline sgd separately in order to avoid overestimating sgd derived nutrient fluxes meanwhile similar to the radium endmember here nutrient endmembers in groundwater were selected based on an assumption as well that was no nutrient transformation from the sampling point to the discharge point actually it is inevitable that nutrients concentrations in coastal aquifers would change as it is transported from the sampling point to the discharge point slomp and van cappellen 2004 and the groundwater sampling depth and distance to the bay are the main factors that influence the assumption therefore in this study the well water and porewater we sampled were as close to the bay as possible in order to obtain the most potential groundwater discharges to the bay moreover considering the spatial variations of nutrient concentrations in our collected groundwater samples this assumption was thought to be acceptable and widely used in such sgd related studies thus leading to reliable nutrient fluxes transported from sgd to the dsb according to the din and dip budgets the din flux into the dsb through all the considered sources was much higher than that of the dip fig 9 fresh sgd contributed 50 8 19 4 of din and 4 4 1 7 of dip whereas saline sgd contributed 12 3 4 1 and 55 3 18 6 respectively in total din and dip fluxes input through sgd were 7 8 and 21 2 times the river input thus the sgd derived nutrient input is a crucial source of nutrients in the bay mariculture discharge contributed 21 2 and 33 3 of din and dip respectively it is worth noting that a portion of coastal wastewater and mariculture discharge seeped into aquifers and was discharged as coastal groundwater consequently the value of inorganic nutrient flux through coastal groundwater was conservative in addition we found that the total sources were smaller than the sinks there may be some sources that were not considered in the system such as discharged from products of shallow sea mariculture and the conversion of organic n and p which also provided the material basis for the inorganic nutrients in the dsb which will be discussed in the following section nitrogen is generally the most important nutrient in sgd and few studies have reported detailed n morphological data santos et al 2021 in this study the no3 concentration in fresh gw was much higher than that in saline sgd fig 10 a fresh sgd derived no3 flux was the main component of din flux 98 of the total inorganic nitrogen species because the effect of denitrification was much less in fresh sgd with less organic matter saline sgd derived nh4 flux was the main component of din flux 99 of the total inorganic nitrogen species on the one hand the high nh4 concentration in saline sgd was produced by the degradation of organic matter wilhelm et al 1994 chen et al 2020b on the other hand due to the oxygen deficient environment in porewater no3 can be consumed and converted to nh4 resulting in a high nh4 concentration in saline sgd brooks et al 2021 the reduced nitrogen nh4 in the surface water can be regenerated in situ through zooplankton excretion or bacterial remineralization whereas oxidized nitrogen no3 comes from an external supply system dugdale and goering 1967 bronk et al 1994 such as rivers and groundwater during the long hours of hot sunshine in the summer when photosynthesis occurs the oxygen content of the surface water is relatively high resulting in high organic matter concentration and low nutrient levels external inputs have become the main factor controlling the form of inorganic nitrogen in the surface water herbert 1999 moreover nox removal and nh4 production in surface seawater occurring at sgd and or river driven trophic levels can be attributed to the action of dissimilated nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra dnra can not only permanently and effectively remove nox but also lead to non negligible nh4 production previous studies have shown that high concentrations of dnra consume significant nitrate concentrations and are more significant than other biochemical processes such as denitrification and anammox fernandes et al 2012 giblin et al 2013 roberts et al 2014 previous studies have shown that dnra processes are more important than denitrification processes for no3 which increases at higher doc levels and acts as an electron donor kessler et al 2018 mariculture also had an important impact on the nitrogen cycle as shellfish breeding in the dsb released large amounts of nox with biological effects during the sampling period therefore dnra plays a major role in the biochemical transformation of nox in the mariculture areas and dominates the direct impact of mariculture high summer water temperatures reduced nitrate reductase activity and affected the assimilation of no3 and nh4 in addition fresh sgd carried high concentrations of no3 and po4 3 into the bay providing a higher din load than river input compared to surface water fresh sgd had a smaller nh4 no3 ratio which can significantly change the nutrient ratio in surface water of the dsb overall the input of fresh sgd is more important for changing the phytoplankton community structure although saline sgd accounted for a larger proportion of sgd the nh4 no3 ratio was smaller than that in fresh sgd and was subject to environmental influences and is not likely to change substantially over the course of a year jiao et al 2010 furthermore because the bay water is vertically well mixed the nutrients released by the sediments are transported upward which can also increase the nutrient content of the surface water yin 2003 xu et al 2010 even so sgd derived fluxes play an important role in influencing the inorganic nutrients in surface seawater of the dsb in addition many sgd studies have emphasized no3 because anthropogenic activities typically produce large amounts of no3 andersen et al 2007 bertics et al 2010 in addition the widespread phytoplankton community plays an important role in the bioavailability of nh4 and contributes to the dynamic transformation of n ammonium in surface water may be converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria plankton thus nitrate is not always from an external source as ammonium autochthonously produced by photooxidation of organic matter and bacteria plankton middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2000 meanwhile a few studies have reported that don was also the dominant form of n in sgd douglas et al 2021a b santos et al 2021 which has the potential to reflect the serious affects by local pollution sources such as mariculture discharge and wastewater discharge on the coastal waters to evaluate the degree of eutrophication of surface seawater in the dsb the data of inorganic nutrients were used to calculate the redfield ratio n p si ratio and the ratio diagram of si n and si p was plotted fig 10c ratios of n p 16 indicated that n was a limiting element whereas ratios 16 indicated that p was a limiting element for phytoplankton growth nguyen et al 2019 lu et al 2020 in surface water of the dsb nitrogen is dominated by no3 and nh4 with high concentrations relative to p leading to p limitation for phytoplankton growth in dsb surface water fig 10c if the nutrient ratio from various sources differs significantly from the redfield ratio the nutrient ratio of different source inputs to coastal waters fig 10c may limit primary production and affect biological communities conley et al 2011 santos et al 2021 generally in the absence of anthropogenic sources coastal regions are nitrogen limited because of the efficient coupling between absorption by primary producers microbial mineralization and denitrification from sediments howarth and marino 2006 therefore high din dip or din dsi ratio of fresh groundwater input can promote phytoplankton growth 4 3 the comparison of don and dop major sources similar to din and dip the don and dop sources were also estimated in the dsb the n and p cycles of the dsb are strongly influenced by human activities which alter inflow and pathways resulting in eutrophication and increased oxygen consumption similarly the don and dop fluxes through bottom sediment diffusion were estimated to be 1 6 0 5 105 and 4 4 0 8 103 mol d 1 respectively based on the results of atmospheric deposition of don and dop by chen et al 2015 and wang et al 2018a the don and dop deposition rates were 129 and 0 05 mmol m 2 yr 1 respectively resulting in the fluxes of 1 0 105 mol d 1 for don and 4 2 101 mol d 1 for dop according to zheng 2019 the nutrient fluxes through mariculture discharge were estimated to be 3 6 106 mol d 1 for don and 1 1 105 mol d 1 for dop in the bay the riverine don and dop fluxes were 2 6 105 and 5 7 104 mol d 1 respectively combining all the organic nutrient sources considered fig 11 fresh sgd contributed 4 4 1 7 of don and 8 1 3 1 of dop while saline sgd accounted for 18 5 6 2 and 33 4 11 2 of the total sources for don and dop respectively highlighting the importance of sgd on transporting organic nutrients to the dsb mariculture discharge reached 47 9 of don and 28 2 of dop and is recognized as the most predominant source of organic nutrients in the dsb in comparison the organic nutrient input from the river water was a minor source contributing 3 5 of don and 14 8 of dop based on the results of nutrient sources sgd was the substantial source of n in the dsb previous studies have focused on din that is more readily available to primary producers while ignoring the slower assimilation rate of sgd associated don in primary production as its contribution is currently unknown kroeger et al 2006 santos et al 2021 the don in groundwater usually originates from soil leachate that penetrates underground estuaries zooplankton excretion and leaching of microbial and algal biomass so don increases in coastal regions and groundwater generally constitutes a large pool of don kroeger et al 2006 sipler and bronk 2015 douglas et al 2021a santos et al 2021 in addition the conversion of n during groundwater transport may affect the chemical form of n which is then discharged into rivers or coastal waters in the dsb nutrients in fresh groundwater were dominated by nox while saline groundwater river water and surface seawater were all dominated by don fig 10d it is generally accepted that almost all the n in aquifers is in the form of nox with ammonification and nitrification occurring in unsaturated sediments above aquifers nox is sufficiently mobile in the soil to be transported in large quantities to the aquifers bouwman et al 2005 moreover mineralization adsorption and complexation of nox as well as adsorption and nitrification of nh4 occur during nitrogen transportation in unsaturated sediments and aquifers cronan and aiken 1985 wilhelm et al 1994 kroeger et al 2006 thereby the don concentrations in saline groundwater were usually higher than those in fresh groundwater corbet et al 2002 kroeger et al 2006 don was relatively high in uncontaminated groundwater although it may also originate from anthropogenic sources because of the high don contribution through sgd fig 9 even a small amount of instability can affect the final amount of nitrogen available for primary producers in general don represents a large fraction of the nitrogen in sgd typically the estuarine dop was dominant in low salinity s 10 and high salinity s 25 regions while the medium salinity s 10 20 region was dominated by dip with the proportion of dip up to 75 lin et al 2012 the dip inventory in the dsb was deficient with dip inputs far from sufficient to support the aquaculture harvest this dip deficiency reveals the existence of other p sources in the dsb such as regenerative cycling of dip in the water and sediments especially the conversion of dop to dip due to the large dop inventory in the water column dip is the form most readily available to phytoplankton and other aquatic microorganisms karl and craven 1980 björkman and karl 1994 lin et al 2012 owing to dip in biological debris and excrement the produced phosphate can rapidly return to the upper water layer after chemical decomposition and water dissolution ziegler and benner 1999 in general dop must be decomposed and oxidized by bacteria into dip which enters the cycling process dyhrman and palenik 1999 therefore the regeneration and recycling of p in the dsb may be an important supplement to dip furthermore dop is a potential source of phosphorus that can be directly utilized by phytoplankton karl and craven 1980 björkman and karl 1994 it is important to note that nutrients from sgd bottom sediment diffusion and atmospheric deposition were supplied into the entire bay whereas nutrients released from mariculture were predominantly derived from mariculture regions fig 1b although high concentrations of nutrients are only present in or around the mariculture areas the large tidal difference in the bay results in a rapid dilution of nutrients after release so the influence is also considerable in the entire dsb however extensive fishing and oyster farming in the bay mouth has resulted in slow water flow and nutrient accumulation in the bay as a result nutrients through sgd and mariculture discharge were the dominant sources in the dsb which may alter the nutrient structure and lead to p limitation 4 4 impact of sgd and mariculture discharge derived nutrients on primary production compared with the low nutrient fluxes of other external sources in the bay the nutrients contributed by mariculture discharge and sgd may not be able to directly increase phytoplankton primary productivity but mariculture may have an impact on the local environment in the study region the main components of din discharged from mariculture were nh4 and no3 which are the most favorable chemical forms of n for phytoplankton and macroalgae troell et al 2003 qi et al 2019 during our sampling season the average primary production in the dsb water was reported to be 595 mg c m 2 d 1 zhang et al 2014 based on the redfield ratio the assimilated ratio of n to p for phytoplankton was assumed to be 16 1 therefore sgd and mariculture contributed 350 and 118 based on n and 104 and 58 based on p respectively for the requirements of phytoplankton growth in the dsb in addition to direct effects mariculture discharge may also affect phytoplankton growth by changing the nutrient structure n p ratio within or around mariculture regions in the dsb the average n p ratio in surface water was 33 1 which was much higher than the redfield ratio fig 12 indicating that phytoplankton growth was restricted by p in the mariculture discharge the n p ratio 32 5 was slightly higher than that in the surface water whereas the n p ratio in sgd 237 was significantly higher a portion of the water with a high n p ratio from sgd into the bay water would be diluted by mariculture activities moreover mariculture discharge could help neutralize the high n p ratio from sgd this may explain why algal blooms did not occur in the dsb despite high din concentrations of course algal outbreaks are the result of many factors such as water temperature salinity nutrient level etc so robust and in depth relevant research is warranted 4 5 comparison to other mariculture areas on the global scale 4 5 1 importance of sgd derived nutrients in global mariculture regions to facilitate comparison the current study summarized the available case studies on sgd in mariculture areas globally and normalized the sgd fluxes and associated nutrients to the unit area table 1 the main mariculture species in the case studies were shellfish and fish with sgd variations over a range of 0 05 310 cm d 1 which encompassed the normalized sgd rate in the dsb 14 3 4 9 cm d 1 moreover the sgd rate in the dsb was comparable to the other two asian mariculture areas of the yeoja bay and the gamak bay which had similar area of the study region and mariculture species to the dsb hwang et al 2005b hwang et al 2010 in addition compared to other domestic mariculture areas the dsb had a similar sgd rate to the laoye lagoon and the sanggou bay ji et al 2013 wang et al 2014 but was higher than that in the daya bay wang et al 2018b and was lower than that in the maowei bay and the xiangshan bay chen et al 2018 peng et al 2021 the normalized din and dip rates in the dsb were 22 5 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 4 0 1 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively which were much higher than those in the daya bay wang et al 2018b that may be related to the larger scale of mariculture in the dsb and the severe environmental impacts of human activities such as mariculture and wastewater discharge although the sgd derived nutrient rate in the dsb seems similar to that in other regions sgd plays a crucial role in the environment of mariculture regions it is worth noting that there is almost no research on dissolved organic matter through sgd in global mariculture therefore our study on sgd associated dissolved organic nutrients in mariculture regions can provide basic data for global relevant research coastal ecosystems are under various environmental pressures worldwide owing to the rapid development of maricultural activities bouwman et al 2013b suárez abelenda et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2017 mariculture discharges large amounts of nitrogen phosphorus organic matter and total suspended solid into coastal waters through mariculture activities affecting the nutrient structure of coastal ecosystems on the one hand sgd and associated nutrients can improve the primary productivity of coastal waters thus promoting the growth of aquaculture species such as algae fish and shellfish and have a positive impact on their production hwang et al 2005b utsunomiya et al 2017 andrisoa et al 2019 wang et al 2021b on the other hand sgd has also been shown to endanger the health of mariculture species due to the associated input of pollutants valiela et al 1992 mcclelland et al 1997 montiel et al 2019 carroll et al 2021 conversely the nutrient enriched seawater in mariculture areas especially the coastal aquaculture ponds may intrude into the underlying multilayered aquifers thereby affecting sgd and the nutrient loads carried to the nearby coastal waters tal et al 2017 liu and du 2022 therefore the influence of sgd in the sustainable development of mariculture is worthy of attention and it is also a crucial issue in future mariculture related research to provide basic data reference for the management of mariculture and sustainable chinese fishery resources china has the largest mariculture production in the world accounting for over half of the total global mariculture production wang et al 2020 the current study attempted to evaluate the sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the whole mariculture areas along the chinese coasts to reduce the uncertainty caused by extreme values and to estimate the sgd flux in the chinese mariculture area the median value of all cases was used for the estimation the median sgd rate of chinese mariculture areas is 14 7 4 38 cm d 1 and sgd associated nutrient fluxes are 26 6 21 3 mmol m 2 d 1 of din and 0 2 0 3 mmol m 2 d 1 of dip according to data from the china fishery statistics yearbook for the sampling year fisheries administration bureau 2020 chinese mariculture covers a total area of 2 0 104 km2 therefore the sgd flux of the chinese mariculture regions is 2 9 0 9 109 m3 d 1 and sgd associated nutrient fluxes are 5 3 4 3 108 mol d 1 for din and 4 6 6 8 106 mol d 1 for dip according to zhang et al 2020 the total sgd flux along the chinese coastline was 1 5 2 8 1010 m3 d 1 and the total sgd related nutrient fluxes were 1 4 4 6 109 mol d 1 for din and 1 1 3 1 107 mol d 1 for dip sgd derived nutrient flux in the chinese mariculture areas accounted for 18 of din and 22 of dip of the total sgd along the chinese coastline which emphasized that the sgd in the mariculture areas also play an important role in coastal nutrient sources moreover the nutrient fluxes through rivers to chinese coastal seas were 4 4 108 mol d 1 of din and 4 7 106 mol d 1 of dip zhang et al 2020 so the sgd derived din and dip fluxes from the chinese mariculture areas accounted for 1 2 and 1 0 times those of rivers respectively it is worth noting that coastal mariculture areas are highly connected with coastal groundwater aquifers therefore water with high nutrient levels in the mariculture areas can be frequently exchanged with coastal groundwater altering the chemical composition and flux of sgd this may affect the outward transportation of solutes through sgd montiel et al 2019 4 5 2 possible mitigation strategies for nutrients from sgd and mariculture discharge from the nutrient structure the input of nutrients with high n p has the potential to increase the n p ratio in the water column of the dsb large amounts of nutrients released by mariculture discharge and sgd are relatively difficult to remove from bay water leading to environmental hazards such as eutrophication the green development of mariculture must adjust the breeding structure and reasonably match the aquaculture ratio to minimize mariculture pollution zheng 2019 therefore the development of a reasonable mariculture management strategy is important for the environmental protection of the dsb reasonable aquaculture management strategies are conducive to minimizing the nutrients released from mariculture including reducing feed delivery expanding the scale of non feeding mariculture species e g macroalgae and filter feeding shellfish and decreasing the discharge of mariculture wastewater feed breeding remains the most commonly used mariculture method in asia bunlipatanon et al 2014 in the dsb more than half of the mariculture areas are feed breeding based on our observations the global average retention efficiencies of n and p in mariculture are approximately 36 and 33 respectively bouwman et al 2013b therefore this problem can be effectively ameliorated by decreasing the feed inputs or by using more efficient formulated feeds furthermore breeding large algae and filter feeding shellfish facilitates the reduction of nitrogen phosphorus and other organic matters in the aquatic environment gao et al 2014 sgd also delivers abundant nutrients leading to the risk of seawater eutrophication therefore the sgd and its associated nutrient fluxes into the mariculture areas must be determined and mariculture species must be allocated to deplete nutrients and mitigate eutrophication trends moreover large scale fishing and oyster cultivation were established at the mouth of the bay resulting in slow water flow and nutrient accumulation hence placing mariculture areas in open waters with sufficient water flow can disperse nutrients and prevent eutrophication intensive fish breeding in the dsb should be devoted to aquaculture development in the sea area beyond the 20 m isobath zheng 2019 based on the characteristics of the dsb sea condition various types of wind resistant cage and raft mariculture facilities should be researched and developed and wind resistant mariculture facilities should be used to conduct intensive mariculture in deep water outside the bay to reduce the pollution loads 5 conclusions in this study radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra were used to quantify the total sgd and related nutrient fluxes in the dsb during september 2019 the conceptual water and salt mass balance models found that the fresh sgd flux in dsb was 5 1 1 9 106 m3 d 1 which only contributed about 13 of the total sgd flux by estimating nutrient fluxes from fresh sgd and saline sgd separately the total sgd derived nutrient fluxes were 6 4 2 4 106 1 2 0 4 105 1 7 0 6 106 and 1 6 0 5 105 mol d 1 for din dip don and dop which were equivalent to 7 8 21 2 6 6 and 2 8 times the riverine input respectively compared to other nutrient sources mariculture discharge played the dominated role in delivering nutrients to the dsb followed by sgd a china wide upscaling that combined our results with literature revealed that nutrient fluxes through sgd in chinese mariculture areas were comparable to the river input along the coasts of china suggesting the importance of sgd and associated nutrient fluxes in mariculture areas and should be considered in the management of the ecological environment of

manuscript thanks so much for their kind and detailed comments and suggestions which enabled us to have a deeper understanding of our research from different perspectives during the revision process appendix a see appendices a1 a3 a 1 summary of parameters for sgd estimation see table a1 a 2 radium sources and sinks for estimating sgd a2 1 riverine input ra from river input in dsb is estimated to by multiplying the river freshwater discharge with the radium isotopes activities in the river water endmember in this study we selected the station which salinity is zero as the river water endmember the freshwater discharge of the zhangjiang river was 2 77 106 m3 d 1 during our sampling period consequently the dissolved radium 224ra 223ra 228ra and 226ra fluxes from riverine input were calculated to be 4 0 0 1 109 6 2 0 7 108 4 4 0 1 109 and 1 2 0 1 109 dpm d 1 respectively a2 2 diffusion from bottom sediment the diffusion flux of radium through the sediments pore space is a possible source of radium in the bay water and is obtained by multiplying the radium diffusion rate by the area of study region we set up two control groups for four groups of experiments to determine the different radium diffusion rates of different particle size sediments and considering the proportion of each particle size in the bay was different we used the weighted average for calculation the diffusion rates dpm m 2 d 1 of 224ra and 223ra were 223 5 9 and 5 9 1 9 respectively regarding to long lived 226ra and 228ra the indoor experiment time was too short to reach the long term equilibrium between sediment diffusion and decay so we applied an approach that developed by nozaki et al 1990 estimate this term the equation was expressed as follows a2 1 f diff p i φ d dp k ad d mx λ i 1 k ad where k ad is adsorption coefficient d mx is sediment mixing coefficient d dp is dispersion coefficient for water movement through sediments φ is sediment porosity which was calculated by parameters of sediments collected in the field and p i is production from parent nuclide the diffusion rates of 228ra and 226ra were 1 0 0 04 and 0 1 0 003 dpm m 2 d 1 respectively hence with the surface area of the dsb the diffusion fluxes of radium 223ra 224ra 228ra and 226ra were estimated to be 6 6 0 8 109 1 4 0 04 1011 2 7 0 1 108 and 2 7 0 1 107 dpm d 1 respectively a2 3 radioactive decay for the radioactive decay in the dsb since the half life of 226ra and 228ra were much longer than flushing time the decay of the water migration time scale of dsb could be neglected conversely the half life of 223ra and 224ra were short and its decay losses were the significant process of radium losses in the dsb during the sampling period the decay losses were calculated by multiplying the decay constant by the radium inventories as shown in the following equation 12 a2 2 f decay λ r a inventory assuming the water mixing was relatively uniform in the vertical profile the radium inventories r a inventory were estimated by multiplying the average radium activities in the dsb by the bay volume the average 224ra and 223ra activities in surface water were 106 0 5 0 and 6 0 1 2 dpm 100 l 1 in study area respectively based on the above results the radioactive decay losses of 224ra and 223ra in the dsb were 3 3 0 2 1011 dpm d 1 and 6 0 1 2 109 dpm d 1 respectively a2 4 mixing with open sea mixing losses with open seawater the exchange between open seawater with low ra activities and inner bay water was another important process of radium losses we used the method in kim and kim 2011 to estimate this flux and this term could be written as follows a2 3 f mix r a inventory r a o b 1 b r a river v bay t f where r a o is radium activities in open seawater b is reflow factor which was calculated through three endmember model r a river is radium activities in river water endmember r a inventory is radium inventory in the whole bay t f is the flushing time based on these parameters we obtained radium fluxes 224ra 223ra 228ra and 226ra from mixing losses with open seawater to be 5 7 0 3 1010 dpm d 1 8 9 4 6 109 dpm d 1 6 6 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 and 1 9 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 respectively a 3 details for nutrient budgets the riverine nutrient fluxes into the dsb can be estimated by the nutrient concentrations in the river water endmember and the corresponding local river discharge rate the riverine nutrient fluxes were 8 16 105 and 5 55 103 mol d 1 for din and dip respectively nutrients accumulate in sediments with higher concentrations than that in the overlying water and then a large amount of nutrients is released across the sediment water interface and transported into overlying water bodies similar to the diffusion of ra from sediments we obtained the nutrient diffusion flux via the nutrients diffusion rate multiplied by the nutrient concentration in liquid supernatant of diffusion experiment minus the average nutrient concentration in surface water the diffusion rates μmol m 2 d 1 of nutrient were estimated to be 1121 0 for din and 10 5 for dip respectively from the indoor diffusion experiment in consequence the nutrient fluxes of din and dip from sediment diffusion were 2 3 1 3 105 and 4 2 2 2 103 mol d 1 respectively nutrient fluxes through atmospheric deposition were calculated by multiplying the area of the dsb with nutrient deposition rates zhang et al 2007 estimated the average atmospheric deposition fluxes of din and dip to the entire east china sea continental shelf approximately 8 5 105 km2 to be 1 17 and 0 002 kmol s 1 respectively because the dsb is adjacent to the east china sea we replaced the above atmospheric deposition fluxes with those in the dsb as a result the nutrient fluxes through atmospheric deposition in dsb were estimated to be 3 4 105 mol d 1 for din and 5 8 102 mol d 1 for dip respectively with industry development in the coastal cities of the dsb the amount of wastewater discharge has increased annually it carries a large amount of nutrients and has a significant impact on the aquatic environment wastewater is polluted water generated by human activities and production the wastewater discharge of the dsb 2 1 106 m3 d 1 was approximately 7 7 of the total discharge of the main rivers in fujian province data from fujian province chi environmental protection chi 2008 the nutrient fluxes were calculated by multiplying the total wastewater discharge by the nutrient concentration of that discharge we collected wastewater from the coastal region and measured its nutrient content the concentrations μmol l 1 of wastewater were 89 7 for din and 1 6 for dip respectively the related nutrient fluxes were estimated to be 1 9 105 mol d 1 for din and 3 4 103 mol d 1 for dip respectively the scale of mariculture in the dsb ranked among the best in fujian province and the pollutants entering the environment were primarily n and p during the marine culturing process therefore the mariculture discharge could not be ignored in addition the main mariculture methods in the dsb can be divided into terrestrial and shallow sea mariculture liu et al 2019 shallow sea mariculture is based on direct seawater culture generally this method does not require the addition of feed therefore the nutrients contributed by this item were considered to be endogenous thus we will not discuss it separately the terrestrial pond culture was based on a land pond and seawater was used for the culture this method requires the addition of feed one part of the polluted waste generated during the culture process can be used through the decomposition of microorganisms and photosynthesis of phytoplankton in the pond the deposit at the bottom of the pond was not reused which caused accumulation in the environment another part is discharged from the pool by changing the water which has a certain impact on the environment of the adjacent sea area the load deposited in the mariculture pond was generally deposited at the bottom of the pond or infiltrated into the aquifer and discharged in the form of groundwater in our study the method established by zheng 2019 was used to assess the mariculture discharge in the dsb consequently the equation can be expressed as follows a3 1 m mariculture q w c m where m mariculture mol d 1 is the nutrient flux through terrestrial pond culture c is the nutrient concentration mol m 3 in wastewater and this value was obtained from field sampling and laboratory measurements the values were 0 803 μmol l 1 for din and 0 0247 μmol l 1 for dip q w is the discharge amount of wastewater during the marine culturing process and is expressed as follows a3 2 q w a w h w n a w h w φ w t w n where a w is the area of seawater aquaculture of 3 60 107 m2 the average depth h w of the pond was 2 0 m gao et al 2014 zheng 2019 n is the annual culture cycle of 3 which refers to culture three times per year t w is the day when the water is changed in the culture ponds 100 days as a cycle no water exchange for the first 30 days of 70 d and φ w is the water exchange rate of 0 05 therefore the nutrient fluxes through the mariculture discharge in the dsb were calculated to be 2 14 106 mol d 1 for din and 6 58 104 mol d 1 for dip respectively this method provides a preliminary estimate of the environmental impacts of mariculture generally absorption by phytoplankton mixing loss to the open sea aquaculture harvest and organic detrital degradation have been considered the main sinks of nutrients in coastal regions wang et al 2014 peng et al 2021 nutrients have been recognized as the basis of marine primary productivity and the food cycle and exist in different forms in the water environment according to the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 and primary productivity 595 mg m 2 d 1 of dsb zhang et al 2014 the nutrient fluxes via absorption by phytoplankton were determined to be 1 82 106 mol d 1 for din and 1 14 105 mol d 1 for dip respectively although the deposition of dissolved organic nutrients has not yet been reported in the dsb which mainly depends on the phytoplankton abundance the nutrients through organic detrital degradation primarily depend on phytoplankton abundance with a value of approximately 136 104 ind m 3 ye et al 2017 phytoplankton abundance in the dsb was of the same order of magnitude as that in sanggou bay yuan et al 2014 thus we applied the rate of deposition of dissolved organic nutrient in sanggou bay to the present study consequently the nutrient fluxes via deposition of dissolved organic nutrient were estimated to be 4 4 105 mol d 1 for din and 3 8 103 mol d 1 for dip respectively in addition the decrease in nutrients via harvesting cannot be overlooked in our study region the annual production of fish is 3 16 105 tons and shellfish production is 9 08 104 tons lu et al 2001 wu 2016 during the sampling period the major species was shellfish with protein and p accounting for approximately 31 and 18 respectively whereas the other main species was fish with protein and p accounting for approximately 36 and 33 respectively bouwman et al 2013b qi et al 2019 as a result nutrient losses during shellfish and fish aquaculture harvest were approximately 2 78 107 mol d 1 for din and 1 07 107 mol d 1 for dip respectively the mixing loss is large because tidal ranges are large and the east china sea has been recognized as the main external sink of nutrients in the ocean therefore we used an approach similar to that of ra isotopes to estimate nutrient fluxes via mixing loss this equation is expressed as follows a3 3 e out c seawater c out a h t f where c seawater is the average nutrient concentration in surface water with values of 45 7 μmol l 1 for din and 1 3 μmol l 1 for dip respectively c out is the nutrient concentration in open sea endmember with values of 10 4 μmol l 1 for din and 0 4 μmol l 1 for dip h represents the average depth of the dsb eventually through mixing loss the nutrient fluxes of din and dip were 4 1 1 6 106 mol d 1 and 1 1 0 4 105 mol d 1 respectively appendix b supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found

2924,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is recognized as one of the most significant pathways for terrestrial nutrient entry into coastal systems however sgd derived nutrient fluxes particularly organic nutrients have not yet been considered in the management of mariculture areas we quantified both saline 12 5 cm day 1 and fresh 1 8 cm day 1 sgd and related nutrient fluxes using the radium quartet and water mass balance model respectively and then reassessed nutrient budgets in a typical mariculture bay although fresh sgd accounts for 13 of the total sgd it carries 7 4 80 5 of the total sgd nutrients suggesting that fresh sgd was an important source of new nutrients with high nitrogen to phosphorus n p ratios 585 into the coastal waters based on the rebuilt nutrient budgets total sgd and mariculture discharge were the two major nutrient sources into the coastal water providing 2 8 21 2 and 1 9 13 9 times more nutrients than local rivers respectively the nutrient speciation results revealed that sgd derived organic nutrients which are typically ignored were dominant i e dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus through sgd contributed about 22 9 and 41 5 of all nutrient resources furthermore china wide upscaling showed that sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the mariculture area along the coast of china are comparable those of the rivers in china therefore we suggest that sgd derived inorganic and organic nutrient fluxes should be incorporated into the ecosystem management of mariculture areas keywords submarine groundwater discharge mariculture nutrient speciation radium isotopes fresh groundwater primary productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ocean is considered a blue granary providing marine food of sustainable quality and yields that is of significant long term demand to humanity sun and ji 2022 over the last 40 years mariculture has grown at an average annual growth rate of 8 7 contributing nearly half of the total global food output production li et al 2016 nadarajah and flaaten 2017 fao 2020 as the world s largest mariculture producer chinese mariculture is recognized as a rapidly developing sustainable fishery model that is beneficial to effective restoration and improvement of the marine ecological environment conservation and enhancement of fishery stocks and sustainable development of the marine fishery economy yu and zhang 2020 qin et al 2021 in addition to topographic and hydrological factors the distributions and sources of nutrients in coastal waters play vital roles in the species structure and resource density in mariculture areas zhou et al 2019 previous studies on nutrient budgets and biogeochemical cycles in mariculture regions have primarily focused on the contribution of local riverine inputs and atmospheric deposition nhan et al 2008 bouwman et al 2013a yang et al 2021 as an important process occurring between land and ocean submarine groundwater discharge sgd and associated nutrient fluxes in mariculture regions have long been overlooked santos et al 2021 sgd is defined as all the water flow on the continental margin from the seabed to the coastal ocean regardless of fluid composition or driving force which includes fresh groundwater fresh sgd and recirculated seawater saline sgd burnett et al 2003 moore 2010 fresh sgd is driven by the terrestrial hydraulic gradient and originates from shallow or deep aquifers which intersect the coastline while saline sgd sometimes referred to as recirculated seawater is defined as saline subsurface water zzexchange through intertidal sediments or coastal seafloor and advective pore water exchange on a scale greater than 1 m burnett et al 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 santos et al 2021 sgd has been widely recognized as a significant transport pathway of dissolved solutes e g nutrients carbon and trace metals into coastal waters maher et al 2013 trezzi et al 2016 liu et al 2021 santos et al 2021 as a result marine scientists have been concerned about sgd and related dissolved substances which may alter the composition and structure of nutrients in coastal waters leading to environmental problems such as eutrophication hypoxia and harmful algae outbreaks hwang et al 2005a hu et al 2006 liu et al 2017a montiel et al 2019 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 douglas et al 2021a but may also sustain many ecosystems and ecosystem services in coastal areas hwang et al 2005b liu et al 2018 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 although fresh sgd contributes only a small percentage of the total sgd it may provide large amounts of new terrestrial nutrients to coastal waters and significantly impacts the coastal ecosystem lecher and mackey 2018 luijendijk et al 2020 santos et al 2021 however the relevant studies on the nutrient contribution of sgd in mariculture are still scarce wang et al 2018b peng et al 2021 several methods have been used to quantify sgd in coastal areas such as seepage meters e g taniguchi et al 2003 duque et al 2020 hydrogeological models e g oberdorfer 2003 luijendijk et al 2020 geophysical studies e g stieglitz et al 2008 dimova et al 2012 bighash and

radionuclide measurement the applications of radioactive isotope tracers in estimating sgd fluxes are gradually increasing burnett and dulaiova 2003 moore et al 2008 taniguchi et al 2019 in particular naturally occurring radium ra isotopes can be used as powerful tracers for identifying and quantifying sgd because they are widely enriched in coastal groundwater moore 1996 garcia orellana et al 2021 the main advantage of using ra isotopes is that it provides a comprehensive signal related to different groundwater pathways in coastal aquifers a combination of different ra isotopes can be used to concurrently determine water flows from different pathways origins and temporal scales charette et al 2008 tamborski et al 2017 in addition ra has been commonly used to estimate total sgd burnett et al 2006 garcia orellana et al 2021 therefore a combination of ra isotopes and hydrogeological models is generally applied to access the total and fresh sgd fluxes in local regions wang et al 2015 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2021a to date although there have been a large number of studies conducted on sgd and related nutrients worldwide santos et al 2021 studies directly related to fishery resources and aquaculture regions are still limited liu and du 2022 utsunomiya et al 2017 first reported that sgd derived nutrients could increase primary productivity in obama bay japan thereby directly increasing fish and invertebrate richness then fujita et al 2019 confirmed that sgd supplied high dissolved inorganic nutrient levels for p yokohamae providing direct evidence that sgd could improve fish feeding and growth in mariculture areas similarly previous findings suggested that sgd associated dissolved inorganic nutrients are also important in the typical chinese mariculture areas wang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 peng et al 2021 all these studies demonstrated that sgd derived nutrients have the potential to affect the mariculture ecosystem but few showed the potential impacts of fresh sgd which also promotes the growth of species in coastal mariculture areas starke et al 2020 moreover except for dissolved inorganic nutrients the importance of dissolved organic nutrients delivered by sgd has been confirmed in coastal waters kroeger et al 2006 santos et al 2012 2021 douglas et al 2021b and therefore should be considered in the nutrient biogeochemical cycles of mariculture regions most previous sgd studies have focused on inorganic nutrients while few studies have been done on organic nutrients douglas et al 2021b santos et al 2021 the nitrogen n cycle forms the basis of the food chain and is an important pathway for material transfer especially in mariculture systems bushaw et al 1996 yu et al 2012 lu et al 2020 eutrophication derived from increased land based n loading is probably the biggest factor altering coastal waters howarth et al 2002 lu et al 2020 recently rapid population growth and economic development in estuaries and coastal areas have led to the input of terrestrial n pollutants into rivers and groundwater and eventually into the coastal ocean resulting in outbreaks of hypoxia harmful algal blooms and eutrophication boyer et al 2006 lu et al 2016 jani and toor 2018 chen et al 2020a in coastal groundwater n is mainly presented as dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved organic nitrogen don however conversion between different n species can occur through several bacterial derived biogeochemical processes adyasari et al 2019 chen et al 2020b such as ammonification mineralization nitrification denitrification anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra an and gardner 2002 galloway and cowling 2002 mortimer et al 2004 jiao et al 2010 dan et al 2019 wong et al 2020 many studies have focused on din but relatively little information is available on the impact of other n species on the nutrient structure in coastal waters longnecker and kujawinski 2011 lu et al 2017 li et al 2019 douglas et al 2021a douglas et al 2021b in recently years n contamination has become widespread in coastal groundwater and surface water which has led to an awareness of the effects of don on nutrient structure qin et al 2015 knapp et al 2018 as a non conservative form of nitrogen don can be converted into din through biological and photochemical processes and released into coastal ecosystems resulting in changes in seawater quality sipler and bronk 2015 lu et al 2017 therefore don not only affects the function of the aquatic environment but also leads to shifts in the coastal nutrient structure phytoplankton species composition and primary production monchamp et al 2014 lu et al 2020 in this study we hypothesized that sgd derived nutrient fluxes are an important component of the nutrient budgets in mariculture bays ra isotopes and nutrients in seawater and coastal groundwater of a typical mariculture bay were investigated quantitatively estimate sgd and associated nutrient fluxes from fresh and saline components we attempted to estimate the total sgd fluxes by identifying all ra sources and sinks i e ra mass balance model and to obtain fresh sgd flux through a hydrogeological model the purpose of this study was to assess the significance of sgd in nutrient budgets and to evaluate the potential influence of sgd derived nutrients on the ecosystems of this mariculture bay 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dongshan bay dsb 23 68 23 96 n 117 33 117 65 e is a semi enclosed bay in fujian province china located in the southwestern part of the east china sea adjacent to the taiwan strait fig 1 a the total area of the bay is approximately 250 km2 with an average water depth of 5 8 m pan et al 2021 the annual average temperature and precipitation are 21 2 c and 1575 mm respectively li et al 2018 the dsb is characterized by an irregular semidiurnal tide with an average tidal range of 2 32 m chen et al 2010 the zhangjiang river has the largest runoff in the study area flowing into the bay from the north with an average annual freshwater discharge and suspended sediment of approximately 1 01 109 m3 and 4 19 105 t respectively xu et al 2017 the bay has abundant water resources and habitats that provide excellent mariculture grounds for a variety of fish shrimp shellfish and algae gao et al 2014 the mariculture area in dsb is approximately 73 8 km2 gao et al 2014 du et al 2016 xu et al 2021 and has become one of the main marine breeding bases in fujian province in recent years the rapid development of the dsb mariculture has not only promoted local socio economic growth but has also posed various problems such as the degradation in environmental quality and the occupation of other sea spaces liu et al 2019 consequently in order to manage mariculture production activities and facilitate the green development of fisheries in the dsb it is important to scientifically evaluate its carrying capacity and ecosystem previous studies in the dsb have primarily concentrated on other nutrients input chen et al 2014 xu et al 2017 but sgd one of its potential crucial sources has been long overlooked 2 2 sampling strategy fieldwork was conducted in september 2019 surface seawater n 26 30 l was collected for ra isotope measurements using a submersible pump at a depth of approximately 0 5 m below the air water interface groundwater samples were obtained from wells and pore water in the beaches around the coast of the dsb porewater samples n 5 15 l were collected with a push point piezometer using a peristaltic pump moore et al 2006 while well water n 17 50 l was collected as close to the bay as possible from the freshwater aquifer after draining the well using a submersible pump the water depths to water ranged from 0 8 to 30 m and most of the wells completely screened with caps so the samples collected would not be diluted directly by rainfall river water samples n 6 30 l were collected from the zhangjiang river to the dsb by salinity gradient 0 13 8 hydrological parameters such as salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen do in surface seawater groundwater and river water were measured in situ using a conductance temperature depth sensor multi 3430 wtw germany while salinity and temperature in seawater along the transect t1 were obtained from a calibrated multi parameter data logger aquatroll 600 in situ inc the ra samples were immediately filtered through columns filled with 20 g mn coated acrylic fibers at a flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 moore 1976 after using milli q water to wash the mn fiber for removing salt and loosely bound mno2 the water content of the mn fiber is adjusted to be approximately 75 by compressed air drying to ensure maximum emanation of rn from the mn fiber and obtain higher measurement efficiency moore 2008 the mn fiber was then brought back to the laboratory for measurement corresponding to the ra samples nutrient samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles that had been cleaned with hydrochloric acid and rinsed with milli q water after rinsing the bottle three times approximately 60 ml of the filtrate was collected after filtration through acid preconditioned acetate cellulose filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm saturated hgcl2 solution was added to the nutrient samples and were then stored in the dark until analysis in the laboratory 2 3 ra sediment diffusion experiment to simulate the ra process of bottom sediment diffusion 6 8 kg of surface sediment in the bay was used evenly covering the bottom of a 25 l polyethylene bucket from our observation the distribution of bottom sediments in the dsb was dominated by mud and sand so we conducted the diffusion indoor experiment by these two types of sediment and two parallel samples were set for each type sediment ra free seawater s 30 7 25 l was injected several times in small quantities 1 l each time to prevent agitations of the bottom sediments after leaving to sit untouched for more than 60 days to ensure an equilibrium between sediment diffusion and decay the water overlying the sediment was then extracted and passed through mno2 fiber columns as described in detail by beck et al 2007 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 radium analysis in the laboratory the short lived isotopes 223ra and 224ra were measured by radecc moore and arnold 1996 each sample has been measured three times in one month using the radecc system and the 224ra and 223ra data was described as excess 224ra and 223ra which are obtained by subtracting their parent radionuclides 228th and 227ac respectively moore 2008 the radecc detectors were calibrated by repeatedly measuring the 227ac and 232th standards the quantification of the 223ra and 224ra activities was performed according to the limits and guidelines provided by diego feliu et al 2020 the uncertainties in 223ra and 224ra were estimated to be approximately 20 and 5 respectively garcia solsona et al 2008 the long lived isotopes 226ra and 228ra were measured using gamma spectrometry ortec gwl 120 15 xlb awj briefly the fiber was burned at 800 c for approximately 8 h the ash was added to a 7 ml plastic vial and sealed with an epoxy sealant to achieve secular equilibrium between ra and its gamma daughters the ingrowth period was at least three weeks 226ra activities were obtained using 214pb 295 and 352 kev and 214bi 609 kev peaks while 228ra activities were obtained using the 338 and 911 kev peaks of 228ac the gamma spectrometry detector was calibrated using certified reference materials batch number 08121 obtained from the national institute of metrology china to ensure its accuracy liu et al 2017b 2 4 2 nutrient analysis nutrient samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic nutrients no2 no3 nh4 po4 3 and si oh 4 total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp using an auto analyzer skalar sanplus the no2 was measured using diazo azo method and the no3 was measured using the cadmium copper reduction method thereafter liu et al 2009 nh4 was measured using the sodium hypobromite oxidation method liu et al 2009 po4 3 and si oh 4 were measured using phosphomolybdenum blue method and the silicomolybdic complex method liu et al 2009 the din concentration was expressed as the sum of the no2 no3 and nh4 concentrations while nox is expressed as the sum of the no3 and no2 the tdn and tdp were measured using high temperature combustion methods sharp et al 2002 lee and westerhoff 2005 the concentrations of don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop are obtained by subtracting the dissolved inorganic nutrients from the total dissolved nutrients the analytical precisions of no2 no3 nh4 po4 3 don and dop were all better than 5 and the detection limits were 0 01 0 05 0 05 0 01 0 05 and 0 05 μmol l 1 respectively liu et al 2022 2 5 water age estimation water age can provide an available timescale for material to accumulate in the coastal bay and it usually must be known before estimating sgd flux firstly a physical method was adopted to estimate the flushing time which refers to the time it takes for the entire volume of a particular body of water to be removed through its open boundaries monsen et al 2002 this method is based on the following two assumptions 1 the influence of the wind in the bay can be ignored and 2 the bay water is well mixed this method is mainly based on the physical renewal ability of the bay water and is expressed as followed sanford et al 1992 moore et al 2006 1 t f v bay 1 b p t q r where t f is the flushing time in the dsb v bay is the volume of the dsb of 1 65 109 m3 q r is river discharge during our sampling period t is the time of one tidal period of 0 517 d p is the tidal prism which is 5 36 108 m3 at neap tide qin et al 2020 and b is reflow factor another method was used to calculate the water age namely residence time here is the time it takes for each material in the system to reach the outlet zimmerman 1976 the dsb water was assumed in the steady state and the increase and decrease of ra isotopes are constant and the equation can be written as moore et al 2006 2 τ f 224 r a 223 r a i 224 r a 223 r a λ 224 i 224 r a 223 r a λ 223 f 224 r a 223 r a where τ represents the residence time of dsb f 224 r a 223 r a is initial activity ratio input of the total flux of 224ra and 223ra in dsb i 224 r a 223 r a is the activity ratio of 224ra and 223ra inventories in measurement in surface water λ 224 and λ 223 are the decay constants of 224ra and 223ra which were 0 189 d 1 and 0 0608 d 1 respectively 2 6 sgd estimations 2 6 1 three endmembers mixing model due to the low regeneration rates of 226ra and 228ra the contribution from sediment diffusion is relatively low and assumed that this source could be negligible therefore the major sources of 226ra and 228ra in the surface water of dsb are rivers open sea water and groundwater the three endmembers mixing model is proposed using radium isotope and salinity to separate the fractions of river water groundwater and open sea water and then to estimate sgd flux the model was constructed by 228ra or 226ra salinity and water balance and can be expressed as follows moore et al 2006 3 f gw f r f o 1 4 r a r f r r a gw f gw r a o f o r a e 5 s r f r s gw f gw s o f o s e where subscripts gw r o and e represent coastal groundwater river water open seawater and bay water respectively f ra and s indicate the fraction radium activities and salinity respectively then the sgd flux m3 d 1 was obtained by the following equation 6 sgd v f gw t f 2 6 2 ra mass balance model there is usually a large amount of excess radium isotopes in dsb the radium masses balance model was established in the steady state system which was adapted from moore et al 2008 after all other radium sources and sinks have been estimated details were shown in appendix a radium isotopes fluxes attributed to sgd could be obtained the radium isotope sinks include decay f decay and mixing loss with open seawater f mix the sources include sediment diffusion f diff river input f river sgd f sgd and desorption of suspended particles f susp the eq 6 for the ra mass balance

sgd dpm d 1 the sgd flux v m3 d 1 of the dsb was calculated by the following equation 8 v f sgd c gw 2 6 3 fresh sgd estimation following the method of wang et al 2015 a water salt mass balance model was established to estimate fresh sgd in the dsb the inputs of bay water include fresh sgd q sfgd river input q r precipitation q p wastewater discharge q w and inflow from the open sea q s the outputs of bay water include outflow to the open sea q o and evaporation q e assuming that the water body of dsb is in a stable state in which the total water inflow is equal to the water outflow then the water mass balance can be represented as follows 9 q s q r q fsgd q w q p q o q e 10 q o v bay t f the inventory of salt in dsb is the result of mixing between freshwater and seawater from outside the bay it can be represented as follows 11 m s s f v f s s v s where m s is the total salt mass stored in dsb s s and s f are the salinity of seawater from outside dsb and freshwater respectively v f and v s are the volumes of freshwater and seawater from outside dsb respectively the salinity of freshwater is zero so the equation can be simplified as follows 12 v s m s s s based on the definition of flushing time t f q s v s t f the following formula can be obtained 13 q s m s t f s s combined with the equations above q fsgd can be represented by 14 q fsgd 1 t f v bay m s s s q e q p q r 3 results 3 1 basic hydrological parameters in the dsb in the surface water of the dsb the temperature ranged from 28 0 to 33 7 c fig 2 a in contrast salinity ranged from 18 4 to 33 7 and showed a gradually increasing trend from the head to the mouth of the bay fig 2b to explore the vertical mixing of water column transect t1 s profile was selected for observation fig 3 the results indicated

table s1 contrary to salinity the concentrations of ra quartets decreased from the embayment to the open sea the relationship between salinity and ra in surface water showed that ra activities were higher than those derived from conservative mixing between the zhangjiang river and open seawater fig 4 in coastal groundwater 223ra and 224ra activities varied from 0 9 to 257 0 dpm 100 l 1 x 38 4 5

surface water were selected as the coastal groundwater endmembers n 16 in particular the sampling level was deep for sites gw 5 and gw 6 which was not considered as endmember for fresh sgd as a result the median values of ra activities dpm 100 l 1 were 8 9 1 7 for 223ra 254 5 9 6 for 224ra 91 4 4 1 for 226ra and 317 9 4 4 for 228ra in the river water 224ra and 223ra activities varied from 19 2 to 144 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 5 9 0 9 dpm 100 l 1 n 6 and 0 7 to 22 4 dpm 100 l 1 x 81 0 3 4 dpm 100 l 1 n 6 respectively fig 5a b 226ra and 228ra activities ranged from 23 3 to 43 1 dpm 100 l 1 x 35 4 1 9 dpm

particulate matter in the river at the salinity of 13 8 radium activity in coastal groundwater was significantly higher than that in surface water and river water 3 3 spatial distributions of nutrient in surface water and coastal groundwater in the surface water of the dsb the no3 concentration varied from 4 5 to 102 2 µmol l 1 x 31 5 29 6 µmol l 1 n 25 the nh4 concentration varied from 2 8 to 27 8 µmol l 1 x 9 6 6 5 µmol l 1 n 25 and the no2 concentration varied from 0 2 to 8 5 µmol l 1 x 3 6 1 5 µmol l 1 n 25 the din concentration varied from 9 1 to 127 0 µmol l 1 x 44 6 34 2 µmol l 1 n 25 the dip concentration ranged from 0 3 to 2 6 µmol l 1 x 1 3 0 8 µmol l 1 n 25 the don concentration varied from 0 3 to 60 2 µmol l 1 x 29 0 16 3 µmol l 1 n 25 and the dop concentration varied from 0 04 to 5 7 µmol l 1 x 2 3 1 1 µmol l 1 n 25 table s1 fig 6 the distribution of nutrients in surface water showed an increasing trend from land to ocean the concentrations of nutrients in the coastal groundwater of the dsb exhibited a wide range table s1 fig 7 the no3 concentration varied from 5 1 to 3370 3 µmol 1 with an average of 811 5 933 0 µmol l 1 n 25 the nh4 concentration varied from 1 1 to 485 9 µmol l 1with an average of 48 8 110 4 µmol l 1 n 25 and the no2 concentration varied from 0 1 to 47 9 µmol l 1 with an average of 3 4 10 2 µmol l 1 n 25 the din concentration ranged from 26 5

concentration varied from 0 1 to 78 4 µmol l 1 x 12 0 22 3 n 10 the nutrient concentrations in the coastal groundwater are generally higher than those in surface seawater which may also indicate that groundwater carries a large amount of nutrients into the bay 3 4 water ages and sgd flux in the dsb based on the physical model with the parameters table a1 the flushing time in dsb is 13 0 1 8 days moreover radium isotopes imported into our study system mainly came from coastal groundwater input with an average 224ra 223ra ratio of 35 2 22 1 the 224ra 223ra ratio at each station was used to estimate the residence time at each station resulting in a mean residence time of 13 8 8 4 days in the dsb the calculated result is very close to the flushing time value it showed that the results calculated by the two methods are reliable therefore we took the average of the two methods 13 4 5 1 d for subsequent calculations in the three endmembers mixing model the salinity of the coastal groundwater endmember was 9 87 and the average 228ra and 226ra activities were 679 0 6 3 dpm 100 l 1 and 223 0 3 6 dpm 100 l 1 respectively at the sampling period the river endmember had a mean salinity of 13 8 and the averaged 228ra and 226ra activities were 157 4 3 2 dpm 100 l 1 and 43 1 1 6 dpm 100 l 1 the open seawater endmember had a mean salinity of 34 5 and the average activities were 15 7 1 8 dpm 100 l 1 for 228ra and 41 1 2 9 dpm 100 l 1 for 226ra the average salinity of surface water was 29 3 and the average concentrations of 228ra and 226ra were 679 0 6 3 dpm 100 l 1 and 223 0 3 6 dpm 100 l 1 respectively the constants and calculated values used in this model were shown in table a1 according to eqs 3 5 the average proportion of open seawater reflux factor coastal groundwater and river water during sampling period was 76 5 18 9 8 3 5 9 and 15 2 21 8 based on 226ra while those values were 76 9 18 7 10 3 8 4 and 12 8 21 1 based on 228ra therefore the estimated sgd flux m3 d 1 was 1 3 1 0 107 4 5 3 7 cm d 1 for 228ra and 1 0 0 7 107 3 6 2 6 cm d 1 for 226ra based on eq 6 fig 8 furthermore the sources and sinks of the four radium isotopes was estimated and the details were presented in the appendix appendix a2 based on eq 7 the radium fluxes through sgd were estimated to be 7 7 5 5 109 dpm d 1 for 223ra 2 4 0 1 1011 dpm d 1 for 224ra 6 1 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 for 228ra and 1 8 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 for 226ra dpm d 1 comparing all sources and sinks of radium in the study area table a1 we suggest that sgd was the dominant source for ra accounting for 51 4 93 5 generally speaking the ra activity in groundwater is higher than that of surface seawater and to obtain a conservative sgd flux we excluded those values that are lower than the mean value of surface seawater and then took the median value for the rest which were 254 5 9 6 for 224ra 8 9 1 7 for 223ra 317 8 4 4 for 228ra and 91 4 4 1 for 226ra sgd fluxes m3 d 1 via radium mass balance models were calculated to be 8 6 6 2 107 for 223ra 30 4 21 8 cm d 1 9 6 0 3 107 for 224ra 33 8 1 0 cm d 1 1 9 0 1 107 for 228ra 6 8 0 1 cm d 1 and 1 9 0 1 107 for 226ra 6 8 0 3 cm d 1 fig 8 moreover from the combined conceptual water mass and salt mass balance models which showed in eq 9 each input and output of water terms was calculated and summarized table a1 resulting in the fresh sgd flux in the dsb of 5 1 1 9 106 m3 d 1 1 8 0 7 cm d 1 3 5 sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the dsb the nutrient fluxes from sgd were conventionally estimated by multiplying the total sgd flux by the concentration of the coastal groundwater endmember e g moore et al 2006 rodellas et al 2015 however because of the selection of coastal groundwater endmembers considerable uncertainty existed in the sgd derived nutrient flux estimation and it might have been overestimated if we did not distinguish between the fresh sgd and saline sgd luo et al 2018 tamborski et al 2018 liu et al 2021 for the fresh sgd we assumed that salinity in groundwater endmembers was less than 5 which collected from well water and the median concentrations of endmember were 1105 5 µmol l 1 for din 1 7 µmol l 1 for dip 64 9 μmol 1 for don and 6 1 µmol l 1 for dop while for the saline sgd the endmembers were collected from coastal tidal flat with a salinity of more than 5 it is worth noting that when dealing with rsgd fluxes the concentration in overlying waters need to be subtracted from the concentration in the saline gw endmember cook et al 2018 resulting in 35 0 µmol l 1 for din 3 1 μmol l 1 for dip 39 1 for don and 3 6 µmol l 1 for dop consequently fresh sgd derived nutrient fluxes mol d 1 were estimated to be 5 1 2 0 106 for din 8 8 3 3 103 for dip 3 3 1 3 105 for don and 3 1 1 2 104 for dop saline sgd derived nutrient fluxes mol d 1 were estimated to be 1 2 0 4 106 for din 1 1 0 4 105 for dip 1 4 0 5 106 for don and 1 3 0 4 105 for dop as a result total sgd derived nutrient fluxes mol d 1 were 6 4 2 4 106 for din 1 2 0 4 105 for dip 1 7 0 6 106 for don and 1 6 0 5 105 for dop 3 6 nutrient budgets in the dsb for better understanding the significance of sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the dsb ecosystem the din and dip budgets were estimated generally in such mariculture coastal bay the din and dip sources include riverine input sediment release atmospheric deposition wastewater mariculture discharge and sgd while sinks come from phytoplankton mixing loss to the open sea shellfish and fish aquaculture harvest and organic detrital degradation when summarizing all the sources and sinks of nutrient the total din and dip fluxes input to the dsb were 1 0 107 mol d 1 and 2 0 105 mol d 1 respectively while fluxes output from the dsb were 3 4 107 mol d 1 and 1 1 107 mol d 1 respectively the details are presented in the appendix a3 4 discussion 4 1 sgd fluxes comparisons and uncertainty analysis comparing the sgd fluxes obtained by the three endmembers model and ra mass balance models the sgd rates ranged from 3 6 to 33 8 cm d 1 the 224ra and 223ra based models lead to the highest sgd fluxes fig 8 because of their short half lives 224ra and 223ra reach secular equilibrium with the sediment derived parent nuclides more quickly than 228ra and 226ra luo and jiao 2016 while the lowest sgd rates were yielded from three endmembers models which were mostly based on water mass balance and did not include a component of recirculated seawater like the mass balance models luo and jiao 2016 overall the sgd fluxes were in good agreement among the different sgd models fig 8 and we thought that the weighted average sgd rate of the six models may represent the full extent of the fluids discharging into the dsb therefore the sgd flux ranged from 1 0 107 m3 d 1 to 9 6 107 m3 d 1 and the average sgd flux in the dsb was estimated to be 4 1 1 4 107 m3 d 1 14 3 4 9 cm d 1 approximately 14 6 times that of the zhangjiang river discharge 2 77 106 m3 d 1 during our sampling period generally fresh sgd represents a net water source in the coastal bay in the dsb fresh sgd contributes approximately 13 of the total sgd but was two times the zhangjiang river discharge into the dsb indicating that fresh sgd was one of the significant freshwater sources entering the dsb the saline sgd flux was estimated to be 3 5 1 2 107 m3 d 1 it follows that saline sgd flux contributes approximately 87 of the total sgd and is the dominant component of sgd in the dsb usually saline sgd is considered to be driven by tidal and wave pumping which force seawater through the sediment seawater interface and exchange with porewater due to the long coastline and high tidal range in the dsb saline sgd occurs ubiquitous along the coastline where seawater exchange with coastal porewater resulting in a high saline sgd flux in the dsb moreover as reviewed by taniguchi et al 2019 saline sgd process may also include additional advective processes like wave setup bioturbation or gas bubble upwelling which could drive water and nutrient fluxes from the land to the coastal water in this study all uncertainties in sgd flux quantifications were estimated based on the errors of the measurement and followed the basic rules of error propagation gonneea et al 2014 sadat noori et al 2015 from the ra isotope mass balance model there are many factors affecting sgd calculation a variation of 10 in residence time would cause a change of 2 1 12 9 in sgd flux estimation indicating that the residence time of the water body in the dsb is still sensitive to sgd flux calculation for the diffusion of bottom sediments the uncertainties of 226ra and 228ra are small on account of its long half lives and low regeneration ability while the uncertainties of 223ra and 224ra are relatively larger on account of the short regeneration time and a 20 error of diffusion flux can lead to 11 6 17 3 in sgd flux uncertainty furthermore river inputs and ra decay losses are low and do not strongly influence the ra mass balance model for the three endmembers model eqs 3 5 the uncertainty for sgd calculation is mainly caused by the activity of 226ra and 228ra in the coastal groundwater end member the activities of 226ra and 228ra in coastal groundwater endmembers produced an uncertainty of 20 which resulted in an uncertainty of 16 7 36 0 for sgd for the water mass balance model the main factor that affects the sgd calculation is the flushing time a variation of 20 in residence time would result in 21 8 26 6 change in the fresh sgd flux estimation it is worth noting that the collection and selection of coastal groundwater endmembers would also cause uncertainty in sgd calculation here the average value of groundwater endmember is used for sgd estimation so the total sgd flux can be calculated to be 1 4 0 6 107 m3 d 1 therefore the use of the average value for sgd estimation will lead to 66 reduction in sgd flux which may be due to the abnormal value in groundwater endmember values so the median value of groundwater endmember was used for calculation actually although the strategy of groundwater collection and the endmember selections of radium in our study are the most popular ways in such sgd studies it is still based on an assumption that no transformation on the radium signature of groundwater from the sampling point to the discharge point 4 2 din and dip fluxes and budgets sgd derived nutrients are usually crucial nutrient sources in coastal regions e g hwang et al 2005b kim and kim 2011 wang et al 2018b in the dsb although fresh sgd flux represented only a small fraction of total sgd fresh sgd derived nutrients were equally important especially for din fresh sgd can contribute up to 80 5 of the din flux carried by total sgd if we applied the conventional estimation based on the total sgd flux and all nutrient samples in coastal groundwater to obtain nutrient flux via sgd of the results would be 3 3 1 1 107 mol d 1 1 4 0 5 105 mol d 1 2 7 0 9 106 mol d 1 and 4 8 1 7 105 mol d 1 which were elevated by 422 19 55 and 204 for din dip don and dop respectively compared to our above calculation the results of comparison highlighted the necessity of distinguishing the components of sgd and estimating nutrient fluxes through fresh sgd and saline sgd separately in order to avoid overestimating sgd derived nutrient fluxes meanwhile similar to the radium endmember here nutrient endmembers in groundwater were selected based on an assumption as well that was no nutrient transformation from the sampling point to the discharge point actually it is inevitable that nutrients concentrations in coastal aquifers would change as it is transported from the sampling point to the discharge point slomp and van cappellen 2004 and the groundwater sampling depth and distance to the bay are the main factors that influence the assumption therefore in this study the well water and porewater we sampled were as close to the bay as possible in order to obtain the most potential groundwater discharges to the bay moreover considering the spatial variations of nutrient concentrations in our collected groundwater samples this assumption was thought to be acceptable and widely used in such sgd related studies thus leading to reliable nutrient fluxes transported from sgd to the dsb according to the din and dip budgets the din flux into the dsb through all the considered sources was much higher than that of the dip fig 9 fresh sgd contributed 50 8 19 4 of din and 4 4 1 7 of dip whereas saline sgd contributed 12 3 4 1 and 55 3 18 6 respectively in total din and dip fluxes input through sgd were 7 8 and 21 2 times the river input thus the sgd derived nutrient input is a crucial source of nutrients in the bay mariculture discharge contributed 21 2 and 33 3 of din and dip respectively it is worth noting that a portion of coastal wastewater and mariculture discharge seeped into aquifers and was discharged as coastal groundwater consequently the value of inorganic nutrient flux through coastal groundwater was conservative in addition we found that the total sources were smaller than the sinks there may be some sources that were not considered in the system such as discharged from products of shallow sea mariculture and the conversion of organic n and p which also provided the material basis for the inorganic nutrients in the dsb which will be discussed in the following section nitrogen is generally the most important nutrient in sgd and few studies have reported detailed n morphological data santos et al 2021 in this study the no3 concentration in fresh gw was much higher than that in saline sgd fig 10 a fresh sgd derived no3 flux was the main component of din flux 98 of the total inorganic nitrogen species because the effect of denitrification was much less in fresh sgd with less organic matter saline sgd derived nh4 flux was the main component of din flux 99 of the total inorganic nitrogen species on the one hand the high nh4 concentration in saline sgd was produced by the degradation of organic matter wilhelm et al 1994 chen et al 2020b on the other hand due to the oxygen deficient environment in porewater no3 can be consumed and converted to nh4 resulting in a high nh4 concentration in saline sgd brooks et al 2021 the reduced nitrogen nh4 in the surface water can be regenerated in situ through zooplankton excretion or bacterial remineralization whereas oxidized nitrogen no3 comes from an external supply system dugdale and goering 1967 bronk et al 1994 such as rivers and groundwater during the long hours of hot sunshine in the summer when photosynthesis occurs the oxygen content of the surface water is relatively high resulting in high organic matter concentration and low nutrient levels external inputs have become the main factor controlling the form of inorganic nitrogen in the surface water herbert 1999 moreover nox removal and nh4 production in surface seawater occurring at sgd and or river driven trophic levels can be attributed to the action of dissimilated nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra dnra can not only permanently and effectively remove nox but also lead to non negligible nh4 production previous studies have shown that high concentrations of dnra consume significant nitrate concentrations and are more significant than other biochemical processes such as denitrification and anammox fernandes et al 2012 giblin et al 2013 roberts et al 2014 previous studies have shown that dnra processes are more important than denitrification processes for no3 which increases at higher doc levels and acts as an electron donor kessler et al 2018 mariculture also had an important impact on the nitrogen cycle as shellfish breeding in the dsb released large amounts of nox with biological effects during the sampling period therefore dnra plays a major role in the biochemical transformation of nox in the mariculture areas and dominates the direct impact of mariculture high summer water temperatures reduced nitrate reductase activity and affected the assimilation of no3 and nh4 in addition fresh sgd carried high concentrations of no3 and po4 3 into the bay providing a higher din load than river input compared to surface water fresh sgd had a smaller nh4 no3 ratio which can significantly change the nutrient ratio in surface water of the dsb overall the input of fresh sgd is more important for changing the phytoplankton community structure although saline sgd accounted for a larger proportion of sgd the nh4 no3 ratio was smaller than that in fresh sgd and was subject to environmental influences and is not likely to change substantially over the course of a year jiao et al 2010 furthermore because the bay water is vertically well mixed the nutrients released by the sediments are transported upward which can also increase the nutrient content of the surface water yin 2003 xu et al 2010 even so sgd derived fluxes play an important role in influencing the inorganic nutrients in surface seawater of the dsb in addition many sgd studies have emphasized no3 because anthropogenic activities typically produce large amounts of no3 andersen et al 2007 bertics et al 2010 in addition the widespread phytoplankton community plays an important role in the bioavailability of nh4 and contributes to the dynamic transformation of n ammonium in surface water may be converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria plankton thus nitrate is not always from an external source as ammonium autochthonously produced by photooxidation of organic matter and bacteria plankton middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2000 meanwhile a few studies have reported that don was also the dominant form of n in sgd douglas et al 2021a b santos et al 2021 which has the potential to reflect the serious affects by local pollution sources such as mariculture discharge and wastewater discharge on the coastal waters to evaluate the degree of eutrophication of surface seawater in the dsb the data of inorganic nutrients were used to calculate the redfield ratio n p si ratio and the ratio diagram of si n and si p was plotted fig 10c ratios of n p 16 indicated that n was a limiting element whereas ratios 16 indicated that p was a limiting element for phytoplankton growth nguyen et al 2019 lu et al 2020 in surface water of the dsb nitrogen is dominated by no3 and nh4 with high concentrations relative to p leading to p limitation for phytoplankton growth in dsb surface water fig 10c if the nutrient ratio from various sources differs significantly from the redfield ratio the nutrient ratio of different source inputs to coastal waters fig 10c may limit primary production and affect biological communities conley et al 2011 santos et al 2021 generally in the absence of anthropogenic sources coastal regions are nitrogen limited because of the efficient coupling between absorption by primary producers microbial mineralization and denitrification from sediments howarth and marino 2006 therefore high din dip or din dsi ratio of fresh groundwater input can promote phytoplankton growth 4 3 the comparison of don and dop major sources similar to din and dip the don and dop sources were also estimated in the dsb the n and p cycles of the dsb are strongly influenced by human activities which alter inflow and pathways resulting in eutrophication and increased oxygen consumption similarly the don and dop fluxes through bottom sediment diffusion were estimated to be 1 6 0 5 105 and 4 4 0 8 103 mol d 1 respectively based on the results of atmospheric deposition of don and dop by chen et al 2015 and wang et al 2018a the don and dop deposition rates were 129 and 0 05 mmol m 2 yr 1 respectively resulting in the fluxes of 1 0 105 mol d 1 for don and 4 2 101 mol d 1 for dop according to zheng 2019 the nutrient fluxes through mariculture discharge were estimated to be 3 6 106 mol d 1 for don and 1 1 105 mol d 1 for dop in the bay the riverine don and dop fluxes were 2 6 105 and 5 7 104 mol d 1 respectively combining all the organic nutrient sources considered fig 11 fresh sgd contributed 4 4 1 7 of don and 8 1 3 1 of dop while saline sgd accounted for 18 5 6 2 and 33 4 11 2 of the total sources for don and dop respectively highlighting the importance of sgd on transporting organic nutrients to the dsb mariculture discharge reached 47 9 of don and 28 2 of dop and is recognized as the most predominant source of organic nutrients in the dsb in comparison the organic nutrient input from the river water was a minor source contributing 3 5 of don and 14 8 of dop based on the results of nutrient sources sgd was the substantial source of n in the dsb previous studies have focused on din that is more readily available to primary producers while ignoring the slower assimilation rate of sgd associated don in primary production as its contribution is currently unknown kroeger et al 2006 santos et al 2021 the don in groundwater usually originates from soil leachate that penetrates underground estuaries zooplankton excretion and leaching of microbial and algal biomass so don increases in coastal regions and groundwater generally constitutes a large pool of don kroeger et al 2006 sipler and bronk 2015 douglas et al 2021a santos et al 2021 in addition the conversion of n during groundwater transport may affect the chemical form of n which is then discharged into rivers or coastal waters in the dsb nutrients in fresh groundwater were dominated by nox while saline groundwater river water and surface seawater were all dominated by don fig 10d it is generally accepted that almost all the n in aquifers is in the form of nox with ammonification and nitrification occurring in unsaturated sediments above aquifers nox is sufficiently mobile in the soil to be transported in large quantities to the aquifers bouwman et al 2005 moreover mineralization adsorption and complexation of nox as well as adsorption and nitrification of nh4 occur during nitrogen transportation in unsaturated sediments and aquifers cronan and aiken 1985 wilhelm et al 1994 kroeger et al 2006 thereby the don concentrations in saline groundwater were usually higher than those in fresh groundwater corbet et al 2002 kroeger et al 2006 don was relatively high in uncontaminated groundwater although it may also originate from anthropogenic sources because of the high don contribution through sgd fig 9 even a small amount of instability can affect the final amount of nitrogen available for primary producers in general don represents a large fraction of the nitrogen in sgd typically the estuarine dop was dominant in low salinity s 10 and high salinity s 25 regions while the medium salinity s 10 20 region was dominated by dip with the proportion of dip up to 75 lin et al 2012 the dip inventory in the dsb was deficient with dip inputs far from sufficient to support the aquaculture harvest this dip deficiency reveals the existence of other p sources in the dsb such as regenerative cycling of dip in the water and sediments especially the conversion of dop to dip due to the large dop inventory in the water column dip is the form most readily available to phytoplankton and other aquatic microorganisms karl and craven 1980 björkman and karl 1994 lin et al 2012 owing to dip in biological debris and excrement the produced phosphate can rapidly return to the upper water layer after chemical decomposition and water dissolution ziegler and benner 1999 in general dop must be decomposed and oxidized by bacteria into dip which enters the cycling process dyhrman and palenik 1999 therefore the regeneration and recycling of p in the dsb may be an important supplement to dip furthermore dop is a potential source of phosphorus that can be directly utilized by phytoplankton karl and craven 1980 björkman and karl 1994 it is important to note that nutrients from sgd bottom sediment diffusion and atmospheric deposition were supplied into the entire bay whereas nutrients released from mariculture were predominantly derived from mariculture regions fig 1b although high concentrations of nutrients are only present in or around the mariculture areas the large tidal difference in the bay results in a rapid dilution of nutrients after release so the influence is also considerable in the entire dsb however extensive fishing and oyster farming in the bay mouth has resulted in slow water flow and nutrient accumulation in the bay as a result nutrients through sgd and mariculture discharge were the dominant sources in the dsb which may alter the nutrient structure and lead to p limitation 4 4 impact of sgd and mariculture discharge derived nutrients on primary production compared with the low nutrient fluxes of other external sources in the bay the nutrients contributed by mariculture discharge and sgd may not be able to directly increase phytoplankton primary productivity but mariculture may have an impact on the local environment in the study region the main components of din discharged from mariculture were nh4 and no3 which are the most favorable chemical forms of n for phytoplankton and macroalgae troell et al 2003 qi et al 2019 during our sampling season the average primary production in the dsb water was reported to be 595 mg c m 2 d 1 zhang et al 2014 based on the redfield ratio the assimilated ratio of n to p for phytoplankton was assumed to be 16 1 therefore sgd and mariculture contributed 350 and 118 based on n and 104 and 58 based on p respectively for the requirements of phytoplankton growth in the dsb in addition to direct effects mariculture discharge may also affect phytoplankton growth by changing the nutrient structure n p ratio within or around mariculture regions in the dsb the average n p ratio in surface water was 33 1 which was much higher than the redfield ratio fig 12 indicating that phytoplankton growth was restricted by p in the mariculture discharge the n p ratio 32 5 was slightly higher than that in the surface water whereas the n p ratio in sgd 237 was significantly higher a portion of the water with a high n p ratio from sgd into the bay water would be diluted by mariculture activities moreover mariculture discharge could help neutralize the high n p ratio from sgd this may explain why algal blooms did not occur in the dsb despite high din concentrations of course algal outbreaks are the result of many factors such as water temperature salinity nutrient level etc so robust and in depth relevant research is warranted 4 5 comparison to other mariculture areas on the global scale 4 5 1 importance of sgd derived nutrients in global mariculture regions to facilitate comparison the current study summarized the available case studies on sgd in mariculture areas globally and normalized the sgd fluxes and associated nutrients to the unit area table 1 the main mariculture species in the case studies were shellfish and fish with sgd variations over a range of 0 05 310 cm d 1 which encompassed the normalized sgd rate in the dsb 14 3 4 9 cm d 1 moreover the sgd rate in the dsb was comparable to the other two asian mariculture areas of the yeoja bay and the gamak bay which had similar area of the study region and mariculture species to the dsb hwang et al 2005b hwang et al 2010 in addition compared to other domestic mariculture areas the dsb had a similar sgd rate to the laoye lagoon and the sanggou bay ji et al 2013 wang et al 2014 but was higher than that in the daya bay wang et al 2018b and was lower than that in the maowei bay and the xiangshan bay chen et al 2018 peng et al 2021 the normalized din and dip rates in the dsb were 22 5 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 4 0 1 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively which were much higher than those in the daya bay wang et al 2018b that may be related to the larger scale of mariculture in the dsb and the severe environmental impacts of human activities such as mariculture and wastewater discharge although the sgd derived nutrient rate in the dsb seems similar to that in other regions sgd plays a crucial role in the environment of mariculture regions it is worth noting that there is almost no research on dissolved organic matter through sgd in global mariculture therefore our study on sgd associated dissolved organic nutrients in mariculture regions can provide basic data for global relevant research coastal ecosystems are under various environmental pressures worldwide owing to the rapid development of maricultural activities bouwman et al 2013b suárez abelenda et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2017 mariculture discharges large amounts of nitrogen phosphorus organic matter and total suspended solid into coastal waters through mariculture activities affecting the nutrient structure of coastal ecosystems on the one hand sgd and associated nutrients can improve the primary productivity of coastal waters thus promoting the growth of aquaculture species such as algae fish and shellfish and have a positive impact on their production hwang et al 2005b utsunomiya et al 2017 andrisoa et al 2019 wang et al 2021b on the other hand sgd has also been shown to endanger the health of mariculture species due to the associated input of pollutants valiela et al 1992 mcclelland et al 1997 montiel et al 2019 carroll et al 2021 conversely the nutrient enriched seawater in mariculture areas especially the coastal aquaculture ponds may intrude into the underlying multilayered aquifers thereby affecting sgd and the nutrient loads carried to the nearby coastal waters tal et al 2017 liu and du 2022 therefore the influence of sgd in the sustainable development of mariculture is worthy of attention and it is also a crucial issue in future mariculture related research to provide basic data reference for the management of mariculture and sustainable chinese fishery resources china has the largest mariculture production in the world accounting for over half of the total global mariculture production wang et al 2020 the current study attempted to evaluate the sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the whole mariculture areas along the chinese coasts to reduce the uncertainty caused by extreme values and to estimate the sgd flux in the chinese mariculture area the median value of all cases was used for the estimation the median sgd rate of chinese mariculture areas is 14 7 4 38 cm d 1 and sgd associated nutrient fluxes are 26 6 21 3 mmol m 2 d 1 of din and 0 2 0 3 mmol m 2 d 1 of dip according to data from the china fishery statistics yearbook for the sampling year fisheries administration bureau 2020 chinese mariculture covers a total area of 2 0 104 km2 therefore the sgd flux of the chinese mariculture regions is 2 9 0 9 109 m3 d 1 and sgd associated nutrient fluxes are 5 3 4 3 108 mol d 1 for din and 4 6 6 8 106 mol d 1 for dip according to zhang et al 2020 the total sgd flux along the chinese coastline was 1 5 2 8 1010 m3 d 1 and the total sgd related nutrient fluxes were 1 4 4 6 109 mol d 1 for din and 1 1 3 1 107 mol d 1 for dip sgd derived nutrient flux in the chinese mariculture areas accounted for 18 of din and 22 of dip of the total sgd along the chinese coastline which emphasized that the sgd in the mariculture areas also play an important role in coastal nutrient sources moreover the nutrient fluxes through rivers to chinese coastal seas were 4 4 108 mol d 1 of din and 4 7 106 mol d 1 of dip zhang et al 2020 so the sgd derived din and dip fluxes from the chinese mariculture areas accounted for 1 2 and 1 0 times those of rivers respectively it is worth noting that coastal mariculture areas are highly connected with coastal groundwater aquifers therefore water with high nutrient levels in the mariculture areas can be frequently exchanged with coastal groundwater altering the chemical composition and flux of sgd this may affect the outward transportation of solutes through sgd montiel et al 2019 4 5 2 possible mitigation strategies for nutrients from sgd and mariculture discharge from the nutrient structure the input of nutrients with high n p has the potential to increase the n p ratio in the water column of the dsb large amounts of nutrients released by mariculture discharge and sgd are relatively difficult to remove from bay water leading to environmental hazards such as eutrophication the green development of mariculture must adjust the breeding structure and reasonably match the aquaculture ratio to minimize mariculture pollution zheng 2019 therefore the development of a reasonable mariculture management strategy is important for the environmental protection of the dsb reasonable aquaculture management strategies are conducive to minimizing the nutrients released from mariculture including reducing feed delivery expanding the scale of non feeding mariculture species e g macroalgae and filter feeding shellfish and decreasing the discharge of mariculture wastewater feed breeding remains the most commonly used mariculture method in asia bunlipatanon et al 2014 in the dsb more than half of the mariculture areas are feed breeding based on our observations the global average retention efficiencies of n and p in mariculture are approximately 36 and 33 respectively bouwman et al 2013b therefore this problem can be effectively ameliorated by decreasing the feed inputs or by using more efficient formulated feeds furthermore breeding large algae and filter feeding shellfish facilitates the reduction of nitrogen phosphorus and other organic matters in the aquatic environment gao et al 2014 sgd also delivers abundant nutrients leading to the risk of seawater eutrophication therefore the sgd and its associated nutrient fluxes into the mariculture areas must be determined and mariculture species must be allocated to deplete nutrients and mitigate eutrophication trends moreover large scale fishing and oyster cultivation were established at the mouth of the bay resulting in slow water flow and nutrient accumulation hence placing mariculture areas in open waters with sufficient water flow can disperse nutrients and prevent eutrophication intensive fish breeding in the dsb should be devoted to aquaculture development in the sea area beyond the 20 m isobath zheng 2019 based on the characteristics of the dsb sea condition various types of wind resistant cage and raft mariculture facilities should be researched and developed and wind resistant mariculture facilities should be used to conduct intensive mariculture in deep water outside the bay to reduce the pollution loads 5 conclusions in this study radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra were used to quantify the total sgd and related nutrient fluxes in the dsb during september 2019 the conceptual water and salt mass balance models found that the fresh sgd flux in dsb was 5 1 1 9 106 m3 d 1 which only contributed about 13 of the total sgd flux by estimating nutrient fluxes from fresh sgd and saline sgd separately the total sgd derived nutrient fluxes were 6 4 2 4 106 1 2 0 4 105 1 7 0 6 106 and 1 6 0 5 105 mol d 1 for din dip don and dop which were equivalent to 7 8 21 2 6 6 and 2 8 times the riverine input respectively compared to other nutrient sources mariculture discharge played the dominated role in delivering nutrients to the dsb followed by sgd a china wide upscaling that combined our results with literature revealed that nutrient fluxes through sgd in chinese mariculture areas were comparable to the river input along the coasts of china suggesting the importance of sgd and associated nutrient fluxes in mariculture areas and should be considered in the management of the ecological environment of

manuscript thanks so much for their kind and detailed comments and suggestions which enabled us to have a deeper understanding of our research from different perspectives during the revision process appendix a see appendices a1 a3 a 1 summary of parameters for sgd estimation see table a1 a 2 radium sources and sinks for estimating sgd a2 1 riverine input ra from river input in dsb is estimated to by multiplying the river freshwater discharge with the radium isotopes activities in the river water endmember in this study we selected the station which salinity is zero as the river water endmember the freshwater discharge of the zhangjiang river was 2 77 106 m3 d 1 during our sampling period consequently the dissolved radium 224ra 223ra 228ra and 226ra fluxes from riverine input were calculated to be 4 0 0 1 109 6 2 0 7 108 4 4 0 1 109 and 1 2 0 1 109 dpm d 1 respectively a2 2 diffusion from bottom sediment the diffusion flux of radium through the sediments pore space is a possible source of radium in the bay water and is obtained by multiplying the radium diffusion rate by the area of study region we set up two control groups for four groups of experiments to determine the different radium diffusion rates of different particle size sediments and considering the proportion of each particle size in the bay was different we used the weighted average for calculation the diffusion rates dpm m 2 d 1 of 224ra and 223ra were 223 5 9 and 5 9 1 9 respectively regarding to long lived 226ra and 228ra the indoor experiment time was too short to reach the long term equilibrium between sediment diffusion and decay so we applied an approach that developed by nozaki et al 1990 estimate this term the equation was expressed as follows a2 1 f diff p i φ d dp k ad d mx λ i 1 k ad where k ad is adsorption coefficient d mx is sediment mixing coefficient d dp is dispersion coefficient for water movement through sediments φ is sediment porosity which was calculated by parameters of sediments collected in the field and p i is production from parent nuclide the diffusion rates of 228ra and 226ra were 1 0 0 04 and 0 1 0 003 dpm m 2 d 1 respectively hence with the surface area of the dsb the diffusion fluxes of radium 223ra 224ra 228ra and 226ra were estimated to be 6 6 0 8 109 1 4 0 04 1011 2 7 0 1 108 and 2 7 0 1 107 dpm d 1 respectively a2 3 radioactive decay for the radioactive decay in the dsb since the half life of 226ra and 228ra were much longer than flushing time the decay of the water migration time scale of dsb could be neglected conversely the half life of 223ra and 224ra were short and its decay losses were the significant process of radium losses in the dsb during the sampling period the decay losses were calculated by multiplying the decay constant by the radium inventories as shown in the following equation 12 a2 2 f decay λ r a inventory assuming the water mixing was relatively uniform in the vertical profile the radium inventories r a inventory were estimated by multiplying the average radium activities in the dsb by the bay volume the average 224ra and 223ra activities in surface water were 106 0 5 0 and 6 0 1 2 dpm 100 l 1 in study area respectively based on the above results the radioactive decay losses of 224ra and 223ra in the dsb were 3 3 0 2 1011 dpm d 1 and 6 0 1 2 109 dpm d 1 respectively a2 4 mixing with open sea mixing losses with open seawater the exchange between open seawater with low ra activities and inner bay water was another important process of radium losses we used the method in kim and kim 2011 to estimate this flux and this term could be written as follows a2 3 f mix r a inventory r a o b 1 b r a river v bay t f where r a o is radium activities in open seawater b is reflow factor which was calculated through three endmember model r a river is radium activities in river water endmember r a inventory is radium inventory in the whole bay t f is the flushing time based on these parameters we obtained radium fluxes 224ra 223ra 228ra and 226ra from mixing losses with open seawater to be 5 7 0 3 1010 dpm d 1 8 9 4 6 109 dpm d 1 6 6 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 and 1 9 0 1 1010 dpm d 1 respectively a 3 details for nutrient budgets the riverine nutrient fluxes into the dsb can be estimated by the nutrient concentrations in the river water endmember and the corresponding local river discharge rate the riverine nutrient fluxes were 8 16 105 and 5 55 103 mol d 1 for din and dip respectively nutrients accumulate in sediments with higher concentrations than that in the overlying water and then a large amount of nutrients is released across the sediment water interface and transported into overlying water bodies similar to the diffusion of ra from sediments we obtained the nutrient diffusion flux via the nutrients diffusion rate multiplied by the nutrient concentration in liquid supernatant of diffusion experiment minus the average nutrient concentration in surface water the diffusion rates μmol m 2 d 1 of nutrient were estimated to be 1121 0 for din and 10 5 for dip respectively from the indoor diffusion experiment in consequence the nutrient fluxes of din and dip from sediment diffusion were 2 3 1 3 105 and 4 2 2 2 103 mol d 1 respectively nutrient fluxes through atmospheric deposition were calculated by multiplying the area of the dsb with nutrient deposition rates zhang et al 2007 estimated the average atmospheric deposition fluxes of din and dip to the entire east china sea continental shelf approximately 8 5 105 km2 to be 1 17 and 0 002 kmol s 1 respectively because the dsb is adjacent to the east china sea we replaced the above atmospheric deposition fluxes with those in the dsb as a result the nutrient fluxes through atmospheric deposition in dsb were estimated to be 3 4 105 mol d 1 for din and 5 8 102 mol d 1 for dip respectively with industry development in the coastal cities of the dsb the amount of wastewater discharge has increased annually it carries a large amount of nutrients and has a significant impact on the aquatic environment wastewater is polluted water generated by human activities and production the wastewater discharge of the dsb 2 1 106 m3 d 1 was approximately 7 7 of the total discharge of the main rivers in fujian province data from fujian province chi environmental protection chi 2008 the nutrient fluxes were calculated by multiplying the total wastewater discharge by the nutrient concentration of that discharge we collected wastewater from the coastal region and measured its nutrient content the concentrations μmol l 1 of wastewater were 89 7 for din and 1 6 for dip respectively the related nutrient fluxes were estimated to be 1 9 105 mol d 1 for din and 3 4 103 mol d 1 for dip respectively the scale of mariculture in the dsb ranked among the best in fujian province and the pollutants entering the environment were primarily n and p during the marine culturing process therefore the mariculture discharge could not be ignored in addition the main mariculture methods in the dsb can be divided into terrestrial and shallow sea mariculture liu et al 2019 shallow sea mariculture is based on direct seawater culture generally this method does not require the addition of feed therefore the nutrients contributed by this item were considered to be endogenous thus we will not discuss it separately the terrestrial pond culture was based on a land pond and seawater was used for the culture this method requires the addition of feed one part of the polluted waste generated during the culture process can be used through the decomposition of microorganisms and photosynthesis of phytoplankton in the pond the deposit at the bottom of the pond was not reused which caused accumulation in the environment another part is discharged from the pool by changing the water which has a certain impact on the environment of the adjacent sea area the load deposited in the mariculture pond was generally deposited at the bottom of the pond or infiltrated into the aquifer and discharged in the form of groundwater in our study the method established by zheng 2019 was used to assess the mariculture discharge in the dsb consequently the equation can be expressed as follows a3 1 m mariculture q w c m where m mariculture mol d 1 is the nutrient flux through terrestrial pond culture c is the nutrient concentration mol m 3 in wastewater and this value was obtained from field sampling and laboratory measurements the values were 0 803 μmol l 1 for din and 0 0247 μmol l 1 for dip q w is the discharge amount of wastewater during the marine culturing process and is expressed as follows a3 2 q w a w h w n a w h w φ w t w n where a w is the area of seawater aquaculture of 3 60 107 m2 the average depth h w of the pond was 2 0 m gao et al 2014 zheng 2019 n is the annual culture cycle of 3 which refers to culture three times per year t w is the day when the water is changed in the culture ponds 100 days as a cycle no water exchange for the first 30 days of 70 d and φ w is the water exchange rate of 0 05 therefore the nutrient fluxes through the mariculture discharge in the dsb were calculated to be 2 14 106 mol d 1 for din and 6 58 104 mol d 1 for dip respectively this method provides a preliminary estimate of the environmental impacts of mariculture generally absorption by phytoplankton mixing loss to the open sea aquaculture harvest and organic detrital degradation have been considered the main sinks of nutrients in coastal regions wang et al 2014 peng et al 2021 nutrients have been recognized as the basis of marine primary productivity and the food cycle and exist in different forms in the water environment according to the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 and primary productivity 595 mg m 2 d 1 of dsb zhang et al 2014 the nutrient fluxes via absorption by phytoplankton were determined to be 1 82 106 mol d 1 for din and 1 14 105 mol d 1 for dip respectively although the deposition of dissolved organic nutrients has not yet been reported in the dsb which mainly depends on the phytoplankton abundance the nutrients through organic detrital degradation primarily depend on phytoplankton abundance with a value of approximately 136 104 ind m 3 ye et al 2017 phytoplankton abundance in the dsb was of the same order of magnitude as that in sanggou bay yuan et al 2014 thus we applied the rate of deposition of dissolved organic nutrient in sanggou bay to the present study consequently the nutrient fluxes via deposition of dissolved organic nutrient were estimated to be 4 4 105 mol d 1 for din and 3 8 103 mol d 1 for dip respectively in addition the decrease in nutrients via harvesting cannot be overlooked in our study region the annual production of fish is 3 16 105 tons and shellfish production is 9 08 104 tons lu et al 2001 wu 2016 during the sampling period the major species was shellfish with protein and p accounting for approximately 31 and 18 respectively whereas the other main species was fish with protein and p accounting for approximately 36 and 33 respectively bouwman et al 2013b qi et al 2019 as a result nutrient losses during shellfish and fish aquaculture harvest were approximately 2 78 107 mol d 1 for din and 1 07 107 mol d 1 for dip respectively the mixing loss is large because tidal ranges are large and the east china sea has been recognized as the main external sink of nutrients in the ocean therefore we used an approach similar to that of ra isotopes to estimate nutrient fluxes via mixing loss this equation is expressed as follows a3 3 e out c seawater c out a h t f where c seawater is the average nutrient concentration in surface water with values of 45 7 μmol l 1 for din and 1 3 μmol l 1 for dip respectively c out is the nutrient concentration in open sea endmember with values of 10 4 μmol l 1 for din and 0 4 μmol l 1 for dip h represents the average depth of the dsb eventually through mixing loss the nutrient fluxes of din and dip were 4 1 1 6 106 mol d 1 and 1 1 0 4 105 mol d 1 respectively appendix b supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found
