8940,discrepancies in time space representation of indata and calibration validation data obstructs analysis of hydrological processes thatlink natural and anthropogenic water infrastructure in catchments and landscapes to improve indata for hydrological and modelling of the soil plant atmosphere continuum this paper presents a high resolution dataset of hydrological functions in the agricultural landscape of tidan sw sweden we firstly address spatial representation of soil physical parameters describing soil water flows and storage secondly we derive tile drainage datasets from historical maps lastly we explore delineation and spatial location of streams ditches and waterbodies to improve description of water connectivity the new soil datasets with top and subsoil descriptions varied in depicting the sensitivity of saturated hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity the most representative soil map showed moderate 34 to very rapid 21 saturated hydraulic conductivity water holding capacity below 40 mm 10 cm 1 94 and a dry bulk density ranging between 1 2 and 1 8 g cm 3 71 the digitalization of drained fields suggests that 69 of the arable fields are under tile drainage dominated by sandy loam loam and clay loam the combined stream network resulted in 5350 km of streams and ditches 14 km and 129 respectively compared to available best resolution

zhang et al 2021 increased detail in data knowledge of soil physical relationships and more sophisticated models with higher computational capacity have been suggested as reasons to advance the use of

be affected by the algorithm used to derive parameters from raw satellite data e g senkondo et al 2019 chao et al 2021 additionally a mismatch in the time space resolution of indata and calibration

information for spac and hydrological models also affect parameter settings and process sensitivity e g abbaspour et al 2018 in some cases effect on parameter setting by resolution is also catchment dependent e g veith et al 2010 guse et al 2017 sweden is an example of good national collections of open access high resolution spatial data linked to landscape description such as topography and soil textural composition as well as climate on a temporal scale nevertheless parameters that typically directly influence hydrological flows are lacking in spatio temporal representation for example most soil profile information only includes texture and occasionally soil organic carbon raulund rasmussen and callesen 1999 jansson and karlberg 2004 paulsson et al 2015 geological survey of sweden 2018 swedish land survey 2019 swedish university of agricultural sciences 2021a few samples exist on parameters as infiltration capacity saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity water holding capacity and bulk density these are fundamental to understanding soil physical properties governing hydrological partitioning flow rates and water storage in soils in hydrological catchment studies from swedish arable landscapes soil parameters have often been generalized to so called type soils with soil physical properties derived as generic parameters or from pedotransfer functions salazar et al 2010 johnsson et al 2019 in other cases the origin and or estimates of soil parameters have not been fully presented in publications e g andréasson et al 2004 teutschbein et al 2011 davies and beven 2015 arheimer and lindström 2019 some studies e g jansson and andersson 1988 grusson et al 2021 that present their soil data have used soil physical data either directly from the slu soil

the lack of detail concerning soil physical properties in these studies is either due to model configuration where defined soil physical parameters are not required or to the fact that the level of detail seems insignificant for the purpose of the specific study another data gap is the lack of accurate delineation of manmade and natural streams information on stream pathways is somewhat accessible but limited to local applicability streams and ditches visible above ground are available as high resolution datasets both potential locations of natural streams ågren and lidberg 2020 and manmade ditches lidberg et al 2021 identify a much denser stream from topographic maps and natural pathways for stream formation ai and image recognition than those depicted in previously available maps however these maps do not capture subsurface tile drains and subsurface connections e g culverts which are important flow pathways especially in agricultural and urban catchments the best available large scale data on tile drainage plans is a modified version of the cadastral map sv ekonomiska kartan produced from orthophotographs between years 1935 1978 although the maps are available as scanned and georectified they are not readily available for use in gis software and do not show the true outline of tile drainage pipes rather they show fields with available tile drainage plans neither do they include recent landscape changes such as merged fields and shifts in spatial range over time or more recent installations of tile drains and related plans anthropogenic landscape changes to land use hydromorphology and water storage withdrawal and recharge show alteration to evapotranspiration runoff and soil water storage compared to unaffected landscapes nevertheless the direction of change is governed by area specific properties both internationally and nationally e g malmquist 2021a kåresdotter et al 2022 hydromorphological changes manmadeor natural also has the potential to delay or reinforce flow patterns and alter their characteristics from perennial streams to more resemble ephermal streams with possible further implications for e g flora and fauna along streams or in waterbodies datry et al 2023 thus a mismatch in the available spatial representation of key hydrological features especially in landscapes with complex interactions of anthropogenic and natural waterways and storage obstructs a thorough exploration of especially subsurface processes in catchment modelling this is an issue as evidence of synergies between engineered and nature based solutions to sustain effects of climate change on hydrological pathways is lacking miralles wilhelm et al 2023 thus this paper explores the availability of high resolution spatial data for developing the descriptions of hydrological functions in agricultural landscapes the paper seeks to answer can high resolution data improve knowledge on anthropogenic modified hydrological functions we illustrate this with three examples of spatial data adaptation to fit a catchment scale hydrological model here soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 for a swedish agricultural catchment sw sweden our case study firstly addresses how to link point data of soil physical properties to spatially distributed information on soil texture in order to improve the representation of hydrological functions of soil water storage and water flows such as infiltration secondly we develop spatial data for soils and their functions for water flows and storage under different degrees of anthropogenic modifications that is i e natural and highly modified subsurface tile drained soils finally the delineation of streams ditches and water bodies and effects of spatial location are explored we discuss the implications on landscape hydrological functions for hydrological modelling 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area tidan catchment 696 km2 is located in västra götaland county sw sweden 58 6 n 14 0 e 58 2 n 13 9 e in the temperate boreal climate zone köppen zone dfb i e cold climate without dry season but with warm summers peel et al 2007 and zone 407 and 418 eu pedoclimate zones jones et al 2010 the landscape is heterogenous consisting of 24 169 km2 agricultural land 21 147 km2 forest and 4 29 km2 urban land malmquist 2021b fig 1 tidan catchment represents a typical swedish arable landscape with modified hydrological features and substantial surface and subsurface drainage occurring over more than 150 years lindelöf 2021 the area has historically been subjected to recurrent flooding due to high precipitation around the catchment mainly occurring along stream tidan adjacent to river ösan holmbom and söderström 2012 wessberg 2019 dry spells droughts have historically been a less recurrent issue holmbom and söderström 2012 wessberg 2019 2 2 data sources the three datasets were developed from spatial raster and polygon data collected from open access databases provided by the swedish land survey lantmäteriet geological survey of sweden sgu swedish board of agriculture sjv swedish water authorities vattenmyndigheterna county administrative board of västra götaland and additional peer reviewed publications quantified parameter values as point and tabulated data sets for soil texture and soil physical parameters were accessed from the slu soil database agricultural soils and coupmodel soil database forest soils while data from additional peer reviewed publications were analysed and used to develop all three datasets table 1 and table 2 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 linking soil physical properties of infiltration in soil profiles water holding capacity natural drainage and groundwater recharge to soil textural datasets 2 3 1 1 arable soils soil profiles with information on soil physical properties saturated hydraulic conductivity soil organic carbon dry bulk density and plant available water from slu s soil wesström and joel 2012 database hereinafter sld were firstly classified to soil textural classes after the swedish soil groups in the soil map soil classes 1 25 000 1 100 000 geological survey of sweden 2014 hereinafter sc as geological and agricultural soil particle classification systems use different grain size divisions supplemental material fig s2 the soil profiles were additionally classified based on fao textural classes to fit soil classification layers of topsoil from the digital soil map piikki and söderström 2019 dsm the soil physical profile point data and soil textural layers from dsm respectively were associated with glacial postglacial origin in sc and subdivided by their geological origin and soil textural class two soil maps with soil physical properties were created one was based on fao textural classification fao map by associating the soil profiles of unique geological and textural classes from sld to the closest individual soil pixel in dsm of same geological origin and fao textural class the second map was based on swedish soil classes sv map and the nearest pixel from the subsoil layers of sc some soil classes in sld at topsoil 0 10 cm and subsoil 40 60 cm were not available from all the various soil texture classes present in dsm and sc of tidan catchment to fill this gap in sld they were fitted to the closest soil class with the closest similar textural composition available in dsm and sc 2 3 1 2 organic soils physical parameters for organic soils are limited in the source material table 1 thus physical parameters were assigned based on their organic type e g gyttja soil bog peat or fen peat and proximity to the study area based on soil profiles from berglund et al 1989 and berglund 2011 2 3 1 3 forest soils soil texture for forest soils is available as spatially located polygons and point data while soil physical data are lacking department of forest resource management and department of soil and environment 2022 for our dataset we used a compilation of 24 forest soil profiles on glacial till karltun 1995 henceforth ktd containing the bulk density and volume weight of particle size fractions for three east to west directed transects in southern central and northern sweden for the new soil dataset we combined soil profiles from forest land use from the coup model jansson and karlberg 2004 henceforth cmd with profiles from ktd based on the closest value of soil carbon in topsoil 5 15 cm and subsoil 40 60 cm the matching profiles saturated hydraulic conductivity was assigned based on topsoil organic carbon content bulk density values were then matched individually per each soil layer from the assigned profiles to achieve a realistic variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth soil organic carbon has been shown to vary with topography and hydrologic class e g callesen et al 2003 olsson et al 2009 thus the profiles were associated to spatially distributed hydrological classes stating three qualitative classes of presence absence of moving soil water the position was based on the slope position department of forest resource management and department of soil and environment 2022 of spatially verified soil profiles from the swedish national forest inventory swedish university of agricultural sciences 2022a the linked soil profiles were spatially joined to subsoil layers from sc for land not classified as arable land based on soil texture class 40 50 cm from ktd and the swedish university of agricultural sciences 2022a to determine the association with the geological formation and sorting of material i e till or no till 2 3 1 4 gravel boulder ridges and bedrock soil physical parameters for profiles dominated by coarser particle size are scarce as most soil physical property analyses are done on cylinder cores with a finer soil particle fraction i e particles 2 mm e g stendahl et al 2009 however the density of minerals in the swedish bedrock is relatively homogenous e g knutsson and morfeldt 1973 carlsson and carlstedt 1977 wikner et al 1991 vägverket and räddningsverket 1998 larsson 2008 wallman et al 2018 hence values on bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity for gravel and bedrock were estimated as median values from data by carlsson and carlstedt 1977 wikner et al 1991 vägverket and räddningsverket 1998 mulqueen 2005 zhang et al 2011 ferdos et al 2015 wallman et al 2018 and li et al 2021 values on plant available water in the root zone for gravel and boulder soils were based on generic profiles from cmd and compared with profiles of gravel and bedrock from the american soil database ssurgo soil survey staff 2021 2 3 1 5 soil depth the two soil maps were merged with available soil depths from the soil depth model 2020 geological survey of sweden 2020 as a majority of the soil profiles in ktd and sld were sampled to a depth of 1 m the physical properties below 1 m are unknown to join the soil depth map to the soil physical layers the depths of the soil profile layer sampled at 0 9 0 1 m from sld were adjusted to the depth from the soil depth model 2020 geological survey of sweden 2020 if 1 m in case of soil depths 1 m the respective soil layers below were erased from the final spatial dataset the schematics of how we linked soil physical parameters to soil textural data is presented in fig 2 2 3 2 delineating tile drained field a specific purpose of this study was to develop indata combining natural and manmade waterbodies at catchment scale approximately 64 300087 ha of agricultural land is tile drained in västra götaland region scb and swedish board of agriculture 2018 yet with a high likelihood of additional forested areas being drained to develop a map of tile drainage in tidan catchment we used information on tile drained fields from the historic swedish economic map for the years 1935 1978 swedish land survey copies of the swedish economic map years 1935 1978 include fields marked with available individual tile drainage plans compared to the original economic map that only showed field borders henceforth the original map is stated as m1 and the map with marked tile drainage plans m2 the colour setting of land uses and objects in the maps enables the classification of borders between land use classes and individual fields which further enables extraction of fields that are have been under tile drainage the scanned tile drained fields in m2 were laid over and geo rectified to m1 the two map versions were classified after colour settings by iso cluster unsupervised classification esri n d a the number of classes were set to n 10 esri n d b and classes representing field boundaries and line objects were extracted to separate layers based on their land use class attribution from the unsupervised iso classification thereafter they were transformed from raster to polyline files the boundaries around agricultural fields from m1 were erased from m2 this resulted in maps with only diagonal lines representing fields with available tile drainage plans due to some misalignment during the rectification of the dataset a buffer distance of 15 m from the border lines was included when erasing the borders this to ensure that their full extent was erased 2 3 3 delineation and extent of stream and ditch network a comparison of the two recent datasets over stream networks ågren and lidberg 2020 str and ditches lidberg et al 2021 di indicated misalignment for tidan catchment the topographic stream network particularly depicted water courses in arable land not present in orthopohotographs swedish land survey 2018 resolution 0 25 m thus the two datasets were processed to link and erase false streams for the best possible depiction of the catchment stream network in addition ditches from manually digitized maps depicting drainage ditches from the national county administrative boards verified from the mid 19th century were included available at https ext geodatakatalog lansstyrelsen se geodatakatalogen for tidan catchment the drainage network is dated from 1885 to 1971 some of this dataset was not included in the more recent ditch network in di the three datasets were combined to achieve a connected stream network consisting of both natural streams and man made ditches the streams in str were overlaid and snapped to di with a buffer distance of 30 m based on visual judgement stream network segments that shared a line with the ditch network were selected as true connectivity and overlapping line segments of the topographic stream network were erased the stream segments in str overlapping agricultural fields were erased since natural streams are eliminated by the presence of sub or surface drainage systems section 2 3 2 lastly the segmented topographic stream network and the ditch map were merged into a joint layer depicting the final stream network some of the main streams were not included in the above detailed stream network maps hence polylines for the main river in the catchment ösan and streams delineated for the specific catchment by lindelöf 2021 were snapped to the combined stream ditch network 60 m buffer based on visual judgement reduced by overlapping line segments and merged to the detailed stream network dataset the final layer was then manually adjusted by connecting line segments to gaps along river ösan 2 3 4 water storage in natural and manmade lakes reservoirs and wetlands the locations of constructed wetlands are not always depicted correctly or are fully missing within national databases e g ter borg and barron 2021 thus locations of constructed and natural wetlands within tidan catchment were verified with sentinel 2 images three maps with different colour band combinations were created to capture presence of waterbodies i e the modified normalized difference water index xu 2006 with swir2 data the color infrared vegetation map band nir red and green and land water images bands nir swir1 and red moreover the classified waterbodies were manually controlled and labelled as true or false waterbodies classified as true were compared with national registers from the wetland database constructed wetlands wetland inventory and agricultural areas from the agricultural block database table 2 the classification of waterbodies are arbitrary as definitions for the three classes of waterbodies intersect e g langbein and iseri 1960 world meteorological organization 2012 tiner 2017 however the three classes here were limited by waterbodies classified as reservoirs if they intersected with the newly delineated stream network ponds were classified as open waterbodies if not intersecting with a stream network and wetlands if they contained visible vegetation 2 3 5 mathematical processing of datasets the new soil texture maps sv map and fao map the combined stream and ditch network di and delineated waterbodies were compared spatially with respective original datasets table 1 table 2 all spatial analysis of data were done in arcmap 10 8 1 esri n d c while comparison of stretch areal and volume between new and original datasets were analysed in excel2016 2016 microsoft cooperation the fit of soil physical profiles to soil textural maps were compared with point textural data from soil and crop inventory sci swedish land survey 2019 swedish university of agricultural sciences 2021a and national soil inventory nsi paulsson et al 2015 by fitting a simple linear regression between the datasets with soil texture as single explaining variable data not shown soil physical data saturated hydraulic conductivity water holding capacity and bulk density were extracted per soil texture class soil layer top or subsoil and per undrained and drained areal respectively field area per class was calculated in the attribute table of the layer or respective soil physical property by calculate geometry the absolute area was summarized per class and estimated as share per soil texture and drainage class drained vs undrained fields by dividing the share per soil texture class with total catchment area the soil texture and soil physical properties per drainage class were divided per total area agricultural land the length of di and str and the new combined dataset was estimated by calculating geometry in the attribute tables the variation in length between the datasets was calculated as the difference between the new dataset and di respective str the estimated area and volume of the waterbodies were summarized per class of waterbody i e pond reservoir or wetland the area and volume of unique lakes not present in available datasets were extracted from the new combined datasets and summarized separately 3 results 3 1 assigning soil physical parameters for best fit to soil texture classes the final soil dataset included n 45 individual soil profiles in the fao map and n 35 in the sv map this is somewhat counter intuitive as the swedish soil classification system includes more soil texture classes than the fao system table s1 as swedish soil classes are lumped if classified by the fao classification system a higher number of soil profiles is assigned per fao soil class compared to the swedish system thus increasing the overall number fitted per soil pixel to the nearest fit hence there is an increased number of final included profiles in the fao map fig 3 the two datasets further differed in their lumping of the fao soil classes with a more diverse distribution of fine medium particle classes for the map based on fao classes table 3 the two soil datasets were further used to calculate the spatial distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivity table 4 fig 4a water holding capacity table 4 fig 4b and bulk density table 4 the spatial distribution of soil physical characteristics differs depending on the input soil texture data using swedish or fao texture classification the soil physical datasets based on the sv map have the largest area of moderately slow 44 and very rapid 29 saturated hydraulic conductivity whereas the water holding capacity is mainly in the interval of 20 40 mm 10 cm 1 82 the bulk density is mainly in the interval of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 44 and 1 6 1 8 g cm 3 17 in the subsoil the saturated hydraulic conductivity is lower than in the topsoil with the largest in the slow 17 and moderate 48 categories the water holding capacity in the subsoil is distributed between 0 and 20 mm 10 cm 3 44 and 20 40 mm 10 cm 3 41 while the distribution of bulk density is mainly in the interval 1 2 1 8 g cm 3 48 in the interval of 1 4 1 6 g cm 3 for the input from the fao map the largest area in the catchment has a moderate 34 to very rapid 21 saturated hydraulic conductivity and the water holding capacity is below 40 mm 10 cm 1 soil 94 in the topsoil these values are reflected in the soil classes of sand sandy loam silt loam and loam which constitute the larger areas in the catchment bulk density is between 0 8 and 1 6 g cm 3 in the topsoil and increases in the subsoil to the interval 1 4 1 8 g cm 3 table 4 comparing the two soil datasets two things stand out the fao map dataset results in larger area of rapidly saturated hydraulic conductivity which might impact infiltration at precipitation events however the water holding capacity is lower over a larger area compared to the sv map this increase the risk of drought impact the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity areas are distributed spatially in the centre of the catchment along stream and ditch network and water bodies to a greater extent than the swedish derived data fig 4a due to a lack of stand alone datasets of soil texture and soil physical properties the datasets have not been independently validated 3 2 identification and delineation of tile drained fields on landscape scale the extraction of fields with tile drainage plans from the economic map swedish land survey n d in tidan suggests that 69 205 km2 of the arable fields within tidan catchment have tile drainage plans available this is in line with the official statistics of drainage in västra götaland from 2016 where 64 of the agricultural land was under tile drainage scb and swedish board of agriculture 2018 combining the delineated tile drainage field with the soil texture map classification section 2 3 1 shows that mainly sandy loam loam and clay loam were drained table 4 the final map of fields with tile drainage plans showed higher clay content median 17 13 sd compared to undrained fields median 14 10 sd and lower sand and silt content fig 5 3 3 alignment of natural and manmade stream network the combined stream and ditch network resulted in 5350 km of streams and ditches within tidan catchment showing a landscape of more water flow infrastructure than previously identified for the catchment this is an increase of 649 km compared to str and an increase of 2927 km compared to di table 5 of the topographic stream network 2690 km lie on agriculturally managed fields with 2470 km not intersecting with the ditch network thus the topographic stream network identified on agricultural land was assumed to be falsely delineated as field management ditch networks and tile drainage systems that reallocated streams that would otherwise have occurred naturally due to topography approximately 269 km of the total length of the ditch network 774 km from the county administrative board of västra götaland 2021 intersects with tile drained fields identified under section 2 3 2 and these are not depicted in di a buffer of 5 m was used around the ditches from lidberg et al 2021 to extract non intersecting ditches from the county administrative board of västra götaland 2021 thus some segments are missing in the total length estimate there is a difference with a median of 35 m 0 72 m between the ai delineated ditches and closest vertices of the topographically delineated stream network despite using the same topographic maps as base maps ditches in topographic maps should be visible if the resolution with an average width in the ditch map is higher than 2 m 1 3 m lidberg et al 2021 thus it can also be expected to initiate stream delineation from topographic maps at the same location as the ditches when using topographically governed stream delineation tools in gis software where flow direction and accumulation is identified by the lowest topographic cell neighbours schäuble et al 2008 lópez vicente et al 2014 fig 6 3 4 land cover corrected for natural and constructed water storage in total n 6 additional water bodies were identified from satellite images copernicus sentinel data 2020a b and orthophotos swedish land survey 2018 comprising a total surface area of 4 3 10 3 km2 and an estimated volume of 6 4 103 m3 table 6 compared to readily available databases smhi 2020 2021 smhi n d swedish board of agriculture 2020 swedish environmental protection agency 2021 vattenmyndigheterna länsstyrelserna havs och vattenmyndigheterna n d this is a small addition compared to the total area and volume of delineated water bodies from previously known datasets surface area 1 82 km2 volume 2 68 10 3 km3 combined table 6 although the added area volume the waterbodies is small they can still possibly impact water balance if they are located in hydrologically important spaces 4 discussion 4 1 opportunities and limitations in the three new datasets the new datasets increased spatial resolution via a weighting approach for point to pixel derived from measured soil physical properties governing soil hydrological properties rather than pedotransfer functions using point measured soil texture as input the dataset also accounts for multiple soil layers not fully depicted in existing national datasets see references table 1 an issue also noted in commonly used global soil datasets e g batjes 2009 iasa et al 2012 origiazzi et al 2018 the resolution in the new soil dataset remained 50 50 m after the base map dsm piikki and söderström 2019 this is however the best available resolution dataset for sweden compared to the map sc by the geological survey of sweden 2014 and e g european panagos 2006 kristeensen et al 2019 or global datasets iasa et al 2012 global soil data task 2014 which are based on interpolated values or derived from correlated parameters the increased number of soil profiles per soil textural group for the dataset based on fao soil classification fao map compared to the swedish classification sv map expanded the spatial variation of soil physical properties within the catchment and their respective soil physical properties the dataset based on fao classification resulted in an addition of n 35 n 25 with swedish classification soil profiles compared to e g the set of generic soil profiles n 10 used in calculations of nutrient leakages and environmental impact from soils to waterbodies on both a multi catchment and national scale johnsson et al 2019 thus the method presented herein is one alternative for increasing the spatial representation of soil physical properties not only in tidan catchment but also as extended to other catchments to enhance the representation of soil heterogeneity as no stand alone dataset was available for the validation of either soil texture or soil physical properties the new soil physical dataset should be used with caution a common issue is the backtracking of swedish spatial soil physical datasets to the sampling in soil and crop inventory and national soil inventory paulsson et al 2015 swedish land survey 2019 swedish university of agricultural sciences 2021b resulting in the absence of independent datasets to our knowledge only three additional compiled datasets geological survey of sweden 2018 jansson and karlberg 2004 raulund rasmussen and callesen 1999 of quantified soil texture composition for land uses other than agricultural ones are available for swedish soils two of these datasets were used for the delineation of our new soil datasets the dataset from raulund rasmussen and callesen 1999 was not accessible at the time of our study furthermore soil physical subsoil texture data and quantitative compilation on soil composition and soil physical parameters in forest and urban landscapes is lacking in quantification and resolution department of forest resource management and department of soil and environment 2022 swedish textural point data has previously been shown to be too scattered for traditional interpolation methods in predicting soil texture for soil textural maps in swedish landscapes djodjic et al 2009 also shown for the european dataset in lucas cordeiro et al 2018 additionally piikki and söderström 2019 point to the increased errors of datasets with local compared to national scales due to the availability of fewer calibration validation samples however the development of pedotransfer functions adapted for swedish soils have shown good fit regarding water content and porosity with the inclusion of soil organic carbon at a higher water content and bulk density linked to soil textural class e g kätterer et al 2006 furthermore topsoil and subsoil textures have been shown to be overall correlated in swedish soil profiles at least in currently available soil samples sohlenius and eriksson 2009 however to include subsoil characteristics in finer soil sampling a grid is still required to develop robust regional pedotransfer functions leastways by the compilation of soil organic carbon and bulk density for deeper soil layers wösten et al 2001 or by fitting pedotransfer functions based on a priori determination and sampling of most sensitive study area parameters van alphen et al 2001 overall a lack of sampling of soil physical parameters including soil structure and porosity is a major gap to include in long term soil monitoring especially since temporal changes of soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and soil organic carbon moberg 2001 occur the spatial description of subsurface flow was improved by delineating fields with tile drainage plans from the economic map swedish land survey n d the new map together with the soil hydrological dataset can be of direct use for comparing drained and undrained fields and improve the water partitioning description the drained arable land indicated a higher share of drainage on soils with higher clay content fig 5 and a larger area of slow to moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity figure s2 supplemental material this is expected as we would anticipate a prioritization of fields with lower hydraulic conductivity as these fields are more susceptible to standing water however table 4 indicates that drainage mainly occur in fields with moderate to rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity classes this reflects that a major part of arable land is already drained covering both less self draining soils as well as soils with higher infiltration capacity the adjusted datasets under sections 2 3 2 and 2 3 4 improved the spatial delineation of the water flow pathway fig 6 table 4 and table 5 however the effectiveness of tile drains remains unaccounted for for example nationally 12 0 of all tile drainage in cropland was in need of maintenance in 2016 additionally 12 1 were considered to require the implementation of new drainage systems scb and swedish board of agriculture 2018 the rate of required maintenance of tile drained fields exempting the requirement for implementing new drainage has been estimated at 1 2 annually in order to meet drainage requirements reiter and bölenius 2020 thus drainage capacity might be overestimated as caused by estimations of the efficiency and effects of the national tile drainage network or underestimated due to the expansion of newly drained fields comparing the ditch maps by lidberg et al 2021 di with the manually delineated ditch maps produced by the county administrative board of västra götaland 2021 showed a change of ditches likely representing a shift from surface drainage to subsurface drainage in later times jacks 2019 there is a shortcoming in depicting the connectivity between ditches in the new main drainage map consisting of open ditches lidberg et al 2021 this can possibly be explained by challenges in depicting subsurface pathways as culverts or poorly maintained ditches exposed to e g the erosion of ditch banks the processing of data herein was done manually we see a great potential for automation to shorten the processing time for example by linking the processing steps and unify the in data tables to a common format for use in common software handling spatial data this is possible for all three datasets the use of e g ai for constructing a model for point to pixel fitting of the soil data to extend outside the dataset herein is an appealing idea however such development would require larger independent dataset of soil physical properties for training and validating the model this is a major limitation as discussed in above sections for the ditch and stream network however similar to the ai model used by lidberg et al 2021 training a model for identifying false streams from the topographic stream network ågren and lidberg 2020 is a possibility for further exploration automating the processing would additionally enhance the possibility to upscale the method to national level this would be possible for both the soil datasets and the stream and ditch network although the linking of soil physical properties data would reduce in spatial variation for northern sweden due to the absence of coverage from the digital soil map piikki and söderström 2019 in these areas the methodology is simple and the possibility to extend outside sweden is mainly linked to textural and soil physical properties data available in other countries extracting the tile drainage system based on the adjusted economic map is limited to västra götaland county as we could not find similar dataset for other counties however the method of classification of line structures based on colour recognition is a simple and effective method for extracting linear features representing tile drains from maps of similar appearance from other regions the extraction of waterbodies from satellite images or ortophotos is a concept used globally and the efficiency mainly dependent on image quality e g reduced by cloud cover and pixel resolution 4 2 implications of higher resolution spatial soil physical and hydrological functions datasets the requirements of high spatio temporal resolution depends on the research objective baffaut et al 2015 nevertheless the increased availability of high resolution spatio temporal data improves possibilities to study more complex questions when using models for example the inclusion of known subsurface flows in the soil and water assessment tool swat has been shown to improve water balance strömqvist et al 2020 rumph frederiksen and molina navarro 2021 valayamkunnath et al 2022 higher resolution in indata and parameters can furthermore reduce uncertainty for parameters known to be sensitive to model algorithms see e g romanowicz et al 2005 veith et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 koo et al 2020 escamilla rivera et al 2022 additional details in temporal variation enables an improved description of short term events e g seasonal or sub daily effects although the impact of input data that is dependent on resolution i e the aggregation of land units in e g hydrological response units s c hrus and hydrological processes in models with a larger scale might masks differences in the high spatial resolution of indata e g li et al 2012 the same might not be valid for temporal effects e g where hydrological response variation in a catchment is dependent on the spatial intra catchment heterogeneity of both climate and land soil properties e g jothityangkoon and sivapalan 2001 the changed distribution of weather extremes caused by climate change speed up hydrological process in field to landscape scales fischer and knutti 2014 trends in the current climate indicate more extreme rainfall events e g grusson et al 2021 and the synergetic effects of multiple weather events so called compound events call for improved knowledge of landscape responses to various events and their interactions at local scale zscheischler et al 2018 the change of pulse events will require new approaches in data collection and hydrological modelling moreover complementary studies at various scales are needed to understand the impacts and e g design of mitigation measures e g garg et al 2022 furthermore although data might be available at high spatial resolution the temporal scale of input parameters for modelling short term events might be too coarse to match the means an issue to discuss e g when linking landscape hydrology with short term weather events the datasets presented herein mainly relate to surface waters nevertheless considering retention to groundwater storages is equally important with respect to both storage and flow pathways in natural and manmade anthropogenic water infrastructure a limit from surface to subsurface flows from the dataset herein concerns the age of the economic map and the tile drainage plans it refers to as well as the limited access to tile drainage plans for other areas further work is needed to highlight delineated subsurface flows and water outtake return flows for anthropogenic use in agriculture industry households and other sectors for example the inclusion of irrigation outtake and re routing in the catchment water balance can be important in achieving a better hydrological representation of anthropogenic landscapes strömqvist et al 2020 some of these data are accessible through the national statistical unit scb yet limited due to secrecy strömqvist et al 2020 additionally a model representation of connectivity between groundwater surface waters in hydrological models is needed to accurately quantify hydrological pathways berghuijs et al 2022 it has already been established that the dynamic representation of especially sub soil hydrological flows for swedish conditions is missing barthel et al 2021 4 3 policy implications our new and improved datasets indicate the spatial complexity of both natural and manmade water infrastructure at catchment scale this is critical information for accurate water balance under current and future water balance studies as climate change accelerates events and periods of both excess and scarcity of water increase in incidence and duration knowing the combined strengths of water infrastructure for partitioning flows and storage will be critical at both local e g field and farm and catchment scale the improved datasets can be used in the evaluation of landscape sensitivity to drought and flood events accounting for spatial heterogeneity an accurate depiction of waterbodies and soil properties improves estimations of landscape water storage together with the improved ditch stream network dataset it might also improve knowledge on the connectivity of water storages and upstream downstream effects of the surplus deficiency of water throughout catchments the datasets are a basis to inform and evaluate the synergetic effects of local adaptation measures at catchment scale the analysis and data collection in this paper clarify that additional effort would be of value to tile drainage data linked to field levels in order to incorporate accurate field bound drainage capacity at a catchment scale as well as coupling with effects on the subsurface level despite increased possibilities for data collection by e g reduced costs and improved automation for the in situ collection of spatio temporal data there are paradoxical signs that data availability as open source becomes more limited and less monitored harris et al 2020 thorslund and van vliet 2020 smhi 2022a b hence paradoxically the number of suggestions method developments of incorporating effects of soil structure dynamics in soil crop systems caused by biological activity e g at the plot and centennial decennial scale e g meurer et al 2020 and in intra annual fluctuations in soil porosity e g chandrasekhar et al 2018 and vegetation e g thompson et al 2011 increase the demand for soil data sampling intervals both spatially and temporarily according to some the increase of openly available rs data the development of various innovative ways of processing and data mining of various landscape parameters reduces direct dependency on in situ sampling e g cui et al 2021 duethmann et al 2022 fuentes et al 2022 xue et al 2022 yan et al 2022 however in this work we show the more remote data products that are available the more it paradoxically enhances the importance of having accurate in situ datasets for thorough independent validation e g cosh et al 2004 weerasinghe et al 2020 gelebo et al 2022 thus a thorough campaign of support from national and regional funders as well as land owners and local populations that enables in situ sampling for verification is still on the agenda this should possibly be synced or incorporated in any research programme for improving remote access data on landscape parameters to match the means 5 conclusions in this study we have developed the information of soil physical characteristics natural and manmade water flow as well as storage at catchment scale to improve water balance partitioning and the description of landscape catchment hydrology we show that with available soil texture data improved with point measured soil physical properties key landscape hydrological functions such as soil water holding capacity and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity change significantly further the explicit addition of tile drainage and merged natural and manmade ditch networks increases flow pathways significantly finally the catchment water storage was comparatively well understood in available existing data to secure water under climate change water allocation will increase in importance for many water users at catchment scale including safeguarding environmental flows alongside human supplies and agricultural needs the use of more complex models and the improved model performance of hydrological processes need to better capture both natural parts and the impact of anthropogenic structures and processes concerning the hydrological cycle at landscape scale linked to both surface and subsurface unsaturated soil water flows improved soil physical properties and merged water flow paths and storage distributed accurately will be as equally important as climate input for these water balances estimates this calls for the long term increased maintained data collection of essential landscape hydrological climate parameters with the evaluation of sampling size and interval spatial and temporal for at a minimum calibration validation purposes in addition transparency of access for available data linked to water outtake recharge storage is needed to be able to evaluate and follow up any landscape measures affecting landscape hydrological storage capacity credit authorship contribution

8940,discrepancies in time space representation of indata and calibration validation data obstructs analysis of hydrological processes thatlink natural and anthropogenic water infrastructure in catchments and landscapes to improve indata for hydrological and modelling of the soil plant atmosphere continuum this paper presents a high resolution dataset of hydrological functions in the agricultural landscape of tidan sw sweden we firstly address spatial representation of soil physical parameters describing soil water flows and storage secondly we derive tile drainage datasets from historical maps lastly we explore delineation and spatial location of streams ditches and waterbodies to improve description of water connectivity the new soil datasets with top and subsoil descriptions varied in depicting the sensitivity of saturated hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity the most representative soil map showed moderate 34 to very rapid 21 saturated hydraulic conductivity water holding capacity below 40 mm 10 cm 1 94 and a dry bulk density ranging between 1 2 and 1 8 g cm 3 71 the digitalization of drained fields suggests that 69 of the arable fields are under tile drainage dominated by sandy loam loam and clay loam the combined stream network resulted in 5350 km of streams and ditches 14 km and 129 respectively compared to available best resolution

from swedish arable landscapes soil parameters have often been generalized to so called type soils with soil physical properties derived as generic parameters or from pedotransfer functions salazar et

the lack of detail concerning soil physical properties in these studies is either due to model configuration where defined soil physical parameters are not required or to the fact that the level of detail seems insignificant for the purpose of the specific study another data gap is the lack of accurate delineation of manmade and natural streams information on stream pathways is somewhat accessible but limited to local applicability streams and ditches visible above ground are available as high resolution datasets both potential locations of natural streams ågren and lidberg 2020 and manmade ditches lidberg et al 2021 identify a much denser stream from topographic maps and natural pathways for stream formation ai and image recognition than those depicted in previously available maps however these maps do not capture subsurface tile drains and subsurface connections e g culverts which are important flow pathways especially in agricultural and urban catchments the best available large scale data on tile drainage plans is a modified version of the cadastral map sv ekonomiska kartan produced from orthophotographs between years 1935 1978 although the maps are available as scanned and georectified they are not readily available for use in gis software and do not show the true outline of tile drainage pipes rather they show fields with available tile drainage plans neither do they include recent landscape changes such as merged fields and shifts in spatial range over time or more recent installations of tile drains and related plans anthropogenic landscape changes to land use hydromorphology and water storage withdrawal and recharge show alteration to evapotranspiration runoff and soil water storage compared to unaffected landscapes nevertheless the direction of change is governed by area specific properties both internationally and nationally e g malmquist 2021a kåresdotter et al 2022 hydromorphological changes manmadeor natural also has the potential to delay or reinforce flow patterns and alter their characteristics from perennial streams to more resemble ephermal streams with possible further implications for e g flora and fauna along streams or in waterbodies datry et al 2023 thus a mismatch in the available spatial representation of key hydrological features especially in landscapes with complex interactions of anthropogenic and natural waterways and storage obstructs a thorough exploration of especially subsurface processes in catchment modelling this is an issue as evidence of synergies between engineered and nature based solutions to sustain effects of climate change on hydrological pathways is lacking miralles wilhelm et al 2023 thus this paper explores the availability of high resolution spatial data for developing the descriptions of hydrological functions in agricultural landscapes the paper seeks to answer can high resolution data improve knowledge on anthropogenic modified hydrological functions we illustrate this with three examples of spatial data adaptation to fit a catchment scale hydrological model here soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 for a swedish agricultural catchment sw sweden our case study firstly addresses how to link point data of soil physical properties to spatially distributed information on soil texture in order to improve the representation of hydrological functions of soil water storage and water flows such as infiltration secondly we develop spatial data for soils and their functions for water flows and storage under different degrees of anthropogenic modifications that is i e natural and highly modified subsurface tile drained soils finally the delineation of streams ditches and water bodies and effects of spatial location are explored we discuss the implications on landscape hydrological functions for hydrological modelling 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area tidan catchment 696 km2 is located in västra götaland county sw

zones jones et al 2010 the landscape is heterogenous consisting of 24 169 km2 agricultural land 21 147 km2 forest and 4 29 km2 urban land malmquist 2021b fig 1 tidan catchment represents a typical swedish arable landscape with modified hydrological features and substantial surface and subsurface drainage occurring over more than 150 years lindelöf 2021 the area has historically been subjected to recurrent flooding due to high precipitation around the catchment mainly occurring along stream tidan adjacent to river ösan holmbom and söderström 2012 wessberg 2019 dry spells droughts have historically been a less recurrent issue holmbom and söderström 2012 wessberg 2019 2 2 data sources the three datasets were developed from spatial raster and polygon data collected from open access databases provided by the swedish land survey lantmäteriet geological survey of sweden sgu swedish board of agriculture sjv swedish water authorities vattenmyndigheterna county administrative board of västra götaland and additional peer reviewed publications quantified parameter values as point and tabulated data sets for soil texture and soil physical parameters were accessed from the slu soil database agricultural soils and coupmodel soil database forest soils while data from additional peer reviewed publications were analysed and used to develop all three datasets table 1 and table 2 2 3

hereinafter sld were firstly classified to soil textural classes after the swedish soil groups in the soil map soil classes 1 25 000 1 100 000 geological survey of sweden 2014 hereinafter sc as geological and agricultural soil particle classification systems use different grain size divisions supplemental material fig s2 the soil profiles were additionally classified based on fao textural classes to fit soil classification layers of topsoil from the digital soil map piikki and söderström 2019 dsm the soil physical profile point data and soil textural layers from dsm respectively were associated with glacial postglacial origin in sc and subdivided by their geological origin and soil textural class two soil maps with soil physical properties were created one was based on fao textural classification fao map by associating the soil profiles of unique geological and textural classes from sld to the closest individual soil pixel in dsm of same geological origin and fao textural class the second map was based on swedish soil classes sv map and the nearest pixel from the subsoil layers of sc some soil classes in sld at topsoil 0 10 cm and subsoil 40 60 cm were not available from all the various soil texture classes present in dsm and sc of tidan catchment to fill this gap in sld they were fitted to the closest soil class with the closest similar textural composition available in dsm and sc 2 3 1 2 organic soils physical parameters for organic soils are limited in the source material table 1 thus physical parameters were assigned based on their organic type e g gyttja soil bog peat or fen peat and proximity to the study area based on soil profiles from berglund et al 1989 and berglund 2011 2 3 1 3 forest soils soil texture for forest soils is available as spatially located polygons and point data while soil physical data are lacking department of forest resource management and department of soil and environment 2022 for our dataset we used a compilation of 24 forest soil profiles on glacial till karltun 1995 henceforth ktd containing the bulk density and volume weight of particle size fractions for three east to west directed transects in southern central and northern sweden for the new soil dataset we combined soil profiles from forest land use from the coup model jansson and karlberg 2004 henceforth cmd with profiles from ktd based on the closest value of soil carbon in topsoil 5 15 cm and subsoil 40 60 cm the matching profiles saturated hydraulic conductivity was assigned based on topsoil organic carbon content bulk density values were then matched individually per each soil layer from the assigned profiles to achieve a realistic variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth soil organic carbon has been shown to vary with topography and hydrologic class e g callesen et al 2003 olsson et al 2009 thus the profiles were associated to spatially distributed hydrological classes stating three qualitative classes of presence absence of moving soil water the position was based on the slope position department of forest resource management and department of soil and environment 2022 of spatially verified soil profiles from the swedish national forest inventory swedish university of agricultural sciences 2022a the linked soil profiles were spatially joined to subsoil layers from sc for land not classified as arable land based on soil texture class 40 50 cm from ktd and the swedish university of agricultural sciences 2022a to determine the association with the geological formation and sorting of material i e till or no till 2 3 1 4 gravel boulder ridges and bedrock soil physical parameters for profiles dominated by coarser particle size are scarce as most soil physical property analyses are done on cylinder cores with a finer soil particle fraction i e particles 2 mm e g stendahl et al 2009 however the density of minerals in the swedish bedrock is relatively homogenous e g knutsson and morfeldt 1973 carlsson and carlstedt 1977 wikner et al 1991 vägverket and räddningsverket 1998 larsson 2008 wallman et al 2018 hence values on bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity for gravel and bedrock were estimated as median values from data by carlsson and carlstedt 1977 wikner et al 1991 vägverket and räddningsverket 1998 mulqueen 2005 zhang et al 2011 ferdos et al 2015 wallman et al 2018 and li et al 2021 values on plant available water in the root zone for gravel and boulder soils were based on generic profiles from cmd and compared with profiles of gravel and bedrock from the american soil database ssurgo soil survey staff 2021 2 3 1 5 soil depth the two soil maps were merged with available soil depths from the soil depth model 2020 geological survey of sweden 2020 as a majority of the soil profiles in ktd and sld were sampled to a depth of 1 m the physical properties below 1 m are unknown to join the soil depth map to the soil physical layers the depths of the soil profile layer sampled at 0 9 0 1 m from sld were adjusted to the depth from the soil depth model 2020 geological survey of sweden 2020 if 1 m in case of soil depths 1 m the respective soil layers below were erased from the final spatial dataset the schematics of how we linked soil physical parameters to soil textural data is presented in fig 2 2 3 2 delineating tile drained field a specific purpose of this study was to develop indata combining natural and manmade waterbodies at catchment scale approximately 64 300087 ha of agricultural land is tile drained in västra götaland region scb and swedish board of agriculture 2018 yet with a high likelihood of additional forested areas being drained to develop a map of tile drainage in tidan catchment we used information on tile drained fields from the historic swedish economic map for the years 1935 1978 swedish land survey copies of the swedish economic map years 1935 1978 include fields marked with available individual tile drainage plans compared to the original economic map that only showed field borders henceforth the original map is stated as m1 and the map with marked tile drainage plans m2 the colour setting of land uses and objects in the maps enables the classification of borders between land use classes and individual fields which further enables extraction of fields that are have been under tile drainage the scanned tile drained fields in m2 were laid over and geo rectified to m1 the two map versions were classified after colour settings by iso cluster unsupervised classification esri n d a the number of classes were set to n 10 esri n d b and classes representing field boundaries and line objects were extracted to separate layers based on their land use class attribution from the unsupervised iso classification thereafter they were transformed from raster to polyline files the boundaries around agricultural fields from m1 were erased from m2 this resulted in maps with only diagonal lines representing fields with available tile drainage plans due to some misalignment during the rectification of the dataset a buffer distance of 15 m from the border lines was included when erasing the borders this to ensure that their full extent was erased 2 3 3 delineation and extent of stream and ditch network a comparison of the two recent datasets over stream networks ågren and lidberg 2020 str and ditches lidberg et al 2021 di indicated misalignment for tidan catchment the topographic stream network particularly depicted water courses in arable land not present in orthopohotographs swedish land survey 2018 resolution 0 25 m thus the two datasets were processed to link and erase false streams for the best possible depiction of the catchment stream network in addition ditches from manually digitized maps depicting drainage ditches from the national county administrative boards verified from the mid 19th century were included available at https ext geodatakatalog lansstyrelsen se geodatakatalogen for tidan catchment the drainage network is dated from 1885 to 1971 some of this dataset was not included in the more recent ditch network in di the three datasets were combined to achieve a connected stream network consisting of both natural streams and man made ditches the streams in str were overlaid and snapped to di with a buffer distance of 30 m based on visual judgement stream network segments that shared a line with the ditch network were selected as true connectivity and overlapping line segments of the topographic stream network were erased the stream segments in str overlapping agricultural fields were erased since natural streams are eliminated by the presence of sub or surface drainage systems section 2 3 2 lastly the segmented topographic stream network and the ditch map were merged into a joint layer depicting the final stream network some of the main streams were not included in the above detailed stream network maps hence polylines for the main river in the catchment ösan and streams delineated for the specific catchment by lindelöf 2021 were snapped to the combined stream ditch network 60 m buffer based on visual judgement reduced by overlapping line segments and merged to the detailed stream network dataset the final layer was then manually adjusted by connecting line segments to gaps along river ösan 2 3 4 water storage in natural and manmade lakes reservoirs and wetlands the locations of constructed wetlands are not always depicted correctly or are fully missing within national databases e g ter borg and barron 2021 thus locations of constructed and natural wetlands within tidan catchment were verified with sentinel 2 images three maps with different colour band combinations were created to capture presence of waterbodies i e the modified normalized difference water index xu 2006 with swir2 data the color infrared vegetation map band nir red and green and land water images bands nir swir1 and red moreover the classified waterbodies were manually controlled and labelled as true or false waterbodies classified as true were compared with national registers from the wetland database constructed wetlands wetland inventory and agricultural areas from the agricultural block database table 2 the classification of waterbodies are arbitrary as definitions for the three classes of waterbodies intersect e g langbein and iseri 1960 world meteorological organization 2012 tiner 2017 however the three classes here were limited by waterbodies classified as reservoirs if they intersected with the newly delineated stream network ponds were classified as open waterbodies if not intersecting with a stream network and wetlands if they contained visible vegetation 2 3 5 mathematical processing of datasets the new soil texture maps sv map and fao map the combined stream and ditch network di and delineated waterbodies were compared spatially with respective original datasets table 1 table 2 all spatial analysis of data were done in arcmap 10 8 1 esri n d c while comparison of stretch areal and volume between new and original datasets were analysed in excel2016 2016 microsoft cooperation the fit of soil physical profiles to soil textural maps were compared with point textural data from soil and crop inventory sci swedish land survey 2019 swedish university of agricultural sciences 2021a and national soil inventory nsi paulsson et al 2015 by fitting a simple linear regression between the datasets with soil texture as single explaining variable data not shown soil physical data saturated hydraulic conductivity water holding capacity and bulk density were extracted per soil texture class soil layer top or subsoil and per undrained and drained areal respectively field area per class was calculated in the attribute table of the layer or respective soil physical property by calculate geometry the absolute area was summarized per class and estimated as share per soil texture and drainage class drained vs undrained fields by dividing the share per soil texture class with total catchment area the soil texture and soil physical properties per drainage class were divided per total area agricultural land the length of di and str and the new combined dataset was estimated by calculating geometry in the attribute tables the variation in length between the datasets was calculated as the difference between the new dataset and di respective str the estimated area and volume of the waterbodies were summarized per class of waterbody i e pond reservoir or wetland the area and volume of unique lakes not present in available datasets were extracted from the new combined datasets and summarized separately 3 results 3 1 assigning soil physical parameters for best fit to soil texture classes the final soil dataset included n 45 individual soil profiles in the fao map and n 35 in the sv map this is somewhat counter intuitive as the swedish soil classification system includes more soil texture classes than the fao system table s1 as swedish soil classes are lumped if classified by the fao classification system a higher number of soil profiles is assigned per fao soil class compared to the swedish system thus increasing the overall number fitted per soil pixel to the nearest fit hence there is an increased number of final included profiles in the fao map fig 3 the two datasets further differed in their lumping of the fao soil classes with a more diverse distribution of fine medium particle classes for the map based on fao classes table 3 the two soil datasets were further used to calculate the spatial distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivity table 4 fig 4a water holding capacity table 4 fig 4b and bulk density table 4 the spatial distribution of soil physical characteristics differs depending on the input soil texture data using swedish or fao texture classification the soil physical datasets based on the sv map have the largest area of moderately slow 44 and very rapid 29 saturated hydraulic conductivity whereas the water holding capacity is mainly in the interval of 20 40 mm 10 cm 1 82 the bulk density is mainly in the interval of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 44 and 1 6 1 8 g cm 3 17 in the subsoil the saturated hydraulic conductivity is lower than in the topsoil with the largest in the slow 17 and moderate 48 categories the water holding capacity in the subsoil is distributed between 0 and 20 mm 10 cm 3 44 and 20 40 mm 10 cm 3 41 while the distribution of bulk density is mainly in the interval 1 2 1 8 g cm 3 48 in the interval of 1 4 1 6 g cm 3 for the input from the fao map the largest area in the catchment has a moderate 34 to very rapid 21 saturated hydraulic conductivity and the water holding capacity is below 40 mm 10 cm 1 soil 94 in the topsoil these values are reflected in the soil classes of sand sandy loam silt loam and loam which constitute the larger areas in the catchment bulk density is between 0 8 and 1 6 g cm 3 in the topsoil and increases in the subsoil to the interval 1 4 1 8 g cm 3 table 4 comparing the two soil datasets two things stand out the fao map dataset results in larger area of rapidly saturated hydraulic conductivity which might impact infiltration at precipitation events however the water holding capacity is lower over a larger area compared to the sv map this increase the risk of drought impact the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity areas are distributed spatially in the centre of the catchment along stream and ditch network and water bodies to a greater extent than the swedish derived data fig 4a due to a lack of stand alone datasets of soil texture and soil physical properties the datasets have not been independently validated 3 2 identification and delineation of tile drained fields on landscape scale the extraction of fields with tile drainage plans from the economic map swedish land survey n d in tidan suggests that 69 205 km2 of the arable fields within tidan catchment have tile drainage plans available this is in line with the official statistics of drainage in västra götaland from 2016 where 64 of the agricultural land was under tile drainage scb and swedish board of agriculture 2018 combining the delineated tile drainage field with the soil texture map classification section 2 3 1 shows that mainly sandy loam loam and clay loam were drained table 4 the final map of fields with tile drainage plans showed higher clay content median 17 13 sd compared to undrained fields median 14 10 sd and lower sand and silt content fig 5 3 3 alignment of natural and manmade stream network the combined stream and ditch network resulted in 5350 km of streams and ditches within tidan catchment showing a landscape of more water flow infrastructure than previously identified for the catchment this is an increase of 649 km compared to str and an increase of 2927 km compared to di table 5 of the topographic stream network 2690 km lie on agriculturally managed fields with 2470 km not intersecting with the ditch network thus the topographic stream network identified on agricultural land was assumed to be falsely delineated as field management ditch networks and tile drainage systems that reallocated streams that would otherwise have occurred naturally due to topography approximately 269 km of the total length of the ditch network 774 km from the county administrative board of västra götaland 2021 intersects with tile drained fields identified under section 2 3 2 and these are not depicted in di a buffer of 5 m was used around the ditches from lidberg et al 2021 to extract non intersecting ditches from the county administrative board of västra götaland 2021 thus some segments are missing in the total length estimate there is a difference with a median of 35 m 0 72 m between the ai delineated ditches and closest vertices of the topographically delineated stream network despite using the same topographic maps as base maps ditches in topographic maps should be visible if the resolution with an average width in the ditch map is higher than 2 m 1 3 m lidberg et al 2021 thus it can also be expected to initiate stream delineation from topographic maps at the same location as the ditches when using topographically governed stream delineation tools in gis software where flow direction and accumulation is identified by the lowest topographic cell neighbours schäuble et al 2008 lópez vicente et al 2014 fig 6 3 4 land cover corrected for natural and constructed water storage in total n 6 additional water bodies were identified from satellite images copernicus sentinel data 2020a b and orthophotos swedish land survey 2018 comprising a total surface area of 4 3 10 3 km2 and an estimated volume of 6 4 103 m3 table 6 compared to readily available databases smhi 2020 2021 smhi n d swedish board of agriculture 2020 swedish environmental protection agency 2021 vattenmyndigheterna länsstyrelserna havs och vattenmyndigheterna n d this is a small addition compared to the total area and volume of delineated water bodies from previously known datasets surface area 1 82 km2 volume 2 68 10 3 km3 combined table 6 although the added area volume the waterbodies is small they can still possibly impact water balance if they are located in hydrologically important spaces 4 discussion 4 1 opportunities and limitations in the three new datasets the new datasets increased spatial resolution via a weighting approach for point to pixel derived from measured soil physical properties governing soil hydrological properties rather than pedotransfer functions using point measured soil texture as input the dataset also accounts for multiple soil layers not fully depicted in existing national datasets see references table 1 an issue also noted in commonly used global soil datasets e g batjes 2009 iasa et al 2012 origiazzi et al 2018 the resolution in the new soil dataset remained 50 50 m after the base map dsm piikki and söderström 2019 this is however the best available resolution dataset for sweden compared to the map sc by the geological survey of sweden 2014 and e g european panagos 2006 kristeensen et al 2019 or global datasets iasa et al 2012 global soil data task 2014 which are based on interpolated values or derived from correlated parameters the increased number of soil profiles per soil textural group for the dataset based on fao soil classification fao map compared to the swedish classification sv map expanded the spatial variation of soil physical properties within the catchment and their respective soil physical properties the dataset based on fao classification resulted in an addition of n 35 n 25 with swedish classification soil profiles compared to e g the set of generic soil profiles n 10 used in calculations of nutrient leakages and environmental impact from soils to waterbodies on both a multi catchment and national scale johnsson et al 2019 thus the method presented herein is one alternative for increasing the spatial representation of soil physical properties not only in tidan catchment but also as extended to other catchments to enhance the representation of soil heterogeneity as no stand alone dataset was available for the validation of either soil texture or soil physical properties the new soil physical dataset should be used with caution a common issue is the backtracking of swedish spatial soil physical datasets to the sampling in soil and crop inventory and national soil inventory paulsson et al 2015 swedish land survey 2019 swedish university of agricultural sciences 2021b resulting in the absence of independent datasets to our knowledge only three additional compiled datasets geological survey of sweden 2018 jansson and karlberg 2004 raulund rasmussen and callesen 1999 of quantified soil texture composition for land uses other than agricultural ones are available for swedish soils two of these datasets were used for the delineation of our new soil datasets the dataset from raulund rasmussen and callesen 1999 was not accessible at the time of our study furthermore soil physical subsoil texture data and quantitative compilation on soil composition and soil physical parameters in forest and urban landscapes is lacking in quantification and resolution department of forest resource management and department of soil and environment 2022 swedish textural point data has previously been shown to be too scattered for traditional interpolation methods in predicting soil texture for soil textural maps in swedish landscapes djodjic et al 2009 also shown for the european dataset in lucas cordeiro et al 2018 additionally piikki and söderström 2019 point to the increased errors of datasets with local compared to national scales due to the availability of fewer calibration validation samples however the development of pedotransfer functions adapted for swedish soils have shown good fit regarding water content and porosity with the inclusion of soil organic carbon at a higher water content and bulk density linked to soil textural class e g kätterer et al 2006 furthermore topsoil and subsoil textures have been shown to be overall correlated in swedish soil profiles at least in currently available soil samples sohlenius and eriksson 2009 however to include subsoil characteristics in finer soil sampling a grid is still required to develop robust regional pedotransfer functions leastways by the compilation of soil organic carbon and bulk density for deeper soil layers wösten et al 2001 or by fitting pedotransfer functions based on a priori determination and sampling of most sensitive study area parameters van alphen et al 2001 overall a lack of sampling of soil physical parameters including soil structure and porosity is a major gap to include in long term soil monitoring especially since temporal changes of soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and soil organic carbon moberg 2001 occur the spatial description of subsurface flow was improved by delineating fields with tile drainage plans from the economic map swedish land survey n d the new map together with the soil hydrological dataset can be of direct use for comparing drained and undrained fields and improve the water partitioning description the drained arable land indicated a higher share of drainage on soils with higher clay content fig 5 and a larger area of slow to moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity figure s2 supplemental material this is expected as we would anticipate a prioritization of fields with lower hydraulic conductivity as these fields are more susceptible to standing water however table 4 indicates that drainage mainly occur in fields with moderate to rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity classes this reflects that a major part of arable land is already drained covering both less self draining soils as well as soils with higher infiltration capacity the adjusted datasets under sections 2 3 2 and 2 3 4 improved the spatial delineation of the water flow pathway fig 6 table 4 and table 5 however the effectiveness of tile drains remains unaccounted for for example nationally 12 0 of all tile drainage in cropland was in need of maintenance in 2016 additionally 12 1 were considered to require the implementation of new drainage systems scb and swedish board of agriculture 2018 the rate of required maintenance of tile drained fields exempting the requirement for implementing new drainage has been estimated at 1 2 annually in order to meet drainage requirements reiter and bölenius 2020 thus drainage capacity might be overestimated as caused by estimations of the efficiency and effects of the national tile drainage network or underestimated due to the expansion of newly drained fields comparing the ditch maps by lidberg et al 2021 di with the manually delineated ditch maps produced by the county administrative board of västra götaland 2021 showed a change of ditches likely representing a shift from surface drainage to subsurface drainage in later times jacks 2019 there is a shortcoming in depicting the connectivity between ditches in the new main drainage map consisting of open ditches lidberg et al 2021 this can possibly be explained by challenges in depicting subsurface pathways as culverts or poorly maintained ditches exposed to e g the erosion of ditch banks the processing of data herein was done manually we see a great potential for automation to shorten the processing time for example by linking the processing steps and unify the in data tables to a common format for use in common software handling spatial data this is possible for all three datasets the use of e g ai for constructing a model for point to pixel fitting of the soil data to extend outside the dataset herein is an appealing idea however such development would require larger independent dataset of soil physical properties for training and validating the model this is a major limitation as discussed in above sections for the ditch and stream network however similar to the ai model used by lidberg et al 2021 training a model for identifying false streams from the topographic stream network ågren and lidberg 2020 is a possibility for further exploration automating the processing would additionally enhance the possibility to upscale the method to national level this would be possible for both the soil datasets and the stream and ditch network although the linking of soil physical properties data would reduce in spatial variation for northern sweden due to the absence of coverage from the digital soil map piikki and söderström 2019 in these areas the methodology is simple and the possibility to extend outside sweden is mainly linked to textural and soil physical properties data available in other countries extracting the tile drainage system based on the adjusted economic map is limited to västra götaland county as we could not find similar dataset for other counties however the method of classification of line structures based on colour recognition is a simple and effective method for extracting linear features representing tile drains from maps of similar appearance from other regions the extraction of waterbodies from satellite images or ortophotos is a concept used globally and the efficiency mainly dependent on image quality e g reduced by cloud cover and pixel resolution 4 2 implications of higher resolution spatial soil physical and hydrological functions datasets the requirements of high spatio temporal resolution depends on the research objective baffaut et al 2015 nevertheless the increased availability of high resolution spatio temporal data improves possibilities to study more complex questions when using models for example the inclusion of known subsurface flows in the soil and water assessment tool swat has been shown to improve water balance strömqvist et al 2020 rumph frederiksen and molina navarro 2021 valayamkunnath et al 2022 higher resolution in indata and parameters can furthermore reduce uncertainty for parameters known to be sensitive to model algorithms see e g romanowicz et al 2005 veith et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 koo et al 2020 escamilla rivera et al 2022 additional details in temporal variation enables an improved description of short term events e g seasonal or sub daily effects although the impact of input data that is dependent on resolution i e the aggregation of land units in e g hydrological response units s c hrus and hydrological processes in models with a larger scale might masks differences in the high spatial resolution of indata e g li et al 2012 the same might not be valid for temporal effects e g where hydrological response variation in a catchment is dependent on the spatial intra catchment heterogeneity of both climate and land soil properties e g jothityangkoon and sivapalan 2001 the changed distribution of weather extremes caused by climate change speed up hydrological process in field to landscape scales fischer and knutti 2014 trends in the current climate indicate more extreme rainfall events e g grusson et al 2021 and the synergetic effects of multiple weather events so called compound events call for improved knowledge of landscape responses to various events and their interactions at local scale zscheischler et al 2018 the change of pulse events will require new approaches in data collection and hydrological modelling moreover complementary studies at various scales are needed to understand the impacts and e g design of mitigation measures e g garg et al 2022 furthermore although data might be available at high spatial resolution the temporal scale of input parameters for modelling short term events might be too coarse to match the means an issue to discuss e g when linking landscape hydrology with short term weather events the datasets presented herein mainly relate to surface waters nevertheless considering retention to groundwater storages is equally important with respect to both storage and flow pathways in natural and manmade anthropogenic water infrastructure a limit from surface to subsurface flows from the dataset herein concerns the age of the economic map and the tile drainage plans it refers to as well as the limited access to tile drainage plans for other areas further work is needed to highlight delineated subsurface flows and water outtake return flows for anthropogenic use in agriculture industry households and other sectors for example the inclusion of irrigation outtake and re routing in the catchment water balance can be important in achieving a better hydrological representation of anthropogenic landscapes strömqvist et al 2020 some of these data are accessible through the national statistical unit scb yet limited due to secrecy strömqvist et al 2020 additionally a model representation of connectivity between groundwater surface waters in hydrological models is needed to accurately quantify hydrological pathways berghuijs et al 2022 it has already been established that the dynamic representation of especially sub soil hydrological flows for swedish conditions is missing barthel et al 2021 4 3 policy implications our new and improved datasets indicate the spatial complexity of both natural and manmade water infrastructure at catchment scale this is critical information for accurate water balance under current and future water balance studies as climate change accelerates events and periods of both excess and scarcity of water increase in incidence and duration knowing the combined strengths of water infrastructure for partitioning flows and storage will be critical at both local e g field and farm and catchment scale the improved datasets can be used in the evaluation of landscape sensitivity to drought and flood events accounting for spatial heterogeneity an accurate depiction of waterbodies and soil properties improves estimations of landscape water storage together with the improved ditch stream network dataset it might also improve knowledge on the connectivity of water storages and upstream downstream effects of the surplus deficiency of water throughout catchments the datasets are a basis to inform and evaluate the synergetic effects of local adaptation measures at catchment scale the analysis and data collection in this paper clarify that additional effort would be of value to tile drainage data linked to field levels in order to incorporate accurate field bound drainage capacity at a catchment scale as well as coupling with effects on the subsurface level despite increased possibilities for data collection by e g reduced costs and improved automation for the in situ collection of spatio temporal data there are paradoxical signs that data availability as open source becomes more limited and less monitored harris et al 2020 thorslund and van vliet 2020 smhi 2022a b hence paradoxically the number of suggestions method developments of incorporating effects of soil structure dynamics in soil crop systems caused by biological activity e g at the plot and centennial decennial scale e g meurer et al 2020 and in intra annual fluctuations in soil porosity e g chandrasekhar et al 2018 and vegetation e g thompson et al 2011 increase the demand for soil data sampling intervals both spatially and temporarily according to some the increase of openly available rs data the development of various innovative ways of processing and data mining of various landscape parameters reduces direct dependency on in situ sampling e g cui et al 2021 duethmann et al 2022 fuentes et al 2022 xue et al 2022 yan et al 2022 however in this work we show the more remote data products that are available the more it paradoxically enhances the importance of having accurate in situ datasets for thorough independent validation e g cosh et al 2004 weerasinghe et al 2020 gelebo et al 2022 thus a thorough campaign of support from national and regional funders as well as land owners and local populations that enables in situ sampling for verification is still on the agenda this should possibly be synced or incorporated in any research programme for improving remote access data on landscape parameters to match the means 5 conclusions in this study we have developed the information of soil physical characteristics natural and manmade water flow as well as storage at catchment scale to improve water balance partitioning and the description of landscape catchment hydrology we show that with available soil texture data improved with point measured soil physical properties key landscape hydrological functions such as soil water holding capacity and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity change significantly further the explicit addition of tile drainage and merged natural and manmade ditch networks increases flow pathways significantly finally the catchment water storage was comparatively well understood in available existing data to secure water under climate change water allocation will increase in importance for many water users at catchment scale including safeguarding environmental flows alongside human supplies and agricultural needs the use of more complex models and the improved model performance of hydrological processes need to better capture both natural parts and the impact of anthropogenic structures and processes concerning the hydrological cycle at landscape scale linked to both surface and subsurface unsaturated soil water flows improved soil physical properties and merged water flow paths and storage distributed accurately will be as equally important as climate input for these water balances estimates this calls for the long term increased maintained data collection of essential landscape hydrological climate parameters with the evaluation of sampling size and interval spatial and temporal for at a minimum calibration validation purposes in addition transparency of access for available data linked to water outtake recharge storage is needed to be able to evaluate and follow up any landscape measures affecting landscape hydrological storage capacity credit authorship contribution

8941,there is a need for precise irrigation strategies to reduce leaching and water use whilst avoiding drought exposure a model based prediction and visualization method is proposed to help estimate the precise required irrigation dosage and frequency to achieve desired leaching fraction and drought exposure as a multi objective optimization problem the method produces a contour plot that shows the estimated leaching and drought exposure under uncertain evapotranspiration three sandy soils and three clay soils were examined for a total of 6 different soils which included a clay soil case with protected chrysanthemum cultivation the results illustrate the usefulness of this type of visualization in decision support predictions indicate that compared to a conventional irrigation strategy leaching could be reduced by 40 and water use by 9 whilst maintaining a low drought exposure below 1 furthermore predictions indicate that reducing evapotranspiration uncertainty would require an irrigation frequency increase 20 or a total irrigation dosage increase 10 compared to clay soils sandy soils require a higher frequency irrigation more than once per 2 days to prevent drought exposure the proposed model based framework and visualization method provides a useful understanding of low risk irrigation strategies that account for evapotranspiration uncertainty while reducing water use and minimizing leaching giving valuable insights to agricultural professionals and policymakers alike additionally the developed framework has the potential to be used as a core for decision and control tools developed for sustainable agriculture and water resource management keywords performance framework model based irrigation drought exposure leaching fraction monte carlo decision support data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction given the current growth in world population the need to maintain a steady level of food production is increasing the agricultural use of resources including freshwater agriculture is the largest single user of freshwater accounting for nearly 75 of current human freshwater use fao 2016 a considerable share 45 of that water is used for irrigation a crucial aspect in achieving ecological sustainability in farming is to achieve an optimal irrigation balance 1 1 irrigation balance over irrigation is an important cause of water waste in addition to contributing to high water use it also causes percolation within the soil this may cause nutrients and biocides to be transported into the groundwater causing a negative environmental impact erisman et al 2011 it is therefore imperative to minimize over irrigation irrigating too little of course is unwanted as this will lead to drought stress at the same time however the complete elimination of percolation would lead to soil salinity a potential source of crop stress the main cause of over irrigation stems from misperceptions on the part of growers regarding the amount of water required levidow et al 2014 from the grower s perspective maximum crop production levels are desirable the risk of yield loss due to drought conditions is always present and hard to foresee growers therefore tend to use over irrigation as a form of risk avoidance thereby protecting their crops from drought exposure perry et al 2009 in contrast from an environmental perspective an important objective is to reduce water use as well as soil percolation emissions in addition to these objectives high soil salinity should be avoided the reduction of soil percolation to near zero values may result in a build up of solutes that are present due to fertilization or fertigation a proportion of the built up solutes is leached out from the root zone to prevent crop stress the fraction of applied water that passes and percolates throughout the entire rooting depth is known as the leaching fraction lf ayers et al 1985 finding a balance between the aforementioned objectives requires precise irrigation scheduling regarding timing and dosage morison et al 2008 the optimization of irrigation through precise timing and dosage is a form of precision farming a strategy for resource efficient food production that involves precise dosage timing and allocation of inputs including nutrients and water van mourik et al 2021 their study illustrates precision farming with a model based irrigation strategy with respect to water dosage and irrigation frequency many studies have been conducted on the improvement of irrigation frequency and dosage based on both experimental and model based approaches 1 2 experimental studies experimental studies have determined the effects of varying irrigation frequency and dosage on yield production by exploring crop water demand due to evapotranspiration these studies also indicate how irrigation strategies based on evapotranspiration can help to increase crop yield and reduce water use studies by ertek et al 2004 sensoy et al 2007 considered the effects of irrigation frequency and dosage on the production rate of field grown melon and summer squash concluding that the combination of higher irrigation frequency together with higher irrigation dosage increased yield whilst maintaining the soil water content above the wilting point in a study of the yield and quality of cucumber crops abd el mageed et al 2018 conclude that irrigation can be reduced from 100 to 80 of the evapotranspiration demand of the crop with no major effect on yield whilst reducing the amount of irrigation water applied by 20 these experimental studies demonstrate that tuning of dosage and frequency can result in considerable improvement in water use efficiency without negatively affecting crop quality or production 1 3 model based and uncertainty model based studies allow fast and extensive exploration of irrigation strategies in a structural fashion thereby offering the possibility to save time and labour input required for experimental studies computational analysis makes it possible to obtain insight into how variation in certain factors e g soil type crop type and weather may influence performance in terms of soil percolation and water use a study of aggarwal aggarwal 1995 focused on the influence of prediction uncertainty in e g weather and crop status on yield output in that study input uncertainty resulted in uncertain grain yield with a standard deviation of 15 evapotranspiration with a standard deviation of 5 and nitrogen uptake with a standard deviation of 3 these results suggest that uncertainty in input and parameters can have a considerable effect on model predictions nevertheless model based studies have not yet devoted much attention to the effect of parameter uncertainty in model predictions the incorporation of uncertainty analysis in model based studies offers significant advantages over traditional experimental studies by exploring irrigation strategies in a structural fashion computational analysis allows for extensive and rapid exploration of different scenarios thus saving time and resources however the inherent prediction uncertainty of soil crop weather systems poses a challenge to model based studies variability in weather and soil properties can significantly impact model predictions resulting in uncertain outcomes this is why the study of mondaca et al mondaca duarte et al 2020a 2020b applied a model based approach to predict the relation between soil percolation and drought exposure under variable dosage and under uncertainty in evapotranspiration rate and soil properties the irrigation frequency was fixed one irrigation per three days for their test case they concluded that it is possible to reduce soil percolation by 88 and water use by 22 compared to a conventional irrigation strategy whilst maintaining a low risk of crop stress due to drought exposure 1 their approach of incorporating uncertainty in evapotranspiration rate and soil properties in their model predictions of soil percolation and drought exposure is a novel and important approach to address these issues however one of the limitations of the study is that the optimal irrigation strategy shown applies to a specific case with a fixed irrigation frequency in reality this becomes an optimization problem as a feasible strategy will vary depending on the growers objective and capabilities further research is needed to account for the influence and interactions of various external factors 1 4 the optimization problem finding the optimal balance between drought exposure water use and leaching poses an interesting optimization problem standard optimization strategies aim to identify an optimal solution amongst a set of feasible solutions by minimizing a cost function that balances objectives such as minimizing water use maintaining a small but nonzero leaching fraction and achieving an acceptably small drought exposure the solution of the optimization problem depends on the relative weights assigned to each objective selecting the weights is not a straightforward procedure as their associated objectives are hard to compare due to their different nature ecological sustainability versus production rate it is generally unclear how leaching or water use are to be weighed against drought exposure as they depend on a variety of variable factors e g related to government policies risk avoidance of growers market prices delivery contracts water availability crop resilience to drought natural soil salinity and local climate the presence of multiple objectives usually creates a set of optimal solutions instead of a single optimal solution a way to visualize multi objective optimization involves pareto optimal solutions sarkar and modak 2005 these solutions typically form an isoline along which the objective function is constant thereby visualizing the trade off between multiple conflicting objectives pareto optimization has been applied in real life scheduling scenarios delgoda et al 2017 or parameter optimization through inverse modelling vrugt et al 2008 when optimization of agricultural irrigation strategies is considered it is also a complex problem that requires balancing multiple conflicting objectives such as water use leaching fraction and drought exposure selecting the relative weights of these objectives is not straightforward and depends on a variety of factors the application of a multi objective optimization to balance these objectives is a novel approach that has not yet been applied to direct agricultural irrigation strategies the closest example is the study of udias et al 2018 where a multi objective optimization approach was used in irrigation dosage based on land use and soil slope characteristics however no studies have yet been published that use multi objective optimization to balance water use drought exposure and soil percolation this highlights the importance of incorporating optimization techniques that allow for the identification of the optimal solution amongst a set of feasible solutions while visualizing the trade off between multiple conflicting objectives therefore incorporating these optimization techniques is a novel approach that can significantly contribute to the optimization of agricultural irrigation strategies 1 5 objective the objective of this study was to propose and illustrate a method for gaining insight into the combined effect of the time between irrigation frequency and total irrigation values dosage on leaching and drought exposure predictions under uncertain environmental conditions this method visualises performance isolines of leaching and drought exposure as a function of the control variables irrigation dosage and frequency the method was applied to the case of soil based chrysanthemum cultivation in a greenhouse the case study focused on the following four questions the first question concerns the extent to which water use and leaching can be reduced by modifying the dosage and frequency of irrigation on a specific type of soil the second question concerns the effect of including uncertainty in evapotranspiration on predictions of leaching and drought exposure the third question concerns how water use and leaching relate to the frequency and dosage of irrigation given a specific allowed drought exposure ratio the fourth question concerns how the variation within and between soils affect drought exposure and leaching fraction as function of irrigation dosage and frequency the materials and methods used to investigate these questions are described in section 2 and the results are presented in section 3 including a discussion reflection on both the results and the methodology section 4 presents conclusions for each question and recommendations for further research 2 materials and methods the methodology used in this study can be summarized in the following steps 1 a two module model framework mondaca duarte et al 2020b was used to generate predictions of soil percolation and drought exposure section 2 1 2 the model framework was extended to enable varying irrigation frequencies section 2 2 3 a performance matrix was created for each type of soil this matrix was used to compare predictions of drought exposure and leaching ratio based on different irrigation frequencies x axis and irrigation dosages y axis outputs of the matrix were the leaching fraction ratio and drought exposure ratio section 2 3 4 a monte carlo random sampling approach was used to simulate daily evapotranspiration uncertainty section 2 4 5 given the noise in the outputs of the performance matrix due to deviations in radiation inputs the data values were smoothed using a moving average algorithm section 2 5 6 the smoothed irrigation matrices were plotted including the frequency and dosage of irrigation and predictions of the drought exposure ratios and leaching fraction ratios section 2 6 7 the smoothed irrigation matrices were analysed in view of the research questions sections 2 6 and 2 7 2 1 model description the model used in this study is a continuation of a previous study by mondaca duarte et al 2020b involving the development of a two module framework based on two models in that study the emman3g model which is based on the fussim2d heinen 2001 model was used to describe a one dimensional vertical water transport through three soil layers 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 90 cm and the de graaf model voogt et al 2000 was used to calculate the evapotranspiration required by the emman3g model for crop water uptake fig 1 in the de graaf model evapotranspiration is a function of global radiation greenhouse temperature heating pipe temperature and crop stage the two module framework has been verified and validated by mondaca duarte et al 2020b and full descriptions of the equations and methodology used to integrate the models are available in that publication in this study soil percolation is defined as the amount of water leaving the soil at the bottom of the soil layer 3 towards groundwater total irrigation is defined as the total amount of water used by an irrigation strategy frequency relates to the amount of time between irrigation events water flow from the first soil layer can occur in two ways through water flow to the second layer and through evapotranspiration drought exposure is the ratio of hours during which a crop root zone first soil layer is exposed to conditions below a water pressure head threshold below which transpiration reduction occurs resulting in decreased crop growth 2 2 model based analysis the period for the model based analysis consisted of 32 consecutive days starting on july 31st 2016 this period is the same as the experimental data period previously used in mondaca duarte et al 2020b during this period the crop is considered fully grown for this reason the soil evaporation was neglected the de graaf model focuses on the relationship between transpiration evapotranspiration and the radiation that the crop receives although soil evaporation can contribute to the overall evapotranspiration for fully grown crops it is usually possible to disregard it and concentrate only on transpiration this is because transpiration accounts for the majority of the et process for mature crops liebhard et al 2022 wei et al 2017 the model based analysis focused on the two module framework to predict drought exposure and leaching fraction based on the dosage and frequency of irrigation irrigation dosages ranged between 103 mm and 173 mm with a step size of 1 mm resulting in 71 different irrigation dosages which are listed along the y axis of a matrix each irrigation dosage represents the accumulated irrigation used during the whole 32 days period this means that as the frequency goes down the amount that is administrated at each instance will increase and vice versa the dosage irrigation values y axis are based on the cumulative evapotranspiration from the de graaf model as calculated with the experimental data the lower limit corresponds to 90 of the cumulative evapotranspiration with the upper limit of irrigation corresponding to 150 of the cumulative evapotranspiration 114 mm the lower limit was selected based on the conclusion of mondaca duarte et al 2020b that a decrease in dosage to near and lower than the cumulative evapotranspiration increased drought exposure exponentially in the same manner the upper limit of 150 cumulative evapotranspiration is based on the finding that irrigation values above this cumulative evapotranspiration range had near zero drought exposure the time between irrigation events displayed along the x axis were based on possible irrigation schedules the lower limit is once an hour and the upper limit is once every 168 h corresponding to an irrigation event once every seven days there were thus 168 different frequency values the resulting performance matrix of 71 irrigation values and 168 frequency values yielded a total of 11 928 unique combinations for each of these combinations the model predicted a leaching fraction and a drought exposure 2 3 leaching fraction and drought exposure predictions in the model soil percolation is represented as the downward water flow from the third soil layer as it assumes that the groundwater table is just below the third soil layer total soil percolation was defined as the cumulative soil percolation over the total range of time series data the leaching fraction was defined as the sum of soil percolation divided by the irrigation 1 lf sp i i i where lf mm mm 1 is the leaching fraction sp mm is the soil percolation amount i mm is the irrigation amount in this study we defined a crop as being under drought exposure when the average water pressure head inside the root zone was below a specific pressure head threshold the drought exposure ratio predictions are thus defined as the ratio of the cumulative number of times that a crop is under drought exposure over the total time series data 2 de 1 n i 1 n d i d i 0 h t h i 1 h i h t where de d d 1 is the drought exposure ratio i e the number of days with drought relative to the total number of days h t cm is the pressure head threshold below which drought stress is experienced and h i cm is the average pressure head in the root zone on day i here we used h t 50 cm on the emman3g module mondaca duarte et al 2020a 2020b the same computation was applied by mondaca duarte et al 2020b although then it was referred to as crop stress risk instead of the drought exposure ratio the latter being our preferred term for this study eq 2 2 4 prediction uncertainty the level of uncertainty in the evapotranspiration was calculated according to the methodology developed by mondaca duarte et al 2020b the model performance matrix was computed 100 times for each combination of frequency and irrigation dosage using a monte carlo sampling method the sampling was done at random with each random daily evapotranspiration sample having the same probability of being selected this yielded a discrete probability density function representing the uncertainty in evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration dataset included 32 measurement days beginning on 31 july 2016 the evapotranspiration dataset was divided into 32 daily segments which were used to artificially create variable evapotranspiration datasets by randomly drawing 32 segments and recreating a new 32 day dataset for each model computation the schematic representation of how the uncertainty study was simulated is presented in section 2 6 the prediction uncertainty of leaching fraction and drought exposure was represented by the standard deviation as obtained from the 100 realizations the uncertainty study was performed on 6 different types of greenhouse soils divided into 3 sandy soils and 3 clay soils the parameters for each soil type and each soil layer are presented in table 1 these soil parameters are used by the van genuchten mualem equation where α cm 1 n and λ are shape parameters θ r cm3 cm 3 is the residual water content θ s cm3 cm 3 is the saturation water content and k s cm d 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation a detailed explanation of the equations used in this framework can be found in mondaca duarte et al 2020b contour plots were used to compare certain and uncertain leaching fractions with their associated drought exposure predictions against each other the plot for certain predictions uses a single evapotranspiration dataset this means that there is no standard deviation the visualization of uncertain predictions is done in a conservative way where leaching and drought exposure are likely overestimated as each point in the plot represents the average of the prediction plus two standard deviations the two standard deviations were chosen to represent a worst case scenario where the contour plots would show the highest possible drought exposure and leaching fraction within 95 of the prediction distribution a grower could consider this worst case scenario if he she is risk averse or could compare between certain and uncertain predictions and decide how much risk he she is willing to take 2 5 smoothing noisy data leaching fraction and drought exposure outputs were noisy due to stochasticity in measured daily radiation this noise was propagated into the isoline visualization of predictions given the high levels of the noise and its high level of dependency on the particular monte carlo sampling of the measurement data and given that this noise obscures a clear view of the predicted leaching fraction and drought exposure isolines the output was smoothed data smoothing was performed using a moving average smoothing algorithm in matlab 2021b using the smooth function on a data array the array was smoothed using a 5 point moving average meaning that it takes an average of 5 values to generate a single point moving the average a single array value at a time and obtaining a new average single point the smoothing was performed on both outputs i e leaching fraction and drought exposure starting with the row data array of the y axis dosage and then proceeding to the column data array of the x axis frequency from top to bottom and then from left to right 2 6 schematic representation a bird s eye view of the model framework is presented in fig 2 under the framework scheme i and n from eqs 1 and 2 were renamed i data and data end for easier understanding of the model framework the time series length is i data from 1 to data end where data end is the total length of the time series n the time series includes solar radiation and air temperature a matrix prm f dosage f freq is made based on the evapotranspiration demand calculated according to the de graaf model this matrix indicates the irrigation irr of a specific frequency f freq and dosage f dosage described in section 2 2 the framework uses a two nested for loop to examine each entry on the performance matrix based on the frequency and dosage each entry uses the complete time series data to give predictions on the drought exposure ratio and leaching fraction for that specific dosage and frequency the first loop ends once dosage f dosage reaches the final range value dosage end the next frequency f freq value is chosen and the dosage is reset to the first dosage value the second loop continues until the frequency f freq reaches the final range value freq end inputs for the emman3g model include the irrigation value evapotranspiration soil parameters for three different soil layers and air temperature a specific soil type is selected along with its soil parameters the emman3g model outputs are the soil water pressure head and soil percolation values if the evapotranspiration is selected to be uncertain the simulations are iterated a certain number of iterations each iteration is denoted with index iter run with iter run 1 iter total in this study iter total 100 cumulative soil percolation sp iter run soil pressure head h iter run and crop drought exposure are stored when the total iter run iterations are computed the mean and standard deviation of the soil percolation and pressure head are stored for use in the performance matrix plot as the leaching fraction ratio and the drought exposure ratio 2 7 comparison between clay and sandy soil the mean of the mean for each of the three sandy soil types and the mean of the mean for each of the three clay soils types was used to compare the differences in drought exposure and leaching fraction between clay and sandy soils the mean of the mean values were sorted using matlab cat function the mean of the mean is from now on referred to as the overall mean the standard deviation of the overall mean was also obtained the arrays were visualized using matlab s contour plot contourf creating a filled contour plot with isolines contour plots of the overall mean were created as well as a contour showing the difference of the mean values between clay and sandy soils finally contour plots for the overall mean standard deviation were also created 3 results and discussion 3 1 smoothing plot fig 3 illustrates how smoothing using moving averages clarifies the distinction between the different levels of drought exposure ratio this is important when selecting an irrigation strategy especially for strategies calling for fewer days between irrigation and with lower leaching fractions if there is not a clear distinction between the regions of drought exposure ratio or leaching fraction it becomes harder to select an irrigation strategy especially for lower frequency predictions as displayed in fig 3 3 2 model based irrigation analysis each element of the array of the framework matrix contains the value of drought exposure leaching fraction and their respective standard deviation if uncertainty is included for a specific dosage of total irrigation and frequency of irrigation this amount of data makes it hard to visualize the standard deviation individually for this reason this section includes three specific total irrigation dosages where drought exposure and leaching fraction predictions along with their plus one and plus two standard deviations can be observed figs 4 and 5 a visualization of certain predictions for all the total irrigation values is shown in section 3 3 and a visualization of uncertain predictions for all the total irrigation values is shown in section 3 4 fig 4 shows the drought exposure at 114 mm 140 mm and 154 mm of total irrigation fig 5 shows the leaching fraction at the same irrigation values these specific irrigation values represent 1 the calculated total evapotranspiration 114 mm 2 an irrigation mid point with sufficient leaching fraction 140 mm and 3 the total irrigation from experiment values 154 mm the drought exposure increases as the irrigation frequency decreases even for high irrigation dosages of up to 150 evapotranspiration 154 mm the confidence intervals become larger as the days between irrigation increase for one or more irrigations per day the drought exposure becomes negligible with an irrigation near evapotranspiration 114 mm the drought exposure starts to increase after frequencies higher than once per day additionally the confidence interval that represents uncertainty of drought exposure increases when the irrigation rate approaches the evapotranspiration rate fig 4 shows that an irrigation strategy where total water gift approaches total evapotranspiration top plot will require a higher irrigation frequency to maintain a low drought exposure ratio for growers this means that reducing the total irrigation would require an increase in irrigation frequency to prevent exposing their crop to higher ratios of drought exposure as such the precision of irrigation management becomes even more critical emphasizing the importance of applying irrigation on an hourly basis when the technical systems allows it hourly irrigation ensures that crops receive precise amounts of water avoiding under or over watering leading to improved crop yields reduce water use and have less uncertainty in drought exposure fig 5 shows that the leaching fraction increases the higher the total irrigation and the higher the days between irrigation on the other hand compared to the drought exposure the leaching fraction confidence interval is nearly independent of the number of days between irrigation as well as of the total irrigation values 3 3 prediction with certain evapotranspiration drought exposure and leaching fraction predictions are shown in fig 6 an ideal irrigation strategy minimizes water use and drought exposure while simultaneously maintaining a desired leaching fraction this means that for example for a particular soil type with a desired lf of 10 or lf 0 1 as in fig 6 an irrigation strategy of 140 mm with an irrigation frequency of once every two days would have a predicted de of 0 01 these results are comparable to the results in turan et al 2015 when scaled back to a 32 day period as in our study in that work it was found that an interval of 2 or 4 days irrigation with an irrigation amount of 131 4 mm can be used to save water without affecting crop quality this is in line with our predictions fig 4 indicates that if the days between irrigation are 2 or 3 there will be no drought exposure comparing the model based predictions with the lysimeter experimental data indicated by the dot and arrow in fig 6 reveals that when no uncertainty in evapotranspiration is considered the irrigation strategy during the greenhouse experiment involving an irrigation frequency of once every three days and total irrigation of 154 mm was a safe choice with de levels below 0 01 and a lf of 0 15 these model predictions can be used to give irrigation advice growers could adjust both dosage and frequency of irrigation to obtain significant reductions in water use for example a grower could use a dosage of 140 mm and a frequency of once every two days to reduce soil percolation by 40 and water use by 9 relative to the experimental irrigation strategy dosage of 154 mm and frequency of once every three days while maintaining a leaching fraction above 10 given a predefined drought exposure ratio results indicate that different combinations of frequency and dosage of irrigation lead to the same level of drought exposure as well as different combinations of inputs producing a similar leaching fraction this observation suggests that selecting the appropriate frequency and dosage of irrigation is a multi objective optimization problem as fig 6 demonstrates given a required maximum drought exposure ratio a different combination of dosage and frequency of irrigation can have the same leaching fraction similarly given a required maximum leaching different combinations of dosage and frequency will yield the same values of drought exposure risk if low drought exposure is desired fig 6 indicates that frequencies lower than once per 3 5 days will not be feasible in practice for example if a grower wants a total drought exposure of 0 01 then the number days between irrigation must be lower than 3 5 a higher number will result in extremely high required dosages which is a result of the almost vertical isolines for periods larger than 3 5 days combined with total irrigation higher than 130 mm for any specific combination between drought exposure ratio and leaching fraction only a single combination of irrigation dosage and frequency will be able to achieve it this is due to the fact that the drought exposure and leaching fraction isolines are more or less perpendicular to each other however if the requirement is to achieve a leaching fraction and drought exposure within some range multiple combinations of dosage and frequency will be able to achieve it this can be useful to a grower as a single combination or the array of allowed combinations are relatively easily recognized in fig 6 the performance matrix thus offers a good way of identifying a suitable strategy for a specific requirement allowing growers the freedom to choose a combination of frequency and dosage that suits their needs these needs depend on available equipment and on performance requirements for example for certain fruit crops it is known that a slight drought or salinity stress results in improved fruit quality wang et al 2019 3 4 prediction with uncertain evapotranspiration drought exposure and leaching fraction predictions in fig 7 are shown as the mean plus two standard deviations representing a worst case scenario of uncertain evapotranspiration when evapotranspiration becomes uncertain the predicted de increases shifting the isolines towards higher frequencies and dosages of irrigation as compared to fig 6 when certain and uncertain predictions are compared it is shown that combinations of frequency and dosage give different leaching fraction lf values for example certain predictions in fig 6 at an irrigation of 150 mm with 3 days between irrigation show a lf of 0 14 uncertain predictions in fig 7 show a lf of 0 16 at the same frequency and dosage regarding drought exposure de uncertain predictions have fewer possible combinations of dosage and frequency with de values below 0 01 comparing the model based predictions with the lysimeter experimental data indicated by the symbol and arrow in fig 7 reveals that the irrigation strategy based on experimental data now have a drought exposure of 0 1 so the grower would require to adjust the dosage and or frequency to reduce the drought exposure ratio being able to give advice under uncertainty is decisive because with these model predictions growers can avoid drought exposure even when the evapotranspiration is not certain a grower must select either a more conservative strategy thereby increasing both water use and leaching fraction or a strategy that will increase the ratio of drought exposure given that growers are generally risk averse they are likely to select more conservative strategies additionally economic farm requirements like labour or equipment also play a role in selecting an irrigation strategy therefore it is quite important to consider the uncertainty in the model predictions so growers can receive accurate advice that does not impact negatively these economic requirements for example chrysanthemum growers require a dryer soil surface for certain periods where labour and equipment are used for agricultural practices such as spraying plant protective products removal of old leaves or flower harvest if an uncertain strategy is selected with too few days between irrigation the soil surface will remain wet and the growers will have a hard time performing these agricultural practices 3 5 comparison between clay and sandy soil types 3 5 1 leaching fraction variation the overall mean values of leaching fraction from the three different sandy soil types explored in this study are represented in fig 8 the overall mean leaching fraction values for the clay soils are presented in fig 9 the difference between the overall mean values of sandy soils minus clay soils are presented in fig 10 sandy soils have a slightly higher leaching fraction than clay soils fig 10 the higher total irrigation and longer days between irrigations increase the difference in leaching fraction this increase in leaching fraction difference does play a role when choosing a combination of dosage and frequency for an irrigation strategy but only when high dosages and longer days between irrigation are considered which usually is not the case irrigation strategies normally aim to have a low leaching fraction for example if a grower considers to have a standard leaching fraction value of 0 1 the highest total irrigation would be on sandy soils at 145 mm on frequencies below one day between irrigation fig 8 at that dosage and frequency the highest leaching fraction difference would be 0 008 which is only an 8 variation compared to the leaching fraction of 0 1 this means that the model predictions can be used to give certain irrigation advice regarding leaching fraction for commonly used strategies across different types of soil 3 5 2 drought exposure variation the overall mean drought exposure values from the three different sandy soil types explored in this study are represented in fig 11 the overall mean drought exposure values for the clay soils are presented in fig 12 the difference between the overall mean values of sandy soils minus clay soils are presented in fig 13 a clear relation between the type of soil and drought exposure can be seen overall sandy soils tend to have a higher drought exposure than clay soils this is expected as sandy soils have a higher hydraulic conductivity and lower water holding capacity water availability see e g heinen et al 2021 increasing the possibility of drought on average the studied sandy soils require irrigation frequencies of more than once per 3 days fig 11 there is an interesting response on certain combinations of irrigation frequencies and total irrigation fig 13 looking at different dosage and frequency values two things can be observed first when an irrigation strategy has a high total irrigation above 155 mm the difference in drought exposure between sandy and clay soils becomes close to zero this is because at frequencies less than once per 3 days the water status at the first soil layer never goes below the threshold in both types of soil so the difference is zero as both soils have zero drought exposure second when the total irrigation is below 125 mm and the days between irrigation are above 1 day then the sandy soils present higher drought exposure compared to clay soils for example in fig 13 de difference of 0 1 is present at a total irrigation of 120 mm and days between irrigation below 1 day and it follows a contour along a change in frequency and dosage up to 150 mm at a frequency of 5 days between irrigation this can be explained because for fully grown crops the evapotranspiration rate is approximately the same for both soils but the water flow rate to the second layer is higher in sandy soils increasing the drought exposure compared to clay soils it is interesting that there are combinations of dosage and frequency where the drought exposure difference is zero across multiple types of soil using the model framework predictions for irrigation advice growers can consider these combinations of dosages and frequencies regardless of the type of soil they have however some of these combinations require higher total irrigation dosages which increases soil percolation and in some cases it is not desired 3 6 standard deviation of the mean between soil types 3 6 1 leaching fraction the standard deviation of leaching fraction in clay soils fig 14 and sandy soils fig 15 are shown in this section there is a considerable difference in standard deviation between sandy soils and clay soils the standard deviations in clay soils range from 0 02 to 0 03 for almost all combinations of dosage and frequency fig 15 shows that sandy soils have a high uniformity in standard deviation 0 005 0 01 compared to clay soils an explanation of this difference in standard deviation between soils is that water retention is especially sensitive to the variation in composition of clay soils in clay soils water is held more tightly and moves more slowly through the soil compared to sandy soils the small pores in clay soils allow water to be held tightly whereas the large pores in sandy soils allow water to move through the soil at a higher rate this is quite important as it shows the model is quite certain in leaching fraction predictions especially on sandy soils the highest standard deviation was 0 03 on clay soils this represents a high variation as the mean leaching fraction values at that dosage and frequency was 0 06 this means that predictions from the model will be uncertain when giving irrigation advice on clay soils when using the model framework predictions to give irrigation advice to growers with clay soils growers need to be certain about the specific soil parameters of their soil to reduce the deviation between clay soils 3 6 2 drought exposure the standard deviation of drought exposure in clay soils fig 16 and sandy soils fig 17 are shown in this section considering the standard deviation between the same types of soil can provide insight in how certain or uncertain can the model predictions be with similar types of soil figs 16 and 17 show that there are combinations of dosage and frequency where the predicted drought exposure has a standard deviation below 0 01 making predictions with these combinations highly certain these certain predictions can be traced at frequencies of less than one day between irrigation and total irrigation dosages on clay soils starting above 125 mm and sandy soils starting above 112 mm to maintain these certain predictions at higher days between irrigation it is required to increase the total irrigation a comparison between both soils shows that sandy soils require less total irrigation to maintain the drought exposure deviation below 0 01 up to a sudden increase in required total irrigation at days between irrigation above 3 days another observation is that overall clay soils present less certain predictions compared to sandy soils where values of standard deviation above 0 05 are present in several dosage and frequency combinations compare to almost none in sandy soils this difference in the standard deviation of drought exposure between clay and sandy soils can be explained similarly as the leaching fraction deviation there is more variation in water retention in clay soils than sandy soils as clay soils water retention can vary from different clay soil sources standard deviation of drought exposure can give insight in how certain an irrigation strategy advice can be across a type of soil if growers know they have a crop on a type of soil but are not certain about its specific soil parameters they can use the model framework to plan an irrigation strategy that can avoid this uncertainty also in cases where they have clay soil growers would require to be aware that there is higher deviation in predictions when using some combinations of dosages and frequencies 3 7 limitations and improvements in the model framework the model framework considers drought exposure as the ratio between the amount of hours a crop is under a specific pressure head threshold compared to the total amount of hours however this ratio does not consider if those hours were consecutive or along a specific timeline this means that you can have the same drought exposure prediction if a crop was 48 consecutive hours below the threshold during a 48 day period or if a crop is one hour each day for a 48 day period below the threshold right now we use a simple metric of ratio of hours above a certain threshold but it could be explored as a pattern of drought periods with different intensities in pressure head as well as cumulative number of hours between these drought periods giving a more detailed advice regarding if a crop is stressed or not the model framework uses global radiation to predict evapotranspiration at the same time uncertainty in evapotranspiration is considered as a variation in daily global radiation however once a frequency and dosage is put into the model the irrigation amount does not change even if the global radiation is high between irrigation events this means that between those irrigation events the irrigation might not have been enough it would be interesting to address changes in between irrigation events and see how the model predictions respond to them if we can change the dosing in between irrigation based on variables like cumulative radiation temperature or crop growth then the model can respond in a more dynamic way therefore it could be worthwhile to extend the framework presented here with a method that considers feedback from these variables and adjust the dosage or frequency the experimental data used to verify the model considers a full grown chrysanthemum crop in a 32 day period it would be interesting to use the model framework to estimate the water requirements for a full growing period with the right data and by considering the development stages of the crop one way to accomplish this is by incorporating the crop height as a variable in the model as the crop grows its water requirements change and by adjusting the model parameters accordingly it is possible to obtain estimates of the water needs for the whole growing period for this reason it is advisable to extend this model based approach using data from a whole cropping season and even for multiple cropping seasons using multiple weather data from different regions and multiple crops the de graaf model has a library of different crop factors for different types of crop which can be of interest to verify them with experimental data and it can be even further extended to include models other than de graaf that also provide et calculations another limitation of our model framework is the potential impact of autocorrelation on the generated random evapotranspiration series while we acknowledge that our sampling strategy using one day segments preserved the autocorrelation within a day there may still be some autocorrelation for periods longer than a day that we did not account for in our analysis this might potentially lead to differences between our simulated evapotranspiration data and the actual evapotranspiration values to address this issue future studies could explore alternative sampling strategies or statistical methods that explicitly account for autocorrelation in the data for instance use block resampling techniques to generate multiple random samples of evapotranspiration data that account for the autocorrelation structure of the original data that will help us to better understand the underlying autocorrelation structure of the et data in addition collecting longer term data series with higher temporal resolution can provide us with a more detailed information on how evapotranspiration varies throughout the day and could help to better understand the autocorrelation patterns in the data the model framework assumes a fixed groundwater level as the bottom boundary condition in modelling greenhouse cropping systems is a commonly used approach to simulate conditions that are typically found in areas where groundwater is managed through a drainage system like in the netherlands however this assumption may not always be valid in all situations and its limitations must be acknowledged to ensure that the results of the study are not misinterpreted to address this limitation a possible approach is to incorporate a variable groundwater level in the framework model this would involve using data on groundwater levels from the specific region where the model is being applied and incorporating this data into the model the model would then simulate the actual conditions in the region including fluctuations in groundwater levels which would provide more accurate results additionally as the groundwater is variable it would be interesting to include an uncertainty analysis on the effect this variation on the water interactions between the soil layers and consequently on the model results the model framework considers irrigation to be uniform per square meter area in reality irrigation is seldomly uniform and this can lead to cases where uneven irrigation can cause drought exposure a new interesting approach could be to include sources of water giving at specific point of a studied area and investigate to what extent these spatial variations in irrigation may improve performance predictions of drought exposure leaching and water use efficiency a possible methodology to apply this approach would require to expand the 1d emman3g model to a 2d soil water model that considers water flow not just vertically but also horizontally 4 conclusions the findings of this study provide valuable insights in irrigation strategies the results demonstrate that modifying the dosage and frequency of irrigation can significantly reduce water use and leaching this study also highlights the significant impact of evapotranspiration uncertainty on drought exposure and leaching predictions emphasizing the need for low risk irrigation strategies that consider this uncertainty furthermore this study shows that the shapes of the isolines for both types of soil indicates a high sensitivity of drought exposure ratio towards irrigation frequency particularly for high total dosages this finding suggests that careful consideration of irrigation frequency is crucial to ensure an optimal irrigation and reduce drought exposure this study also points out the impact of soil type on predicted drought exposure and leaching with clay soils showing more variation in these predictions compared to sandy soils finally a visualization of the predictions allows to identify possible combinations of irrigation dosage and leaching fractions and supports growers into being informed about the effects and risks associated with their management decisions this approach is fundamentally different from conventional optimization which involves the computation of a single

8941,there is a need for precise irrigation strategies to reduce leaching and water use whilst avoiding drought exposure a model based prediction and visualization method is proposed to help estimate the precise required irrigation dosage and frequency to achieve desired leaching fraction and drought exposure as a multi objective optimization problem the method produces a contour plot that shows the estimated leaching and drought exposure under uncertain evapotranspiration three sandy soils and three clay soils were examined for a total of 6 different soils which included a clay soil case with protected chrysanthemum cultivation the results illustrate the usefulness of this type of visualization in decision support predictions indicate that compared to a conventional irrigation strategy leaching could be reduced by 40 and water use by 9 whilst maintaining a low drought exposure below 1 furthermore predictions indicate that reducing evapotranspiration uncertainty would require an irrigation frequency increase 20 or a total irrigation dosage increase 10 compared to clay soils sandy soils require a higher frequency irrigation more than once per 2 days to prevent drought exposure the proposed model based framework and visualization method provides a useful understanding of low risk irrigation strategies that account for evapotranspiration uncertainty while reducing water use and minimizing leaching giving valuable insights to agricultural professionals and policymakers alike additionally the developed framework has the potential to be used as a core for decision and control tools developed for sustainable agriculture and water resource management keywords performance framework model based irrigation drought exposure leaching fraction monte carlo decision support data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction given the current growth in world population the need to maintain a steady level of food production is increasing the agricultural use of resources including freshwater agriculture is the largest single user of freshwater accounting for nearly 75 of current human freshwater use fao 2016 a considerable share 45 of that water is used for irrigation a crucial aspect in achieving ecological sustainability in farming is to achieve an optimal irrigation balance 1 1 irrigation balance over irrigation is an important cause of water waste in addition to contributing to high water use it also causes percolation within the soil this may cause nutrients and biocides to be transported into the groundwater causing a negative environmental impact erisman et al 2011 it is therefore imperative to minimize over irrigation irrigating too little of course is unwanted as this will lead to drought stress at the same time however the complete elimination of percolation would lead to soil salinity a potential source of crop stress the main cause of over irrigation stems from misperceptions on the part of growers regarding the amount of water required levidow et al 2014 from the grower s perspective maximum crop production levels are desirable the risk of yield loss due to drought conditions is always present and hard to foresee growers therefore tend to use over irrigation as a form of risk avoidance thereby protecting their crops from drought exposure perry et al 2009 in contrast from an environmental perspective an important objective is to reduce water use as well as soil percolation emissions in addition to these objectives high soil salinity should be avoided the reduction of soil percolation to near zero values may result in a build up of solutes that are present due to fertilization or fertigation a proportion of the built up solutes is leached out from the root zone to prevent crop stress the fraction of applied water that passes and percolates throughout the entire rooting depth is known as the leaching fraction lf ayers et al 1985 finding a balance between the aforementioned objectives requires precise irrigation scheduling regarding timing and dosage morison et al 2008 the optimization of irrigation through precise timing and dosage is a form of precision farming a strategy for resource efficient food production that involves precise dosage timing and allocation of inputs including nutrients and water van mourik et al 2021 their study illustrates precision farming with a model based irrigation strategy with respect to water dosage and irrigation frequency many studies have been conducted on the improvement of irrigation frequency and dosage based on both experimental and model based approaches 1 2 experimental studies experimental studies have determined the effects of varying irrigation frequency and dosage on yield production by exploring crop water demand due to evapotranspiration these studies also indicate how irrigation strategies based on evapotranspiration can help to increase crop yield and reduce water use studies by ertek et al 2004 sensoy et al 2007 considered the effects of irrigation frequency and dosage on the production rate of field grown melon and summer squash concluding that the combination of higher irrigation frequency together with higher irrigation dosage increased yield whilst maintaining the soil water content above the wilting point in a study of the yield and quality of cucumber crops abd el mageed et al 2018 conclude that irrigation can be reduced from 100 to 80 of the evapotranspiration demand of the crop with no major effect on yield whilst reducing the amount of irrigation water applied by 20 these experimental studies demonstrate that tuning of dosage and frequency can result in considerable improvement in water use efficiency without negatively affecting crop quality or production 1 3 model based and uncertainty model based studies allow fast and extensive exploration of irrigation strategies in a structural fashion thereby offering the possibility to save time and labour input required for experimental studies computational analysis makes it possible to obtain insight into how variation in certain factors e g soil type crop type and weather may influence performance in terms of soil percolation and water use a study of aggarwal aggarwal 1995 focused on the influence of prediction uncertainty in e g weather and crop status on yield output in that study input uncertainty resulted in uncertain grain yield with a standard deviation of 15 evapotranspiration with a standard deviation of 5 and nitrogen uptake with a standard deviation of 3 these results suggest that uncertainty in input and parameters can have a considerable effect on model predictions nevertheless model based studies have not yet devoted much attention to the effect of parameter uncertainty in model predictions the incorporation of uncertainty analysis in model based studies offers significant advantages over traditional experimental studies by exploring irrigation strategies in a structural fashion computational analysis allows for extensive and rapid exploration of different scenarios thus saving time and resources however the inherent prediction uncertainty of soil crop weather systems poses a challenge to model based studies variability in weather and soil properties can significantly impact model predictions resulting in uncertain outcomes this is why the study of mondaca et al mondaca duarte et al 2020a 2020b applied a model based approach to predict the relation between soil percolation and drought exposure under variable dosage and under uncertainty in evapotranspiration rate and soil properties the irrigation frequency was fixed one irrigation per three days for their test case they concluded that it is possible to reduce soil percolation by 88 and water use by 22 compared to a conventional irrigation strategy whilst maintaining a low risk of crop stress due to drought exposure 1 their approach of incorporating uncertainty in evapotranspiration rate and soil properties in their model predictions of soil percolation and drought exposure is a novel and important approach to address these issues however one of the limitations of the study is that the optimal irrigation strategy shown applies to a specific case with a fixed irrigation frequency in reality this becomes an optimization problem as a feasible strategy will vary depending on the growers objective and capabilities further research is needed to account for the influence and interactions of various external factors 1 4 the optimization problem finding the optimal balance between drought exposure water use and leaching poses an interesting optimization problem standard optimization strategies aim to identify an optimal solution amongst a set of feasible solutions by minimizing a cost function that balances objectives such as minimizing water use maintaining a small but nonzero leaching fraction and achieving an acceptably small drought exposure the solution of the optimization problem depends on the relative weights assigned to each objective selecting the weights is not a straightforward procedure as their associated objectives are hard to compare due to their different nature ecological sustainability versus production rate it is generally unclear how leaching or water use are to be weighed against drought exposure as they depend on a variety of variable factors e g related to government policies risk avoidance of growers market prices delivery contracts water availability crop resilience to drought natural soil salinity and local climate the presence of multiple objectives usually creates a set of optimal solutions instead of a single optimal solution a way to visualize multi objective optimization involves pareto optimal solutions sarkar and modak 2005 these solutions typically form an isoline along which the objective function is constant thereby visualizing the trade off between multiple conflicting objectives pareto optimization has been applied in real life scheduling scenarios delgoda et al 2017 or parameter optimization through inverse modelling vrugt et al 2008 when optimization of agricultural irrigation strategies is considered it is also a complex problem that requires balancing multiple conflicting objectives such as water use leaching fraction and drought exposure selecting the relative weights of these objectives is not straightforward and depends on a variety of factors the application of a multi objective optimization to balance these objectives is a novel approach that has not yet been applied to direct agricultural irrigation strategies the closest example is the study of udias et al 2018 where a multi objective optimization approach was used in irrigation dosage based on land use and soil slope characteristics however no studies have yet been published that use multi objective optimization to balance water use drought exposure and soil percolation this highlights the importance of incorporating optimization techniques that allow for the identification of the optimal solution amongst a set of feasible solutions while visualizing the trade off between multiple conflicting objectives therefore incorporating these optimization techniques is a novel approach that can significantly contribute to the optimization of agricultural irrigation strategies 1 5 objective the objective of this study was to propose and illustrate a method for gaining insight into the combined effect of the time between irrigation frequency and total irrigation values dosage on leaching and drought exposure predictions under uncertain environmental conditions this method visualises performance isolines of leaching and drought exposure as a function of the control variables irrigation dosage and frequency the method was applied to the case of soil based chrysanthemum cultivation in a greenhouse the case study focused on the following four questions the first question concerns the extent to which water use and leaching can be reduced by modifying the dosage and frequency of irrigation on a specific type of soil the second question concerns the effect of including uncertainty in evapotranspiration on predictions of leaching and drought exposure the third question concerns how water use and leaching relate to the frequency and dosage of irrigation given a specific allowed drought exposure ratio the fourth question concerns how the variation within and between soils affect drought exposure and leaching fraction as function of irrigation dosage and frequency the materials and methods used to investigate these questions are described in section 2 and the results are presented in section 3 including a discussion reflection on both the results and the methodology section 4 presents conclusions for each question and recommendations for further research 2 materials and methods the methodology used in this study can be summarized in the following steps 1 a two module model framework mondaca duarte et al 2020b was used to generate predictions of soil percolation and drought exposure section 2 1 2 the model framework was extended to enable varying irrigation frequencies section 2 2 3 a performance matrix was created for each type of soil this matrix was used to compare predictions of drought exposure and leaching ratio based on different irrigation frequencies x axis and irrigation dosages y axis outputs of the matrix were the leaching fraction ratio and drought exposure ratio section 2 3 4 a monte carlo random sampling approach was used to simulate daily evapotranspiration uncertainty section 2 4 5 given the noise in the outputs of the performance matrix due to deviations in radiation inputs the data values were smoothed using a moving average algorithm section 2 5 6 the smoothed irrigation matrices were plotted including the frequency and dosage of irrigation and predictions of the drought exposure ratios and leaching fraction ratios section 2 6 7 the smoothed irrigation matrices were analysed in view of the research questions sections 2 6 and 2 7 2 1 model description the model used in this study is a continuation of a previous study by mondaca duarte et al 2020b involving the development of a two module framework based on two models in that study the emman3g model which is based on the fussim2d heinen 2001 model was used to describe a one dimensional vertical water transport through three soil layers 0 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 90 cm and the de graaf model voogt et al 2000 was used to calculate the evapotranspiration required by the emman3g model for crop water uptake fig 1 in the de graaf model evapotranspiration is a function of global radiation greenhouse temperature heating pipe temperature and crop stage the two module framework has been verified and validated by mondaca duarte et al 2020b and full descriptions of the equations and methodology used to integrate the models are available in that publication in this study soil percolation is defined as the amount of water leaving the soil at the bottom of the soil layer 3 towards groundwater total irrigation is defined as the total amount of water used by an irrigation strategy frequency relates to the amount of time between irrigation events water flow from the first soil layer can occur in two ways through water flow to the second layer and through evapotranspiration drought exposure is the ratio of hours during which a crop root zone first soil layer is exposed to conditions below a water pressure head threshold below which transpiration reduction occurs resulting in decreased crop growth 2 2 model based analysis the period for the model based analysis consisted of 32 consecutive days starting on july 31st 2016 this period is the same as the experimental data period previously used in mondaca duarte et al 2020b during this period the crop is considered fully grown for this reason the soil evaporation was neglected the de graaf model focuses on the relationship between transpiration evapotranspiration and the radiation that the crop receives although soil evaporation can contribute to the overall evapotranspiration for fully grown crops it is usually possible to disregard it and concentrate only on transpiration this is because transpiration accounts for the majority of the et process for mature crops liebhard et al 2022 wei et al 2017 the model based analysis focused on the two module framework to predict drought exposure and leaching fraction based on the dosage and frequency of irrigation irrigation dosages ranged between 103 mm and 173 mm with a step size of 1 mm resulting in 71 different irrigation dosages which are listed along the y axis of a matrix each irrigation dosage represents the accumulated irrigation used during the whole 32 days period this means that as the frequency goes down the amount that is administrated at each instance will increase and vice versa the dosage irrigation values y axis are based on the cumulative evapotranspiration from the de graaf model as calculated with the experimental data the lower limit corresponds to 90 of the cumulative evapotranspiration with the upper limit of irrigation corresponding to 150 of the cumulative evapotranspiration 114 mm the lower limit was selected based on the conclusion of mondaca duarte et al 2020b that a decrease in dosage to near and lower than the cumulative evapotranspiration increased drought exposure exponentially in the same manner the upper limit of 150 cumulative evapotranspiration is based on the finding that irrigation values above this cumulative evapotranspiration range had near zero drought exposure the time between irrigation events displayed along the x axis were based on possible irrigation schedules the lower limit is once an hour and the upper limit is once every 168 h corresponding to an irrigation event once every seven days there were thus 168 different frequency values the resulting performance matrix of 71 irrigation values and 168 frequency values yielded a total of 11 928 unique combinations for each of these combinations the model predicted a leaching fraction and a drought exposure 2 3 leaching fraction and drought exposure predictions in the model soil percolation is represented as the downward water flow from the third soil layer as it assumes that the groundwater table is just below the third soil layer total soil percolation was defined as the cumulative soil percolation over the total range of time series data the leaching fraction was defined as the sum of soil percolation divided by the irrigation 1 lf sp i i i where lf mm mm 1 is the leaching fraction sp mm is the soil percolation amount i mm is the irrigation amount in this study we defined a crop as being under drought exposure when the average water pressure head inside the root zone was below a specific pressure head threshold the drought exposure ratio predictions are thus defined as the ratio of the cumulative number of times that a crop is under drought exposure over the total time series data 2 de 1 n i 1 n d i d i 0 h t h i 1 h i h t where de d d 1 is the drought exposure ratio i e the number of days with drought relative to the total number of days h t cm is the pressure head threshold below which drought stress is experienced and h i cm is the average pressure head in the root zone on day i here we used h t 50 cm on the emman3g module mondaca duarte et al 2020a 2020b the same computation was applied by mondaca duarte et al 2020b although then it was referred to as crop stress risk instead of the drought exposure ratio the latter being our preferred term for this study eq 2 2 4 prediction uncertainty the level of uncertainty in the evapotranspiration was calculated according to the methodology developed by mondaca duarte et al 2020b the model performance matrix was computed 100 times for each combination of frequency and irrigation dosage using a monte carlo sampling method the sampling was done at random with each random daily evapotranspiration sample having the same probability of being selected this yielded a discrete probability density function representing the uncertainty in evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration dataset included 32 measurement days beginning on 31 july 2016 the evapotranspiration dataset was divided into 32 daily segments which were used to artificially create variable evapotranspiration datasets by randomly drawing 32 segments and recreating a new 32 day dataset for each model computation the schematic representation of how the uncertainty study was simulated is presented in section 2 6 the prediction uncertainty of leaching fraction and drought exposure was represented by the standard deviation as obtained from the 100 realizations the uncertainty study was performed on 6 different types of greenhouse soils divided into 3 sandy soils and 3 clay soils the parameters for each soil type and each soil layer are presented in table 1 these soil parameters are used by the van genuchten mualem equation where α cm 1 n and λ are shape parameters θ r cm3 cm 3 is the residual water content θ s cm3 cm 3 is the saturation water content and k s cm d 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation a detailed explanation of the equations used in this framework can be found in mondaca duarte et al 2020b contour plots were used to compare certain and uncertain leaching fractions with their associated drought exposure predictions against each other the plot for certain predictions uses a single evapotranspiration dataset this means that there is no standard deviation the visualization of uncertain predictions is done in a conservative way where leaching and drought exposure are likely overestimated as each point in the plot represents the average of the prediction plus two standard deviations the two standard deviations were chosen to represent a worst case scenario where the contour plots would show the highest possible drought exposure and leaching fraction within 95 of the prediction distribution a grower could consider this worst case scenario if he she is risk averse or could compare between certain and uncertain predictions and decide how much risk he she is willing to take 2 5 smoothing noisy data leaching fraction and drought exposure outputs were noisy due to stochasticity in measured daily radiation this noise was propagated into the isoline visualization of predictions given the high levels of the noise and its high level of dependency on the particular monte carlo sampling of the measurement data and given that this noise obscures a clear view of the predicted leaching fraction and drought exposure isolines the output was smoothed data smoothing was performed using a moving average smoothing algorithm in matlab 2021b using the smooth function on a data array the array was smoothed using a 5 point moving average meaning that it takes an average of 5 values to generate a single point moving the average a single array value at a time and obtaining a new average single point the smoothing was performed on both outputs i e leaching fraction and drought exposure starting with the row data array of the y axis dosage and then proceeding to the column data array of the x axis frequency from top to bottom and then from left to right 2 6 schematic representation a bird s eye view of the model framework is presented in fig 2 under the framework scheme i and n from eqs 1 and 2 were renamed i data and data end for easier understanding of the model framework the time series length is i data from 1 to data end where data end is the total length of the time series n the time series includes solar radiation and air temperature a matrix prm f dosage f freq is made based on the evapotranspiration demand calculated according to the de graaf model this matrix indicates the irrigation irr of a specific frequency f freq and dosage f dosage described in section 2 2 the framework uses a two nested for loop to examine each entry on the performance matrix based on the frequency and dosage each entry uses the complete time series data to give predictions on the drought exposure ratio and leaching fraction for that specific dosage and frequency the first loop ends once dosage f dosage reaches the final range value dosage end the next frequency f freq value is chosen and the dosage is reset to the first dosage value the second loop continues until the frequency f freq reaches the final range value freq end inputs for the emman3g model include the irrigation value evapotranspiration soil parameters for three different soil layers and air temperature a specific soil type is selected along with its soil parameters the emman3g model outputs are the soil water pressure head and soil percolation values if the evapotranspiration is selected to be uncertain the simulations are iterated a certain number of iterations each iteration is denoted with index iter run with iter run 1 iter total in this study iter total 100 cumulative soil percolation sp iter run soil pressure head h iter run and crop drought exposure are stored when the total iter run iterations are computed the mean and standard deviation of the soil percolation and pressure head are stored for use in the performance matrix plot as the leaching fraction ratio and the drought exposure ratio 2 7 comparison between clay and sandy soil the mean of the mean for each of the three sandy soil types and the mean of the mean for each of the three clay soils types was used to compare the differences in drought exposure and leaching fraction between clay and sandy soils the mean of the mean values were sorted using matlab cat function the mean of the mean is from now on referred to as the overall mean the standard deviation of the overall mean was also obtained the arrays were visualized using matlab s contour plot contourf creating a filled contour plot with isolines contour plots of the overall mean were created as well as a contour showing the difference of the mean values between clay and sandy soils finally contour plots for the overall mean standard deviation were also created 3 results and discussion 3 1 smoothing plot fig 3 illustrates how smoothing using moving averages clarifies the distinction between the different levels of drought exposure ratio this is important when selecting an irrigation strategy especially for strategies calling for fewer days between irrigation and with lower leaching fractions if there is not a clear distinction between the regions of drought exposure ratio or leaching fraction it becomes harder to select an irrigation strategy especially for lower frequency predictions as displayed in fig 3 3 2 model based irrigation analysis each element of the array of the framework matrix contains the value of drought exposure leaching fraction and their respective standard deviation if uncertainty is included for a specific dosage of total irrigation and frequency of irrigation this amount of data makes it hard to visualize the standard deviation individually for this reason this section includes three specific total irrigation dosages where drought exposure and leaching fraction predictions along with their plus one and plus two standard deviations can be observed figs 4 and 5 a visualization of certain predictions for all the total irrigation values is shown in section 3 3 and a visualization of uncertain predictions for all the total irrigation values is shown in section 3 4 fig 4 shows the drought exposure at 114 mm 140 mm and 154 mm of total irrigation fig 5 shows the leaching fraction at the same irrigation values these specific irrigation values represent 1 the calculated total evapotranspiration 114 mm 2 an irrigation mid point with sufficient leaching fraction 140 mm and 3 the total irrigation from experiment values 154 mm the drought exposure increases as the irrigation frequency decreases even for high irrigation dosages of up to 150 evapotranspiration 154 mm the confidence intervals become larger as the days between irrigation increase for one or more irrigations per day the drought exposure becomes negligible with an irrigation near evapotranspiration 114 mm the drought exposure starts to increase after frequencies higher than once per day additionally the confidence interval that represents uncertainty of drought exposure increases when the irrigation rate approaches the evapotranspiration rate fig 4 shows that an irrigation strategy where total water gift approaches total evapotranspiration top plot will require a higher irrigation frequency to maintain a low drought exposure ratio for growers this means that reducing the total irrigation would require an increase in irrigation frequency to prevent exposing their crop to higher ratios of drought exposure as such the precision of irrigation management becomes even more critical emphasizing the importance of applying irrigation on an hourly basis when the technical systems allows it hourly irrigation ensures that crops receive precise amounts of water avoiding under or over watering leading to improved crop yields reduce water use and have less uncertainty in drought exposure fig 5 shows that the leaching fraction increases the higher the total irrigation and the higher the days between irrigation on the other hand compared to the drought exposure the leaching fraction confidence interval is nearly independent of the number of days between irrigation as well as of the total irrigation values 3 3 prediction with certain evapotranspiration drought exposure and leaching fraction predictions are shown in fig 6 an ideal irrigation strategy minimizes water use and drought exposure while simultaneously maintaining a desired leaching fraction this means that for example for a particular soil type with a desired lf of 10 or lf 0 1 as in fig 6 an irrigation strategy of 140 mm with an irrigation frequency of once every two days would have a predicted de of 0 01 these results are comparable to the results in turan et al 2015 when scaled back to a 32 day period as in our study in that work it was found that an interval of 2 or 4 days irrigation with an irrigation amount of 131 4 mm can be used to save water without affecting crop quality this is in line with our predictions fig 4 indicates that if the days between irrigation are 2 or 3 there will be no drought exposure comparing the model based predictions with the lysimeter experimental data indicated by the dot and arrow in fig 6 reveals that when no uncertainty in evapotranspiration is considered the irrigation strategy during the greenhouse experiment involving an irrigation frequency of once every three days and total irrigation of 154 mm was a safe choice with de levels below 0 01 and a lf of 0 15 these model predictions can be used to give irrigation advice growers could adjust both dosage and frequency of irrigation to obtain significant reductions in water use for example a grower could use a dosage of 140 mm and a frequency of once every two days to reduce soil percolation by 40 and water use by 9 relative to the experimental irrigation strategy dosage of 154 mm and frequency of once every three days while maintaining a leaching fraction above 10 given a predefined drought exposure ratio results indicate that different combinations of frequency and dosage of irrigation lead to the same level of drought exposure as well as different combinations of inputs producing a similar leaching fraction this observation suggests that selecting the appropriate frequency and dosage of irrigation is a multi objective optimization problem as fig 6 demonstrates given a required maximum drought exposure ratio a different combination of dosage and frequency of irrigation can have the same leaching fraction similarly given a required maximum leaching different combinations of dosage and frequency will yield the same values of drought exposure risk if low drought exposure is desired fig 6 indicates that frequencies lower than once per 3 5 days will not be feasible in practice for example if a grower wants a total drought exposure of 0 01 then the number days between irrigation must be lower than 3 5 a higher number will result in extremely high required dosages which is a result of the almost vertical isolines for periods larger than 3 5 days combined with total irrigation higher than 130 mm for any specific combination between drought exposure ratio and leaching fraction only a single combination of irrigation dosage and frequency will be able to achieve it this is due to the fact that the drought exposure and leaching fraction isolines are more or less perpendicular to each other however if the requirement is to achieve a leaching fraction and drought exposure within some range multiple combinations of dosage and frequency will be able to achieve it this can be useful to a grower as a single combination or the array of allowed combinations are relatively easily recognized in fig 6 the performance matrix thus offers a good way of identifying a suitable strategy for a specific requirement allowing growers the freedom to choose a combination of frequency and dosage that suits their needs these needs depend on available equipment and on performance requirements for example for certain fruit crops it is known that a slight drought or salinity stress results in improved fruit quality wang et al 2019 3 4 prediction with uncertain evapotranspiration drought exposure and leaching fraction predictions in fig 7 are shown as the mean plus two standard deviations representing a worst case scenario of uncertain evapotranspiration when evapotranspiration becomes uncertain the predicted de increases shifting the isolines towards higher frequencies and dosages of irrigation as compared to fig 6 when certain and uncertain predictions are compared it is shown that combinations of frequency and dosage give different leaching fraction lf values for example certain predictions in fig 6 at an irrigation of 150 mm with 3 days between irrigation show a lf of 0 14 uncertain predictions in fig 7 show a lf of 0 16 at the same frequency and dosage regarding drought exposure de uncertain predictions have fewer possible combinations of dosage and frequency with de values below 0 01 comparing the model based predictions with the lysimeter experimental data indicated by the symbol and arrow in fig 7 reveals that the irrigation strategy based on experimental data now have a drought exposure of 0 1 so the grower would require to adjust the dosage and or frequency to reduce the drought exposure ratio being able to give advice under uncertainty is decisive because with these model predictions growers can avoid drought exposure even when the evapotranspiration is not certain a grower must select either a more conservative strategy thereby increasing both water use and leaching fraction or a strategy that will increase the ratio of drought exposure given that growers are generally risk averse they are likely to select more conservative strategies additionally economic farm requirements like labour or equipment also play a role in selecting an irrigation strategy therefore it is quite important to consider the uncertainty in the model predictions so growers can receive accurate advice that does not impact negatively these economic requirements for example chrysanthemum growers require a dryer soil surface for certain periods where labour and equipment are used for agricultural practices such as spraying plant protective products removal of old leaves or flower harvest if an uncertain strategy is selected with too few days between irrigation the soil surface will remain wet and the growers will have a hard time performing these agricultural practices 3 5 comparison between clay and sandy soil types 3 5 1 leaching fraction variation the overall mean values of leaching fraction from the three different sandy soil types explored in this study are represented in fig 8 the overall mean leaching fraction values for the clay soils are presented in fig 9 the difference between the overall mean values of sandy soils minus clay soils are presented in fig 10 sandy soils have a slightly higher leaching fraction than clay soils fig 10 the higher total irrigation and longer days between irrigations increase the difference in leaching fraction this increase in leaching fraction difference does play a role when choosing a combination of dosage and frequency for an irrigation strategy but only when high dosages and longer days between irrigation are considered which usually is not the case irrigation strategies normally aim to have a low leaching fraction for example if a grower considers to have a standard leaching fraction value of 0 1 the highest total irrigation would be on sandy soils at 145 mm on frequencies below one day between irrigation fig 8 at that dosage and frequency the highest leaching fraction difference would be 0 008 which is only an 8 variation compared to the leaching fraction of 0 1 this means that the model predictions can be used to give certain irrigation advice regarding leaching fraction for commonly used strategies across different types of soil 3 5 2 drought exposure variation the overall mean drought exposure values from the three different sandy soil types explored in this study are represented in fig 11 the overall mean drought exposure values for the clay soils are presented in fig 12 the difference between the overall mean values of sandy soils minus clay soils are presented in fig 13 a clear relation between the type of soil and drought exposure can be seen overall sandy soils tend to have a higher drought exposure than clay soils this is expected as sandy soils have a higher hydraulic conductivity and lower water holding capacity water availability see e g heinen et al 2021 increasing the possibility of drought on average the studied sandy soils require irrigation frequencies of more than once per 3 days fig 11 there is an interesting response on certain combinations of irrigation frequencies and total irrigation fig 13 looking at different dosage and frequency values two things can be observed first when an irrigation strategy has a high total irrigation above 155 mm the difference in drought exposure between sandy and clay soils becomes close to zero this is because at frequencies less than once per 3 days the water status at the first soil layer never goes below the threshold in both types of soil so the difference is zero as both soils have zero drought exposure second when the total irrigation is below 125 mm and the days between irrigation are above 1 day then the sandy soils present higher drought exposure compared to clay soils for example in fig 13 de difference of 0 1 is present at a total irrigation of 120 mm and days between irrigation below 1 day and it follows a contour along a change in frequency and dosage up to 150 mm at a frequency of 5 days between irrigation this can be explained because for fully grown crops the evapotranspiration rate is approximately the same for both soils but the water flow rate to the second layer is higher in sandy soils increasing the drought exposure compared to clay soils it is interesting that there are combinations of dosage and frequency where the drought exposure difference is zero across multiple types of soil using the model framework predictions for irrigation advice growers can consider these combinations of dosages and frequencies regardless of the type of soil they have however some of these combinations require higher total irrigation dosages which increases soil percolation and in some cases it is not desired 3 6 standard deviation of the mean between soil types 3 6 1 leaching fraction the standard deviation of leaching fraction in clay soils fig 14 and sandy soils fig 15 are shown in this section there is a considerable difference in standard deviation between sandy soils and clay soils the standard deviations in clay soils range from 0 02 to 0 03 for almost all combinations of dosage and frequency fig 15 shows that sandy soils have a high uniformity in standard deviation 0 005 0 01 compared to clay soils an explanation of this difference in standard deviation between soils is that water retention is especially sensitive to the variation in composition of clay soils in clay soils water is held more tightly and moves more slowly through the soil compared to sandy soils the small pores in clay soils allow water to be held tightly whereas the large pores in sandy soils allow water to move through the soil at a higher rate this is quite important as it shows the model is quite certain in leaching fraction predictions especially on sandy soils the highest standard deviation was 0 03 on clay soils this represents a high variation as the mean leaching fraction values at that dosage and frequency was 0 06 this means that predictions from the model will be uncertain when giving irrigation advice on clay soils when using the model framework predictions to give irrigation advice to growers with clay soils growers need to be certain about the specific soil parameters of their soil to reduce the deviation between clay soils 3 6 2 drought exposure the standard deviation of drought exposure in clay soils fig 16 and sandy soils fig 17 are shown in this section considering the standard deviation between the same types of soil can provide insight in how certain or uncertain can the model predictions be with similar types of soil figs 16 and 17 show that there are combinations of dosage and frequency where the predicted drought exposure has a standard deviation below 0 01 making predictions with these combinations highly certain these certain predictions can be traced at frequencies of less than one day between irrigation and total irrigation dosages on clay soils starting above 125 mm and sandy soils starting above 112 mm to maintain these certain predictions at higher days between irrigation it is required to increase the total irrigation a comparison between both soils shows that sandy soils require less total irrigation to maintain the drought exposure deviation below 0 01 up to a sudden increase in required total irrigation at days between irrigation above 3 days another observation is that overall clay soils present less certain predictions compared to sandy soils where values of standard deviation above 0 05 are present in several dosage and frequency combinations compare to almost none in sandy soils this difference in the standard deviation of drought exposure between clay and sandy soils can be explained similarly as the leaching fraction deviation there is more variation in water retention in clay soils than sandy soils as clay soils water retention can vary from different clay soil sources standard deviation of drought exposure can give insight in how certain an irrigation strategy advice can be across a type of soil if growers know they have a crop on a type of soil but are not certain about its specific soil parameters they can use the model framework to plan an irrigation strategy that can avoid this uncertainty also in cases where they have clay soil growers would require to be aware that there is higher deviation in predictions when using some combinations of dosages and frequencies 3 7 limitations and improvements in the model framework the model framework considers drought exposure as the ratio between the amount of hours a crop is under a specific pressure head threshold compared to the total amount of hours however this ratio does not consider if those hours were consecutive or along a specific timeline this means that you can have the same drought exposure prediction if a crop was 48 consecutive hours below the threshold during a 48 day period or if a crop is one hour each day for a 48 day period below the threshold right now we use a simple metric of ratio of hours above a certain threshold but it could be explored as a pattern of drought periods with different intensities in pressure head as well as cumulative number of hours between these drought periods giving a more detailed advice regarding if a crop is stressed or not the model framework uses global radiation to predict evapotranspiration at the same time uncertainty in evapotranspiration is considered as a variation in daily global radiation however once a frequency and dosage is put into the model the irrigation amount does not change even if the global radiation is high between irrigation events this means that between those irrigation events the irrigation might not have been enough it would be interesting to address changes in between irrigation events and see how the model predictions respond to them if we can change the dosing in between irrigation based on variables like cumulative radiation temperature or crop growth then the model can respond in a more dynamic way therefore it could be worthwhile to extend the framework presented here with a method that considers feedback from these variables and adjust the dosage or frequency the experimental data used to verify the model considers a full grown chrysanthemum crop in a 32 day period it would be interesting to use the model framework to estimate the water requirements for a full growing period with the right data and by considering the development stages of the crop one way to accomplish this is by incorporating the crop height as a variable in the model as the crop grows its water requirements change and by adjusting the model parameters accordingly it is possible to obtain estimates of the water needs for the whole growing period for this reason it is advisable to extend this model based approach using data from a whole cropping season and even for multiple cropping seasons using multiple weather data from different regions and multiple crops the de graaf model has a library of different crop factors for different types of crop which can be of interest to verify them with experimental data and it can be even further extended to include models other than de graaf that also provide et calculations another limitation of our model framework is the potential impact of autocorrelation on the generated random evapotranspiration series while we acknowledge that our sampling strategy using one day segments preserved the autocorrelation within a day there may still be some autocorrelation for periods longer than a day that we did not account for in our analysis this might potentially lead to differences between our simulated evapotranspiration data and the actual evapotranspiration values to address this issue future studies could explore alternative sampling strategies or statistical methods that explicitly account for autocorrelation in the data for instance use block resampling techniques to generate multiple random samples of evapotranspiration data that account for the autocorrelation structure of the original data that will help us to better understand the underlying autocorrelation structure of the et data in addition collecting longer term data series with higher temporal resolution can provide us with a more detailed information on how evapotranspiration varies throughout the day and could help to better understand the autocorrelation patterns in the data the model framework assumes a fixed groundwater level as the bottom boundary condition in modelling greenhouse cropping systems is a commonly used approach to simulate conditions that are typically found in areas where groundwater is managed through a drainage system like in the netherlands however this assumption may not always be valid in all situations and its limitations must be acknowledged to ensure that the results of the study are not misinterpreted to address this limitation a possible approach is to incorporate a variable groundwater level in the framework model this would involve using data on groundwater levels from the specific region where the model is being applied and incorporating this data into the model the model would then simulate the actual conditions in the region including fluctuations in groundwater levels which would provide more accurate results additionally as the groundwater is variable it would be interesting to include an uncertainty analysis on the effect this variation on the water interactions between the soil layers and consequently on the model results the model framework considers irrigation to be uniform per square meter area in reality irrigation is seldomly uniform and this can lead to cases where uneven irrigation can cause drought exposure a new interesting approach could be to include sources of water giving at specific point of a studied area and investigate to what extent these spatial variations in irrigation may improve performance predictions of drought exposure leaching and water use efficiency a possible methodology to apply this approach would require to expand the 1d emman3g model to a 2d soil water model that considers water flow not just vertically but also horizontally 4 conclusions the findings of this study provide valuable insights in irrigation strategies the results demonstrate that modifying the dosage and frequency of irrigation can significantly reduce water use and leaching this study also highlights the significant impact of evapotranspiration uncertainty on drought exposure and leaching predictions emphasizing the need for low risk irrigation strategies that consider this uncertainty furthermore this study shows that the shapes of the isolines for both types of soil indicates a high sensitivity of drought exposure ratio towards irrigation frequency particularly for high total dosages this finding suggests that careful consideration of irrigation frequency is crucial to ensure an optimal irrigation and reduce drought exposure this study also points out the impact of soil type on predicted drought exposure and leaching with clay soils showing more variation in these predictions compared to sandy soils finally a visualization of the predictions allows to identify possible combinations of irrigation dosage and leaching fractions and supports growers into being informed about the effects and risks associated with their management decisions this approach is fundamentally different from conventional optimization which involves the computation of a single input strategy the one that optimizes a selected performance criterion declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be

8942,cropping systems in the agro pastoral ecotone ape of shanxi province will face uncertainty over sustainability for dealing with climate risks and providing information regarding adoption of climate resistant cropping systems this study aimed to i calibrate and validate apsim for predicting production of maize zea mays potato solanum tuberosum forage oats avena sativa and feed soybean glycine max ii estimate sensitivity of yield and water productivity wp in response to different precipitation conditions associated with typical seasons iii evaluate changes of food yield caused by given treatments with typical stages results showed that i apsim calibration and validation had generally satisfactory results with 4 09 29 98 of nmrse values ii due to less water retention maize based systems showed lower yield and wp than others by linear regressions maize yield showed high sensitivity with standardized precipitation index spi of stage 1 may and 2 june and july r2 0 0002 0 5176 a 315 94 in drought season while markedly effects of precipitation on wp were presented in stage 1 and 2 for drought and wet season respectively iii the key for moisture demand determining high potato and forage productivity is from emergency to floral initiation therefore yield and wp showed positive relevance with spi in stage 2 in most cases r2 0 0203 0 8391 with absolute a values of 460 29 2746 7 and 0 9687 3 8206 for yield and wp respectively iv food yields under various systems were non significantly lower or higher than the most widely used rotation maize potato but these changes expanded when crops undergoing typical drought in stage 2 by reductions of 3 0 42 5 altogether traditional potato maize rotation and continuous maize should be avoided for mitigating negative effects of drought in stage 1 or 2 while supplementary irrigation in june july and august is warranted for producing acceptable food and forage yield keywords northern agro pastoral ecotone crop yield water

the convergence area of agriculture and animal husbandry in china occupying an important position in water conservation and serving as an ecological barrier chen et al 2021a the area has borne the key responsibilities of feed production and supply of animal products since past decades ren et al 2021 due to the necessity of food guarantee and fulfilling the forage demands of animal husbandry in recent years the nape has tended to maintain the traditional cereal potato solanum tuberosum production system or implement forage crop rotation for ensuring food production including maize zea mays potato solanum tuberosum chen et al 2021b however the use of mechanical equipment is limited in a considerable proportion of the nape e g the agro pastoral ecotone ape in northern shanxi province meanwhile the policy of using groundwater also heightens the limitation of field irrigation regarding the amount and the depth of pumping to keep water sources clean wang et al 2020 thus the cropland in these regions is dominated by semi rainfed agriculture although the annual precipitation and monthly distribution are extremely uneven the above factors make crop production in this region particularly sensitive to weather conditions casting uncertainty over the economic sustainability of food cropping systems among years notably the uncertainty in conditions challenges the stability of land productivity and the use efficiency of limited water supply for reducing waste of concentrated rainfall whereas reasonable management of agricultural water is necessary for the aims of food guarantee and forage demand various research studies related to food forage production have indicated significant agroecological and productivity benefits when optimizing possible adaptations ojiem et al 2014 ojeda et al 2018 peng et al 2022 in particular oats avena sativa and annual legumes have become the most common forages rotating with food crops for formulating schemes of cropping systems aimed to improve drought and heat tolerance and to cope with the local climate in the nape for greater land productivity and water productivity zhang et al 2019 ren et al 2019 indicated that the rotational intercropping system of potato and hairy vetch vicia villosa improved land productivity and system level water productivity under rainfed and semi arid conditions in the nape yao et al 2020 judged that the rotations containing oats and fava beans vicia faba showed better productivity and suitability based on a five year field experiment previous studies also indicated that shifting from food crop rotations to crop forage rotations significantly enhanced grain yield economic profits and energy efficiency under multiple year patterns ojiem et al 2014 zou et al 2021 perceiving a changeable climate and adapting by adjusting crop varieties planting dates and water conservation have been encouraged in the nape nevertheless local farmers have preferred traditional practices and cropping systems and avoided the above practices due to unclear beneficial effects and high costs li et al 2015 implying that the rational planning and field management should be done more delicately for substantially defining and enhancing the benefits of adaptations in food forage production with a higher frequency of extreme weather events and more severe inter annual variability in climate conditions zhang et al 2022 more efficient field management is urgently needed however it is difficult to improve the adaptive capacity for promoting sustainable agricultural development in this region or to correct some ineffective and unsustainable measures e g excessive exploitation of groundwater and over fertilization li et al 2015 which might be evaluated and solved by adequate applications of crop models for effectively evaluating and adjusting field managements under local condition of the nape the multi site studies conducted by tang et al 2021 and tang et al 2022 using agricultural production systems simulator apsim indicated that optimizing limited irrigation could improve yield decline environmental sequence and cope with climate warming for potato based system in the nape another work of utilizing apsim thought that transforming single cropping system to double cropping system could mitigate the sensitivity of crops to climate change and water shortage in the northern shanxi province and illustrated that 50 mm of irrigation for maize sowing is critical gao et al 2019 currently theoretical and applied research for ensuring food and forage production related to the evaluation of how crop productivity and water productivity wp respond to varying weather conditions during different periods remains limited in the ape of northern shanxi taken together the above points imply that systematic investigations are needed to evaluate the impacts of transforming the current food production patterns and variable water conditions on crop productivity in the ape of northern shanxi the overall goal of this study was to assess alternative cropping patterns for water use and crop yield regarding long term benefits especially food productivity under different water supply conditions based on an established process model using both calibration and validation the results will help identify appropriate strategies for improving agricultural water management and assessing possible adaptations attempts to provide guidance for prioritizing adaptation investments therefore the immediate objectives of the current study are to i calibrate and validate apsim for accurately predicting several crop growth processes and soil water content ii estimate the sensitivity of crop yield and water use in response to different precipitation conditions during given stages in typical seasons and iii evaluate whether food production can be maintained under typical climate conditions with switching from the current cropping patterns to forage crop rotation in the ape of northern shanxi province 2 materials and methods 2 1 site information the experimental site of this study was a typical area of the nape the youyu loess plateau grassland ecosystem research

21 clay in the top 0 20 cm 41 sand and 27 clay in 20 120 cm and the groundwater depth is below 12 m the irrigation water supply is often come from tap water due to the policy of protecting groundwater wang et al 2020 resulting in a limited utilization of field irrigation 2 2 field experiment fig 2 showed the workflow of this study field experiment was conducted during 2020 2021 comprising five rotational systems and a continuous monoculture the five rotations were as follows mo maize forage oats ms maize feed soybean glycine max po potato forage oats ps potato feed soybean and pm potato maize the one continuous system was maize monoculture each rotation contained two sequences planting the first sequence i and second sequence ii crops for each rotation in 2020 and the subsequent crop in 2021 for example mo 1 and mo 2 planted maize and forage oats in 2020 respectively each treatment was replicated three times in a randomized block design with 36 plots 30 plots for five rotations with two sequences and six plots for maize monoculture and left fallow table 1 each plot was 4 m 13 m 52 m2 in area the crops were artificially planted and harvested each season disk tillage was

potassium sulfate disulfide group compound fertilizer was applied for feed soybean before planting sprinkling irrigation was implemented with 85 and 50 mm for 2020 and 2021 respectively after harvesting the crop stalks and leaf residues were all removed from the field above applied crop managements were the common forming practices in the ape of northern shanxi the dry matter aboveground biomass grain yield for maize in r6 and forage yield deemed as dry matter aboveground biomass in feekes 11 1 and r3 for forage oats and feed soybean respectively in 2020 2021 were determined using oven drying of three randomly selected quadrat samples from within each plot measured as 0 45 0 25 and 0 25 m2 for maize forage oats and feed soybean respectively the dry matter aboveground biomass and dry tuber yield of potato was determined when mature from three randomly selected quadrat samples 0 54 m2 in each plot using the specific gravity method vakis 1979 in addition the dry matter biomass was also observed in vt feekes 10 1 r1 and early tuber for maize forage oats feed soybean and potato respectively the gravimetric soil water storage 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and 100 120 cm was measured by oven drying at sowing and harvesting and recorded at least once per month soil no3 n soil nh4 n and soil organic carbon were determined at sowing and harvesting using seven layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and 100 120 cm the key parameters of the equilibrium evaporation concept in apsim u and cona priestley and tylor 1972 jones and kiniry 1986 were measured using artificial rain method values of u and cona were 7 4 and 3 7 respectively daily precipitation mm maximum temperature c minimum temperature c and daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 during 2020 2021 was recorded by a long term maintenance automatic weather station in the research station 2 3 model calibration apsim ver 7 10 available at www apsim info in conjunction with crop modules apsim maize apsim potato apsim oats and apsim soybean was used to simulate crop development and production in this study the crop parameters of the four local cultivars lihe228 maize xisen6 potato haymaker forage oats and mudanjiang feed soybean were obtained based on the field observations during 2020 using trial and error method table 3 the key soil parameters table 4 of seven layers 0 10 10 20 20 0 40 60 60 80 80 100 and 100 120 cm were calculated by soil particle composition using the methods described by saxton and rawls 2006 soil organic carbon was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer vario toc in may 2020 before sowing the crops meanwhile soil no3 n and nh4 n were measured by autoanalyzer 3 seal analytical gmbh norderstedt germany the root exploration factor xf of 0 100 and 100 120 cm was set to 1 0 and 0 8 respectively peng et al 2022 apsim simulations were performed separately for 2020 calibration and 2021 validation the performance statistics were calculated based on the data collected from the field experiment component refer to section 2 2 and the corresponding simulated values derived from daily apsim simulations including maize grain yield potato tuber yield aboveground biomass for each crop and soil water storage 0 120 cm the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse 0 100 and willmott agreement index d 1 were calculated as 1 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o

respectively n represents the number of observations the lower values of rmse and nrmse represented lower deviations of apsim simulations while the value of d quantified the model s accuracy for estimating the trend upward or downward 2 4 model application 2 4 1 climate scenario generation the climate scenarios used in this study were generated based on the historical data of youyu county during 1980 2009 obtained from the cma the data included daily precipitation mm maximum temperature c minimum temperature c and sunshine hours h the data of daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 were calculated from sunshine hours using the angstrom equation wang et al 2015 the general growing season of the study site from may to september was divided into three stages in this study pre sowing to crop germination stage 1 may vegetative growth phase stage 2 june to july and reproductive growth phase stage 3 august to september then the values of standardized precipitation index spi were calculated for each stage from 1980 to 2009 data 30 years fig 2 the spi which shows the deviation extent of precipitation in a certain period compared with the long term historical average level is often used to examine the applicability of the water supply conditions at different timescales mckee et al 1993 the formula for calculating spi is based on the density and a gamma probability function zuo et al 2021 4 g x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β in eq 4 α represents the shape parameter α 0 β represents the scale parameter β 0 determined by maximum likelihood meanwhile x is the precipitation amount this varies with α and β the assigned values are normalized and transformed to standard normal distributions i e mean zero and variance one more detailed calculation procedures and classification of spi were described by mckee et al 1993 and zuo et al 2021 the precipitation in stage 1 2 and 3 during 1980 2009 showed p 0 05 in the kolmogorov smirnov test representing that the data obeys gamma probability function spi values for the three stages in the current study were generated by the spi generator developed by the national drought mitigation center https drought unl edu university of nebraska lincoln unl a negative spi value means drought conditions on the tested time scale while a positive spi value represents relatively wet conditions afterward each stage was classified into drought normal or wet patterns according to the spi by measuring the spi values we choose the typical drought normal and wet patterns from the classification of 30 yr for divided stages shown in table 5 the scenario generations were developed by two methods that we refer to as scenario simulation i and ii fig 2 scenario simulation i ssi the daily climate data 1980 2009 of a given stage 1 2 or 3 were retained following the 30 yr historical data of general growing seasons while the data of the other two stages were replaced by the typical drought normal or wet pattern as shown in fig 3 with an example this is referred to as ssi hereafter comprising nine total climate scenarios totally there were 3 typical conditions 3 stages 9 climate scenarios in ssi which is a matrix style the ssi dataset allowed us to assess the responses to cropping systems derived from the changes in specific stages in typical drought normal or wet seasons scenario simulation ii ssii ssii was conducted considering that ssi fails to represent the effects of typical conditions during stage 1 2 or 3 on crop yield we created nine scenarios by replacing daily climate data of stage 1 2 or 3 from the typical data drought normal or wet during 30 general growing seasons while the historical data were retained for the other two stages as shown in fig 3 with an example similar to ssi there were nine climate scenarios in ssii the data set of ssii also allowed us to assess the potential yield changes of food crops maize and potato caused by cropping systems and typical climate conditions in different stages 2 4 2 simulation setting the five rotations and one continuous system were simulated based on the scenarios of both ssi and ssii fig 2 rotations were simulated by two different sequences that were initialed with the first or second crop with a requirement for accumulated precipitation 10 mm in five days for sowing each crop had a specific sowing time window may 15th to 25th or sowing on the latest date of may 25th table 2 lists the planting density plant space row space and harvest date for ensuring the optimum crop growth without n limitation 320 kg n ha 1 was applied at each sowing event in the simulations the initial soil water storage was set at 80 of field capacity for each soil layer to remove any bias based on previous soil conditions table 4 according to the local customary conditions irrigation of 50 mm was implemented once per season at sowing for both crops the initial no3 n nh4 n and soc levels were set according to table 4 while the crop residuals were all removed from the fields in the simulations 2 4 3 results generation and synthesis the effects of treatments and climate scenarios were investigated based on the outputs of apsim simulations for ssi we focused on investigating the effects of different climate conditions from 30 years of historical data in specific stages on crop productivity therefore linear regressions were conducted between crop yields water productivity wp and spi values of given stages for both scenarios in ssi for example maize grain yield and forage oats yield in the mo treatment were regressed with the spi values from historical conditions in stage 1 under hs1 scenarios hs1 drought hs1 normal and hs1 wet as well as regressed with spi in stage 2 under hs2 scenarios hs2 drought hs2 normal and hs2 wet the above analysis would yield insights into how climate conditions in stage 1 2 or 3 affected the yield of different treatments in the typical drought normal and wet years wp was calculated as 5 w p y w s 6 w s g s p s w i s w t in eqs 5 and 6 y represents grain yield ws represents the water supply for a single growing season and gsp is growing season precipitation swi and swt are soil water storage at sowing and harvesting respectively 0 120 cm soil layer the land in the study site is smooth while the groundwater is deep and hard to supply to the 0 120 cm soil layer thus the surface runoff and water uptake from the bottom were neglected in calculating ws for ssii we focused on the variation in food yield caused by treatments and typical climates in given stages notably the main food crops in yanmenguan are maize and potato that are often rotated with each other or some cereals in this region in our case the crop yield of potato maize rotation pm under the baseline scenario was chosen as the base data in ssii coding as a b means the food yields of other rotations containing maize or potato described in table 1 cm mo ms for maize po and ps for potato under the baseline scenario while c means the yields of pm under nine generated scenarios of ssii fig 3 similarly d represents the food yields of cm mo ms po and ps under the nine generated scenarios finally the values of b a c a and d a were calculated to comprehensively assess the effects of cropping systems and typical conditions in a given stage 1 2 or 3 on long term food productivity in the ape of northern shanxi and to deduce possible adaptation options 2 5 data analysis data analyses were performed by ibm spss statistics edition 19 0 software including the linear regressions y ax b between crop yield wp and spi values the independent variable x and dependent variable y for conducting linear regressions were spi values of given stages stage 1 2 or 3 and crop yield wp respectively the crop yield wp and food yield changes b a c a and d a were compared among scenarios for ssi and ssii separately while the analysis of variance based anova mean separation was performed using the duncan multi range test the annual values from 30 years in a scenario simulation were considered repeated measures in the anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 field experiment data the results of the field experiment presented decreases in maize grain yield and potato tuber yield in 2021 compared with 2020 43 1 47 6 and 19 1 34 6 respectively p 0 01 table 6 this difference was primarily caused by the inter annual variation in precipitation during august and september stage 3 that showed 311 and 133 mm for 2020 and 2021 respectively however the forage yields of oats and feed soybean in 2021 were improved by 23 2 30 4 and 21 3 31 5 respectively table 6 this was probably caused by the markedly higher precipitation in june and july stage 2 in 2021 95 6 mm compared to 2020 63 4 mm therefore the field measured results showed that changing precipitation in stages 2 and 3 introduced contrasting effects on food yield and forage yield implying the necessity to investigate how crops respond to the precipitation pattern during different stages otherwise the statistical analysis of the field measured yield 2020 2021 did not present significant differences between treatments rotations and monoculture p 0 05 possibly due to the limited term of the field experiment field measured data also indicated that forage oats consumed more water in july and august for late august the soil water contents 0 120 cm in oats plots were 10 4 25 0 and 38 8 mm lower than for other crop plots and fallow plots data not shown for late september maize plots showed the lowest level of soil water content therefore for the entire growing season maize would consume more water than other crops under the conditions of the study region 3 2 model calibration and validation 3 2 1 aboveground biomass and crop yield this study calibrated and validated four sub modules with several key parameters table 3 during a two year field experiment located at the youyu loess plateau grassland ecosystem research station of shanxi province apsim simulated the biomass production of the four crops maize potato forage oats and soybean by rmse of 323 1946 and 324 2289 kg ha 1 for calibration 2020 and validation 2021 respectively accounting for 4 40 15 84 of the mean observation nrmse details listed in table 7 meanwhile the largest differences in nrmse between calibration and validation were observed in forage oat biomass due to 11 41 17 69 underestimation in 2021 the d values for biomass in calibration and validation ranged from 0 9815 to 0 9987 and from 0 9106 to 0 9877 respectively indicating the accuracy in predicting biomass dynamic changes for maize grain yield although rmse and nrmse were only 418 627 kg ha 1 and 4 09 11 15 respectively d values seemed not to reach a satisfactory level being 0 2049 and 0 3773 for calibration and validation respectively for potato tuber yield however rmse nrmse and d values of 324 1222 kg ha 1 3 74 9 95 and 0 5537 0 9182 respectively were obtained table 7 due to maize grain yield showing nom significant differences between treatments in field observations calibration and validation apsim did not define clear differences caused by treatments in the current study low values of d pointed that trial and error method of calibration using one yr of field observation still showed subsequent problems in model performance though the methodology was considered as approved and credible ahmed et al 2016 larger and more robust datasets should be utilized in further research for better calibration for conducting sustainable model calibration and application the modelled errors also could to be partly derived by another reason judged by former study apsim could not simulate the harms of pest and disease incidence on crops due to its framework therefore apsim simulation often represents a well regulated management condition causing overestimation of biomass production ojeda et al 2016 in summary apsim predict the production of these four crops maize potato forage oats and feed soybean well in most cases fig s1 and could be a useful tool for evaluating the crop productivity via scenario analysis li et al 2022 however there was a certain trend seen in underestimating maize forage oats and feed soybean biomass on average by 4 86 4 49 and 3 28 and overestimating the aboveground biomass of potato by 15 84 apsim managed to capture the variation of the biomass production and yield of the four crops in response to different years in the ape of northern shanxi though markedly different conditions were showed between 2020 and 2021 3 2 2 soil water storage soil water storage during 2020 2021 indicated good agreement between simulated and measured data in both calibration and validation for the 0 120 cm soil layer the rmse values for calibration and validation were 7 1 and 9 8 mm respectively accounting for 5 19 7 11 of the mean observation values of d were 0 9057 and 0 6231 for calibration and validation respectively dividing the soil depth into 0 20 surface layer and 20 120 cm deeper layer d values were 0 5249 0 7147 and 0 6806 0 8690 respectively table 7 meanwhile the results showed generally acceptable nrmse for the two depths 5 65 28 64 and 9 08 29 98 for calibration and validation respectively indicating that apsim simulated soil water dynamics well in the ape of northern shanxi for the current study the simulated deviations of the surface layer were larger than those for the deeper layer as shown by higher nrmse and lower d values table 7 fig s2 naturally soil water storage is dramatically changed in the surface layer and thus harder to precisely predicted chaki et al 2022 a previous study pointed that due to the lagging responses of apsim water infiltration and distribution might show non negligible simulated deviations during frequent rainy days elli et al 2020 another study ojeda et al 2018 found that soil plant models fail to consistently describe soil water dynamics in shallow soils but present good ability in simulating the dynamics in deep soil or the soil water conditions with relatively moderate changes it is also worth noting that there was some limitation in saxton s equations leading to inaccurately estimated soil parameters and limited representativeness of actual soil conditions abbasi et al 2011 generally speaking however the metrics of calibration and validation suggested that apsim was able to estimate soil water dynamics in study area peake et al 2014 while the accuracy of soil water dynamics as well as the biomass synthesis rates are needed to be continuously calibrated and examined in further studies 3 3 results of baseline scenario in comparison with pm mo and ms maize grain yield and wp in the cm treatment were the lowest in the baseline scenario with the greatest annual variation averages 7719 kg ha 1 and 3 83 kg ha 1 mm 1 for grain yield and wp respectively fig 4 indicating low annual food output for traditional cereal monoculture potato tuber yield in the baseline scenario did not differ significantly with treatments p 0 05 fig 4 while the pm treatment presented markedly lower potato wp 34 63 kg ha 1 mm 1 than po and ps between pm and ps p 0 05 especially for drought seasons yields of forage oats and feed soybean averaged 7 57 7 71 lower when rotating with maize mo and ms compared to potato po and ps p 0 05 however wp values of these two crops were relatively close in different treatments fig 4 the results of this study showed smooth changes in forage yield in response to different water consumption levels of previous crops further demonstrating the superiority of water use via vegetative mass production 3 4 results of ssi 3 4 1 crop yield and wp in ssi similar to the baseline scenario 1980 2009 crop yield and wp of food crops maize and potato in ssi received better values when rotating with forages mo ms po and ps hs1 w presented the highest mean maize yield of 9496 620 9509 627 kg ha 1 although normal maize seasons tend to greatly improve wp in most cases table 8 potato showed the highest tuber yield with values of 13106 961 13878 190 kg ha 1 in hs1 scenarios while the wp showed negative effects derived from an increased water supply that progressively decreased with the regular progression of drought normal wet seasons table 8 compared with mo and ms in most cases po and ps had average increases of 0 3234 and 4 1601 kg ha 1 for forage oats and feed soybean yield respectively table 8 in addition rotation with potato po and ps also averagely yielded 0 87 5 23 kg ha 1 mm 1 greater wp for forage oats and feed soybean in drought normal seasons than mo and ms except for hs2 n that obtained very similar soybean wp between different rotations table 8 in summary the crops in maize based rotations led to yield losses that may have been due to less water retention before planting and semi rainfed conditions ojiem et al 2014 additionally the data of cm also supported the above issue in this study a continuous maize system could be deemed as a rotation of maize maize 3 4 2 linear relationships between crop yield wp and spi in ssi in general the results showed that maize grain yield was noticeably affected by the spi in stage 1 may in drought seasons r2 ranged from 0 2409 to 0 4037 p 0 01 with a values 527 84 table 9 the effect of precipitation in stage 1 hs1 w on maize yield was also highly significant in wet seasons except for the cm treatment table 9 for stage 2 june and july the relationship between spi and maize grain yield was estimated to be markedly stronger in normal seasons hs2 n r2 values were 0 2615 0 5176 p 0 01 a 1034 5 however spi of stage 3 august and september confirmed no strong relationship connected with maize yield in both treatments for maize wp the linear regressions associated with spi in hs1 d were similar to those for grain yield showing that the water supply before maize sowing was very important for maize grain yield in drought seasons implying negative effects of rainless winters on maize production under both rotational and monoculture patterns in successive seasons wang et al 2021 for the other eight scenarios only hs2 w the precipitation of stage 2 in wet season hs2 w showed a markedly negative relationship with maize wp r2 0 3776 0 4378 p 0 001 a 1 2315 table 10 notably maize yield and wp tended to be more affected by rainfall from jointing to tasseling generally in june and july in normal seasons tables 9 and 10 this period is also the key of daily matter accumulation and use of supplied water and easily affected by varied water condition indicating higher climate risk for traditional continuous maize than rotations yang et al 2020 above results reminded us that i maize crop in drought wet seasons showed relatively low high productivity despite water fluctuation in a given stage ii enhancing water supply in stage 2 could significantly improved productivity and sustainability of maize especially in normal seasons with about 306 mm of precipitation from may to september table 5 potato tuber yield was highly related to spi in stage 2 hs2 scenarios for both treatments r2 reached 0 3586 0 5757 p 0 001 indicating that precipitation in june and july generally emergence to the stage of early tuber had the largest effects on potato tuber yield mthembu et al 2022 judged that potato aboveground biomass accumulation after sowing would be the key for moisture demand determining high tuber yield in the current study area the general aboveground biomass accumulation period before tuberization june and july almost accounted half of potato growing season while insufficient inopportune water supply in this period might receive markedly risk and result in loss of tuber yield tang et al 2018 e g a season with wet july and a relatively drought june in study site naturally above effects were relatively milder in wet seasons lower values of a compared with hs2 d and hs2 n table 9 due to higher water supply for hs1 w though a noticeable relationship between potato yield and spi was observed r2 0 2428 the low a values 91 213 91 195 did not indicate marked effects of precipitation in stage 1 table 9 hs1 w and hs2 w had relatively high r2 values 0 2591 0 3722 with p 0 01 table 10 and were negatively related to potato wp a ranged from 0 7666 to 0 7687 meanwhile for hs3 scenarios potato wp tended to indicate relatively strong negative relationships with spi in stage 3 table 10 the above results indicated that wp of potato could not be substantially improved by the enhanced water supply since pre sowing in most cases in the study area and therefore more irrigation was not recommended before sowing in the study area tang et al 2021 potato yield wp in pm was also markedly related to spi in stage 2 to a certain extent r2 ranged from 0 1988 to 0 5757 in most cases p 0 05 and there were positive relationships between wp and spi found in hs2 d and hs2 n with a of 1 9085 2 7810 the above results also reflected the relatively poor water conditions before potato planting when rotating with maize gao et al 2019 further reminding us that irrigation in stage 2 could significantly improve potato tuber yield and water use spi in stage 2 was significantly positively related p 0 001 to the forage yields of oats and feed soybean in drought normal and wet seasons r2 0 4102 0 8391 a 1125 6 2746 7 table 9 above implied that stage 2 june and july was the most sensitive stage from emergency to floral initiation to water supply for forage biomass accumulation which was the period with high potential growth rates for the plants mbangiwa et al 2019 hakala et al 2020 thus accidental drought or heavy precipitation events in stage 2 would influence forage yield to a certain extent for stage 1 only hs1 d presented a relatively strong relationship between spi and forage yields with r2 values of 0 1754 0 4443 a 255 69 1259 8 p 0 05 while forage wp was even negatively affected by the spi in stage 1 in wet seasons r2 0 4885 0 6672 a raged from 2 6116 to 0 9297 p 0 001 table 10 with these results the water supply before sowing also showed notable effects on forage yields in drought seasons while 50 mm per year irrigation seems to be generally enough for forages in normal or wet seasons as these forages showed greater climate adaptability than food crops similar to the linear regressions between forage yield and spi results showed that forage wp was positively related to the spi in stage 2 with r2 of 0 2007 0 5328 and a of 1 1640 3 8206 p 0 01 table 10 this indicated that the forages are undergoing water stress in the study area due to potential demands of growth therefore we could advocate that the relatively high water supply in june and july could cope with forage growth exerting potential water productivity with suitable timing of the water supply zhang et al 2017 notably wp of forages in mo and ms presented r2 values of 0 2127 0 2529 p 0 05 and was positively related to spi in hs1 d a 1 0858 1 9031 implying a greater water risk for forages when rotating with maize crops due to water demand and consumption of maize ojeda et al 2018 results of ssi estimated the how crop yield and wp of several treatments in response to varied water conditions during different stages in typical seasons however concerning daily analysis of crop development was not the keynote of this study which should be extracted and analyzed in further work for providing effective insights on plant growth and yield formation in the local condition of study area 3 5 food yield maize and potato changes in ssii 3 5 1 food yield changes for b a the mean b a values ranged from 7712 to 281 kg ha 1 and from 297 to 330 kg ha 1 for maize and potato yield respectively fig 5 though some cases showed significant discrepancies between treatments maize and potato yields were not changed markedly between treatments under the baseline scenario cm showed a relatively lower b a value compared with other treatments 776 kg ha 1 indicating low sustainability of continuous maize from another angle 3 5 2 food yield changes for c a generated scenarios presented relatively large changes in c a compared with b a the scenarios of ts3 typical drought normal and wet scenario tended to result in higher food yields than corresponding ts1 and ts2 scenarios in most cases the differences were between 277 and 869 kg ha 1 these results implied that undergoing drought during august september led to relatively insignificant negative effects on maize and potato yield previous studies judged that the principal factors causing slow growth in the late season and finally affecting maize grain yield were attributable to the deficits of temperature and solar radiation gao et al 2018 in addition though another study indicated that limited late season water supply did not significantly affect the growth of potato tuber lerna and mauromicale 2022 but ts3 wet showed 1176 and 1757 kg ha 1 of mean c a in ssii for yield of maize and potato respectively implying that high water supply in stage 3 still present significant benefits on food yield p 0 05 additionally the food yield of pm treatment was maximally decreased when stage 2 suffering drought conditions ts2 drought showing significant limitation in plant growth due to scanty supply of water with extreme values of 9105 and 4273 kg ha 1 and average values of 1973 and 1620 kg ha 1 for maize and potato respectively compared with stage 2 typical drought conditions in stage 1 ts1 drought mitigated the reduction of mean yield by 1061 and 467 kg ha 1 for maize and potato respectively these results indicated that the negative effects of drought in may were lower than those from drought in june july on food yield possibly caused by the 50 mm of irrigation during crop sowing thus we could speculate that under the current production conditions and in a typical climate year a drought in stage 2 june to july would be the greatest challenge to the common crops and patterns of food production wang et al 2019 however the irrigated conditions in this region are limited and cannot ensure the extra water supply after crop sowing leading inevitably to risk in food production 3 5 3 food yield changes for d a finally the values of d a treatments and climate scenarios showed relatively large differences compared with b a fig 5 implying that drought or wet conditions in given stages could expand the impacts of treatments on food yield for maize cm mo and ms the typical drought and even normal climate conditions of stage 2 could decrease grain yield drastically in most cases due to unsatisfactory water supply for rapid daily growth showing mean changes of 3283 2384 and 558 kg ha 1 42 5 30 9 7 2 for cm mo and ms in ts2 drgouht and 1659 825 and 109 kg ha 1 from 21 5 to 1 4 for cm mo and ms in ts2 normal however ts2 wet only provided 317 359 kg ha 1 of mean yield benefits d a for maize the ts1 and ts3 suffering drought and normal conditions also reduced maize grain yield in cm and mo but lesser than in ts2 scenarios from 1569 to 384 kg ha 1 fig 5 above results indicated that drought in june july for cm and mo would cause the highest risk to maize yield moreover stages 1 and 2 with normal precipitation conditions still showed yield reduction for maize yield compared with b a c a and d a for maize indicated that i the natural precipitation condition of the preceding growing season for this region cannot meet the demand of maize grain productivity in most cases despite yearly patterns especially for the cm treatment ii for avoiding useless water input and maintaining maize vegetative growth small amounts of irrigation several times are recommended from pre planting to emergence and flowering period generally in august instead of one time large amount irrigation amarasingha et al 2017 iii food yield of ms treatment was comparatively high and stable due to the lower water cost of feed soybean ignoring the forage yield we also found that d a in ssii showed more stable values for potato yield compared with maize fig 5 the results were consistent with c a po and ps were maximally decreased and increased under ts2 drought and ts3 wet respectively while d a of ts1 and ts3 showed similar values compared with c a in particular d a values were slightly higher average 0 1261 kg ha 1 than those of c a indicating that po and ps showed better resistance to climate change compared with pm due to the higher water cost for maize compared with the forages discussed in section 3 4 otherwise it should be noted that d a values of po and ps in ts2 drought were 1170 1372 and 359 1521 kg ha 1 average 9 8 and 3 0 fig 5 respectively and these were significant differences p 0 05 the results revealed that when suffering severe drought in stage 2 the potato plants rotated with oats might face higher risk lower tuber yield with higher annual variation than when rotating with feed soybean the reason for this would be the higher available water retention and potential crop n responses of previous soybean production of ms treatment bell et al 2022 moreover excluding the conditions with water depletion the ample water supply in stage 3 tended to yield markdly benefits in food production that were largely caused by high potential evapotranspiration from maize flowering to grain filling seyoum et al 2018 as well as from potato tuber growth to senescence lerna and mauromicale 2022 altogether avoiding rotation with forage oats in the seasons with drought in june july helped enhance potential potato tuber yield supplementing water via irrigation in august flowering period or drought normal stage 2 could effectively stabilize food productivity in the ape of northern shanxi province ssii provided data references and information in evaluating long term food productivity for different cropping systems and seasons but comprehensive consideration in actual demand of food forages and future climate changing are still need to be conducted 4 conclusions combination of field experiment and calibrated model would contribute to improving understanding of productivity and resource use in response to certain climate conditions offering comprehensive assessments for strategic decision making processes to summarize the results of apsim calibration and validation showed that the model was able to predict the yields of maize potato forage oats and feed soybean in the ape of northern shanxi and could generally describe the soil water balance components due to less water retention before planting and semi rainfed conditions the long term scenario simulations based on ssi and six cropping systems showed that crop yield and wp tended to be lower in maize based systems than in others in typical seasons especially for forages maize yield showed higher sensitivity with the water condition in stage 1 and 2 than in stage 3 while key effects of precipitation on maize wp were presented in stage 1 and 2 for drought and wet season respectively importantly potato biomass accumulation after sowing would be the key for moisture demand determining high tuber yield while the potential water demands of forages seemed not to fulfill in study area causing significant positive relevance between crop yield wp of potato forage oats and feed soybean and spi in stage 2 in most cases naturally such relationships were relatively milder in wet seasons ssii presented that the b a values for maize and potato were negative and positive respectively specifically maize in cm showed 482 495 kg ha 1 lower b a values than others c a and d a suggested that drought or wet condition in given stages expanded the impacts of treatments on food yield while undergoing droughts in stage 2 would be the greatest challenge to food guarantee with a mean reductions of 7 2 42 5 and 3 0 9 8 for maize and potato yield respectively the precipitation condition cannot meet the demand of maize grain productivity despite yearly patterns resulting in relatively unstable productivity droughts in stage 1 or 3 did not significantly reduce food yield during 30 yr but a wet stage 3 tended to present significant food yield benefits which largely caused by high potential evapotranspiration from maize flowering to grain filling and potato tuber growth to senescence noticeably the low water demand and potential crop n responses of feed soybean afford comparatively high food productivity with ignoring forage yield overall we advocate that the traditional patterns of continuous maize and potato maize rotation should be shifted to mitigate the negative effects of rainless winters on crop productivity cope with the droughts in may june july and fully utilize growth characteristics of different crops potato is more suitable than maize rotated with forages in the ape of northern shanxi province meanwhile supplementary irrigation is warranted in june july or august to moderate the

expanded when crops undergoing typical drought in stage 2 by reductions of 3 0 42 5 altogether traditional potato maize rotation and continuous maize should be avoided for mitigating negative effects

productivity standardized precipitation index generated climate scenarios data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the northern agro pastoral ecotone nape is the convergence area of agriculture and animal husbandry in china occupying an important position in water conservation and serving as an ecological barrier chen et al 2021a the area has borne the key responsibilities of feed production and supply of animal products since past decades ren et al 2021 due to the necessity of food guarantee and fulfilling the forage demands of animal husbandry in recent years the nape has tended to maintain the traditional cereal potato solanum tuberosum production system or implement forage crop rotation for ensuring food production including maize zea mays potato solanum tuberosum chen et al 2021b however the use of mechanical equipment is limited in a considerable proportion of the nape e g the agro pastoral ecotone ape in northern shanxi province meanwhile the policy of using groundwater also heightens the limitation of field irrigation regarding the amount and the depth of pumping to keep water sources clean wang et al 2020 thus the cropland in these regions is dominated by semi rainfed agriculture although the annual precipitation and monthly distribution are extremely uneven the above factors make crop production in this region particularly sensitive to weather conditions casting uncertainty over the economic sustainability of food cropping systems among years notably the uncertainty in conditions challenges the stability of land productivity and the use efficiency of limited water supply for reducing waste of concentrated rainfall whereas reasonable management of agricultural water is necessary for the aims of food guarantee and forage demand various research studies related to food forage production have indicated significant agroecological and productivity benefits when optimizing possible adaptations ojiem et al 2014 ojeda et al 2018 peng et al 2022 in particular oats avena sativa and annual legumes have become the most common forages rotating with food crops for formulating schemes of cropping systems aimed to improve drought and heat tolerance and to cope with the local climate in the nape for greater land productivity and water productivity zhang et al 2019 ren et al 2019 indicated that the rotational intercropping system of potato and hairy vetch vicia villosa improved land productivity and system level water productivity under rainfed and semi arid conditions in the nape yao et al 2020 judged that the rotations containing oats and fava beans vicia faba showed better productivity and suitability based on a five year field experiment previous studies also indicated that shifting from food crop rotations to crop forage rotations significantly enhanced grain yield economic profits and energy efficiency under multiple year patterns ojiem et al 2014 zou et al 2021 perceiving a changeable climate and adapting by adjusting crop varieties planting dates and water conservation have been encouraged in the nape nevertheless local farmers have preferred traditional practices and cropping systems and avoided the above practices due to unclear beneficial effects and high costs li et al 2015 implying that the rational planning and field management should be done more delicately for substantially defining and enhancing the benefits of adaptations in food forage production with a higher frequency of extreme weather events and more severe inter annual variability in climate conditions zhang et al 2022 more efficient field management is urgently needed however it is difficult to improve the adaptive capacity for promoting sustainable agricultural development in this region or to correct some ineffective and unsustainable measures e g excessive exploitation of groundwater and over fertilization li et al 2015 which might be evaluated and solved by adequate applications of crop models for effectively evaluating and adjusting field managements under local condition of the nape the multi site studies conducted by tang et al 2021 and tang et al 2022 using agricultural production systems simulator apsim indicated that optimizing limited irrigation could improve yield decline environmental sequence and cope with climate warming for potato based system in the nape another work of utilizing apsim thought that transforming single cropping system to double cropping system could mitigate the sensitivity of crops to climate change and water shortage in the northern shanxi province and illustrated that 50 mm of irrigation for maize sowing is critical gao et al 2019 currently theoretical and applied research for ensuring food and forage production related to the evaluation of how crop productivity and water productivity wp respond to varying weather conditions during different periods remains limited in the ape of northern shanxi taken together the above points imply that systematic investigations are needed to evaluate the impacts of transforming the current food production patterns and variable water conditions on crop productivity in the ape of northern shanxi the overall goal of this study was to assess alternative cropping patterns for water use and crop yield regarding long term benefits especially food productivity under different water supply conditions based on an established process model using both calibration and validation the results will help identify appropriate strategies for improving agricultural water management and assessing possible adaptations attempts to provide guidance for prioritizing adaptation investments therefore the immediate objectives of the current study are to i calibrate and validate apsim for accurately predicting several crop growth processes and soil water content ii estimate the sensitivity of crop yield and water use in response to different precipitation conditions during given stages in typical seasons and iii evaluate whether food production can be maintained under typical climate conditions with switching from the current cropping patterns to forage crop rotation in the ape of northern shanxi province 2 materials and methods 2 1 site information the experimental site of this study was a typical area of the nape the youyu loess plateau grassland ecosystem research

21 clay in the top 0 20 cm 41 sand and 27 clay in 20 120 cm and the groundwater depth is below 12 m the irrigation water supply is often come from tap water due to the policy of protecting groundwater wang et al 2020 resulting in a limited utilization of field irrigation 2 2 field experiment fig 2 showed the workflow of this study field experiment was conducted during 2020 2021 comprising five rotational systems and a continuous monoculture the five rotations were as follows mo maize forage oats ms maize feed soybean glycine max po potato forage oats ps potato feed soybean and pm potato maize the one continuous system was maize monoculture each rotation contained two sequences planting the first sequence i and second sequence ii crops for each rotation in 2020 and the subsequent crop in 2021 for example mo 1 and mo 2 planted maize and forage oats in 2020 respectively each treatment was replicated three times in a randomized block design with 36 plots 30 plots for five rotations with two sequences and six plots for maize monoculture and left fallow table 1 each plot was 4 m 13 m 52 m2 in area the crops were artificially planted and harvested each season disk tillage was

potassium sulfate disulfide group compound fertilizer was applied for feed soybean before planting sprinkling irrigation was implemented with 85 and 50 mm for 2020 and 2021 respectively after harvesting the crop stalks and leaf residues were all removed from the field above applied crop managements were the common forming practices in the ape of northern shanxi the dry matter aboveground biomass grain yield for maize in r6 and forage yield deemed as dry matter aboveground biomass in feekes 11 1 and r3 for forage oats and feed soybean respectively in 2020 2021 were determined using oven drying of three randomly selected quadrat samples from within each plot measured as 0 45 0 25 and 0 25 m2 for maize forage oats and feed soybean respectively the dry matter aboveground biomass and dry tuber yield of potato was determined when mature from three randomly selected quadrat samples 0 54 m2 in each plot using the specific gravity method vakis 1979 in addition the dry matter biomass was also observed in vt feekes 10 1 r1 and early tuber for maize forage oats feed soybean and potato respectively the gravimetric soil water storage 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and 100 120 cm was measured by oven drying at sowing and harvesting and recorded at least once per month soil no3 n soil nh4 n and soil organic carbon were determined at sowing and harvesting using seven

using artificial rain method values of u and cona were 7 4 and 3 7 respectively daily precipitation mm maximum temperature c minimum temperature c and daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 during 2020 2021 was recorded by a long term maintenance automatic weather station in the research station 2 3 model calibration apsim ver 7 10 available at www apsim info in conjunction with crop modules apsim maize apsim potato apsim oats and apsim soybean was used to simulate crop development and production in this study the crop parameters of the four local cultivars lihe228 maize xisen6 potato haymaker forage oats and mudanjiang feed soybean were obtained based on the field observations during 2020 using trial and error method table 3 the key soil parameters table 4 of seven layers 0 10 10 20 20 0 40 60 60

in may 2020 before sowing the crops meanwhile soil no3 n and nh4 n were measured by autoanalyzer 3 seal analytical gmbh norderstedt germany the root exploration factor xf of 0 100 and 100 120 cm was set to 1 0 and 0 8 respectively peng et al 2022 apsim simulations were performed separately for 2020 calibration and 2021 validation the performance statistics were calculated based on the data collected from the field experiment component refer to section 2 2 and the corresponding simulated values derived from daily apsim simulations including maize grain yield potato tuber yield aboveground biomass for each crop and soil water storage 0 120 cm the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse 0 100 and willmott agreement index d 1 were calculated as 1 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o

estimating the trend upward or downward 2 4 model application 2 4 1 climate scenario generation the climate scenarios used in this study were generated based on the historical data of youyu county during 1980 2009 obtained from the cma the data included daily precipitation mm maximum temperature c minimum temperature c and sunshine hours h the data of daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 were calculated from sunshine hours using the angstrom equation wang et al 2015 the general growing season of the study site from may to september was divided into three stages in this study pre sowing to crop germination stage 1 may vegetative growth phase stage 2 june to july and reproductive growth phase stage 3 august to september then the values of standardized precipitation index spi were calculated for each stage from 1980 to 2009 data 30 years fig 2 the spi which shows the deviation extent of precipitation in a certain period compared with the long term historical average level is often used to examine the applicability of the water supply conditions at different timescales mckee et al 1993 the formula for calculating spi is based on the density and a gamma probability function zuo et al 2021 4 g x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β in eq 4 α represents the shape parameter α 0 β represents the scale parameter β 0 determined by maximum likelihood meanwhile x is the precipitation amount this varies with α and β the assigned values are normalized and transformed to standard normal distributions i e mean zero and variance one more detailed calculation procedures and classification of spi were described by mckee et al 1993 and zuo et al 2021 the precipitation in stage 1 2 and 3 during 1980 2009 showed p 0 05 in the kolmogorov smirnov test representing that the data obeys gamma probability function spi values for the three stages in the current study were generated by the spi generator developed by the national drought mitigation center https drought unl edu university of nebraska lincoln unl a negative spi value means drought conditions on the tested time scale while a positive spi value represents relatively wet conditions afterward each stage was classified into drought normal or wet patterns according to the spi by measuring the spi values we choose the typical drought normal and wet patterns from the classification of 30 yr for divided stages shown in table 5 the scenario generations were developed by two methods that we refer to as scenario simulation i and ii fig 2 scenario simulation i ssi the daily climate data 1980 2009 of a given stage 1 2 or 3 were retained following the 30 yr historical data of general growing seasons while the data of the other two stages were replaced by the typical drought normal or wet pattern as shown in fig 3 with an example this is referred to as ssi hereafter comprising nine total climate scenarios totally there were 3 typical conditions 3 stages 9 climate scenarios in ssi which is a matrix style the ssi dataset allowed us to assess the responses to cropping systems derived from the changes in specific stages in typical drought normal or wet seasons scenario simulation ii ssii ssii was conducted considering that ssi fails to represent the effects of typical conditions during stage 1 2 or 3 on crop yield we created nine scenarios by replacing daily climate data of stage 1 2 or 3 from the typical data drought normal or wet during 30 general growing seasons while the historical data were retained for the other two stages as shown in fig 3 with an example similar to ssi there were nine climate scenarios in ssii the data set of ssii also allowed us to assess the potential yield changes of food crops maize and potato caused by cropping systems and typical climate conditions in different stages 2 4 2 simulation setting the five rotations and one continuous system were simulated based on the scenarios of both ssi and ssii fig 2 rotations were simulated by two different sequences that were initialed with the first or second crop with a requirement for accumulated precipitation 10 mm in five days for sowing each crop had a specific sowing time window may 15th to 25th or sowing on the latest date of may 25th table 2 lists the planting density plant space row space and harvest date for ensuring the optimum crop growth without n limitation 320 kg n ha 1 was applied at each sowing event in the simulations the initial soil water storage was set at 80 of field capacity for each soil layer to remove any bias based on previous soil conditions table 4 according to the local customary conditions irrigation of 50 mm was implemented once per season at sowing for both crops the initial no3 n nh4 n and soc levels were set according to table 4 while the crop residuals were all removed from the fields in the simulations 2 4 3 results generation and synthesis the effects of treatments and climate scenarios were investigated based on the outputs of apsim simulations for ssi we focused on investigating the effects of different climate conditions from 30 years of historical data in specific stages on crop productivity therefore linear regressions were conducted between crop yields water productivity wp and spi values of given stages for both scenarios in ssi for example maize grain yield and forage oats yield in the mo treatment were regressed with the spi values from historical conditions in stage 1 under hs1 scenarios hs1 drought hs1 normal and hs1 wet as well as regressed with spi in stage 2 under hs2 scenarios hs2 drought hs2 normal and hs2 wet the above analysis would yield insights into how climate conditions in stage 1 2 or 3 affected the yield of different treatments in the typical drought normal and wet years wp was calculated as 5 w p y w s 6 w s g s p s w i s w t in eqs 5 and 6 y represents grain yield ws represents the water supply for a single growing season and gsp is growing season precipitation swi and swt are soil water storage at sowing and harvesting respectively 0 120 cm soil layer the land in the study site is smooth while the groundwater is deep and hard to supply to the 0 120 cm soil layer thus the surface runoff and water uptake from the bottom were neglected in calculating ws for ssii we focused on the variation in food yield caused by treatments and typical climates in given stages notably the main food crops in yanmenguan are maize and potato that are often rotated with each other or some cereals in this region in our case the crop yield of potato maize rotation pm under the baseline scenario was chosen as the base data in ssii coding as a b means the food yields of other rotations containing maize or potato described in table 1 cm mo ms for maize po and ps for potato under the baseline scenario while c means the yields of pm under nine generated scenarios of ssii fig 3 similarly d represents the food yields of cm mo ms po and ps under the nine generated scenarios finally the values of b a c a and d a were calculated to comprehensively assess the effects of cropping systems and typical conditions in a given stage 1 2 or 3 on long term food productivity in the ape of northern shanxi and to deduce possible adaptation options 2 5 data analysis data analyses were performed by ibm spss statistics edition 19 0 software including the linear regressions y ax b between crop yield wp and spi values the independent variable x and dependent variable y for conducting linear regressions were spi values of given stages stage 1 2 or 3 and crop yield wp respectively the crop yield wp and food yield changes b a c a and d a were compared among scenarios for ssi and ssii separately while the analysis of variance based anova mean separation was performed using the duncan multi range test the annual values from 30 years in a scenario simulation were considered repeated measures in the anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 field experiment data the results of the field experiment presented decreases in maize grain yield and potato tuber yield in 2021 compared with 2020 43 1 47 6 and 19 1 34 6 respectively p 0 01 table 6 this difference was primarily caused by the inter annual variation in precipitation during august and september stage 3 that showed 311 and 133 mm for 2020 and 2021 respectively however the forage yields of oats and feed soybean in 2021 were improved by 23 2 30 4 and 21 3 31 5 respectively table 6 this was probably caused by the markedly higher precipitation in june and july stage 2 in 2021 95 6 mm compared to 2020 63 4 mm therefore the field measured results showed that changing precipitation in stages 2 and 3 introduced contrasting effects on food yield and forage yield implying the necessity to investigate how crops respond to the precipitation pattern during different stages otherwise the statistical analysis of the field measured yield 2020 2021 did not present significant differences between treatments rotations and monoculture p 0 05 possibly due to the limited term of the field experiment field measured data also indicated that forage oats consumed more water in july and august for late august the soil water contents 0 120 cm in oats plots were 10 4 25 0 and 38 8 mm lower than for other crop plots and fallow plots data not shown for late september maize plots showed the lowest level of soil water content therefore for the entire growing season maize would consume more water than other crops under the conditions of the study region 3 2 model calibration and validation 3 2 1 aboveground biomass and crop yield this study calibrated and validated four sub modules with several key parameters table 3 during a two year field experiment located at the youyu loess plateau grassland ecosystem research station of shanxi province apsim simulated the biomass production of the four crops maize potato forage oats and soybean by rmse of 323 1946 and 324 2289 kg ha 1 for calibration 2020 and validation 2021 respectively accounting for 4 40 15 84 of the mean observation nrmse details listed in table 7 meanwhile the largest differences in nrmse between calibration and validation were observed in forage oat biomass due to 11 41 17 69 underestimation in 2021 the d values for biomass in calibration and validation ranged from 0 9815 to 0 9987 and from 0 9106 to 0 9877 respectively indicating the accuracy in predicting biomass dynamic changes for maize grain yield although rmse and nrmse were only 418 627 kg ha 1 and 4 09 11 15 respectively d values seemed not to reach a satisfactory level being 0 2049 and 0 3773 for calibration and validation respectively for potato tuber yield however rmse nrmse and d values of 324 1222 kg ha 1 3 74 9 95 and 0 5537 0 9182 respectively were obtained table 7 due to maize grain yield showing nom significant differences between treatments in field observations calibration and validation apsim did not define clear differences caused by treatments in the current study low values of d pointed that trial and error method of calibration using one yr of field observation still showed subsequent problems in model performance though the methodology was considered as approved and credible ahmed et al 2016 larger and more robust datasets should be utilized in further research for better calibration for conducting sustainable model calibration and application the modelled errors also could to be partly derived by another reason judged by former study apsim could not simulate the harms of pest and disease incidence on crops due to its framework therefore apsim simulation often represents a well regulated management condition causing overestimation of biomass production ojeda et al 2016 in summary apsim predict the production of these four crops maize potato forage oats and feed soybean well in most cases fig s1 and could be a useful tool for evaluating the crop productivity via scenario analysis li et al 2022 however there was a certain trend seen in underestimating maize forage oats and feed soybean biomass on average by 4 86 4 49 and 3 28 and overestimating the aboveground biomass of potato by 15 84 apsim managed to capture the variation of the biomass production and yield of the four crops in response to different years in the ape of northern shanxi though markedly different conditions were showed between 2020 and 2021 3 2 2 soil water storage soil water storage during 2020 2021 indicated good agreement between simulated and measured data in both calibration and validation for the 0 120 cm soil layer the rmse values for calibration and validation were 7 1 and 9 8 mm respectively accounting for 5 19 7 11 of the mean observation values of d were 0 9057 and 0 6231 for calibration and validation respectively dividing the soil depth into 0 20 surface layer and 20 120 cm deeper layer d values were 0 5249 0 7147 and 0 6806 0 8690 respectively table 7 meanwhile the results showed generally acceptable nrmse for the two depths 5 65 28 64 and 9 08 29 98 for calibration and validation respectively indicating that apsim simulated soil water dynamics well in the ape of northern shanxi for the current study the simulated deviations of the surface layer were larger than those for the deeper layer as shown by higher nrmse and lower d values table 7 fig s2 naturally soil water storage is dramatically changed in the surface layer and thus harder to precisely predicted chaki et al 2022 a previous study pointed that due to the lagging responses of apsim water infiltration and distribution might show non negligible simulated deviations during frequent rainy days elli et al 2020 another study ojeda et al 2018 found that soil plant models fail to consistently describe soil water dynamics in shallow soils but present good ability in simulating the dynamics in deep soil or the soil water conditions with relatively moderate changes it is also worth noting that there was some limitation in saxton s equations leading to inaccurately estimated soil parameters and limited representativeness of actual soil conditions abbasi et al 2011 generally speaking however the metrics of calibration and validation suggested that apsim was able to estimate soil water dynamics in study area peake et al 2014 while the accuracy of soil water dynamics as well as the biomass synthesis rates are needed to be continuously calibrated and examined in further studies 3 3 results of baseline scenario in comparison with pm mo and ms maize grain yield and wp in the cm treatment were the lowest in the baseline scenario with the greatest annual variation averages 7719 kg ha 1 and 3 83 kg ha 1 mm 1 for grain yield and wp respectively fig 4 indicating low annual food output for traditional cereal monoculture potato tuber yield in the baseline scenario did not differ significantly with treatments p 0 05 fig 4 while the pm treatment presented markedly lower potato wp 34 63 kg ha 1 mm 1 than po and ps between pm and ps p 0 05 especially for drought seasons yields of forage oats and feed soybean averaged 7 57 7 71 lower when rotating with maize mo and ms compared to potato po and ps p 0 05 however wp values of these two crops were relatively close in different treatments fig 4 the results of this study showed smooth changes in forage yield in response to different water consumption levels of previous crops further demonstrating the superiority of water use via vegetative mass production 3 4 results of ssi 3 4 1 crop yield and wp in ssi similar to the baseline scenario 1980 2009 crop yield and wp of food crops maize and potato in ssi received better values when rotating with forages mo ms po and ps hs1 w presented the highest mean maize yield of 9496 620 9509 627 kg ha 1 although normal maize seasons tend to greatly improve wp in most cases table 8 potato showed the highest tuber yield with values of 13106 961 13878 190 kg ha 1 in hs1 scenarios while the wp showed negative effects derived from an increased water supply that progressively decreased with the regular progression of drought normal wet seasons table 8 compared with mo and ms in most cases po and ps had average increases of 0 3234 and 4 1601 kg ha 1 for forage oats and feed soybean yield respectively table 8 in addition rotation with potato po and ps also averagely yielded 0 87 5 23 kg ha 1 mm 1 greater wp for forage oats and feed soybean in drought normal seasons than mo and ms except for hs2 n that obtained very similar soybean wp between different rotations table 8 in summary the crops in maize based rotations led to yield losses that may have been due to less water retention before planting and semi rainfed conditions ojiem et al 2014 additionally the data of cm also supported the above issue in this study a continuous maize system could be deemed as a rotation of maize maize 3 4 2 linear relationships between crop yield wp and spi in ssi in general the results showed that maize grain yield was noticeably affected by the spi in stage 1 may in drought seasons r2 ranged from 0 2409 to 0 4037 p 0 01 with a values 527 84 table 9 the effect of precipitation in stage 1 hs1 w on maize yield was also highly significant in wet seasons except for the cm treatment table 9 for stage 2 june and july the relationship between spi and maize grain yield was estimated to be markedly stronger in normal seasons hs2 n r2 values were 0 2615 0 5176 p 0 01 a 1034 5 however spi of stage 3 august and september confirmed no strong relationship connected with maize yield in both treatments for maize wp the linear regressions associated with spi in hs1 d were similar to those for grain yield showing that the water supply before maize sowing was very important for maize grain yield in drought seasons implying negative effects of rainless winters on maize production under both rotational and monoculture patterns in successive seasons wang et al 2021 for the other eight scenarios only hs2 w the precipitation of stage 2 in wet season hs2 w showed a markedly negative relationship with maize wp r2 0 3776 0 4378 p 0 001 a 1 2315 table 10 notably maize yield and wp tended to be more affected by rainfall from jointing to tasseling generally in june and july in normal seasons tables 9 and 10 this period is also the key of daily matter accumulation and use of supplied water and easily affected by varied water condition indicating higher climate risk for traditional continuous maize than rotations yang et al 2020 above results reminded us that i maize crop in drought wet seasons showed relatively low high productivity despite water fluctuation in a given stage ii enhancing water supply in stage 2 could significantly improved productivity and sustainability of maize especially in normal seasons with about 306 mm of precipitation from may to september table 5 potato tuber yield was highly related to spi in stage 2 hs2 scenarios for both treatments r2 reached 0 3586 0 5757 p 0 001 indicating that precipitation in june and july generally emergence to the stage of early tuber had the largest effects on potato tuber yield mthembu et al 2022 judged that potato aboveground biomass accumulation after sowing would be the key for moisture demand determining high tuber yield in the current study area the general aboveground biomass accumulation period before tuberization june and july almost accounted half of potato growing season while insufficient inopportune water supply in this period might receive markedly risk and result in loss of tuber yield tang et al 2018 e g a season with wet july and a relatively drought june in study site naturally above effects were relatively milder in wet seasons lower values of a compared with hs2 d and hs2 n table 9 due to higher water supply for hs1 w though a noticeable relationship between potato yield and spi was observed r2 0 2428 the low a values 91 213 91 195 did not indicate marked effects of precipitation in stage 1 table 9 hs1 w and hs2 w had relatively high r2 values 0 2591 0 3722 with p 0 01 table 10 and were negatively related to potato wp a ranged from 0 7666 to 0 7687 meanwhile for hs3 scenarios potato wp tended to indicate relatively strong negative relationships with spi in stage 3 table 10 the above results indicated that wp of potato could not be substantially improved by the enhanced water supply since pre sowing in most cases in the study area and therefore more irrigation was not recommended before sowing in the study area tang et al 2021 potato yield wp in pm was also markedly related to spi in stage 2 to a certain extent r2 ranged from 0 1988 to 0 5757 in most cases p 0 05 and there were positive relationships between wp and spi found in hs2 d and hs2 n with a of 1 9085 2 7810 the above results also reflected the relatively poor water conditions before potato planting when rotating with maize gao et al 2019 further reminding us that irrigation in stage 2 could significantly improve potato tuber yield and water use spi in stage 2 was significantly positively related p 0 001 to the forage yields of oats and feed soybean in drought normal and wet seasons r2 0 4102 0 8391 a 1125 6 2746 7 table 9 above implied that stage 2 june and july was the most sensitive stage from emergency to floral initiation to water supply for forage biomass accumulation which was the period with high potential growth rates for the plants mbangiwa et al 2019 hakala et al 2020 thus accidental drought or heavy precipitation events in stage 2 would influence forage yield to a certain extent for stage 1 only hs1 d presented a relatively strong relationship between spi and forage yields with r2 values of 0 1754 0 4443 a 255 69 1259 8 p 0 05 while forage wp was even negatively affected by the spi in stage 1 in wet seasons r2 0 4885 0 6672 a raged from 2 6116 to 0 9297 p 0 001 table 10 with these results the water supply before sowing also showed notable effects on forage yields in drought seasons while 50 mm per year irrigation seems to be generally enough for forages in normal or wet seasons as these forages showed greater climate adaptability than food crops similar to the linear regressions between forage yield and spi results showed that forage wp was positively related to the spi in stage 2 with r2 of 0 2007 0 5328 and a of 1 1640 3 8206 p 0 01 table 10 this indicated that the forages are undergoing water stress in the study area due to potential demands of growth therefore we could advocate that the relatively high water supply in june and july could cope with forage growth exerting potential water productivity with suitable timing of the water supply zhang et al 2017 notably wp of forages in mo and ms presented r2 values of 0 2127 0 2529 p 0 05 and was positively related to spi in hs1 d a 1 0858 1 9031 implying a greater water risk for forages when rotating with maize crops due to water demand and consumption of maize ojeda et al 2018 results of ssi estimated the how crop yield and wp of several treatments in response to varied water conditions during different stages in typical seasons however concerning daily analysis of crop development was not the keynote of this study which should be extracted and analyzed in further work for providing effective insights on plant growth and yield formation in the local condition of study area 3 5 food yield maize and potato changes in ssii 3 5 1 food yield changes for b a the mean b a values ranged from 7712 to 281 kg ha 1 and from 297 to 330 kg ha 1 for maize and potato yield respectively fig 5 though some cases showed significant discrepancies between treatments maize and potato yields were not changed markedly between treatments under the baseline scenario cm showed a relatively lower b a value compared with other treatments 776 kg ha 1 indicating low sustainability of continuous maize from another angle 3 5 2 food yield changes for c a generated scenarios presented relatively large changes in c a compared with b a the scenarios of ts3 typical drought normal and wet scenario tended to result in higher food yields than corresponding ts1 and ts2 scenarios in most cases the differences were between 277 and 869 kg ha 1 these results implied that undergoing drought during august september led to relatively insignificant negative effects on maize and potato yield previous studies judged that the principal factors causing slow growth in the late season and finally affecting maize grain yield were attributable to the deficits of temperature and solar radiation gao et al 2018 in addition though another study indicated that limited late season water supply did not significantly affect the growth of potato tuber lerna and mauromicale 2022 but ts3 wet showed 1176 and 1757 kg ha 1 of mean c a in ssii for yield of maize and potato respectively implying that high water supply in stage 3 still present significant benefits on food yield p 0 05 additionally the food yield of pm treatment was maximally decreased when stage 2 suffering drought conditions ts2 drought showing significant limitation in plant growth due to scanty supply of water with extreme values of 9105 and 4273 kg ha 1 and average values of 1973 and 1620 kg ha 1 for maize and potato respectively compared with stage 2 typical drought conditions in stage 1 ts1 drought mitigated the reduction of mean yield by 1061 and 467 kg ha 1 for maize and potato respectively these results indicated that the negative effects of drought in may were lower than those from drought in june july on food yield possibly caused by the 50 mm of irrigation during crop sowing thus we could speculate that under the current production conditions and in a typical climate year a drought in stage 2 june to july would be the greatest challenge to the common crops and patterns of food production wang et al 2019 however the irrigated conditions in this region are limited and cannot ensure the extra water supply after crop sowing leading inevitably to risk in food production 3 5 3 food yield changes for d a finally the values of d a treatments and climate scenarios showed relatively large differences compared with b a fig 5 implying that drought or wet conditions in given stages could expand the impacts of treatments on food yield for maize cm mo and ms the typical drought and even normal climate conditions of stage 2 could decrease grain yield drastically in most cases due to unsatisfactory water supply for rapid daily growth showing mean changes of 3283 2384 and 558 kg ha 1 42 5 30 9 7 2 for cm mo and ms in ts2 drgouht and 1659 825 and 109 kg ha 1 from 21 5 to 1 4 for cm mo and ms in ts2 normal however ts2 wet only provided 317 359 kg ha 1 of mean yield benefits d a for maize the ts1 and ts3 suffering drought and normal conditions also reduced maize grain yield in cm and mo but lesser than in ts2 scenarios from 1569 to 384 kg ha 1 fig 5 above results indicated that drought in june july for cm and mo would cause the highest risk to maize yield moreover stages 1 and 2 with normal precipitation conditions still showed yield reduction for maize yield compared with b a c a and d a for maize indicated that i the natural precipitation condition of the preceding growing season for this region cannot meet the demand of maize grain productivity in most cases despite yearly patterns especially for the cm treatment ii for avoiding useless water input and maintaining maize vegetative growth small amounts of irrigation several times are recommended from pre planting to emergence and flowering period generally in august instead of one time large amount irrigation amarasingha et al 2017 iii food yield of ms treatment was comparatively high and stable due to the lower water cost of feed soybean ignoring the forage yield we also found that d a in ssii showed more stable values for potato yield compared with maize fig 5 the results were consistent with c a po and ps were maximally decreased and increased under ts2 drought and ts3 wet respectively while d a of ts1 and ts3 showed similar values compared with c a in particular d a values were slightly higher average 0 1261 kg ha 1 than those of c a indicating that po and ps showed better resistance to climate change compared with pm due to the higher water cost for maize compared with the forages discussed in section 3 4 otherwise it should be noted that d a values of po and ps in ts2 drought were 1170 1372 and 359 1521 kg ha 1 average 9 8 and 3 0 fig 5 respectively and these were significant differences p 0 05 the results revealed that when suffering severe drought in stage 2 the potato plants rotated with oats might face higher risk lower tuber yield with higher annual variation than when rotating with feed soybean the reason for this would be the higher available water retention and potential crop n responses of previous soybean production of ms treatment bell et al 2022 moreover excluding the conditions with water depletion the ample water supply in stage 3 tended to yield markdly benefits in food production that were largely caused by high potential evapotranspiration from maize flowering to grain filling seyoum et al 2018 as well as from potato tuber growth to senescence lerna and mauromicale 2022 altogether avoiding rotation with forage oats in the seasons with drought in june july helped enhance potential potato tuber yield supplementing water via irrigation in august flowering period or drought normal stage 2 could effectively stabilize food productivity in the ape of northern shanxi province ssii provided data references and information in evaluating long term food productivity for different cropping systems and seasons but comprehensive consideration in actual demand of food forages and future climate changing are still need to be conducted 4 conclusions combination of field experiment and calibrated model would contribute to improving understanding of productivity and resource use in response to certain climate conditions offering comprehensive assessments for strategic decision making processes to summarize the results of apsim calibration and validation showed that the model was able to predict the yields of maize potato forage oats and feed soybean in the ape of northern shanxi and could generally describe the soil water balance components due to less water retention before planting and semi rainfed conditions the long term scenario simulations based on ssi and six cropping systems showed that crop yield and wp tended to be lower in maize based systems than in others in typical seasons especially for forages maize yield showed higher sensitivity with the water condition in stage 1 and 2 than in stage 3 while key effects of precipitation on maize wp were presented in stage 1 and 2 for drought and wet season respectively importantly potato biomass accumulation after sowing would be the key for moisture demand determining high tuber yield while the potential water demands of forages seemed not to fulfill in study area causing significant positive relevance between crop yield wp of potato forage oats and feed soybean and spi in stage 2 in most cases naturally such relationships were relatively milder in wet seasons ssii presented that the b a values for maize and potato were negative and positive respectively specifically maize in cm showed 482 495 kg ha 1 lower b a values than others c a and d a suggested that drought or wet condition in given stages expanded the impacts of treatments on food yield while undergoing droughts in stage 2 would be the greatest challenge to food guarantee with a mean reductions of 7 2 42 5 and 3 0 9 8 for maize and potato yield respectively the precipitation condition cannot meet the demand of maize grain productivity despite yearly patterns resulting in relatively unstable productivity droughts in stage 1 or 3 did not significantly reduce food yield during 30 yr but a wet stage 3 tended to present significant food yield benefits which largely caused by high potential evapotranspiration from maize flowering to grain filling and potato tuber growth to senescence noticeably the low water demand and potential crop n responses of feed soybean afford comparatively high food productivity with ignoring forage yield overall we advocate that the traditional patterns of continuous maize and potato maize rotation should be shifted to mitigate the negative effects of rainless winters on crop productivity cope with the droughts in may june july and fully utilize growth characteristics of different crops potato is more suitable than maize rotated with forages in the ape of northern shanxi province meanwhile supplementary irrigation is warranted in june july or august to moderate the risk of droughts as well as to afford additional water in the key periods for obtaining high crop productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

8943,it has become increasingly important to quantify carbon and water fluxes due to their roles in global warming and climate change particularly for the agroecosystems however the dynamics of carbon and water fluxes have not been clearly recognized in rotation croplands with complex and changeable climate here the variations of net ecosystem productivity nep evapotranspiration et and the water use efficiency wue defined as nep et and their responses to the environmental factors were investigated in a wheat maize rotation cropland across the huaibei plain of china over 2013 2015 the total average nep et and average wue respectively were 489 1 gc m 2 315 8 kgh2o m 2 4 4 gc kg 1h2o for wheat and 192 5 gc m 2 249 0 kgh2o m 2 3 6 gc kg 1h2o for maize implying that wheat season sequestered more co2 than maize season spring drought and summer flood affected wue of wheat and maize respectively daily wheat wue seemed to be more sensitive to changes in photosynthetically active radiation par vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content swc and canopy conductance gc par was the dominant factor controlling diurnal dynamics of nep and et while the opposite effect of vpd on nep was recognized nep increasing with par was limited by high vpd which obviously when vpd exceeded 2 kpa during the maize season maize nep was limited with vpd under high solar radiation 500 μmol m 2 s 1 wues of wheat and maize were negatively related to swc and gc and the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range sub diurnal nep against par vpd or temperature showed clockwise hysteresis but et against par or windspeed showed counter clockwise hysteresis and these hystereses were mainly caused by the interplay between evaporative demand and

hysteresis rotation cropland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases during recent decades global climate change has significantly affected ecosystem functions and processes including tightly coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycles yang et al 2015 zhang and yuan 2020 carbon and water fluxes are two essential biogeophysical components law et al 2002 their exchanges between the terrestrial surface and atmosphere play a vital role not only in the terrestrial carbon cycle but also in the hydrological processes and energy budget choi et al 2018 gilmanov et al 2003 wang et al 2022 as an important part of terrestrial ecosystems agroecosystems are believed to have great potential to sequester global carbon emissions also through crop rotation and water management practices baldocchi et al 2001 ciais et al 2011 liu et al 2021b schmidt et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 thus the precise quantification of carbon and water fluxes in agroecosystems is crucial to elucidate the physiological responses of crops to environmental conditions project crop management and the food production under climate change baldocchi 2014 knox et al 2015 piao et al 2019 over the past decade carbon and water fluxes such as net ecosystem productivity nep evapotranspiration et over agroecosystems have

provide consecutive measurements of h2o and co2 exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere ec measurements offer great help in investigating the dynamics of the fluxes and the environmental controls as well as estimating the water use efficiency wue beer et al 2009 niu et al 2011 which contributes to better water resource management and agricultural development suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 wue i e co2 assimilation per unit mass of water consumption is an essential indicator for evaluating the effect of saving water on agricultural production during the growing period for agroecosystems wue can be defined as the ratio of nep to et scanlon and albertson 2004 wang et al 2021b the nep et and wue at ecosystem scale vary with plant types environmental controls and even human activities like irrigation drainage hrach et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the assessment of wue over various ecosystems indicated that wue of maize was higher than that of sunflower winter wheat soybean and paddy rice jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhao et al 2007 but lower than that of the forest ito and inatomi 2012 ponton et al 2006 it was reported that there was a consistent seasonal variation in various forms of carbon assimilation including net ecosystem exchange nee gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp and net biome productivity nbp etc liu et al 2021a zhao et al 2007 the nee can be decomposed as two components i e gpp and ecosystem respiration reco using the eddy covariance method previous studies have also shown that the carbon and water fluxes of wheat were larger than those of maize shen et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 although there are various of studies have assessed the carbon and water budgets across different cropland management styles detailed budgets of carbon and water fluxes might facilitate better predictions of agroecosystems responses to climate change therefore the accurate evaluations of nep et and wue in a rotation cropland remain necessary currently radiant energy absorbed by the crop canopy kim and lieth 2003 soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations liu et al 2014 crop phenology bai et al 2015 leaf area index hu et al 2018 and environmental factors such as soil water content swc vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta fernandez martinez et al 2019 jung et al 2017 tao et al 2022 yuan et al 2020 have been found to relate the changes in carbon and water fluxes photosynthetically active radiation par was identified as the primary driver controlling diurnal dynamics of nee and et in irrigated maize field in arid areas while the opposite effects of vpd were identified wang et al 2021b usually wue decreased with increase of vpd while the response of wue to par and swc is controversial for instance some results suggest that the increased swc can lead to the increase of carbon uptake which thus improved wue humphrey et al 2021 but other experiments showed that wue declined with the increase of swc wang et al 2021a besides high vpd would decrease wue of maize growing in irrigated agroecosystems in arid areas wang et al 2021b further the response of wue to drought in humid regions was different from and even contrary to that in arid regions xu et al 2019 it should be noted that for the similar wheat maize rotation cropland the factors affecting carbon and water fluxes in different climate regions are different sun et al 2016 wang et al 2022 therefore investigating the controls of the environmental factors on the variation in carbon and water fluxes is necessary for specific regions alternatively the hysteresis between pairs of et and vpd nep and par reco and temperature have been mainly investigated by bodies of studies chen et al 2020 phillips et al 2011 riveros iregui et al 2007 recently over a large ephemeral lake in china cui et al 2020 illustrated that surface net radiation wind speed and temperature difference dominants would control the hysteresis effects and regulate latent heat flux variations xu et al 2022 assessed the hysteresis between sub diurnal et and vpd at the ecosystem scale and found that in seasonally dry locations low soil moisture availability amplified the hysteresis during the dry season also hysteresis between nee and soil temperature has been identified tramontana et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 overall attributable to changes in the environment and interactions within the soil plant atmosphere continuum ecosystem carbon and water fluxes hysteresis phenomena have also been observed across different time scales such as the diurnal and seasonal cycles lin et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 even hysteresis has been previously observed in the agroecosystems riveros iregui et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 in humid and sub humid areas the hysteresis effect on the carbon and water fluxes i e nep and et of wheat maize rotation cropland is still ambiguous and needs to be further evaluated the huaibei plain is one of china s important commodity grain production bases and it belongs to a warm temperate sub humid monsoon climate zone as typical and representative agricultural crops of this region wheat and maize have important ecological functions such as maintaining ecosystem integrity and biodiversity conservation lu et al 2019 several studies have reported croplands in the north china plain as a weak co2 source e g li et al 2006 luo et al 2008 while zhang et al 2020 indicated that the wheat was a weak co2 sink and maize was close to co2 neutral to the atmosphere that is whether the huaibei plain is a carbon source or a carbon sink is inconclusive further it should be noted that seasonal flood or drought frequently occurs in this region yuan et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 thus understanding the variation and attribution of wue over this rotation cropland are important for the local hydrological process and water resources utilization therefore with the ec measuring of carbon and water fluxes i e nep and et across a wheat maize rotation cropland over the huaibei plain of china during the 2013 2015 agricultural cycles we investigated the dynamics of carbon and water fluxes and their responses to the environmental factors the main objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the carbon and water fluxes i e nep et and their coupling wue in this rotation cropland 2 characterize the diurnal and seasonal variations of the fluxes and identify the contributing factor and 3 decompose the mechanisms of diurnal hysteresis between the fluxes and environmental conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site description this study was conducted at the wudaogou hydrology and water resources experimental site wdg site 33 09 n 117 21 e in the huaibei plain northern anhui province china fig 1 the huaibei plain belongs to the southern part of north china plain and is an important commodity grain base in china it is characterized by a semi humid monsoon climate being dry in spring and winter warm and rainy in summer and autumn precipitation in the huaibei plain is mainly concentrated from june to september accounting for more than 60 of the total annual rainfall during the 30 year period from 1992 to 2021 the mean annual temperature and precipitation at the wdg site were 15 1 c and 954 2 mm respectively the crop layout is mainly dry crops including winter wheat maize soybean peanut and cotton gou et al 2020 the representative cropping style in this region is winter wheat and summer maize double cropping rotation during the past years the wheat was sown around 1st november and harvested around 25th may of the following year with crop residues left on the field the maize was sown following the wheat harvest around 15th june and harvested around 25th september straw was chopped 5 cm by an automated machine and returned to the field at harvest time seeds were directly drilled into the soil and plowing of the top soil 0 15 cm occurred once a year after the harvest of the maize crop in october irrigation is generally not needed in this region for the effective precipitation can meet the crop water requirements in this study carbon and water fluxes during three wheat maize growing seasons in 2013 2015 were continuously observed by ec system over the field 2 2 eddy covariance and meteorological measurements the carbon and water fluxes i e nep and et between the biosphere and atmosphere were measured by an open path eddy covariance system ec150 campbell scientific inc usa csat3 campbell scientific inc usa which was installed at the 6 86 m height above the ground surface the original data were recorded at a frequency of 10 hz with a datalogger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa the main wind directions of this area are east and northeast and the eddy covariance system was installed in the northeast direction fig 1 further the footprint of flux source was conducted using the kljun model kljun et al 2015 the system performance was assessed by linear regression of the energy balance closure with the sum of sensible plus latent heat flux h le measured from eddy covariance as the dependent variable and the difference between net radiation and ground heat flux rn g measured from the meteorological sensors as the independent variable rodrigues et al 2014 the slope of regression can be seen as the energy balance ratio ebr and the ratios for all half hourly data were 0 58 in wheat season and 0 60 in maize season respectively it should be noted that the slope varies from 0 49 to 0 81 at the sites included in china flux li et al 2005 indicating that the flux observed data at this site are reliable the environmental factors including air temperature ta relative humidity rh photosynthetically active radiation par and wind speed ws were automatically measured by the auxiliary equipment installed at the tower meteorological sensors included a combined humidity and temperature sensor hmp155a vaisala inc finland a par

data with standard procedures which included the double coordinate rotation correction for density fluctuations wpl correction webb et al 1980 and the spectral and de spiking correction liu et al 2021a paw et al 2000 after the corrections f c data was output over 30 minute intervals wue gc kg 1 h2o was calculated as the ratio of nep to et according the previous studies i e kuglitsch et al 2008 wang et al 2021a 3 wue nep et a series of quality control was implemented before data analysis we removed the flux data which were monitored when the sensors failed or being repaired or calibrated some peak values caused by rain and other reasons also were rejected liu et al 2021a besides co2 flux data with friction velocity u less than 0 1 m s 1 at night were also removed rana et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 ultimately about 45 unqualified data was lost therefore we filled the gaps by two different ways in daytime and nighttime the gaps of daytime nee were filled by a light response curve known as the michaelis menten model falge et al 2001 and in the nighttime the measured nee can be described as ecosystem respiration reco which can be gap filled by a soil temperature dependent exponential

sensing leaf area index lai was used to monitor the phenology of crops at this site kong et al 2020 the remote sensing data was collected from the modis reflectance product https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov lai was derived from the product mod15a2h the temporal and spatial resolutions of lai were 8 day and 500 m respectively and the lai was extracted by the area of the wdg site located in 2 5 statistical analysis the pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation degree of two variables hegyi and laczi 2015 meanwhile the linear and non linear regressions were applied to analyze the relationships between fluxes i e nep et and wue and environmental factors the multiple linear regression a widely used method to identify the dominant variables associated with carbon and water fluxes was employed to possibly explain the underlying mechanisms of changes in daily water carbon fluxes four meteorological and hydrological factors i e par vpd swc and gc were selected as the main influencing factors at the daily scale furthermore we examined the half hourly responses of et to the meteorological factors including par vpd ta and ws and examined the half hourly responses of nep to the factors including par vpd ta and ts 3 results 3 1 meteorological and physiological conditions daily variations in environmental and biological factors during the study period of 1st november 2012 31st october 2015 at the wdg site are illustrated in fig 2 including mean daytime ta par vpd p ts and swc at different layers lai and gc obviously the par and vpd showed similar seasonal variations with ta the average daytime ta was respectively 8 2 9 1 and 8 9 27 4 24 6 and 24 8 par was respectively 239 8 210 7 and 188 6 μmol m 2 s 1 375 8 258 1 and 248 7 μmol m 2 s 1 for six growing periods wheat and maize of 2013 2014 and 2015 the vpd was comparatively low 1 0 kpa and showed higher values from june to august in particular the par gradually increased from january and reached its plateau in summer late july or early august with maximum value of 594 1 μmol m 2 s 1 ts of different depths 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 100 cm and 150 cm had similar seasonal dynamics to ta fig 2a the total p was 270 0 342 3 and 332 7 mm during the wheat growing period of 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively but 479 1 484 8 837 8 mm for summer maize fig 2c in addition swc varied in a similar way but late to p showing an obvious decrease in december to next may due to the winter and spring drought fig 2c the maximum daily average swc 0 446 m3 m 3 across the 10 cm soil layer occurred on september 2nd 2014 the lai varied with growing season in the rotation cropland fig 2d during the year of 2013 lai rapidly increased during crop development reaching the first maximum value of 5 65 m2 m 2 at april 23th wheat season and the second maximum value of 5 56 m2 m 2 at august 13th maize season the maximum lai of wheat during the three growing periods was about 5 73 m2 m 2 and slightly higher than that of maize 5 56 m2 m 2 the variation in lai at the wdg site can distinguish the different crop development stages subsequently the minimum lai of 2 14 m2 m 2 was found during the period of water stress november 16th 2012 february 2nd 2013 fig 2d the corresponding lai reduction is due to either drought induced limitation of leaf area expansion or temporary leaf wilting during periods of severe stress in addition as the indicator of stomatal regulation at the canopy level gc of summer maize varied from 1 4 to 27 0 mm s 1 with the mean value of 7 0 mm s 1 which was also lower than that of winter wheat 8 0 mm s 1 3 2 changes of carbon and water fluxes the daily water and carbon fluxes i e nep et and their coupling wue in this rotation cropland are shown in fig 3 seasonal variations of et and nep for wheat and maize presented different normal distribution curves but distinct seasonal cycles existed in et and nep variabilities with a lower amplitude in winter and the drought season and higher amplitude in the growing season when the solar zenith angle was high during the growing season the duration of positive values in nep was long generally the mean total nep was 489 1 and 192 5 gc m 2 respectively for wheat and maize growing periods 2013 2015 at the wdg site the average total et and average wue respectively were 315 8 kgh2o m 2 4 4 gc kg 1h2o for winter wheat and 249 0 kgh2o m 2 3 6 gc kg 1h2o for summer maize from february to april nep ranged from 0 0 to 12 0 gc m 2 d 1 and et ranged from 0 5 to 4 kgh2o m 2 particularly the wue increased in wheat season of 2013 but decreased in 2014 and 2015 fig 3c this was attributed to the mismatch of nep and et phases as for the maize seasons the wue increased but the averaged values in 2013 and 2014 4 1 and 4 2 gc kg 1h2o respectively were much larger than that in 2015 2 6 gc kg 1h2o besides when considering the net co2 loss of 319 5 gc m 2 during the three fallow periods the total nep of three full 2013 2015 cycles was 1725 3 gc m 2 suggesting that the cropland was a strong carbon sink under this field management practice to further investigate the differences in water and carbon fluxes between two different crop seasons hourly variations of nep et and wue in the wheat and maize seasons of different years are respectively plotted in fig 4 evident diurnal variation pattern of daytime uptake and nighttime release for nep was detected nep moved from a negative value release to a positive value uptake after dawn then the c sequestration rate achieved the peak value between 11 00 and 13 00 at midday and afterward it began to decline the diurnal patterns of nep and et depend on the interaction between the atmosphere and physiological response fernandez martinez et al 2019 wue showed similar diurnal variations in six growing seasons with the maximum wue appearing in the early morning and then wue showed a decline trend in the wheat season average daytime wue was 3 7 4 5 and 4 3 gc kg 1h2o respectively for 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 4a c e while in the maize season average daytime wue was 3 8 4 0 and 2 3 gc kg 1h2o respectively fig 4b d f spring drought and summer flood resulted in wue of wheat for 2013 and maize for 2015 respectively figs 2c 4a and f it is worth noting that nep reached the plateau ahead of et about 0 2 0 h in the morning fig 4 the main reason for the low wue around the noon was perhaps the incomplete synchronous diurnal patterns of nep and et compared to summer maize the diurnal variation of wue in winter wheat was higher it may be due to the lower et 3 3 identification analysis of environmental factors relationships between the daily flux nep et and wue and environmental factors were explored using the multiple stepwise regression model table 1 the nep was positively correlated with par but negatively correlated with vpd swc and gc contrarily the et was positive with par vpd and gc while the mechanism between wue and environmental variables is confused e g negatively correlated with swc in 2013 and 2014 but positively correlated with swc in 2015 in 2013 and 2014 wue was primarily controlled by swc and vpd while for maize season in 2015 it was mainly affected by vpd and par at the sub diurnal timescale the most dominating factor for wheat and maize nep et increase was the augmented radiation table 2 followed by the temperature and vpd it also can be found that the variation of nep of winter wheat relied on par heavier than that of summer maize which is inconsistent with the results at the daily timescale indicating that some phenomena have been weakened as the time scale expands both daily nep and et were positively correlated with par during wheat and maize growing seasons fig 5a e and fig s1 contrarily nep was negative with swc and gc except that nep in maize growing season of 2013 fig 5g et was positively correlated with gc except that in the maize season of 2015 and negatively correlated with swc except wheat season in 2014 and maize season in 2013 vpd showed positive effects on nep during both the wheat and maize seasons but there were thresholds vpd seemed to have a limitation effect on nep after vpd exceeding about 0 6 and 0 8 kpa respectively for wheat and maize season fig 5b and f the results indicated that the most dominating factor for nep and et increase was the augmented radiation followed by the vpd and gc for winter wheat par and vpd showed positive effects while swc and gc showed negative effects on wue in three different years except wheat wue vs swc during 2015 figs s2 in summary wheat wue seemed more sensitive to changes in par vpd swc and gc with steeper fitting lines than that of maize the effects of swc and gc on nep et and wue under different par or vpd ranges were also investigated figs 6 7 s3 s6 nep et of winter wheat was negatively related to swc under all par or vpd conditions but nep et of summer maize was positively related to swc which is consistent with the results in fig 5 further this phenomenon is especially evident at high par or vpd values fig 6h j k nep et increased more with the increase of gc when par 300 μmol m 2 s 1 or vpd 0 4 kpa for winter wheat and vpd 0 8 kpa for summer maize fig 7b e g h j k overall wues of wheat and maize were negatively related to swc and gc under all par or vpd conditions and the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range 3 4 responses of sub diurnal nep et and wue to meteorological factors at the sub diurnal scale the slopes between nep and par decreased with the increasing vpd which suggested that nep increasing with par was limited by high vpd this phenomenon occurred obviously when vpd exceeded 2 kpa during the maize season fig 8d figs s7 and s8 it maybe because that under high vpd conditions wheat and maize tended to close their stomata which limits photosynthetic activities while the positive responses of et par were much distinct the slopes of the relationship between et and par were inapparently increasing with the increase in vpd ranges in all three years except the slopes of et par decreased with the increasing vpd for the maize seasons in 2014 and 2015 figs s7 and s8 this illustrated that in years with abundant rainfall the maize et was limited with high water vapor condition fig 2b and d wue was not obviously affected by par condition under different vpd ranges the slopes between nep and vpd changed from positive to negative with the increasing par especially during the maize seasons fig 9d figs s9 and s10 this illustrated that the maize nep was limited with vpd under high solar radiation over 500 μmol m 2 s 1 compared with the conditions of par 500 μmol m 2 s 1 and par 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 the slopes of et vpd during maize seasons in 2013 and 2015 wheat seasons in 2014 and 2015 were basically unchanged under 500 par 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 condition while slopes of wue vpd were negative especially under high solar radiation over 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 condition 3 5 hysteresis between water carbon fluxes and environmental variables interactions among environmental variables may introduce uncertainty in the identification of controlling factors and the hysteresis effects are attributable in regulating the carbon and water fluxes dynamics the distinct hysteresis loop was evident in the relationship between carbon and water fluxes and par vpd ta and ts ws for both wheat and maize seasons fig 10 s11 and s12 apparently the diel courses between nep and par vpd ta and ts formed clockwise loops from morning to evening fig 10a d g and j it indicates that nep was higher in the morning heating phase than cooling phase in afternoon under the same surface net radiation atmospheric moisture or temperature the clockwise loops between nep and par vpd or temperature differed in shape in comparison with vpd the hysteresis between nep and par was relatively weak particularly during the wheat season for the water flux et the loop with par emerged as counterclockwise with an enhanced hysteresis fig 10b also counterclockwise loops of et with ws were found fig 10k while et had clockwise loops with either vpd or ta fig 10e h vpd increased rapidly during the morning and peaks at about 13 30 14 30 and then dramatically decreased fig 10 f these clockwise loops agree with existing observations phillips et al 2011 pingintha et al 2011 nep et aligned well with par or vpd and peaked at 13 00 14 00 notably nep or et had rapid reductions even ta changed very slightly between 15 00 and 18 00 implying nep or et is more insensitive to ta in the afternoon than in the morning moreover the hysteresis loops of nep et and par vpd or ta were much weaker during the wheat season when compared to the maize season during the wheat season as vpd increased in the morning nep increased reaching the peak value 0 271 gc m 2 s 1 at vpd of 0 886 kpa and then rapidly decreased reaching almost zero at 18 00 o clock fig 10d in maize season as par increased in the morning nep increased and reached the peak value 0 365 gc m 2 s 1 at the highest par of 1304 7 μmol m 2 s 1 and as par decreased in the afternoon nep declined fig 10d in the morning as par or vpd increased carbon uptake increased but in the afternoon carbon uptake at any given par or vpd was slightly lower than the rate in the morning at the same par or vpd during the maize season sub diurnal et approximately increased linearly with par at about 12 30 and then declined with decreasing par fig 10b similar results can also be seen for wheat and maize seasons in 2014 and 2015 figs s11 and s12 4 discussion 4 1 variations in carbon and water fluxes at the annual scale as the negative form of nep nee presented large variations across the globe 746 to 319 gc m 2 depending on the environmental conditions crop rotation and other management practices diaz et al 2019 knox et al 2015 during the past 20 years the trend of global nee was negative which means that the c sequestration capacity of terrestrial ecosystems has increased norton et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 some studies have reported that wheat maize rotation croplands across the north china plain as carbon source and nees of these regions became less negative during the past decade 2005 2016 implying a progressive decline of the c sequestration potential e g luo et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 in this study for the period of 2013 2015 the wheat maize rotation cropland showed strong co2 sink with the cumulative nep of three full 2013 2015 cycles being 1725 3 gc m 2 generally the mean total nep of 575 gc m 2 at the wdg site was about 1 3 times the total nep of a wheat maize rotation cropland at weishan site during a 2010 2011 agricultural cycle over the north china plain 438 gc m 2 zhang et al 2020 despite the co2 loss during the fallow period reversed the cropland from a sink into a source this wheat maize rotation cropland acted as a strong co2 sink fig 3 comparing with nees of two paddy fields in southern china 750 gc m 2 liu et al 2021a a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system in the north china plain ranged from 857 to 274 gc m 2 tao et al 2022 a continental monsoon temperate forest in northeast china 160 gc m 2 liu et al 2021b and a drip irrigated cotton field in an oasis of northwest china 100 gc m 2 ming et al 2021 etc this result is not consistent with previous studies that reported the wheat maize rotation cropland as a weak co2 source and the higher nep at wdg site may partially result from the sufficient rainfall the mean annual p was about twice that of weishan and luancheng sites and fertilization wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 also since the large application rates of irrigation and fertilization wheat maize rotation systems in the north china plain were a medium source of greenhouse gas emissions in most of years tao et al 2022 the average total et respectively was 315 8 kgh2o m 2 for wheat and 249 0 kgh2o m 2 for maize et increased in wheat seasons and decreased in maize seasons which was positively correlated with p ta and par figs 2 and 5 note that the ebrs for half hourly data measured from eddy covariance at this site were 0 58 in wheat season and 0 60 in maize season respectively it seems that the measurement accuracy of et is relatively low comparing with the performance of the national sites included in china flux with the ebr ranging of 0 49 0 81 li et al 2005 some studies have confirmed that the energy imbalance was attributable to the available energy might be site specific to a certain degree widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 the low ebrs mean that turbulent energy fluxes were underestimated which could result in the overestimated wue nevertheless compared with the arid and semi arid regions wang et al 2018 wang et al 2021b the average wue of maize across the huaibei plain of china was a bit lower because the higher et obvious diurnal variabilities of carbon and water fluxes were observed and this also varied with seasons having slightly lower amplitudes in wheat seasons and higher amplitudes in maize seasons fig 4 although the measured p in 2015 837 8 mm was larger than that in 2013 and 2014 maize wue of 2014 was 61 5 higher than that of 2015 spring drought of 2013 also led to a lower wheat wue figs 2c and 4 this suggested that the excess p in 2015 limited nep and wue but increased et whilst during the drought period the stress of water deficit can restrain the vegetation growth resulting a decreased wue some literatures also reported that a drying trend appropriate drainage measures or water stress could result in decreased et and increased wue for hype arid sub humid and humid regions jiang et al 2022 tesfaye et al 2021 xu et al 2019 even the two different effects from the increase in temperature and radiation positive effect and the stress of water deficit negative effect could result in amphibolous change in wue considering the frequent droughts and floods along the huaihe river basin throughout history yuan et al 2019 in future spring irrigation summer irrigation and drainage should be effectively increased to improve the wue moreover since different photosynthetic pathways in c3 and c4 crops it is stated that wue of c4 crop maize cropland was apparently higher emmerich 2007 wang et al 2018 this conclusion is inconsistent with the result of this study nevertheless the winter wheat summer maize rotation system may help raise the yield potential 4 2 environmental and biotic controls on carbon and water fluxes for the agricultural ecosystem crop management activities like field with milk vetch rotation irrigation practice and nitrogen fertilizer as well as the environmental fluctuations can affect the exchange of co2 and h2o liu et al 2021a weller et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 found that ta radiation and groundwater depth had pronounced correlations with the co2 fluxes for wheat and maize seasons net radiation and surface conductance were identified to be the two primary controlling factors of et for both the summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons across various regions wang et al 2022 some studies found that warming hiatus accelerated the terrestrial carbon sequestration by reducing reco ballantyne et al 2017 in this study spring drought in 2013 and summer flood in 2015 may be the dominant factors of difference in the correlation between environmental factors and water carbon fluxes and wue show opposite results in different years fig 5g figs s1 and s2 our research suggested that the variation of daily wue of 2013 and 2014 were primarily controlled by swc and vpd while in maize season of 2015 it was mainly affected by vpd and par fig 5 and table 1 this difference indicated that if precipitation is abundant the stress of water deficit played a stronger effect on wue than the increase in temperature and radiation wues of wheat and maize were negatively related to swc and gc and this negative relationship obtained in the current study was consistent with previous literature jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range figs 6 7 s3 s6 in the future vpd is predicted to increase and par tends to decrease delucia et al 2019 yang et al 2018 therefore the response of future wue to swc or gc would remain controversial which should be analyzed specifically for the certain region and underlying surface type another interesting result is that on the diurnal timescale nep and et increasing with par were limited by high vpd and this limitation on carbon flux i e nep was more severe than it on water flux i e et while wue was not obviously affected by par condition under different vpd ranges figs 8 and 9 this phenomenon maybe resulted from the effect of vpd on wue would be regulated by soil water availability wang et al 2021b under higher solar radiation par 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 the maize nep decreased and et increased with increasing vpd resulting in a rapid decline of wue fig 9f figs s9 and s10 this result also is consistent with previous studies which confirmed a negative relationship between wue and vpd kuglitsch et al 2008 li et al 2015 both ecosystem fluxes i e co2 and h2o fluxes and environmental conditions experience diurnal changes reaching peaks at different times and leading to a hysteresis effect zhou et al 2014 these carbon and water fluxes par vpd or temperature hysteresis are acknowledged to be resulted from the complex interactions between physical and physiological processes xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 in this current study stronger hysteresis between nep et and par vpd temperature and ws were observed and nep was found to be slightly higher in the morning fig 10 s11 and s12 these results are consistent with previous studies that have more conclusively shown that plants experience higher opening of stomata in the morning when vpd is lower and internal water stress is lower generating more nep e g de carcer et al 2018 savage et al 2013 this phenomenon is particularly obvious in the forests lin et al 2019 while in our study the rotation cropland experienced comparable ecosystem conductance during the morning and afternoon but exhibit minimal water stress overall our results also imply that the hysteresis is stronger over the maize season when the temperature is high and the water heat carbon transport is active this more obvious hysteresis may be related to the adaptive mechanism of crop maize growth rashid et al 2018 likely the asymmetrical behaviors between co2 h2o fluxes and environmental conditions can be largely explained by the closure of stomata under water stress conditions fatichi et al 2016 pilegaard et al 2011 unsworth et al 2004 and changes in plant hydraulic conductivity lin et al 2019 o grady et al 1999 these findings can enrich our current understanding on the coupling relationship between the ecosystems and the environment yet the mechanisms behind the diurnal hysteresis effects more systematic studies under dynamic environmental variations and across multiple plant functional types are still needed to be further captured 5 conclusions this study investigated the environmental and biotic controls on the seasonal and diurnal changes in carbon and water fluxes across a wheat maize rotation cropland over the huaibei plain of china during the three 2013 2015 agricultural cycles we found this wheat maize rotation cropland was a strong co2 sink the mean total nep being 575 gc m 2 during the year of 2013 2015 even co2 released during the fallow period was considered the total average nep et and average wue respectively were 489 1 gc m 2 315 8 kgh2o m 2 4 4 gc kg 1h2o for wheat and 192 5 gc m 2 249 0 kgh2o m 2 3 6 gc kg 1h2o for maize implying that wheat season sequestered more co2 than maize season for this rotation agroecosystem the multiple stepwise regressions revealed that at the daily scale nep et and wue were dominated by par vpd swc and gc and wue of wheat seemed to be more sensitive to changes in par vpd swc and gc with steeper fitting lines than that of maize par was the dominant factor controlling diurnal dynamics of nep and et in this rotation cropland and the variations of daily wue of 2013 and 2014 were primarily controlled by swc and vpd while in maize season of 2015 it was mainly affected by vpd and par the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range at the sub diurnal timescale nep increasing with par was limited by high vpd while maize nep was limited with vpd under high solar radiation over 500 μmol m 2 s 1 sub diurnal nep against par vpd or temperature showed clockwise hysteresis but sub diurnal et against par or windspeed showed counter clockwise hysteresis these results contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and coupling of carbon and water fluxes over agroecosystems and provide a substantial basis to tackle climate change in semi humid and humid areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8943,it has become increasingly important to quantify carbon and water fluxes due to their roles in global warming and climate change particularly for the agroecosystems however the dynamics of carbon and water fluxes have not been clearly recognized in rotation croplands with complex and changeable climate here the variations of net ecosystem productivity nep evapotranspiration et and the water use efficiency wue defined as nep et and their responses to the environmental factors were investigated in a wheat maize rotation cropland across the huaibei plain of china over 2013 2015 the total average nep et and average wue respectively were 489 1 gc m 2 315 8 kgh2o m 2 4 4 gc kg 1h2o for wheat and 192 5 gc m 2 249 0 kgh2o m 2 3 6 gc kg 1h2o for maize implying that wheat season sequestered more co2 than maize season spring drought and summer flood affected wue of wheat and maize respectively daily wheat wue seemed to be more sensitive to changes in photosynthetically active radiation par vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content swc and canopy conductance gc par was the dominant factor controlling diurnal dynamics of nep and et while the opposite effect of vpd on nep was recognized nep increasing with par was limited by high vpd which obviously when vpd exceeded 2 kpa during the maize season maize nep was limited with vpd under high solar radiation 500 μmol m 2 s 1 wues of wheat and maize were negatively related to swc and gc and the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range sub diurnal nep against par vpd or temperature showed clockwise hysteresis but et against par or windspeed showed counter clockwise hysteresis and these hystereses were mainly caused by the interplay between evaporative demand and

change has significantly affected ecosystem functions and processes including tightly coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycles yang et al 2015 zhang and yuan 2020 carbon and water fluxes are two essential biogeophysical components law et al 2002 their exchanges between the terrestrial surface and atmosphere play a vital role not only in the terrestrial carbon cycle but also in the hydrological processes and energy budget choi et al 2018 gilmanov et al 2003 wang et al 2022 as an important part of terrestrial ecosystems agroecosystems are believed to have great potential to sequester global carbon emissions also through crop rotation and water management practices baldocchi et al 2001 ciais et al 2011 liu et al 2021b schmidt et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 thus the precise quantification of carbon and water fluxes in agroecosystems is crucial to elucidate the physiological responses of crops to environmental conditions project crop management and the food production under climate change baldocchi 2014 knox et al 2015 piao et al 2019 over the past decade carbon and water fluxes such as net ecosystem productivity nep evapotranspiration et over agroecosystems have been the focus of food energy water nexus studies e g wagle et al 2018 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 the eddy covariance ec system is considered as a standard method and has been widely used to provide consecutive measurements of h2o and co2 exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere ec measurements offer great help in investigating the dynamics of the fluxes and the environmental controls as well as estimating the water use efficiency wue beer et al 2009 niu et al 2011 which contributes to better water resource management and agricultural development suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 wue i e co2 assimilation per unit mass of water consumption is an essential indicator for evaluating the effect of saving water on agricultural production during the growing period for agroecosystems wue can be defined as the ratio of nep to et scanlon and albertson 2004 wang et al 2021b the nep et and wue at ecosystem scale vary with plant types environmental controls and even human activities like irrigation drainage hrach et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the assessment of wue over various ecosystems indicated that wue of maize was higher than that of sunflower winter wheat soybean and paddy rice jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhao et al 2007 but lower than that of the forest ito and inatomi 2012 ponton et al 2006 it was reported that there was a consistent seasonal variation in various forms of carbon assimilation including net ecosystem exchange nee gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp and net biome productivity nbp etc liu et al 2021a zhao et al 2007 the nee can be decomposed as two components i e gpp and ecosystem respiration reco using the eddy covariance method previous studies have also shown that the carbon and water fluxes of wheat were larger than those of maize shen et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 although there are various of studies have assessed the carbon and water budgets across different cropland management styles detailed budgets of carbon and water fluxes might facilitate better predictions of agroecosystems responses to climate change therefore the accurate evaluations of nep et and wue in a rotation cropland remain necessary currently radiant energy absorbed by the crop canopy kim and lieth 2003 soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations liu et al 2014 crop phenology bai et al 2015 leaf area index hu et al 2018 and environmental factors such as soil water content swc vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta fernandez martinez et al 2019 jung et al 2017 tao et al 2022 yuan et al 2020 have been found to relate the changes in carbon and water fluxes photosynthetically active radiation par was identified as the primary driver controlling diurnal dynamics of nee and et in irrigated maize field in arid areas while the opposite effects of vpd were identified wang et al 2021b usually wue decreased with increase of vpd while the response of wue to par and swc is controversial for instance some results suggest that the increased swc can lead to the increase of carbon uptake which thus improved wue humphrey et al 2021 but other experiments showed that wue declined with the increase of swc wang et al 2021a besides high vpd would decrease wue of maize growing in irrigated agroecosystems in arid areas wang et al 2021b further the response of wue to drought in humid regions was different from and even contrary to that in arid regions xu et al 2019 it should be noted that for the similar wheat maize rotation cropland the factors affecting carbon and water fluxes in different climate regions are different sun et al 2016 wang et al 2022 therefore investigating the controls of the environmental factors on the variation in carbon and water fluxes is necessary for specific regions alternatively the hysteresis between pairs of et and vpd nep and par reco and temperature have been mainly investigated by bodies of studies chen et al 2020 phillips et al 2011 riveros iregui et al 2007 recently over a large ephemeral lake in china cui et al 2020 illustrated that surface net radiation wind speed and temperature difference dominants would control the hysteresis effects and regulate latent heat flux variations xu et al 2022 assessed the hysteresis between sub diurnal et and vpd at the ecosystem scale and found that in seasonally dry locations low soil moisture availability amplified the hysteresis during the dry season also hysteresis between nee and soil temperature has been identified tramontana et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 overall attributable to changes in the environment and interactions within the soil plant atmosphere continuum ecosystem carbon and water fluxes hysteresis phenomena have also been observed across different time scales such as the diurnal and seasonal cycles lin et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 even hysteresis has been previously observed in the agroecosystems riveros iregui et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 in humid and sub humid areas the hysteresis effect on the carbon and water fluxes i e nep and et of wheat maize rotation cropland is still ambiguous and needs to be further evaluated the huaibei plain is one of china s important commodity grain production bases and it belongs to a warm temperate sub humid monsoon climate zone as typical and representative agricultural crops of this region wheat and maize have important ecological functions such as maintaining ecosystem integrity and biodiversity conservation lu et al 2019 several studies have reported croplands in the north china plain as a weak co2 source e g li et al 2006 luo et al 2008 while zhang et al 2020 indicated that the wheat was a weak co2 sink and maize was close to co2 neutral to the atmosphere that is whether the huaibei plain is a carbon source or a carbon sink is inconclusive further it should be noted that seasonal flood or drought frequently occurs in this region yuan et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 thus understanding the variation and attribution of wue over this rotation cropland are important for the local hydrological process and water resources utilization therefore with the ec measuring of carbon and water fluxes i e nep and et across a wheat maize rotation cropland over the huaibei plain of china during the 2013 2015 agricultural cycles we investigated the dynamics of carbon and water fluxes and their responses to the environmental factors the main objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the carbon and water fluxes i e nep et and their coupling wue in this rotation cropland 2 characterize the diurnal and seasonal variations of the fluxes and identify the contributing factor and 3 decompose the mechanisms of diurnal hysteresis between the fluxes and environmental conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site description this study was conducted at the wudaogou hydrology and water resources experimental site wdg site 33 09 n 117 21 e in the huaibei plain northern anhui province china fig 1 the huaibei plain belongs to the southern part of north china plain and is an important commodity grain base in china it is characterized by a semi humid monsoon climate being dry in spring and winter warm and rainy in summer and autumn precipitation in the huaibei plain is mainly concentrated from june to september accounting for more than 60 of the total annual rainfall during the 30 year period from 1992 to 2021 the mean annual temperature and precipitation at the wdg site were 15 1 c and 954 2 mm respectively the crop layout is mainly dry crops including winter wheat maize soybean peanut and cotton gou et al 2020 the representative cropping style in this region is winter wheat and summer maize double cropping rotation during the past years the wheat was sown around 1st november and harvested around 25th may of the following year with crop residues left on the field the maize was sown following the wheat harvest around 15th june and harvested around 25th september straw was chopped 5 cm by an automated machine and returned to the field at harvest time seeds were directly drilled into the soil and plowing of the top soil 0 15 cm occurred once a year after the harvest of the maize crop in october irrigation is generally not needed in this region for the effective precipitation can meet the crop water requirements in this study carbon and water fluxes during three wheat maize growing seasons in 2013 2015 were continuously observed by ec system over the field 2 2 eddy covariance and meteorological measurements the carbon and water fluxes i e nep and et between the biosphere and atmosphere were measured by an open path eddy covariance system ec150 campbell scientific inc usa csat3 campbell scientific inc usa which was installed at the 6 86 m height above the ground surface the original data were recorded at a frequency of 10 hz with a datalogger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa the main wind directions of this area are east and northeast and the eddy covariance system was installed in the northeast direction fig 1 further the footprint of flux source was conducted using the kljun model kljun et al 2015 the system performance was assessed by linear regression of the energy balance closure with the sum of sensible plus latent heat flux h le measured from eddy covariance as the dependent variable and the difference between net radiation and ground heat flux rn g measured from the meteorological sensors as the independent variable rodrigues et al 2014 the slope of regression can be seen as the energy balance ratio ebr and the ratios for all half hourly data were 0 58 in wheat season and 0 60 in maize season respectively it should be noted that the slope varies from 0 49 to 0 81 at the sites included in china flux li et al 2005 indicating that the flux observed data at this site are reliable the environmental factors including air temperature ta relative humidity rh photosynthetically active radiation par and wind speed ws were automatically measured by the auxiliary equipment installed at the tower meteorological sensors included a combined humidity and temperature sensor hmp155a vaisala inc finland a par

data with standard procedures which included the double coordinate rotation correction for density fluctuations wpl correction webb et al 1980 and the spectral and de spiking correction liu et al 2021a paw et al 2000 after the corrections f c data was output over 30 minute intervals wue gc kg 1 h2o was calculated as the ratio of nep to et according the previous studies i e kuglitsch et al 2008 wang et al 2021a 3 wue nep et a series of quality control was implemented before data analysis we removed the flux data which were monitored when the sensors failed or being repaired or calibrated some peak values caused by rain and other reasons also were rejected liu et al 2021a besides co2 flux data with friction velocity u less than 0 1 m s 1 at night were also removed rana et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 ultimately about 45 unqualified data was lost therefore we filled the gaps by two different ways in daytime and nighttime the gaps of daytime nee were filled by a light response curve known as the michaelis menten model falge et al 2001 and in the nighttime the measured nee can be described as ecosystem respiration reco which can be gap filled by a soil temperature dependent exponential

sensing leaf area index lai was used to monitor the phenology of crops at this site kong et al 2020 the remote sensing data was collected from the modis reflectance product https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov lai was derived from the product mod15a2h the temporal and spatial resolutions of lai were 8 day and 500 m respectively and the lai was extracted by the area of the wdg site located in 2 5 statistical analysis the pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation degree of two variables hegyi and laczi 2015 meanwhile the linear and non linear regressions were applied to analyze the relationships between fluxes i e nep et and wue and environmental factors the multiple linear regression a widely used method to identify the dominant variables associated with carbon and water fluxes was employed to possibly explain the underlying mechanisms of changes in daily water carbon fluxes four meteorological and hydrological factors i e par vpd swc and gc were selected as the main influencing factors at the daily scale furthermore we examined the half hourly responses of et to the meteorological factors including par vpd ta and ws and examined the half hourly responses of nep to the factors including par vpd ta and ts 3 results 3 1 meteorological and physiological conditions daily variations in environmental and biological factors during the study period of 1st november 2012 31st october 2015 at the wdg site are illustrated in fig 2 including mean daytime ta par vpd p ts and swc at different layers lai and gc obviously the par and vpd showed similar seasonal variations with ta the average daytime ta was respectively 8 2 9 1 and 8 9 27 4 24 6 and 24 8 par was respectively 239 8 210 7 and 188 6 μmol m 2 s 1 375 8 258 1 and 248 7 μmol m 2 s 1 for six growing periods wheat and maize of 2013 2014 and 2015 the vpd was comparatively low 1 0 kpa and showed higher values from june to august in particular the par gradually increased from january and reached its plateau in summer late july or early august with maximum value of 594 1 μmol m 2 s 1 ts of different depths 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 100 cm and 150 cm had similar seasonal dynamics to ta fig 2a the total p was 270 0 342 3 and 332 7 mm during the wheat growing period of 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively but 479 1 484 8 837 8 mm for summer maize fig 2c in addition swc varied in a similar way but late to p showing an obvious decrease in december to next may due to the winter and spring drought fig 2c the maximum daily average swc 0 446 m3 m 3 across the 10 cm soil layer occurred on september 2nd 2014 the lai varied with growing season in the rotation cropland fig 2d during the year of 2013 lai rapidly increased during crop development reaching the first maximum value of 5 65 m2 m 2 at april 23th wheat season and the second maximum value of 5 56 m2 m 2 at august 13th maize season the maximum lai of wheat during the three growing periods was about 5 73 m2 m 2 and slightly higher than that of maize 5 56 m2 m 2 the variation in lai at the wdg site can distinguish the different crop development stages subsequently the minimum lai of 2 14 m2 m 2 was found during the period of water stress november 16th 2012 february 2nd 2013 fig 2d the corresponding lai reduction is due to either drought induced limitation of leaf area expansion or temporary leaf wilting during periods of severe stress in addition as the indicator of stomatal regulation at the canopy level gc of summer maize varied from 1 4 to 27 0 mm s 1 with the mean value of 7 0 mm s 1 which was also lower than that of winter wheat 8 0 mm s 1 3 2 changes of carbon and water fluxes the daily water and carbon fluxes i e nep et and their coupling wue in this rotation cropland are shown in fig 3 seasonal variations of et and nep for wheat and maize presented different normal distribution curves but distinct seasonal cycles existed in et and nep variabilities with a lower amplitude in winter and the drought season and higher amplitude in the growing season when the solar zenith angle was high during the growing season the duration of positive values in nep was long generally the mean total nep was 489 1 and 192 5 gc m 2 respectively for wheat and maize growing periods 2013 2015 at the wdg site the average total et and average wue respectively were 315 8 kgh2o m 2 4 4 gc kg 1h2o for winter wheat and 249 0 kgh2o m 2 3 6 gc kg 1h2o for summer maize from february to april nep ranged from 0 0 to 12 0 gc m 2 d 1 and et ranged from 0 5 to 4 kgh2o m 2 particularly the wue increased in wheat season of 2013 but decreased in 2014 and 2015 fig 3c this was attributed to the mismatch of nep and et phases as for the maize seasons the wue increased but the averaged values in 2013 and 2014 4 1 and 4 2 gc kg 1h2o respectively were much larger than that in 2015 2 6 gc kg 1h2o besides when considering the net co2 loss of 319 5 gc m 2 during the three fallow periods the total nep of three full 2013 2015 cycles was 1725 3 gc m 2 suggesting that the cropland was a strong carbon sink under this field management practice to further investigate the differences in water and carbon fluxes between two different crop seasons hourly variations of nep et and wue in the wheat and maize seasons of different years are respectively plotted in fig 4 evident diurnal variation pattern of daytime uptake and nighttime release for nep was detected nep moved from a negative value release to a positive value uptake after dawn then the c sequestration rate achieved the peak value between 11 00 and 13 00 at midday and afterward it began to decline the diurnal patterns of nep and et depend on the interaction between the atmosphere and physiological response fernandez martinez et al 2019 wue showed similar diurnal variations in six growing seasons with the maximum wue appearing in the early morning and then wue showed a decline trend in the wheat season average daytime wue was 3 7 4 5 and 4 3 gc kg 1h2o respectively for 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 4a c e while in the maize season average daytime wue was 3 8 4 0 and 2 3 gc kg 1h2o respectively fig 4b d f spring drought and summer flood resulted in wue of wheat for 2013 and maize for 2015 respectively figs 2c 4a and f it is worth noting that nep reached the plateau ahead of et about 0 2 0 h in the morning fig 4 the main reason for the low wue around the noon was perhaps the incomplete synchronous diurnal patterns of nep and et compared to summer maize the diurnal variation of wue in winter wheat was higher it may be due to the lower et 3 3 identification analysis of environmental factors relationships between the daily flux nep et and wue and environmental factors were explored using the multiple stepwise regression model table 1 the nep was positively correlated with par but negatively correlated with vpd swc and gc contrarily the et was positive with par vpd and gc while the mechanism between wue and environmental variables is confused e g negatively correlated with swc in 2013 and 2014 but positively correlated with swc in 2015 in 2013 and 2014 wue was primarily controlled by swc and vpd while for maize season in 2015 it was mainly affected by vpd and par at the sub diurnal timescale the most dominating factor for wheat and maize nep et increase was the augmented radiation table 2 followed by the temperature and vpd it also can be found that the variation of nep of winter wheat relied on par heavier than that of summer maize which is inconsistent with the results at the daily timescale indicating that some phenomena have been weakened as the time scale expands both daily nep and et were positively correlated with par during wheat and maize growing seasons fig 5a e and fig s1 contrarily nep was negative with swc and gc except that nep in maize growing season of 2013 fig 5g et was positively correlated with gc except that in the maize season of 2015 and negatively correlated with swc except wheat season in 2014 and maize season in 2013 vpd showed positive effects on nep during both the wheat and maize seasons but there were thresholds vpd seemed to have a limitation effect on nep after vpd exceeding about 0 6 and 0 8 kpa respectively for wheat and maize season fig 5b and f the results indicated that the most dominating factor for nep and et increase was the augmented radiation followed by the vpd and gc for winter wheat par and vpd showed positive effects while swc and gc showed negative effects on wue in three different years except wheat wue vs swc during 2015 figs s2 in summary wheat wue seemed more sensitive to changes in par vpd swc and gc with steeper fitting lines than that of maize the effects of swc and gc on nep et and wue under different par or vpd ranges were also investigated figs 6 7 s3 s6 nep et of winter wheat was negatively related to swc under all par or vpd conditions but nep et of summer maize was positively related to swc which is consistent with the results in fig 5 further this phenomenon is especially evident at high par or vpd values fig 6h j k nep et increased more with the increase of gc when par 300 μmol m 2 s 1 or vpd 0 4 kpa for winter wheat and vpd 0 8 kpa for summer maize fig 7b e g h j k overall wues of wheat and maize were negatively related to swc and gc under all par or vpd conditions and the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range 3 4 responses of sub diurnal nep et and wue to meteorological factors at the sub diurnal scale the slopes between nep and par decreased with the increasing vpd which suggested that nep increasing with par was limited by high vpd this phenomenon occurred obviously when vpd exceeded 2 kpa during the maize season fig 8d figs s7 and s8 it maybe because that under high vpd conditions wheat and maize tended to close their stomata which limits photosynthetic activities while the positive responses of et par were much distinct the slopes of the relationship between et and par were inapparently increasing with the increase in vpd ranges in all three years except the slopes of et par decreased with the increasing vpd for the maize seasons in 2014 and 2015 figs s7 and s8 this illustrated that in years with abundant rainfall the maize et was limited with high water vapor condition fig 2b and d wue was not obviously affected by par condition under different vpd ranges the slopes between nep and vpd changed from positive to negative with the increasing par especially during the maize seasons fig 9d figs s9 and s10 this illustrated that the maize nep was limited with vpd under high solar radiation over 500 μmol m 2 s 1 compared with the conditions of par 500 μmol m 2 s 1 and par 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 the slopes of et vpd during maize seasons in 2013 and 2015 wheat seasons in 2014 and 2015 were basically unchanged under 500 par 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 condition while slopes of wue vpd were negative especially under high solar radiation over 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 condition 3 5 hysteresis between water carbon fluxes and environmental variables interactions among environmental variables may introduce uncertainty in the identification of controlling factors and the hysteresis effects are attributable in regulating the carbon and water fluxes dynamics the distinct hysteresis loop was evident in the relationship between carbon and water fluxes and par vpd ta and ts ws for both wheat and maize seasons fig 10 s11 and s12 apparently the diel courses between nep and par vpd ta and ts formed clockwise loops from morning to evening fig 10a d g and j it indicates that nep was higher in the morning heating phase than cooling phase in afternoon under the same surface net radiation atmospheric moisture or temperature the clockwise loops between nep and par vpd or temperature differed in shape in comparison with vpd the hysteresis between nep and par was relatively weak particularly during the wheat season for the water flux et the loop with par emerged as counterclockwise with an enhanced hysteresis fig 10b also counterclockwise loops of et with ws were found fig 10k while et had clockwise loops with either vpd or ta fig 10e h vpd increased rapidly during the morning and peaks at about 13 30 14 30 and then dramatically decreased fig 10 f these clockwise loops agree with existing observations phillips et al 2011 pingintha et al 2011 nep et aligned well with par or vpd and peaked at 13 00 14 00 notably nep or et had rapid reductions even ta changed very slightly between 15 00 and 18 00 implying nep or et is more insensitive to ta in the afternoon than in the morning moreover the hysteresis loops of nep et and par vpd or ta were much weaker during the wheat season when compared to the maize season during the wheat season as vpd increased in the morning nep increased reaching the peak value 0 271 gc m 2 s 1 at vpd of 0 886 kpa and then rapidly decreased reaching almost zero at 18 00 o clock fig 10d in maize season as par increased in the morning nep increased and reached the peak value 0 365 gc m 2 s 1 at the highest par of 1304 7 μmol m 2 s 1 and as par decreased in the afternoon nep declined fig 10d in the morning as par or vpd increased carbon uptake increased but in the afternoon carbon uptake at any given par or vpd was slightly lower than the rate in the morning at the same par or vpd during the maize season sub diurnal et approximately increased linearly with par at about 12 30 and then declined with decreasing par fig 10b similar results can also be seen for wheat and maize seasons in 2014 and 2015 figs s11 and s12 4 discussion 4 1 variations in carbon and water fluxes at the annual scale as the negative form of nep nee presented large variations across the globe 746 to 319 gc m 2 depending on the environmental conditions crop rotation and other management practices diaz et al 2019 knox et al 2015 during the past 20 years the trend of global nee was negative which means that the c sequestration capacity of terrestrial ecosystems has increased norton et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 some studies have reported that wheat maize rotation croplands across the north china plain as carbon source and nees of these regions became less negative during the past decade 2005 2016 implying a progressive decline of the c sequestration potential e g luo et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 in this study for the period of 2013 2015 the wheat maize rotation cropland showed strong co2 sink with the cumulative nep of three full 2013 2015 cycles being 1725 3 gc m 2 generally the mean total nep of 575 gc m 2 at the wdg site was about 1 3 times the total nep of a wheat maize rotation cropland at weishan site during a 2010 2011 agricultural cycle over the north china plain 438 gc m 2 zhang et al 2020 despite the co2 loss during the fallow period reversed the cropland from a sink into a source this wheat maize rotation cropland acted as a strong co2 sink fig 3 comparing with nees of two paddy fields in southern china 750 gc m 2 liu et al 2021a a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system in the north china plain ranged from 857 to 274 gc m 2 tao et al 2022 a continental monsoon temperate forest in northeast china 160 gc m 2 liu et al 2021b and a drip irrigated cotton field in an oasis of northwest china 100 gc m 2 ming et al 2021 etc this result is not consistent with previous studies that reported the wheat maize rotation cropland as a weak co2 source and the higher nep at wdg site may partially result from the sufficient rainfall the mean annual p was about twice that of weishan and luancheng sites and fertilization wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 also since the large application rates of irrigation and fertilization wheat maize rotation systems in the north china plain were a medium source of greenhouse gas emissions in most of years tao et al 2022 the average total et respectively was 315 8 kgh2o m 2 for wheat and 249 0 kgh2o m 2 for maize et increased in wheat seasons and decreased in maize seasons which was positively correlated with p ta and par figs 2 and 5 note that the ebrs for half hourly data measured from eddy covariance at this site were 0 58 in wheat season and 0 60 in maize season respectively it seems that the measurement accuracy of et is relatively low comparing with the performance of the national sites included in china flux with the ebr ranging of 0 49 0 81 li et al 2005 some studies have confirmed that the energy imbalance was attributable to the available energy might be site specific to a certain degree widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 the low ebrs mean that turbulent energy fluxes were underestimated which could result in the overestimated wue nevertheless compared with the arid and semi arid regions wang et al 2018 wang et al 2021b the average wue of maize across the huaibei plain of china was a bit lower because the higher et obvious diurnal variabilities of carbon and water fluxes were observed and this also varied with seasons having slightly lower amplitudes in wheat seasons and higher amplitudes in maize seasons fig 4 although the measured p in 2015 837 8 mm was larger than that in 2013 and 2014 maize wue of 2014 was 61 5 higher than that of 2015 spring drought of 2013 also led to a lower wheat wue figs 2c and 4 this suggested that the excess p in 2015 limited nep and wue but increased et whilst during the drought period the stress of water deficit can restrain the vegetation growth resulting a decreased wue some literatures also reported that a drying trend appropriate drainage measures or water stress could result in decreased et and increased wue for hype arid sub humid and humid regions jiang et al 2022 tesfaye et al 2021 xu et al 2019 even the two different effects from the increase in temperature and radiation positive effect and the stress of water deficit negative effect could result in amphibolous change in wue considering the frequent droughts and floods along the huaihe river basin throughout history yuan et al 2019 in future spring irrigation summer irrigation and drainage should be effectively increased to improve the wue moreover since different photosynthetic pathways in c3 and c4 crops it is stated that wue of c4 crop maize cropland was apparently higher emmerich 2007 wang et al 2018 this conclusion is inconsistent with the result of this study nevertheless the winter wheat summer maize rotation system may help raise the yield potential 4 2 environmental and biotic controls on carbon and water fluxes for the agricultural ecosystem crop management activities like field with milk vetch rotation irrigation practice and nitrogen fertilizer as well as the environmental fluctuations can affect the exchange of co2 and h2o liu et al 2021a weller et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 found that ta radiation and groundwater depth had pronounced correlations with the co2 fluxes for wheat and maize seasons net radiation and surface conductance were identified to be the two primary controlling factors of et for both the summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons across various regions wang et al 2022 some studies found that warming hiatus accelerated the terrestrial carbon sequestration by reducing reco ballantyne et al 2017 in this study spring drought in 2013 and summer flood in 2015 may be the dominant factors of difference in the correlation between environmental factors and water carbon fluxes and wue show opposite results in different years fig 5g figs s1 and s2 our research suggested that the variation of daily wue of 2013 and 2014 were primarily controlled by swc and vpd while in maize season of 2015 it was mainly affected by vpd and par fig 5 and table 1 this difference indicated that if precipitation is abundant the stress of water deficit played a stronger effect on wue than the increase in temperature and radiation wues of wheat and maize were negatively related to swc and gc and this negative relationship obtained in the current study was consistent with previous literature jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range figs 6 7 s3 s6 in the future vpd is predicted to increase and par tends to decrease delucia et al 2019 yang et al 2018 therefore the response of future wue to swc or gc would remain controversial which should be analyzed specifically for the certain region and underlying surface type another interesting result is that on the diurnal timescale nep and et increasing with par were limited by high vpd and this limitation on carbon flux i e nep was more severe than it on water flux i e et while wue was not obviously affected by par condition under different vpd ranges figs 8 and 9 this phenomenon maybe resulted from the effect of vpd on wue would be regulated by soil water availability wang et al 2021b under higher solar radiation par 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 the maize nep decreased and et increased with increasing vpd resulting in a rapid decline of wue fig 9f figs s9 and s10 this result also is consistent with previous studies which confirmed a negative relationship between wue and vpd kuglitsch et al 2008 li et al 2015 both ecosystem fluxes i e co2 and h2o fluxes and environmental conditions experience diurnal changes reaching peaks at different times and leading to a hysteresis effect zhou et al 2014 these carbon and water fluxes par vpd or temperature hysteresis are acknowledged to be resulted from the complex interactions between physical and physiological processes xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 in this current study stronger hysteresis between nep et and par vpd temperature and ws were observed and nep was found to be slightly higher in the morning fig 10 s11 and s12 these results are consistent with previous studies that have more conclusively shown that plants experience higher opening of stomata in the morning when vpd is lower and internal water stress is lower generating more nep e g de carcer et al 2018 savage et al 2013 this phenomenon is particularly obvious in the forests lin et al 2019 while in our study the rotation cropland experienced comparable ecosystem conductance during the morning and afternoon but exhibit minimal water stress overall our results also imply that the hysteresis is stronger over the maize season when the temperature is high and the water heat carbon transport is active this more obvious hysteresis may be related to the adaptive mechanism of crop maize growth rashid et al 2018 likely the asymmetrical behaviors between co2 h2o fluxes and environmental conditions can be largely explained by the closure of stomata under water stress conditions fatichi et al 2016 pilegaard et al 2011 unsworth et al 2004 and changes in plant hydraulic conductivity lin et al 2019 o grady et al 1999 these findings can enrich our current understanding on the coupling relationship between the ecosystems and the environment yet the mechanisms behind the diurnal hysteresis effects more systematic studies under dynamic environmental variations and across multiple plant functional types are still needed to be further captured 5 conclusions this study investigated the environmental and biotic controls on the seasonal and diurnal changes in carbon and water fluxes across a wheat maize rotation cropland over the huaibei plain of china during the three 2013 2015 agricultural cycles we found this wheat maize rotation cropland was a strong co2 sink the mean total nep being 575 gc m 2 during the year of 2013 2015 even co2 released during the fallow period was considered the total average nep et and average wue respectively were 489 1 gc m 2 315 8 kgh2o m 2 4 4 gc kg 1h2o for wheat and 192 5 gc m 2 249 0 kgh2o m 2 3 6 gc kg 1h2o for maize implying that wheat season sequestered more co2 than maize season for this rotation agroecosystem the multiple stepwise regressions revealed that at the daily scale nep et and wue were dominated by par vpd swc and gc and wue of wheat seemed to be more sensitive to changes in par vpd swc and gc with steeper fitting lines than that of maize par was the dominant factor controlling diurnal dynamics of nep and et in this rotation cropland and the variations of daily wue of 2013 and 2014 were primarily controlled by swc and vpd while in maize season of 2015 it was mainly affected by vpd and par the sensitivity of wue response to swc and gc increased with the increase of par or vpd range at the sub diurnal timescale nep increasing with par was limited by high vpd while maize nep was limited with vpd under high solar radiation over 500 μmol m 2 s 1 sub diurnal nep against par vpd or temperature showed clockwise hysteresis but sub diurnal et against par or windspeed showed counter clockwise hysteresis these results contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and coupling of carbon and water fluxes over agroecosystems and provide a substantial basis to tackle climate change in semi humid and humid areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8944,agricultural drought threatens global water security food security and natural ecosystems accurate identification of agricultural drought is a crucial task to mitigate its consequences however it is challenging to achieve reliable and accurate regional agricultural drought assessment in both wet and dry climates at the same time therefore the objective of this study is to identify a reliable and accurate agricultural drought index that performs well in both dry and wet climates drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi the vegetation condition index vci the soil moisture anomaly index sma and the drought severity index dsi were calculated and compared against in situ drought information devised by official sources in china the results showed that 1 dsi based on the global land data assimilation system gldas products performed the best in identifying agricultural drought in both dry and wet climate regions of china 2 agricultural regions such as northern arid and semiarid regions northeast china plain huang huai hai plain and loess plateau experienced moderate and severe agricultural droughts with a frequency of 20 3 the frequency of agricultural droughts observed in northern arid and semi arid regions and northeast china plain has slowed significantly over the last two decades with a significance level of 0 01 on the other hand the number of agricultural droughts has increased in yunnan guizhou plateau since 2002 graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural drought soil moisture gldas drought severity index drought frequency china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the world s most devastating natural disasters hao and singh 2015 and in recent decades the occurrence of droughts have become more frequent due to global warming piao et al 2010 drought is commonly classified into the following categories meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought eslamian et al 2017 mishra and singh 2010 among them agricultural drought directly damages the natural ecosystems and dramatically reduces crop yields in some cases agricultural droughts can develop rapidly also referred to as flash droughts making them more difficult to manage basara et al 2019 christian et al 2021 otkin et al 2018 for instance the united states us drought of 2012 was an extreme event of historic proportions which caused over 30 billion in economic losses basara et al 2019 similarly eastern australia experienced severe flash drought and forest fires in the summer of 2019 nguyen et al 2021 china also experienced several costly agricultural droughts in the past decade the drought in the yangtze river basin resulted in 1 5 billion in losses during the summer of 2011 affecting the lives of about 30 million people christian et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 a drought in the summer of 2013 destroyed over 2 million hectares of crops in the provinces of guizhou and hunan yuan et al 2015 therefore it is essential to accurately monitor agricultural droughts to mitigate their negative effects on agriculture food production natural ecosystems and freshwater resources drought indices based on different parameters were devised to measure agricultural drought dalezios et al 2017 eslamian et al 2017 keyantash and dracup 2002 for instance soil moisture sm is the key component of water transport thus making it a fundamental indicator for agricultural drought monitoring brocca et al 2011 brocca et al 2010 liu et al 2019 the standardized soil moisture index ssi aghakouchak 2014 the soil water deficit index swdi martínez fernández et al 2015 the drought severity index dsi cammalleri et al 2015 the soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi liu et al 2019 and the soil moisture anomaly index shahzaman et al 2021 can be given as examples of the sm based drought indices agricultural drought usually follows meteorological drought therefore it was shown that a precipitation deficit accumulated over 3 6 months can be also an indicator of agricultural drought dai et al 2020 mckee et al 1993 teweldebirhan tsige et al 2019 meteorological drought is commonly measured by the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1995 mckee et al 1993 besides spi the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 calculated from precipitation and temperature datasets are also employed to monitor meteorological and agricultural droughts in addition some studies showed that vegetation status can also serve as an indicator of agricultural drought via the crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 the vegetation condition index vci kogan 2007 liu and kogan 1996 and the vegetation health index vhi rojas et al 2011 unganai and kogan 1998 drought indices estimated from the ground observations of sm precipitation and temperature at weather stations are the most reliable and accurate methods to monitor agricultural conditions srivastava 2017 however such stations are not spatially well distributed across china additionally point based measurements may not be a good representative to reflect the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought indicators thereby making them unsuitable for large scale drought monitoring yuan et al 2015 in the last two decades numerous satellite based precipitation vegetation index and sm products have become available through the development of satellite remote sensing technology bartalis et al 2007 the sm products from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci products the soil moisture active passive smap products and the global land assimilation system gldas have been widely used in agricultural drought assessment brocca et al 2011 ford and quiring 2019 hunt et al 2009 mishra et al 2017 shahzaman et al 2021 for instance the drought indices calculated from these products have been applied to measure agricultural droughts in china chen et al 2020 zeng et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 however there have been disagreements over the extent and frequency of agricultural droughts in china the first group of researchers suggested that droughts were more frequent and widespread in china chen and sun 2015 li et al 2008 yu et al 2014 the other group concluded that the frequency of droughts was slowing down or not changing significantly wang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 zou et al 2005 the main reason for these contradictory results can be the choice of drought indices and the accuracy of satellite products used to derive drought indices for example the meteorological drought indices may not solely be appropriate and adequate to assess agricultural drought due to the lag between agricultural and meteorological drought ding et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b in addition the number of currently available sm products used in drought research is abundant and their accuracy varies considerably zheng et al 2022 it is always challenging to select reliable drought index and dataset to achieve accurate regional agricultural drought assessment in all climate types many studies have been carried out to test the performance of drought indices in china guo et al 2019 xu et al 2022 zhao et al 2017b xu et al 2022 devised a new drought index and zhao et al 2017 modified an existing drought index to improve the accuracy of drought assessment however the accuracy of agricultural drought indices used in these studies were only compared to the results of other meteorological drought indices xu et al 2022 or ground measurements of sm zhao et al 2017a for example zhao and wang 2021 carried out the validation study only in in wet and semi humid zones of china additionally previous studies didn t analyze the impact of input sm datasets to the sm based drought indices such as sma and dsi into account since the drought indices focus on different aspect of drought in various region the accuracy of the drought indices has to be assessed in different climate zones to see overall of performance of these indices to monitor agricultural droughts at large scales the objectives of this study are as follows 1 investigate the accuracy of the drought indices in three provinces with diverse climates 2 highlight the impact of input dataset to the sm based drought indices 3 examine the drought characteristics of nine major agricultural regions in china in the end this study strives to provide a reliable method for the accurate assessment of agricultural drought using remote sensing products in arid semi arid temperate and humid climatic regions of china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area china is a vast country with complex topography and climate divided into four major climatic zones and nine major agricultural regions fig 1 these four climate zones arid semi arid semi humid and humid are determined by the dryness index calculated from the climate data of the national meteorological administration of china between 1951 and 1970 zhu 1962 china was divided into nine agricultural regions based on three criteria provincial borders climate types and crop planting characteristics china a major producer and importer of crops such as wheat and maize supplies food to 22 of the world population even though it has only 7 of the world s cultivated land liu and zhang 2010 piao et al 2010 in the last two decades china suffered from agricultural droughts which in turn led to serious losses in agricultural production and ecological damage leng et al 2015 wang et al 2019b yu and zhai 2020 zhang et al 2021a agricultural drought monitoring is the basis of agricultural management and is of great significance to china s sustainable development in this study three provinces gansu hebei and yunnan were selected to assess the applicability and accuracy of data products in the derivation of drought indices fig 1a gansu and hebei are located in the arid and temperate regions of china respectively while yunnan is mainly in the humid zone table 1 the actual agricultural drought years of these provinces were collected from the china

index spi a prolonged precipitation deficit is the direct cause of the meteorological drought the spi is a commonly used index in drought monitoring based on a standardized method of precipitation scarcity agnew 2000 mckee et al 1995 mckee et al 1993 in addition the world meteorological organization wmo recommends spi for meteorological drought identification hao and aghakouchak 2013 hayes et al 2011 the index calculates the gamma probability distribution function of the precipitation time series and then converts the cumulative gamma probability into a cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution with the gradual development of studies on drought propagation spi3 and spi6 were accepted for agricultural drought or hydrological drought studies due to the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought or hydrological drought over approximately 3 6 months forootan et al 2019 it has been suggested that spi3 is more suitable for identifying drought events that eventually affect agricultural practices gebrehiwot et al 2011 in this paper spi3 was selected to make comparisons between drought indices 2 3 2 vegetation condition index vci vegetation indices have been commonly used to determine drought conditions ndvi is sensitive to changes in both sm and annual weather conditions the vegetation condition index vci was devised to highlight ndvi changes related to annual weather and soil moisture conditions higher vci values indicate wetter conditions or high vegetation moisture content while lower vci values indicate stressed or dry vegetation conditions liu and kogan 1996 vci is calculated from eq 1 1 v c i j n d v i j n d v i min n d v i max n d v i min where v c i j is the vci in period j of a particular year n d v i j is the ndvi in period j of a particular year n d v i max is the maximum value of ndvi in period j of the study years n d v i min is the minimum value of ndvi in period j of the study years 2 3 3 soil moisture anomaly index sma the soil moisture anomaly index sma is a common index to monitor agricultural drought conditions shahzaman et al 2021 which can be calculated by eq 2 2 s m a s m i μ σ s m i μ and σ are the monthly sm value and mean and the standard deviation of the month respectively 2 3 4 drought severity index dsi the drought severity index dsi was proposed by cammalleri et al 2015 to identify agricultural droughts in europe by considering the water deficit factor and dryness probability factor dsi can be calculated from eq 3 1 3 1 d s i p d where p and d are the dryness probability index and soil moisture deficit index respectively later d and p can be estimated by eq 3 2 and eq 3 3 respectively 3 2 d 1 1 θ θ 50 n 3 3 p exp f d 1 2 0 03 where θ is the soil moisture θ 50 is the average between θ 50 and θ w p and n is an empirical shape factor while f d is the standard percentile of the cumulative probability function of the beta distribution concerning d furthermore θ c r is the critical θ at which soil water availability limits evapotranspiration and θ w p is the minimal of θ the plant not to wilt in the end monthly drought maps were classified by the thresholds given in table 3 to identify agricultural drought events in china between 2000 and 2019 2 3 5 statistical analysis using soil plant air water field pond hydrology version 6 02 70 spaw software the field capacity and wilting point were calculated based on the harmonized world soil database 1 2 https www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 the mann kendall mk test was used for trend analysis of agricultural drought in china yue and wang 2002 taylor diagram which contains three statistical indices standard deviation sd root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r was selected to cross validate the drought indices finally the hit rate h analysis was conducted to evaluate how well drought indices can identify drought events correctly h can be calculated from eq 4 ford and quiring 2019 golian et al 2019 4 h h h m f where h is the hit rate and h m and f are the number of hits misses and false alarms respectively 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal distribution of data products the 2000 2019 average of gpcc prcp ndvi from spot vgt and proba v and sm from four datasets were shown in fig 2 where gansu hebei and yunnan provinces are marked by black lines the zonal statistics tool in arcgis toolbox was used to calculate the multi year averages of these drought indicators shown in fig 2 spatially all three provinces exhibited a distinct northwest southeast gradient in prcp ndvi and sm the densely vegetated areas lie in southwest regions of these provinces due to abundant prcp subsequently sm sparse vegetation dominated the dry northeast regions the highest spatial heterogeneity is seen in yunnan where the southern parts receive prcp annually about 400 mm while the average prcp in the central and northern parts is less than 200 mm per year the era5 land product showed a large contrast in sm while other sm products indicated a small discrepancy between the southeast and northeast regions of china among the sm products a good spatial agreement was observed between gldas and merra 2 in terms of magnitude there was a large variation in ndvi prcp and sm gansu yunnan experienced the driest wettest conditions while the conditions in hebei were moderate fig 3 in gansu the monthly prcp ranged between 0 and 100 mm the ndvi was in the range of 0 1 0 4 and the sm was around 0 2 m3 m3 except for fldas where the sm value was significantly higher than the other four products in hebei the prcp ndvi and sm varied from 0 to 250 mm 0 2 0 7 and 0 2 0 3 m3 m3 respectively additionally gldas sm was slightly lower than the other sm products in yunnan the monthly prcp ndvi and sm ranged from 0 to 300 mm 0 4 0 75 and 0 25 0 45 m3 m3 respectively the sm products varied more consistently in yunnan achieving similar peak values between 2000 and 2019 in gansu and hebei both ndvi and sm lagged prcp and the lag of sm to prcp was 2 months longer than the lag of ndvi to prcp however the peaks in sm and ndvi occurred at the same time in yunnan thereby indicating similar lags to rainfall events this also indicates that sm in yunnan is more responsive to rainfall events the comparison of the four sm products suggested that era5 land showed the highest sm values in hebei and yunnan provinces whereas fldas showed the highest sm in gansu province there was a small discrepancy in the sm products in hebei while the sm products were inconsistent in hebei especially merra 2 sm was nearly two times greater than era5 land sm 3 2 comparison of agricultural drought indices the threshold values table 3 were used to infer drought events from drought indices the spi1 and spi3 were calculated using gpcc prcp data while the vci was calculated using the ndvi products acquired by spot vgt and proba v missions additionally the sma and dsi were calculated using the four sets of sm products the monthly values of these drought indices for gansu hebei and yunnan provinces were shown in fig 4 where the solid lines indicate the drought thresholds and the dashed lines show the drought intensity categories the time series of drought indices are illustrated in bright colors during the drought periods in gansu the actual drought years were 2000 2001 2007 and 2009 both spi1 and spi3 classified 2001 and 2005 as drought years while era5 land dsi era5 land sma merra 2 dsi and fldas dsi did not signal any drought at all during the 2000 2019 period vci overestimated the drought years such that gansu experienced drought related vegetation stress in 2001 2002 2003 2004 2015 2016 and 2018 moreover merra 2 sma suggested that drought years were 2000 2001 and 2008 whereas 2001 2002 and 2003 were classified as drought by gldas sma finally fldas sma identified 2003 as a drought year while gldas dsi indicated that 2001 and 2003 were the agricultural drought years in hebei the actual drought years were 2000 2001 2002 2003 2006 2007 2009 2014 and 2015 among the drought indices gldas dsi and gldas sma equally performed the best by identifying the droughts in 2000 2001 2002 2003 2006 2007 and 2009 correctly the second best performed drought indices were vci fldas sma and fldas dsi by correctly identifying 5 drought years the worst performed indices such as spi 1 era5 land dsi and merra 2 dsi identified 2011 2019 and 2000 as drought years respectively thereby substantially underreporting the drought years in situ data suggested that the actual drought years were 2005 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 in yunnan surprisingly the dsi calculated from the era5 land merra 2 and fldas sm products did not signal any drought at all between 2000 and 2019 sma from era5 land merra 2 and fldas overestimated the actual drought years similarly vci reported 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2009 2010 and 2012 as drought years overestimating and missing actual drought years at the same time both spi 1 and gldas dsi correctly identified the droughts in 2005 and 2011 and 2012 and 2013 respectively the performance of the drought indices was evaluated by the taylor diagrams fig 5 the results suggested that the drought indices are more statistically related to spi3 than spi1 since agricultural droughts follow meteorological drought with a lag of several months of the drought indices the dsi calculated from sm products showed better performance with relatively small sd and rmse values although r values were not high vci had the worst correlation with spi3 despite the small sd and rmse values fig 5 pointed out that dsi comparatively had the best performance for agricultural drought monitoring in all three provinces in addition to statistical relationships of drought indices against the actual drought years a hit rate analysis was conducted to explore the accuracy of drought indices in the identification of drought events table 4 in gansu merra 2 sma yielded the highest h value i e 0 4 followed by spi1 spi3 and gldas dsi with an h value of 0 2 in hebei the performance of gldas dsi was the best with an h of 0 7 the second best drought index was gldas sma with an h value of 0 6 followed by merra 2 and fldas dsi with h values of 0 55 in yunnan gldas dsi and spi1 produced the highest h values i e 0 4 followed by merra 2 sma fldas sma and gldas sma with an h value of 0 33 the result of the hit rate analysis suggested that drought indices such as gldas dsi merra 2 sma and gldas sma performed better in identifying the actual drought years in three provinces the performance of merra 2 sma was better than gldas dsi in gansu however gldas dsi was more accurate than merra 2 sma and gldas sma in hebei and yunnan moreover the taylor diagram showed that the overall error of dsi is smaller than sma therefore the statistical analysis of monthly time series and hit rates concluded that gldas dsi overall exhibited better drought monitoring performance under both wet and dry conditions 3 3 characteristics of agricultural droughts in nine agricultural regions of china droughts are characterized by spatial extent frequency severity and duration therefore the maps that illustrate the spatial extent of drought severity and frequency fig 6 drought affected areas fig 7 and duration fig 8 were constructed based on gldas dsi to analyze the drought characteristics in nine agricultural regions of china between 2000 and 2019 the frequency of drought severity map fig 6 depicted that the frequency of droughts ranged from 0 to 25 in china between 2000 and 2019 moderate droughts were frequently seen in almost all agricultural districts except for sichuan basin and surrounding regions and middle lower yangtze plain the frequency of moderate drought was the highest i e 25 along the intersection between qinghai tibet plateau and northern arid and semiarid regions where the qilian mountains are located moderate droughts were as high as 25 more frequent than severe and extreme droughts across china severe droughts mainly occurred in northern arid and semiarid regions northeast china plain loess plateau huang huai hai plain qinghai part of the qinghai tibet plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau the regions where extreme droughts occurred seemed to be on the borders of the regions where severe droughts occurred and in the areas of china s magnificent mountain ranges like the greater khingan mountains the taihang mountains and the qilian mountains china terrestrial ecosystems are influenced by monsoon climate and water vapor transport is blocked by mountain ranges resulting in drought on leeward slopes of mountains cai and liu 2012 park et al 2010 wang et al 2022 furthermore drought development is also related to the strong sensitivity of mountain tree species to climate change and the weak drought resistance of picea crassifolia in the western qilian mountains zhang et al 2019 moreover the landscape in mountainous areas is dominated by dryland susceptible to meteorological drought therefore diverting water resources for irrigation is not an option to mitigate agricultural droughts in these regions overall the drought affected area and the drought frequency decreased gradually by going from moderate to extreme drought the majority of agricultural regions of china were frequently affected by moderate droughts and the northeast of china generally experienced severe and extreme droughts the drought affected areas in nine major agricultural regions of china are given in percentages in fig 7 moderate to severe droughts between 2000 and 2019 covered as high as 25 of areas in qinghai tibet plateau and northern arid and semiarid regions but the drought affected area in these regions tended to decrease after 2010 sichuan basin and surrounding regions and middle lower yangtze plain faced less frequent and extensive droughts the large scale droughts often occurred in the northeast plain huang huai hai plain and loess plateau covering as high as 60 80 and 65 of the regions respectively droughts observed in the yunnan guizhou plateau and southern china regions were frequent yet less extensive the yearly cumulative dsi ydsi was developed to measure the drought duration cammalleri et al 2015 the annual ydsi maps were shown between 2000 and 2019 fig 8 the results indicated that northern china including northern arid and semiarid regions northeast china plain huang huai hai plain loess plateau and qinghai tibet plateau experienced large magnitude droughts with a duration of 2 months or more however in the latter decade 2010 2019 northern china faced fewer droughts while the agricultural regions such as yunnan guizhou plateau and southern china experienced persistent droughts with longer durations 3 4 agricultural droughts trends in nine agricultural regions of china the mk test was conducted to further explore the drought trends in the nine agricultural regions fig 9 z value was used to determine agricultural drought trends at the 0 01 significance level a mutation test was conducted to determine the year of mutation where the forward uf and backward ub curves are two statistics calculated by changing the order of the time series the date when uf and ub curves cross within the confidence interval is the mutation time northern arid and semiarid regions and northeast china plain showed statistically significant p value 0 01 decreasing trends of agricultural drought with the z values of 11 52 and 6 22 respectively likewise qinghai tibet plateau showed a slowing drought trend with a z value of 2 25 p value 0 02 however none of the regions had intersections within 1 96 confidence interval suggesting that the mutation years might be earlier before 2002 the ub and uf values have fluctuated from 2000 to 2019 with no significant trend in sichuan basin and surrounding regions and loess plateau after 2004 the drought trend declined in huang huai hai plain with a z value of 2 04 and p value of 0 04 yunnan guizhou plateau had a statistically insignificant drought trend with a z value of 0 29 p value 0 76 the mutation year in this region was 2002 when an increase in agricultural drought in yunnan guizhou plateau after 2002 no statistically significant trend changes were observed in middle lower yangtze river plain initially there was a positive drought trend in southern china region until 2003 after the mutation time the drought trend became negative overall the drought trend in southern china region slowed down after 2003 4 discussion 4 1 deviations in soil moisture datasets the average sm maps figs 2 and 3 displayed that the driest conditions were observed in the western part of northern arid and semiarid regions while the wettest conditions were prevalent across middle lower yangtze plain and southern china regions the merra 2 dataset showed significant correlations with prcp in all three climatic zones shahzaman et al 2021 confirmed that the merra 2 products were highly correlated r 0 8 with prcp products relative to the era5 land and gldas products on the other hand wu et al 2021 compared era5 land sm and gldas sm datasets against in situ sm measurements collected at 1411 ground stations in china and concluded that gldas sm products were more accurate in humid sub humid and northern arid regions and wu et al 2021 further added that both sm products had a poor spatial correlation with ground sm observations this issue has also been reported in lsm based sm products yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a which is mainly caused by problems in model parameterization zwieback et al 2015 in addition complex topography and climate could affect the precision of the input datasets used for drought monitoring for instance zhang et al 2021a compared the drought monitoring capability of the esa cci and gldas noah sm datasets in china and concluded that satellite retrieval and lsms can be disturbed at high latitudes and altitudes resulting in uncertainty in satellite and lsm derived sm for drought identification chen et al 2020 found that no single sm dataset can perfectly reflect the actual situation in china for example the merra 2 products may have a better correlation with prcp but are inferior to gldas in the identification of drought events therefore multiple datasets were employed to assess the agricultural drought conditions in this study the choice of forcing data and model physics also contribute to regional differences observed in sm products the gldas and fldas products are driven by the noah lsm mcnally et al 2022 rodell et al 2004 gldas 2 1 simulations are forced with a combination of gdas global data assimilation system gpcp prcp and air force weather agency afwa radiation budget datasets the meteorological input data of fldas is driven by chirps climate hazards group infrared prcp with station data merra 2 and gdas moreover era5 land sm is a reanalysis product driven by the vegetation cover soil type surface roughness lake temperature lake depth lake ice temperature lake ice depth snow cover snow depth snow albedo snow density sm layer1 4 leaf area index surface pressure temperatures 2 m soil skin surface runoff snowmelt surface sensible heat flux evaporation and forecast albedo muñoz sabater et al 2021 randles et al 2017 similarly merra 2 sm is also a reanalysis product driven by meteorological data such as pressure layer height humidity wind speed air temperature and precipitable ice water as well as assimilated aerosol diagnostics such as column mass density of aerosol components the surface mass concentration of aerosol components and total extinction and scattering aerosol optical thickness aot at 550 nm 4 2 regional applicability of the drought indices until now numerous indices have been developed for drought identification while no one has an inherent superiority over others in all conditions however there is no single drought index that can be applied to all drought types in all climates so far this has been one of the difficult challenges of drought research the results indicated that vci did not accurately detect the droughts in arid gansu and humid yunnan land cover land use differences may lead to uncertainties in agricultural drought assessment for instance the vegetation cover in gansu is sparse vegetation while in yunnan it is dominated by forest land liu et al 2022 noted that the relative contribution of vegetation change to agricultural drought is about 30 when a drought occurs water storage in the root zone is not depleted as quickly as it would be under normal conditions which in turn affects the course of agricultural drought development cao et al 2022 pointed out that the different drought resistance in different climatic zones and vegetation types is due to the specific sensitivity and uniqueness of the local drought environment other factors such as plant pests and diseases flooding improper fertilization and irrigation can lead to poor vegetation growth thereby causing falsely vci to report drought the spi is one of the most popular indices and easy to calculate because only prcp is required when conditions become drier or wetter spi becomes negative or positive respectively wang et al 2014 yang et al 2017a found that spi behaved differently in different climatic zones the spi shows poor performance in arid and semi arid areas it is also pointed out that the change in evapotranspiration due to temperature anomalies in arid and semi arid regions is a large proportion of the water balance and the spi does not consider the contribution of temperature change resulting in inaccurate drought results in these regions yang et al 2017b temperature anomalies are also important in agricultural drought assessment which causes crop or vegetation death under hot temperatures when the water deficit is large since spi considers only precipitation it can be only used to identify meteorological droughts traditionally agricultural drought has been quantified based on sm in the root zone in this study drought indices such as sma and dsi were used to measure agricultural drought based on root zone sm products sma is calculated like the z score taking the scarcity of an event into account dsi considered both the level of water stress and the probability of occurrence of water stress both drought indices can be employed to detect agricultural drought cammalleri et al 2015 compared the drought measurement ability of dsi with sma in spain dry and sweden wet and found that sma underestimates in spain and overestimates in sweden which is consistent with our results because the overall soil moisture values are small and fluctuate little in dry areas scarcity is hardly reflected by sma while the opposite occurs in wet regions in this study the drought hit rate of sma was more positive in hebei which features moderate conditions therefore it can be concluded that sma is more suitable for agricultural drought monitoring in regions with moderate dry and wet conditions 4 3 contribution of climatic factors and human activities to drought trends according to agricultural drought trends in nine agricultural regions of china it is evident that a slowing drought trend was seen in the northern agricultural regions such as northern arid and semiarid regions qinghai tibet plateau northeast china plain and huang huai hai plain while the frequency of agricultural droughts increased in the southern agricultural regions such as yunnan guizhou plateau and southern china climate change has a direct impact on the growth of vegetation it was suspected that warming would exacerbate drought conditions in northern china within the last two decades but the opposite has occurred xuyang et al 2022 found that although the average temperature is rising there is an increase in precipitation which is responsible for the humidification in northwest china the increase in precipitation is undoubtedly beneficial to mitigate agricultural drought moreover china has committed to protecting the ecological environment since the 21st century the slowing trend of agricultural droughts in northwest china is also closely related to drought mitigation activities such as farming patterns water diversion and drainage desert management and afforestation for example zhu 2004 proposed the construction of mixed forests for natural drought resistant measures in the loess plateau region wang et al 2019a found that farmers increased irrigation intensity and improved irrigation efficiency to mitigate the negative effects of droughts in the north china plain since 2001 the frequent seasonal droughts in southwest china have not only caused serious socio economic impacts on the human population but also left people with endless thoughts why do humid regions suffer from such severe droughts there may be several answers firstly global warming droughts may accelerate the drying of the surface thus leading to an increase in agricultural drought severity and frequency ma et al 2021 second man made forests in southern china may not have the ability to cope with droughts du 2010 additionally the consequences of drought are further aggravated by the lack of awareness and guidance to combat drought such that drought will occur in the humid southern region at unexpected times future efforts should focus on activities to raise drought awareness in humid regions 5 conclusion in this study drought indicators such as prcp ndvi and sm were selected to calculate several drought indices such as spi1 spi3 vci sma and dsi all indices were validated against the actual drought years obtained from official sources in both dry and wet climatic regions in china the following conclusions can be drawn from this research among the drought indicators prcp ndvi and sm sm is found to be more appropriate for agricultural drought assessment in china dsi is more accurate to monitor agricultural droughts in china in comparison to spi1 spi3 vci and sma however the choice of input sm dataset affected the performance of dsi dsi accurately detected agricultural droughts when used with gldas sm dataset moderate to severe agricultural droughts often occurred in the agricultural regions of northern china whereas the frequency of agricultural drought was lower in southern china over the last two decades agricultural droughts have eased in the north but worsened in the south there was a decline in the agricultural drought trend in northwest china as the region is becoming warmer and wetter due to climate change this region has greatly benefited from the drought mitigation measures and the implementation of ecological projects credit authorship contribution statement ying pan conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing yonghua

8944,agricultural drought threatens global water security food security and natural ecosystems accurate identification of agricultural drought is a crucial task to mitigate its consequences however it is challenging to achieve reliable and accurate regional agricultural drought assessment in both wet and dry climates at the same time therefore the objective of this study is to identify a reliable and accurate agricultural drought index that performs well in both dry and wet climates drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi the vegetation condition index vci the soil moisture anomaly index sma and the drought severity index dsi were calculated and compared against in situ drought information devised by official sources in china the results showed that 1 dsi based on the global land data assimilation system gldas products performed the best in identifying agricultural drought in both dry and wet climate regions of china 2 agricultural regions such as northern arid and semiarid regions northeast china plain huang huai hai plain and loess plateau experienced moderate and severe agricultural droughts with a frequency of 20 3 the frequency of agricultural droughts observed in northern arid and semi arid regions and northeast china plain has slowed significantly over the last two decades with a significance level of 0 01 on the other hand the number of agricultural droughts has increased in yunnan guizhou plateau since 2002 graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural drought soil moisture gldas drought severity index drought frequency china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the world s most devastating natural disasters hao and singh 2015 and in recent decades the occurrence of droughts have become more frequent due to global warming piao et al 2010 drought is commonly classified into the following categories meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought eslamian et al 2017 mishra and singh 2010 among them agricultural drought directly damages the natural ecosystems and dramatically reduces crop yields in some cases agricultural droughts can develop rapidly also referred to as flash droughts making them more difficult to manage basara et al 2019 christian et al 2021 otkin et al 2018 for instance the united states us drought of 2012 was an extreme event of historic proportions which caused over 30 billion in economic losses basara et al 2019 similarly eastern australia experienced severe flash drought and forest fires in the summer of 2019 nguyen et al 2021 china also experienced several costly agricultural droughts in the past decade the drought in the yangtze river basin resulted in 1 5 billion in losses during the summer of 2011 affecting the lives of about 30 million people christian et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 a drought in the summer of 2013 destroyed over 2 million hectares of crops in the provinces of guizhou and hunan yuan et al 2015 therefore it is essential to accurately monitor agricultural droughts to mitigate their negative effects on agriculture food production natural ecosystems and freshwater resources drought indices based on different parameters were devised to measure agricultural drought dalezios et al 2017 eslamian et al 2017 keyantash and dracup 2002 for instance soil moisture sm is the key component of water transport thus making it a fundamental indicator for agricultural drought monitoring brocca et al 2011 brocca et al 2010 liu et al 2019 the standardized soil moisture index ssi aghakouchak 2014 the soil water deficit index swdi martínez fernández et al 2015 the drought severity index dsi cammalleri et al 2015 the soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi liu et al 2019 and the soil moisture anomaly index shahzaman et al 2021 can be given as examples of the sm based drought indices agricultural drought usually follows meteorological drought therefore it was shown that a precipitation deficit accumulated over 3 6 months can be also an indicator of agricultural drought dai et al 2020 mckee et al 1993 teweldebirhan tsige et al 2019 meteorological drought is commonly measured by the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1995 mckee et al 1993 besides spi the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 calculated from precipitation and temperature datasets are also employed to monitor meteorological and agricultural droughts in addition some studies showed that vegetation status can also serve as an indicator of agricultural drought via the crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 the vegetation condition index vci kogan 2007 liu and kogan 1996 and the vegetation health index vhi rojas et al 2011 unganai and kogan 1998 drought indices estimated from the ground observations of sm precipitation and temperature at weather stations are the most reliable and accurate methods to monitor agricultural conditions srivastava 2017 however such stations are not spatially well distributed across china additionally point based measurements may not be a good representative to reflect the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought indicators thereby making them unsuitable for large scale drought monitoring yuan et al 2015 in the last two decades numerous satellite based precipitation vegetation index and sm products have become available through the development of satellite remote sensing technology bartalis et al 2007 the sm products from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci products the soil moisture active passive smap products and the global land assimilation system gldas have been widely used in agricultural drought assessment brocca et al 2011 ford and quiring 2019 hunt et al 2009 mishra et al 2017 shahzaman et al 2021 for instance the drought indices calculated from these products have been applied to measure agricultural droughts in china chen et al 2020 zeng et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 however there have been disagreements over the extent and frequency of agricultural droughts in china the first group of researchers suggested that droughts were more frequent and widespread in china chen and sun 2015 li et al 2008 yu et al 2014 the other group concluded that the frequency of droughts was slowing down or not changing significantly wang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 zou et al 2005 the main reason for these contradictory results can be the choice of drought indices and the accuracy of satellite products used to derive drought indices for example the meteorological drought indices may not solely be appropriate and adequate to assess agricultural drought due to the lag between agricultural and meteorological drought ding et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b in addition the number of currently available sm products used in drought research is abundant and their accuracy varies considerably zheng et al 2022 it is always challenging to select reliable drought index and dataset to achieve accurate regional agricultural drought assessment in all climate types many studies have been carried out to test the performance of drought indices in china guo et al 2019 xu et al 2022 zhao et al 2017b xu et al 2022 devised a new drought index and zhao et al 2017 modified an existing drought index to improve the accuracy of drought assessment however the accuracy of agricultural drought indices used in these studies were only compared to the results of other meteorological drought indices xu et al 2022 or ground measurements of sm zhao et al 2017a for example zhao and wang 2021 carried out the validation study only in in wet and semi humid zones of china additionally previous studies didn t analyze the impact of input sm datasets to the sm based drought indices such as sma and dsi into account since the drought indices focus on different aspect of drought in various region the accuracy of the drought indices has to be assessed in different climate zones to see overall of performance of these indices to monitor agricultural droughts at large scales the objectives of this study are as follows 1 investigate the accuracy of the drought indices in three provinces with diverse climates 2 highlight the impact of input dataset to the sm based drought indices 3 examine the drought characteristics of nine major agricultural regions in china in the end this study strives to provide a reliable method for the accurate assessment of agricultural drought using remote sensing products in arid semi arid temperate and humid climatic regions of china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area china is a vast country with complex topography and climate divided into four major climatic zones and nine major agricultural regions fig 1 these four climate zones arid semi arid semi humid and humid are determined by the dryness index calculated from the climate data of the national meteorological administration of china between 1951 and 1970 zhu 1962 china was divided into nine agricultural regions based on three criteria provincial borders climate types and crop planting characteristics china a major producer and importer of crops such as wheat and maize supplies food to 22 of the world population even though it has only 7 of the world s cultivated land liu and zhang 2010 piao et al 2010 in the last two decades china suffered from agricultural droughts which in turn led to serious losses in agricultural production and ecological damage leng et al 2015 wang et al 2019b yu and zhai 2020 zhang et al 2021a agricultural drought monitoring is the basis of agricultural management and is of great significance to china s sustainable development in this study three provinces gansu hebei and yunnan were selected to assess the applicability and accuracy of data products in the derivation of drought indices fig 1a gansu and hebei are located in the arid and temperate regions of china respectively while yunnan is mainly in the humid zone table 1 the actual agricultural drought years of these provinces were collected from the china

index spi a prolonged precipitation deficit is the direct cause of the meteorological drought the spi is a commonly used index in drought monitoring based on a standardized method of precipitation scarcity agnew 2000 mckee et al 1995 mckee et al 1993 in addition the world meteorological organization wmo recommends spi for meteorological drought identification hao and aghakouchak 2013 hayes et al 2011 the index calculates the gamma probability distribution function of the precipitation time series and then converts the cumulative gamma probability into a cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution with the gradual development of studies on drought propagation spi3 and spi6 were accepted for agricultural drought or hydrological drought studies due to the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought or hydrological drought over approximately 3 6 months forootan et al 2019 it has been suggested that spi3 is more suitable for identifying drought events that eventually affect agricultural practices gebrehiwot et al 2011 in this paper spi3 was selected to make comparisons between drought indices 2 3 2 vegetation condition index vci vegetation indices have been commonly used to determine drought conditions ndvi is sensitive to changes in both sm and annual weather conditions the vegetation condition index vci was devised to highlight ndvi changes related to annual weather and soil moisture conditions higher vci values indicate wetter conditions or high vegetation moisture content while lower vci values indicate stressed or dry vegetation conditions liu and kogan 1996 vci is calculated from eq 1 1 v c i j n d v i j n d v i min n d v i max n d v i min where v c i j is the vci in period j of a particular year n d v i j is the ndvi in period j of a particular year n d v i max is the maximum value of ndvi in period j of the study years n d v i min is the minimum value of ndvi in period j of the study years 2 3 3 soil moisture anomaly index sma the soil moisture anomaly index sma is a common index to monitor agricultural drought conditions shahzaman et al 2021 which can be calculated by eq 2 2 s m a s m i μ σ s m i μ and σ are the monthly sm value and mean and the standard deviation of the month respectively 2 3 4 drought severity index dsi the drought severity index dsi was proposed by cammalleri et al 2015 to identify agricultural droughts in europe by considering the water deficit factor and dryness probability factor dsi can be calculated from eq 3 1 3 1 d s i p d where p and d are the dryness probability index and soil moisture deficit index respectively later d and p can be estimated by eq 3 2 and eq 3 3 respectively 3 2 d 1 1 θ θ 50 n 3 3 p exp f d 1 2 0 03 where θ is the soil moisture θ 50 is the average between θ 50 and θ w p and n is an empirical shape factor while f d is the standard percentile of the cumulative probability function of the beta distribution concerning d furthermore θ c r is the critical θ at which soil water availability limits evapotranspiration and θ w p is the minimal of θ the plant not to wilt in the end monthly drought maps were classified by the thresholds given in table 3 to identify agricultural drought events in china between 2000 and 2019 2 3 5 statistical analysis using soil plant air water field pond hydrology version 6 02 70 spaw software the field capacity and wilting point were calculated based on the harmonized world soil database 1 2 https www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 the mann kendall mk test was used for trend analysis of agricultural drought in china yue and wang 2002 taylor diagram which contains three statistical indices standard deviation sd root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r was selected to cross validate the drought indices finally the hit rate h analysis was conducted to evaluate how well drought indices can identify drought events correctly h can be calculated from eq 4 ford and quiring 2019 golian et al 2019 4 h h h m f where h is the hit rate and h m and f are the number of hits misses and false alarms respectively 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal distribution of data products the 2000 2019 average of gpcc prcp ndvi from spot vgt and proba v and sm from four datasets were shown in fig 2 where gansu hebei and yunnan provinces are marked by black lines the zonal statistics tool in arcgis toolbox was used to calculate the multi year averages of these drought indicators shown in fig 2 spatially all three provinces exhibited a distinct northwest southeast gradient in prcp ndvi and sm the densely vegetated areas lie in southwest regions of these provinces due to abundant prcp subsequently sm sparse vegetation dominated the dry northeast regions the highest spatial heterogeneity is seen in yunnan where the southern parts receive prcp annually about 400 mm while the average prcp in the central and northern parts is less than 200 mm per year the era5 land product showed a large contrast in sm while other sm products indicated a small discrepancy between the southeast and northeast regions of china among the sm products a good spatial agreement was observed between gldas and merra 2 in terms of magnitude there was a large variation in ndvi prcp and sm gansu yunnan experienced the driest wettest conditions while the conditions in hebei were moderate fig 3 in gansu the monthly prcp ranged between 0 and 100 mm the ndvi was in the range of 0 1 0 4 and the sm was around 0 2 m3 m3 except for fldas where the sm value was significantly higher than the other four products in hebei the prcp ndvi and sm varied from 0 to 250 mm 0 2 0 7 and 0 2 0 3 m3 m3 respectively additionally gldas sm was slightly lower than the other sm products in yunnan the monthly prcp ndvi and sm ranged from 0 to 300 mm 0 4 0 75 and 0 25 0 45 m3 m3 respectively the sm products varied more consistently in yunnan achieving similar peak values between 2000 and 2019 in gansu and hebei both ndvi and sm lagged prcp and the lag of sm to prcp was 2 months longer than the lag of ndvi to prcp however the peaks in sm and ndvi occurred at the same time in yunnan thereby indicating similar lags to rainfall events this also indicates that sm in yunnan is more responsive to rainfall events the comparison of the four sm products suggested that era5 land showed the highest sm values in hebei and yunnan provinces whereas fldas showed the highest sm in gansu province there was a small discrepancy in the sm products in hebei while the sm products were inconsistent in hebei especially merra 2 sm was nearly two times greater than era5 land sm 3 2 comparison of agricultural drought indices the threshold values table 3 were used to infer drought events from drought indices the spi1 and spi3 were calculated using gpcc prcp data while the vci was calculated using the ndvi products acquired by spot vgt and proba v missions additionally the sma and dsi were calculated using the four sets of sm products the monthly values of these drought indices for gansu hebei and yunnan provinces were shown in fig 4 where the solid lines indicate the drought thresholds and the dashed lines show the drought intensity categories the time series of drought indices are illustrated in bright colors during the drought periods in gansu the actual drought years were 2000 2001 2007 and 2009 both spi1 and spi3 classified 2001 and 2005 as drought years while era5 land dsi era5 land sma merra 2 dsi and fldas dsi did not signal any drought at all during the 2000 2019 period vci overestimated the drought years such that gansu experienced drought related vegetation stress in 2001 2002 2003 2004 2015 2016 and 2018 moreover merra 2 sma suggested that drought years were 2000 2001 and 2008 whereas 2001 2002 and 2003 were classified as drought by gldas sma finally fldas sma identified 2003 as a drought year while gldas dsi indicated that 2001 and 2003 were the agricultural drought years in hebei the actual drought years were 2000 2001 2002 2003 2006 2007 2009 2014 and 2015 among the drought indices gldas dsi and gldas sma equally performed the best by identifying the droughts in 2000 2001 2002 2003 2006 2007 and 2009 correctly the second best performed drought indices were vci fldas sma and fldas dsi by correctly identifying 5 drought years the worst performed indices such as spi 1 era5 land dsi and merra 2 dsi identified 2011 2019 and 2000 as drought years respectively thereby substantially underreporting the drought years in situ data suggested that the actual drought years were 2005 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 in yunnan surprisingly the dsi calculated from the era5 land merra 2 and fldas sm products did not signal any drought at all between 2000 and 2019 sma from era5 land merra 2 and fldas overestimated the actual drought years similarly vci reported 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2009 2010 and 2012 as drought years overestimating and missing actual drought years at the same time both spi 1 and gldas dsi correctly identified the droughts in 2005 and 2011 and 2012 and 2013 respectively the performance of the drought indices was evaluated by the taylor diagrams fig 5 the results suggested that the drought indices are more statistically related to spi3 than spi1 since agricultural droughts follow meteorological drought with a lag of several months of the drought indices the dsi calculated from sm products showed better performance with relatively small sd and rmse values although r values were not high vci had the worst correlation with spi3 despite the small sd and rmse values fig 5 pointed out that dsi comparatively had the best performance for agricultural drought monitoring in all three provinces in addition to statistical relationships of drought indices against the actual drought years a hit rate analysis was conducted to explore the accuracy of drought indices in the identification of drought events table 4 in gansu merra 2 sma yielded the highest h value i e 0 4 followed by spi1 spi3 and gldas dsi with an h value of 0 2 in hebei the performance of gldas dsi was the best with an h of 0 7 the second best drought index was gldas sma with an h value of 0 6 followed by merra 2 and fldas dsi with h values of 0 55 in yunnan gldas dsi and spi1 produced the highest h values i e 0 4 followed by merra 2 sma fldas sma and gldas sma with an h value of 0 33 the result of the hit rate analysis suggested that drought indices such as gldas dsi merra 2 sma and gldas sma performed better in identifying the actual drought years in three provinces the performance of merra 2 sma was better than gldas dsi in gansu however gldas dsi was more accurate than merra 2 sma and gldas sma in hebei and yunnan moreover the taylor diagram showed that the overall error of dsi is smaller than sma therefore the statistical analysis of monthly time series and hit rates concluded that gldas dsi overall exhibited better drought monitoring performance under both wet and dry conditions 3 3 characteristics of agricultural droughts in nine agricultural regions of china droughts are characterized by spatial extent frequency severity and duration therefore the maps that illustrate the spatial extent of drought severity and frequency fig 6 drought affected areas fig 7 and duration fig 8 were constructed based on gldas dsi to analyze the drought characteristics in nine agricultural regions of china between 2000 and 2019 the frequency of drought severity map fig 6 depicted that the frequency of droughts ranged from 0 to 25 in china between 2000 and 2019 moderate droughts were frequently seen in almost all agricultural districts except for sichuan basin and surrounding regions and middle lower yangtze plain the frequency of moderate drought was the highest i e 25 along the intersection between qinghai tibet plateau and northern arid and semiarid regions where the qilian mountains are located moderate droughts were as high as 25 more frequent than severe and extreme droughts across china severe droughts mainly occurred in northern arid and semiarid regions northeast china plain loess plateau huang huai hai plain qinghai part of the qinghai tibet plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau the regions where extreme droughts occurred seemed to be on the borders of the regions where severe droughts occurred and in the areas of china s magnificent mountain ranges like the greater khingan mountains the taihang mountains and the qilian mountains china terrestrial ecosystems are influenced by monsoon climate and water vapor transport is blocked by mountain ranges resulting in drought on leeward slopes of mountains cai and liu 2012 park et al 2010 wang et al 2022 furthermore drought development is also related to the strong sensitivity of mountain tree species to climate change and the weak drought resistance of picea crassifolia in the western qilian mountains zhang et al 2019 moreover the landscape in mountainous areas is dominated by dryland susceptible to meteorological drought therefore diverting water resources for irrigation is not an option to mitigate agricultural droughts in these regions overall the drought affected area and the drought frequency decreased gradually by going from moderate to extreme drought the majority of agricultural regions of china were frequently affected by moderate droughts and the northeast of china generally experienced severe and extreme droughts the drought affected areas in nine major agricultural regions of china are given in percentages in fig 7 moderate to severe droughts between 2000 and 2019 covered as high as 25 of areas in qinghai tibet plateau and northern arid and semiarid regions but the drought affected area in these regions tended to decrease after 2010 sichuan basin and surrounding regions and middle lower yangtze plain faced less frequent and extensive droughts the large scale droughts often occurred in the northeast plain huang huai hai plain and loess plateau covering as high as 60 80 and 65 of the regions respectively droughts observed in the yunnan guizhou plateau and southern china regions were frequent yet less extensive the yearly cumulative dsi ydsi was developed to measure the drought duration cammalleri et al 2015 the annual ydsi maps were shown between 2000 and 2019 fig 8 the results indicated that northern china including northern arid and semiarid regions northeast china plain huang huai hai plain loess plateau and qinghai tibet plateau experienced large magnitude droughts with a duration of 2 months or more however in the latter decade 2010 2019 northern china faced fewer droughts while the agricultural regions such as yunnan guizhou plateau and southern china experienced persistent droughts with longer durations 3 4 agricultural droughts trends in nine agricultural regions of china the mk test was conducted to further explore the drought trends in the nine agricultural regions fig 9 z value was used to determine agricultural drought trends at the 0 01 significance level a mutation test was conducted to determine the year of mutation where the forward uf and backward ub curves are two statistics calculated by changing the order of the time series the date when uf and ub curves cross within the confidence interval is the mutation time northern arid and semiarid regions and northeast china plain showed statistically significant p value 0 01 decreasing trends of agricultural drought with the z values of 11 52 and 6 22 respectively likewise qinghai tibet plateau showed a slowing drought trend with a z value of 2 25 p value 0 02 however none of the regions had intersections within 1 96 confidence interval suggesting that the mutation years might be earlier before 2002 the ub and uf values have fluctuated from 2000 to 2019 with no significant trend in sichuan basin and surrounding regions and loess plateau after 2004 the drought trend declined in huang huai hai plain with a z value of 2 04 and p value of 0 04 yunnan guizhou plateau had a statistically insignificant drought trend with a z value of 0 29 p value 0 76 the mutation year in this region was 2002 when an increase in agricultural drought in yunnan guizhou plateau after 2002 no statistically significant trend changes were observed in middle lower yangtze river plain initially there was a positive drought trend in southern china region until 2003 after the mutation time the drought trend became negative overall the drought trend in southern china region slowed down after 2003 4 discussion 4 1 deviations in soil moisture datasets the average sm maps figs 2 and 3 displayed that the driest conditions were observed in the western part of northern arid and semiarid regions while the wettest conditions were prevalent across middle lower yangtze plain and southern china regions the merra 2 dataset showed significant correlations with prcp in all three climatic zones shahzaman et al 2021 confirmed that the merra 2 products were highly correlated r 0 8 with prcp products relative to the era5 land and gldas products on the other hand wu et al 2021 compared era5 land sm and gldas sm datasets against in situ sm measurements collected at 1411 ground stations in china and concluded that gldas sm products were more accurate in humid sub humid and northern arid regions and wu et al 2021 further added that both sm products had a poor spatial correlation with ground sm observations this issue has also been reported in lsm based sm products yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a which is mainly caused by problems in model parameterization zwieback et al 2015 in addition complex topography and climate could affect the precision of the input datasets used for drought monitoring for instance zhang et al 2021a compared the drought monitoring capability of the esa cci and gldas noah sm datasets in china and concluded that satellite retrieval and lsms can be disturbed at high latitudes and altitudes resulting in uncertainty in satellite and lsm derived sm for drought identification chen et al 2020 found that no single sm dataset can perfectly reflect the actual situation in china for example the merra 2 products may have a better correlation with prcp but are inferior to gldas in the identification of drought events therefore multiple datasets were employed to assess the agricultural drought conditions in this study the choice of forcing data and model physics also contribute to regional differences observed in sm products the gldas and fldas products are driven by the noah lsm mcnally et al 2022 rodell et al 2004 gldas 2 1 simulations are forced with a combination of gdas global data assimilation system gpcp prcp and air force weather agency afwa radiation budget datasets the meteorological input data of fldas is driven by chirps climate hazards group infrared prcp with station data merra 2 and gdas moreover era5 land sm is a reanalysis product driven by the vegetation cover soil type surface roughness lake temperature lake depth lake ice temperature lake ice depth snow cover snow depth snow albedo snow density sm layer1 4 leaf area index surface pressure temperatures 2 m soil skin surface runoff snowmelt surface sensible heat flux evaporation and forecast albedo muñoz sabater et al 2021 randles et al 2017 similarly merra 2 sm is also a reanalysis product driven by meteorological data such as pressure layer height humidity wind speed air temperature and precipitable ice water as well as assimilated aerosol diagnostics such as column mass density of aerosol components the surface mass concentration of aerosol components and total extinction and scattering aerosol optical thickness aot at 550 nm 4 2 regional applicability of the drought indices until now numerous indices have been developed for drought identification while no one has an inherent superiority over others in all conditions however there is no single drought index that can be applied to all drought types in all climates so far this has been one of the difficult challenges of drought research the results indicated that vci did not accurately detect the droughts in arid gansu and humid yunnan land cover land use differences may lead to uncertainties in agricultural drought assessment for instance the vegetation cover in gansu is sparse vegetation while in yunnan it is dominated by forest land liu et al 2022 noted that the relative contribution of vegetation change to agricultural drought is about 30 when a drought occurs water storage in the root zone is not depleted as quickly as it would be under normal conditions which in turn affects the course of agricultural drought development cao et al 2022 pointed out that the different drought resistance in different climatic zones and vegetation types is due to the specific sensitivity and uniqueness of the local drought environment other factors such as plant pests and diseases flooding improper fertilization and irrigation can lead to poor vegetation growth thereby causing falsely vci to report drought the spi is one of the most popular indices and easy to calculate because only prcp is required when conditions become drier or wetter spi becomes negative or positive respectively wang et al 2014 yang et al 2017a found that spi behaved differently in different climatic zones the spi shows poor performance in arid and semi arid areas it is also pointed out that the change in evapotranspiration due to temperature anomalies in arid and semi arid regions is a large proportion of the water balance and the spi does not consider the contribution of temperature change resulting in inaccurate drought results in these regions yang et al 2017b temperature anomalies are also important in agricultural drought assessment which causes crop or vegetation death under hot temperatures when the water deficit is large since spi considers only precipitation it can be only used to identify meteorological droughts traditionally agricultural drought has been quantified based on sm in the root zone in this study drought indices such as sma and dsi were used to measure agricultural drought based on root zone sm products sma is calculated like the z score taking the scarcity of an event into account dsi considered both the level of water stress and the probability of occurrence of water stress both drought indices can be employed to detect agricultural drought cammalleri et al 2015 compared the drought measurement ability of dsi with sma in spain dry and sweden wet and found that sma underestimates in spain and overestimates in sweden which is consistent with our results because the overall soil moisture values are small and fluctuate little in dry areas scarcity is hardly reflected by sma while the opposite occurs in wet regions in this study the drought hit rate of sma was more positive in hebei which features moderate conditions therefore it can be concluded that sma is more suitable for agricultural drought monitoring in regions with moderate dry and wet conditions 4 3 contribution of climatic factors and human activities to drought trends according to agricultural drought trends in nine agricultural regions of china it is evident that a slowing drought trend was seen in the northern agricultural regions such as northern arid and semiarid regions qinghai tibet plateau northeast china plain and huang huai hai plain while the frequency of agricultural droughts increased in the southern agricultural regions such as yunnan guizhou plateau and southern china climate change has a direct impact on the growth of vegetation it was suspected that warming would exacerbate drought conditions in northern china within the last two decades but the opposite has occurred xuyang et al 2022 found that although the average temperature is rising there is an increase in precipitation which is responsible for the humidification in northwest china the increase in precipitation is undoubtedly beneficial to mitigate agricultural drought moreover china has committed to protecting the ecological environment since the 21st century the slowing trend of agricultural droughts in northwest china is also closely related to drought mitigation activities such as farming patterns water diversion and drainage desert management and afforestation for example zhu 2004 proposed the construction of mixed forests for natural drought resistant measures in the loess plateau region wang et al 2019a found that farmers increased irrigation intensity and improved irrigation efficiency to mitigate the negative effects of droughts in the north china plain since 2001 the frequent seasonal droughts in southwest china have not only caused serious socio economic impacts on the human population but also left people with endless thoughts why do humid regions suffer from such severe droughts there may be several answers firstly global warming droughts may accelerate the drying of the surface thus leading to an increase in agricultural drought severity and frequency ma et al 2021 second man made forests in southern china may not have the ability to cope with droughts du 2010 additionally the consequences of drought are further aggravated by the lack of awareness and guidance to combat drought such that drought will occur in the humid southern region at unexpected times future efforts should focus on activities to raise drought awareness in humid regions 5 conclusion in this study drought indicators such as prcp ndvi and sm were selected to calculate several drought indices such as spi1 spi3 vci sma and dsi all indices were validated against the actual drought years obtained from official sources in both dry and wet climatic regions in china the following conclusions can be drawn from this research among the drought indicators prcp ndvi and sm sm is found to be more appropriate for agricultural drought assessment in china dsi is more accurate to monitor agricultural droughts in china in comparison to spi1 spi3 vci and sma however the choice of input sm dataset affected the performance of dsi dsi accurately detected agricultural droughts when used with gldas sm dataset moderate to severe agricultural droughts often occurred in the agricultural regions of northern china whereas the frequency of agricultural drought was lower in southern china over the last two decades agricultural droughts have eased in the north but worsened in the south there was a decline in the agricultural drought trend in northwest china as the region is becoming warmer and wetter due to climate change this region has greatly benefited from the drought
