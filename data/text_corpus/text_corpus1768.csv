8840,brewery effluent be needs to be treated before it can be released into the environment reused or used in down stream activities this study demonstrated that anaerobic digestion ad followed by treatment in an integrated tertiary effluent treatment system transformed be into a suitable solution for crop irrigation brewery effluent can be used to improve crop yields cabbage brassica oleracea cv star 3301 grew significantly larger when irrigated with post ad post primary facultative pond pfp effluent compared with those irrigated with post constructed wetland cw effluent or tap water only p 0 0001 however cabbage yield when grown using be was 13 lower than that irrigated with a nutrient solution and fresh water the electrical conductivity of be 3019 05 48 72 µs cm2 may have been responsible for this post cw and post high rate algal pond hrap be was least suitable due to their higher conductivity and lower nutrient concentration after three months soils irrigated with post ad and post pfp be had a significantly higher sodium concentration and sodium adsorption ratio 3919 94 77 8 18 0 17 mg kg than soil irrigated with a commercial nutrient solution 920 58 27 46 2 20 0 05 mg kg however this was not accompanied by a deterioration in the soil s hydro physical properties nor a change in the metabolic community structure of the soil the benefits of developing this nutrient and water resource could contribute to cost reductions at the brewery more efficient water nutrient and energy management and job creation future studies should investigate methods to reduce the build up of salt in the soil when treated be is used to irrigate crops keywords wastewater irrigation nutrient recovery agriculture brewery effluent 1 introduction brewery effluent be is an organic effluent that contains nitrogen and phosphorus and a range of organic and inorganic compounds 30 32 these nutrients are essential for plant growth and health so brewery effluent has the potential to be used as a source of water and nutrients in irrigated crop production 10 26 32 however be also has properties that inhibit the growth of plants and deteriorate soil physical profile and fertility when used to irrigate crops 16 17 8 brewery effluent at ibhayi brewery sab pty ltd port elizabeth south africa is treated in an anaerobic digester ad and activated sludge system before being either piped to a municipal sewer or channelled back to the factory for re use in non production activities a small stream of post ad be is fed into an experimental treatment facility which uses various alternative sustainable methods of bioremediation including a primary facultative pond pfp a high rate algal pond hrap and a constructed wetland cw each treatment process results in be with different water quality parameters such as ph form and concentration of nitrogen and the concentration of phosphorus sodium and other dissolved salts 14 these parameters have been shown to directly and indirectly affect plant growth and soil fertility 21 30 different methods of be pre treatment have been found to influence nutrient availability and downstream crop productivity 30 furthermore the sodium concentration of be negatively affected the physical properties of the irrigated soil 8 it is therefore essential that the most effective pre treatment method of be is found so that the nutrients in the effluent are made accessible to the plants while minimising any negative impacts be may have on the soil 1 1 aims and objectives the aim of this study was to determine the suitability of different tertiary effluent technologies in making be suitable for crop irrigation this was done by comparing the change in soil characteristics and growth of cabbages irrigated with be drawn at various points from an experimental be treatment system including post ad post pfp post hrap and post cw to cabbages irrigated with tap water or a combination of water and inorganic fertilizer 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental species and system cabbage brassica oleracea was used as the test crop because it has similar salt tolerance and nutrient requirements as most vegetables 29 two hundred cabbage seedlings brassica oleracea cv star 3301 starke ayres pty ltd south africa were purchased from a commercial nursery moorland seedlings pty ltd humansdorp south africa of these 120 similar size seedlings were used in this experiment cabbage plants were grown out doors in 23 l pots these pots were filled with an oxidic sandy loam top soil 10 silt 20 25 clay 65 70 sand classified according to macvicar et al 22 one cabbage plant was planted in each pot 2 2 treatments six irrigation solutions were applied to the cabbages which included post ad post pfp post hrap post cw a nutrient solution ns and municipal water the ph of each treatment was either adjusted to 6 5 with 98 sulphuric acid protea chemicals pty ltd south africa or left unadjusted table 1 the plants irrigated with tap water served as a control the nutrient solution was comprised of a commercially available inorganic fertilizer hygrotech pty ltd south africa registration number k5709 act 36 of 1947 and calcium nitrate with a composition of 11 7 nitrogen and 16 6 calcium mixed in a ratio of 1 0 8 and dissolved in municipal water to achieve an electrical conductivity ec of 1800 µm hygrotech pty ltd south africa each treatment was replicated ten times with a replicate consisting of a single plant in a pot 2 3 irrigation regime and pest control cabbages were irrigated with one litre two to three times a week during irrigation care was taken not to wet the cabbage leaves the maximum volume of water irrigated at one time was one litre this was done to ensure that leaching did not occur water was not observed draining out the bottom of the pots in total each cabbage plant received 198 1 mm of treatment water and 91 mm of rain during the twelve week growth trial one month after planting diamond back moth larvae were noticed on some of the cabbages cabbages plants were sprayed with malasol active ingredient mercaptothion efekto agro serve pty ltd to kill the larvae when a spraying occurred every plant was sprayed an event that occurred five times during the trial no plants suffered severe damage from the diamond back moth larvae 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 irrigation water chemistry the ph

4 discussion 4 1 plant growth and health each treatment contained different concentrations of plant nutrients which should have affected the growth and health of plants they were used to irrigate cabbages irrigated with ns ad and pfp treatments were significantly bigger than plants irrigated with hrap cw and water treatments cabbages irrigated with ad and pfp effluents where 12 heavier than cabbages irrigated with tap water in order to sustain vigorous and healthy growth plants require sufficient concentrations of macro and micro nutrients 10 24 the hrap and cw treatment processes utilise algae and plants which decrease the concentration of nutrients in the effluent as it is utilised to support plant growth this is probably the main reason why plants irrigated with hrap and cw treatment water were significantly smaller than plants irrigated with ns ad and pfp treatments to further support this conclusion plants subject to hrap and cw treatments showed signs of nutrient deficiency their outer leaves were yellow orange and or dark red purple in colour which is known as chlorosis and necrosis and is a sign of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium deficiency 10 effluent treatment processes that remove plant nutrients are counterproductive when using effluents as an irrigation source for plants because they remove valuable nutrients that are needed to support plant growth anaerobically digested and post pfp be can be used to increase the yield of crops which are irrigated with water containing low concentrations of nutrients such as tap water or post cw effluent brewery effluent is not an ideal plant nutrient solution and has certain characteristics that could inhibit plant growth anaerobically digested and post pfp be contained slightly higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus than the ns however cabbages that were irrigated with be subjected to ad and pfp were smaller than cabbages irrigated with ns but showed no signs of nutrient deficiency therefore certain characteristics of be either inhibit the uptake of nutrients by cabbages or put stress on the plants resulting in less energy being spent on growth it has previously been identified that the high conductivity sodicity and ph in be may decrease the growth and health of plants 3 30 32 the ph of nutrient solution plays a major role in the availability of macro and micro nutrients to plants with the optimal range for most plants being between five and seven lucas davies 1961 10 the unadjusted be treatments had ph values around 8 14 with hrap treatment having a mean ph of 9 17 fig 2 surprisingly no difference was observed in the growth cci and chemical composition of cabbages subject to be treatments with or without ph adjustment the ph range for good quality irrigation water is between 6 5 and 7 5 10 high ph values above 8 5 can cause the precipitation of fe2 mn2 po4 ca2 and mn2 to insoluble and plant unavailable salts 37 5 however there was no difference in the growth cci or chemical composition of cabbages treated with ph unadjusted hrap effluent ph 9 17 and ph adjusted hrap effluent ph 6 5 soils have the ability of resist ph changes which is known as their buffering capacity buckman brady 1967 the buffering capacity could have counteracted the ph adjustment of be the salinity of irrigation water is one of the concerns when using effluents as irrigation waters since salinity causes decreased growth and yield of most crops 26 33 the mean ec of be was 3301 85 µs cm2 which should reduce cabbage crops yields by 10 20 9 the mean mass of cabbages irrigated with ad and pfp effluents was 13 lower than cabbages irrigated with ns treatments the high ec of ad and pfp treatments probably caused the decreased yield of cabbages when compared with ns irrigated cabbages because ad and pfp treatments contained higher concentrations of n and p than the ns treatment medium salinity of irrigation water 2000 3000 µs cm2 causes a decrease in yield in cabbages and most vegetables 33 this is primarily due to the osmotic effects by decreasing the osmotic potential between the root plasma and soil water 13 25 the severity of the crop response to salinity is species specific and is also mediated by environmental factors such as humidity temperature wind light and air pollution 33 it is important to select salt tolerant crops when using moderately saline effluents in irrigation 4 2 soil fertility soil water potential quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another area and is mainly affected by the concentration of salts in the soil 38 5 it provides a measure of how easily soil water will move into the root of a plant soils subject to irrigation with hrap and cw had significantly lower water potentials at all soil moisture concentrations than soils subjected to the other treatments as the salinity of the irrigation water and or soil increases the water potential will decrease 4 5 this means that plants have to spend more energy to get water from the soil which in turn will compromise the growth of the plant 4 5 the high salinity of be probably increased the energy that plants invested in obtaining water and this is a possible cause for the decreased growth of plants in these treatments most plants including cabbages cannot access water in the soil when the water potential decreases below 1 5 mpa this is represented by the dashed black line in fig 6 6 19 6 this means that in soils irrigated with hrap and cw treated be plants could not access water in the soil when the gravimetric soil moisture concentration dropped below 15 with the other treatments plants could not access soil water when the gravimetric soil moisture concentration dropped below 10 the negative affect of saline irrigation waters on the availability of water to plants demonstrated that the treatment process that results in be having the lowest salinity would be the most suitable for crop irrigation the salinity of the treatments had an effect on the salinity and sar of the soils which in turn could affect the physical characteristics of the soil at the beginning of the trial the soils had an sar of 2 21 0 05 after 12 weeks of irrigation the soil sar subject to be treatments rose to 8 18 0 17 while the sar of soils subject ns and water remained the same throughout the trial soils that have a sar 13 are classified as sodic and are unsuitable for cultivating most vegetable crops 36 qadir schubert 2002 in most studies conducted on the use of wastewaters as an irrigation water source the sar of the receiving soil has increased 16 18 dakoure et al 8 irrigated eggplants grown on ferralsol soil with be that had been treated using stabilisation ponds after two seasons of irrigation they found that the effluent caused an increase in the sar 2 9 20 3 and esp of the soil accompanied by a strong degradation of hydro structural soil properties soil irrigated with effluent had a decreased soil structural porosity an increased bulk density and ph when compared with soils irrigated with tap water 8 during this study the increase in sar of the soil did not seem to negatively affect the physical structure of the soil with the exception of the stability of soil aggregates which was slightly lower than soils irrigated the ns treatment however this trial was only run for 12 weeks and after prolonged irrigation with be an increase in the sar of the soil and accompanied decrease in the soil s physical structure would be expected this emphasises the point that the be treatment which results in the lowest sodium chloride and salinity concentration will be most suitable for irrigation the different treatments influenced the infiltration rates of the soil with soils subject to hrap cw and water treatments developing reduced infiltration rates these treatments either had the highest sodium concentration hrap cw or the lowest conductivity water a high sodium concentration in irrigation water causes extreme flocculation resulting in the formation of a soil crust and decreased infiltration rates while the low conductivity 500 µs cm2 of the water treatments caused soil particle dispersion resulting in a decreased soil structure and infiltration rates 2 5 it is important to understand whether the application of be onto soils will affect the community of microbes in the soil and thus the functions they provide 1 no significant difference was observed in the carbon source utilisation of soils subject to the irrigation treatments fig 9 soils were dominated by carbohydrate 36 03 utilising bacteria followed by amino acid 22 11 carboxylic and acetic acid 19 31 and polymer 18 45 utilising bacteria the literature shows both detrimental and enhancing effects of effluent on soil microbial population and communities illustrating the complexity of relationships among soil microbial communities in agricultural soils 34 35 from this study it can be concluded that the application of be to agricultural soils does not affect the overall functioning and processes performed by the soil microbe community in the short term it may have changed the species composition of soil microbes but the overall metabolic community structure of microbes present was not affected future studies should investigate the changes in species composition of soil microbes using metagenomics and conduct the study over a longer timescale soils subject to be and ns treatments had significantly higher colony forming units per gram of soil than soils irrigated with tap water to add to this the awcd of the biolog plates inoculated with soil subjected be treatments was significantly higher those inoculated with soil irrigated with tap water the same results were observed when looking at the diversity and richness of the biolog plates in previous studies the application of treated effluents onto soil had no effect or increased the microbial population in the soil 31 32 these authors concluded that the increase in microbial populations could have been due to the increase in soil carbon however the increase in microbial populations could be due to the addition of microbes present in the wastewater 31 juwarkar dutta 15 and kaushik et al 16 observed a 50 reduction in soil microbial populations treated with raw distillery effluent in conclusion the application of be had no effect on the soil microbial populations in terms of numbers and metabolic diversity however the prolonged use of be will result in a build up of salt in the soil which may have negative effects on soil microbial populations 7 8 as well as shift in diversity to more salt tolerant species 27 28 4 3 conclusion brewery effluent can be used as an irrigation water source for cabbage production and contains sufficient nutrients to improve crop growth since cabbages irrigated with be grew significantly larger than those irrigated with water only post ad or post pfp be is the most suitable for crop irrigation because it contains the highest concentration of plant nutrients and the lowest conductivity however be is an inferior irrigation water source when compared with a nutritional irrigation water source the ph adjustment of be did not improve plant growth or the biological activity chemical and physical fertility of the soil post hrap and cw be were the least suitable for crop irrigation due to the lowest concentration of nutrients and the highest concentration of salts the sodium and chloride concentrations and overall conductivity are the biggest concerns when using be because the combination results in an increase in the sar and conductivity of the soil which puts osmotic stress on the plants resulting in reduced growth the application of post ad and post pfp be did not significantly decrease the biological and physical factors of the soil however after prolonged use it may negatively affect the soil s physical structure and reduce the soil s biological activity due to the sodium and chloride present in the effluent future studies should investigate the long term effects of irrigating soils with post ad or post pfp be and

that contains nitrogen and phosphorus and a range of organic and inorganic compounds 30 32 these nutrients are essential for plant growth and health so brewery effluent has the potential to be used as a source of water and nutrients in irrigated crop production 10 26 32 however be also has properties that inhibit the growth of plants and deteriorate soil physical profile and fertility when used to irrigate crops 16 17 8 brewery effluent at ibhayi brewery sab pty ltd port elizabeth south africa is treated in an anaerobic digester ad and activated sludge system before being either piped to a municipal sewer or channelled back to the factory for re use in non production activities a small stream of post ad be is fed into an experimental treatment facility which uses various alternative sustainable methods of bioremediation including a primary facultative pond pfp a high rate algal pond hrap and a constructed wetland cw each treatment process results in be with different water quality parameters such as ph form and concentration of nitrogen and the concentration of phosphorus sodium and other dissolved salts 14 these parameters have been shown to directly and indirectly affect plant growth and soil fertility 21 30 different methods of be pre treatment have been found to influence nutrient availability and downstream crop productivity 30 furthermore the sodium concentration of be negatively affected the physical properties of the irrigated soil 8 it is therefore essential that the most effective pre treatment method of be is found so that the nutrients in the effluent are made accessible to the plants while minimising any negative impacts be may have on the soil 1 1 aims and objectives the aim of this study was to determine the suitability of different tertiary effluent technologies in making be suitable for crop irrigation this was done by comparing the change in soil characteristics and growth of cabbages irrigated with be drawn at various points from an experimental be treatment system including post ad post pfp post hrap and post cw to cabbages irrigated with tap water or a combination of water and inorganic fertilizer 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental species and system cabbage brassica oleracea was used as the test crop because it has similar salt tolerance and nutrient requirements as most vegetables 29 two hundred cabbage seedlings brassica oleracea cv star 3301 starke ayres pty ltd south africa were purchased from a commercial nursery moorland seedlings pty ltd humansdorp south africa of these 120 similar size seedlings were used in this experiment cabbage plants were grown out doors in 23 l pots these pots were filled with an oxidic sandy loam top soil 10 silt 20 25 clay 65 70 sand classified according to macvicar et al 22 one cabbage plant was planted in each pot 2 2 treatments six irrigation solutions were applied to the cabbages which included post ad post pfp post hrap post cw a nutrient solution ns and municipal water the ph of each treatment was either adjusted to 6 5 with 98 sulphuric acid protea chemicals pty ltd south africa or left unadjusted table 1 the plants irrigated with tap water served as a control the nutrient solution was comprised of a commercially available inorganic fertilizer hygrotech pty ltd south africa registration number k5709 act 36 of 1947 and calcium nitrate

treatment was replicated ten times with a replicate consisting of a single plant in a pot 2 3 irrigation regime and pest control cabbages were irrigated with one litre two to three times a week during irrigation care was taken not to wet the cabbage leaves the maximum volume of water irrigated at one time was one litre this was done to ensure that leaching did not occur water was not observed draining out the bottom of the pots in total each cabbage plant received 198 1 mm of treatment water and 91 mm of rain during the twelve week growth trial one month after planting diamond back moth larvae were noticed on some of the cabbages cabbages plants were sprayed with malasol active ingredient mercaptothion efekto agro serve pty ltd to kill the larvae when a spraying occurred every plant

4 discussion 4 1 plant growth and health each treatment contained different concentrations of plant nutrients which should have affected the growth and health of plants they were used to irrigate cabbages irrigated with ns ad and pfp treatments were significantly bigger than plants irrigated with hrap cw and water treatments cabbages irrigated with ad and pfp effluents where 12 heavier than cabbages irrigated with tap water in order to sustain vigorous and healthy growth plants require sufficient concentrations of macro and micro nutrients 10 24 the hrap and cw treatment processes utilise algae and plants which decrease the concentration of nutrients in the effluent as it is utilised to support plant growth this is probably the main reason why plants irrigated with hrap and cw treatment water were significantly smaller than plants irrigated with ns ad and pfp treatments to further support this conclusion plants subject to hrap and cw treatments showed signs of nutrient deficiency their outer leaves were yellow orange and or dark red purple in colour which is known as chlorosis and necrosis and is a sign of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium deficiency 10 effluent treatment processes that remove plant nutrients are counterproductive when using effluents as an irrigation source for plants because they remove valuable nutrients that are needed to support plant growth anaerobically digested and post pfp be can be used to increase the yield of crops which are irrigated with water containing low concentrations of nutrients such as tap water or post cw effluent brewery effluent is not an ideal plant nutrient solution and has certain characteristics that could inhibit plant growth anaerobically digested and post pfp be contained slightly higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus than the ns however cabbages that were irrigated with be subjected to ad and pfp were smaller than cabbages irrigated with ns but showed no signs of nutrient deficiency therefore certain characteristics of be either inhibit the uptake of nutrients by cabbages or put stress on the plants resulting in less energy being spent on growth it has previously been identified that the high conductivity sodicity and ph in be may decrease the growth and health of plants 3 30 32 the ph of nutrient solution plays a major role in the availability of macro and micro nutrients to plants with the optimal range for most plants being between five and seven lucas davies 1961 10 the unadjusted be treatments had ph values around 8 14 with hrap treatment having a mean ph of 9 17 fig 2 surprisingly no difference was observed in the growth cci and chemical composition of cabbages subject to be treatments with or without ph adjustment the ph range for good quality irrigation water is between 6 5 and 7 5 10 high ph values above 8 5 can cause the precipitation of fe2 mn2 po4 ca2 and mn2 to insoluble and plant unavailable salts 37 5 however there was no difference in the growth cci or chemical composition of cabbages treated with ph unadjusted hrap effluent ph 9 17 and ph adjusted hrap effluent ph 6 5 soils have the ability of resist ph changes which is known as their buffering capacity buckman brady 1967 the buffering capacity could have counteracted the ph adjustment of be the salinity of irrigation water is one of the concerns when using effluents as irrigation waters since salinity causes decreased growth and yield of most crops 26 33 the mean ec of be was 3301 85 µs cm2 which should reduce cabbage crops yields by 10 20 9 the mean mass of cabbages irrigated with ad and pfp effluents was 13 lower than cabbages irrigated with ns treatments the high ec of ad and pfp treatments probably caused the decreased yield of cabbages when compared with ns irrigated cabbages because ad and pfp treatments contained higher concentrations of n and p than the ns treatment medium salinity of irrigation water 2000 3000 µs cm2 causes a decrease in yield in cabbages and most vegetables 33 this is primarily due to the osmotic effects by decreasing the osmotic potential between the root plasma and soil water 13 25 the severity of the crop response to salinity is species specific and is also mediated by environmental factors such as humidity temperature wind light and air pollution 33 it is important to select salt tolerant crops when using moderately saline effluents in irrigation 4 2 soil fertility soil water potential quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another area and is mainly affected by the concentration of salts in the soil 38 5 it provides a measure of how easily soil water will move into the root of a plant soils subject to irrigation with hrap and cw had significantly lower water potentials at all soil moisture concentrations than soils subjected to the other treatments as the salinity of the irrigation water and or soil increases the water potential will decrease 4 5 this means that plants have to spend more energy to get water from the soil which in turn will compromise the growth of the plant 4 5 the high salinity of be probably increased the energy that plants invested in obtaining water and this is a possible cause for the decreased growth of plants in these treatments most plants including cabbages cannot access water in the soil when the water potential decreases below 1 5 mpa this is represented by the dashed black line in fig 6 6 19 6 this means that in soils irrigated with hrap and cw treated be plants could not access water in the soil when the gravimetric soil moisture concentration dropped below 15 with the other treatments plants could not access soil water when the gravimetric soil moisture concentration dropped below 10 the negative affect of saline irrigation waters on the availability of water to plants demonstrated that the treatment process that results in be having the lowest salinity would be the most suitable for crop irrigation the salinity of the treatments had an effect on the salinity and sar of the soils which in turn could affect the physical characteristics of the soil at the beginning of the trial the soils had an sar of 2 21 0 05 after 12 weeks of irrigation the soil sar subject to be treatments rose to 8 18 0 17 while the sar of soils subject ns and water remained the same throughout the trial soils that have a sar 13 are classified as sodic and are unsuitable for cultivating most vegetable crops 36 qadir schubert 2002 in most studies conducted on the use of wastewaters as an irrigation water source the sar of the receiving soil has increased 16 18 dakoure et al 8 irrigated eggplants grown on ferralsol soil with be that had been treated using stabilisation ponds after two seasons of irrigation they found that the effluent caused an increase in the sar 2 9 20 3 and esp of the soil accompanied by a strong degradation of hydro structural soil properties soil irrigated with effluent had a decreased soil structural porosity an increased bulk density and ph when compared with soils irrigated with tap water 8 during this study the increase in sar of the soil did not seem to negatively affect the physical structure of the soil with the exception of the stability of soil aggregates which was slightly lower than soils irrigated the ns treatment however this trial was only run for 12 weeks and after prolonged irrigation with be an increase in the sar of the soil and accompanied decrease in the soil s physical structure would be expected this emphasises the point that the be treatment which results in the lowest sodium chloride and salinity concentration will be most suitable for irrigation the different treatments influenced the infiltration rates of the soil with soils subject to hrap cw and water treatments developing reduced infiltration rates these treatments either had the highest sodium concentration hrap cw or the lowest conductivity water a high sodium concentration in irrigation water causes extreme flocculation resulting in the formation of a soil crust and decreased infiltration rates while the low conductivity 500 µs cm2 of the water treatments caused soil particle dispersion resulting in a decreased soil structure and infiltration rates 2 5 it is important to understand whether the application of be onto soils will affect the community of microbes in the soil and thus the functions they provide 1 no significant difference was observed in the carbon source utilisation of soils subject to the irrigation treatments fig 9 soils were dominated by carbohydrate 36 03 utilising bacteria followed by amino acid 22 11 carboxylic and acetic acid 19 31 and polymer 18 45 utilising bacteria the literature shows both detrimental and enhancing effects of effluent on soil microbial population and communities illustrating the complexity of relationships among soil microbial communities in agricultural soils 34 35 from this study it can be concluded that the application of be to agricultural soils does not affect the overall functioning and processes performed by the soil microbe community in the short term it may have changed the species composition of soil microbes but the overall metabolic community structure of microbes present was not affected future studies should investigate the changes in species composition of soil microbes using metagenomics and conduct the study over a longer timescale soils subject to be and ns treatments had significantly higher colony forming units per gram of soil than soils irrigated with tap water to add to this the awcd of the biolog plates inoculated with soil subjected be treatments was significantly higher those inoculated with soil irrigated with tap water the same results were observed when looking at the diversity and richness of the biolog plates in previous studies the application of treated effluents onto soil had no effect or increased the microbial population in the soil 31 32 these authors concluded that the increase in microbial populations could have been due to the increase in soil carbon however the increase in microbial populations could be due to the addition of microbes present in the wastewater 31 juwarkar dutta 15 and kaushik et al 16 observed a 50 reduction in soil microbial populations treated with raw distillery effluent in conclusion the application of be had no effect on the soil microbial populations in terms of numbers and metabolic diversity however the prolonged use of be will result in a build up of salt in the soil which may have negative effects on soil microbial populations 7 8 as well as shift in diversity to more salt tolerant species 27 28 4 3 conclusion brewery effluent can be used as an irrigation water source for cabbage production and contains sufficient nutrients to improve crop growth since cabbages irrigated with be grew significantly larger than those irrigated with water only post ad or post pfp be is the most suitable for crop irrigation because it contains the highest concentration of plant nutrients and the lowest conductivity however be is an inferior irrigation water source when compared with a nutritional irrigation water source the ph adjustment of be did not improve plant growth or the biological activity chemical and physical fertility of the soil post hrap and cw be were the least suitable for crop irrigation due to the lowest concentration of nutrients and the highest concentration of salts the sodium and chloride concentrations and overall conductivity are the biggest concerns when using be because the combination results in an increase in the sar and conductivity of the soil which puts osmotic stress on the plants resulting in reduced growth the application of post ad and post pfp be did not significantly decrease the biological and physical factors of the soil however after prolonged use it may negatively affect the soil s physical structure and reduce the soil s biological activity due to the sodium and chloride present in the effluent future studies should investigate the long term effects of irrigating soils with post ad or post pfp be and

8841,modern agriculture is underpinned by actual meteorological data registered using automated meteorological stations forming networks specifically created for advising purposes in many cases those data used to be accessible online by means of apis application programming interface one of the most common cases is the irrigation advice weather network implemented with the aim of obtaining eto values to be used in irrigation recommendations however those punctual values of eto scattered throughout the territory do not allow to produce specific irrigation recommendations for each farm the only way of disposing site specific values of eto is by compiling maps that describe its spatial variation with this objective a new dynamic procedure based on an existing regression based technique of interpolation was proposed using the meteorological data registered at the end of each day maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind velocity and radiation maps were interpolated and then an eto map was derived the proposed procedure demonstrated a special adaptation capacity to the synoptic pattern of each day using some geographical features or others as appropriate to explain the spatial variability of the interpolated meteorological variable in those months where radiation plays a key role in the eto value growing season eto maps obtained were especially fine grained in areas with significant relief this procedure improved other contrasted methodologies they were compared with the impact of using the nearest weather station eto vs interpolated value on a daily water needs was investigated and near 10 average value of error was encountered in the case study keywords reference evapotranspiration regression based interpolation procedures eto mapping agricultural weather networks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent times a multitude of agricultural weather networks awn have been developed around the world with the aim of advising agricultural activities shulski et al 2018 certainly fostered by the exponential growth of digital technologies few years ago the installation and maintenance of these kinds of facilities were only within reach of governmental agencies and national weather services of countries however nowadays cooperative extensions universities growers associations and regional or even local governments are providing this service thanks to the automated weather stations furthermore adopting modern information and communication technologies allows data to be available in real time among the different ways of serving the registered data to the users weather apis application programming interface are gaining space due to their flexibility any authorized user can retrieve data online from the awn creating software applications that directly consume the data in this sense it is worth to highlight the increase of the awns specifically set up to advice irrigators elliott et al 2000 this type of weather station uses to be equipped with enough sensors temperature and relative humidity probes anemometer and pyranometer to derive the fao 56 penman monteith pm56 reference evapotranspiration eto brown 2007 as an expression of the daily evaporative demand of the atmosphere raes et al 2009 eto along with the registered rainfall allows to provide irrigation recommendations using the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 nonetheless even if an irrigation advice weather network exists in a region stations density does not allow producing specific irrigation recommendations for each farm depending on the relative location of the farm in respect of the weather station the eto employed could come from many kilometers apart martínez lüscher et al 2022 under this circumstance the only way of disposing site specific values of eto is by compiling maps that describe its spatial variation vicente serrano et al 2007 to do that two main procedures can be identified in the literature on the one hand a number of authors employed geostatistical or deterministic interpolation methods hodam et al 2017 mancosu et al 2014 noshadi and sepaskhah 2005 and martinez cob 1996 utilized ordinary kriging residual kriging cokriging and inverse distance squared martínez cob and cuenca 1992 and mardikis et al 2005 proposed variations in some of them to include the terrain elevation as a covariate due to its deep influence in landscapes with some relief on the other hand and considering that eto would be spatially influenced by not only elevation but other geographical features other authors opted for statistical techniques of mapping previously employed successfully to map other meteorological variables like temperature agnew and palutikof 2000 ninyerola et al 2007a precipitation daly et al 2002 ninyerola et al 2007b or radiation pons and ninyerola 2008 this kind of interpolation method uses to be based on multiple linear regressions in which the explained meteorological variable is related to some geographical characteristic like latitude longitude elevation continentality slope aspect etc acting as independent variables to date only a few studies have explicitly addressed this eto mapping approach furthermore the existing ones are obtained on a monthly basis vicente serrano et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2007 a definitely time step not valid to be used to make irrigation recommendations that need at most weekly or preferably daily eto values it is worth emphasizing that the aforementioned regression based statistical techniques of mapping eto can be addressed under two different headings mcvicar et al 2007 i calculate then interpolate approach interpolating directly the punctual eto values obtained in each weather station on the region covered for the awn martí and zarzo 2012 or ii interpolate then calculate approach interpolating separately each meteorological variable involved in the pm56 formulation maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity 2 meter height wind speed and solar radiation and then applying layer algebra for each grid cell to derive the eto map vicente serrano et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2007 as a general rule in the previous monthly basis works authors agreed that better results were obtained using the second approach despite the error propagation along with each interpolation involved vicente serrano et al 2007 conversely from a temporal point of view those previous monthly basis works are static due to the fact that the regression coefficients were obtained using a certain weather station percentage of the network and validated in the rest of them e g 80 mapping 20 validation but for the same period of time e g same 15 20 or whatever period of years it is not proven that this approach guarantees the adequacy of these regression equations for a new period i e for a new month of a new year not to mention for producing daily eto maps in relation to the generation of daily meteorological variable surfaces a special mention deserves the contribution of thornton et al 1997 they improved the mtclim logic model hungerford et al 1989 applying a truncated gaussian filter as an interpolation method and a weighted least square regression between pairs of stations as a correction for the effect of the elevation on the variables using this method important products like daymet dataset oak ridge national laboratory supported by nasa usa thornton et al 2021 1997 have been delivered daymet dataset provides long term continuous gridded estimates of daily weather and climatology variables on a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface over continental north america from 1980 but does not exist in other regions or in other resolutions using this same algorithm with a few modifications the r package meteoland de cáceres et al 2018 allows the spatial interpolation of daily weather records from meteorological stations in order to produce continuous surfaces in this case the user decides the spatial resolution by means of the resolution of the elevation surface or digital elevation model dem employed in the interpolation procedure in regions covered by awns specifically devoted to irrigation advice with weather api real time access to the data it is peremptory to investigate the development of a dynamic algorithm capable to obtain reliable eto maps on a daily basis and with an adequate spatial resolution to produce site specific irrigation recommendations and not just referred to the nearest weather station at the end of each day the api should serve a new map along with the regular daily meteorological records this study aims at contributing to an improved comprehension of eto mapping on a daily basis considering the geographical characteristics of the landscape our study was conducted in the jucar river system a mediterranean region of eastern spain where the intensive irrigated agriculture and a pronounced relief in certain areas provided an excellent context to address the following research questions rq rq1 are monthly interpolation procedures capable to produce proper eto maps on a daily basis using static equations coming from historical data rq2 do all the meteorological variables involved in the pm56 eto calculation have the same influence on the final eto value and is this influence constant throughout the year rq3 derived from the previous question does the lack of precision interpolating one meteorological variable have the same impact as another 2 material and methods 2 1 case study area the jucar river system jrs placed in the east of spain fig 1 the jucar river system jrs almost exactly matches the same name river basin according to the published information by the river authority confederación hidrográfica del júcar 2022 the basin is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate the annual average precipitation is about 500 mm ranging from 300 to 780 mm the rainfall regime combines intense rains in autumn october is the rainiest month with nearly 60 mm and spring with dry summers july is the driest month with nearly 13 mm the average temperature ranges from 11 c in winter to 26 6 c in summer the average eto for the period 1980 2018 was 992 7 mm the geographical area of the jrs is 2 226 093 ha of which 210 000 ha are irrigated to finish with citrus trees are the main crop occupying nearly 40 of the irrigated area being cereals vineyards fruit trees horticulture crops and olives the other 60 confederación hidrográfica del júcar 2022 2 2 meteorological data siar agricultural weather network irrigated areas of the jucar river system jrs are covered by the awn named siar agro climatic information system for irrigation www siar es siar was created in 1998 to promote water savings by means of proper irrigation recommendations and covering the main irrigable areas of spain with a total of 460 automated weather stations 63 of them located into or near the perimeter of the jrs as can be seen in fig 2 siar was promoted by the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food mapa and is maintained and in some cases densified with additional stations by the different regional governments that is the case of the jrs whose weather stations are maintained by the valencian community and castile la mancha community regional governments in fig 3 can be seen a typical automated weather station equipped with a bucket rainfall sensor anemometer and wind direction located at 2 m normalized high from the ground temperature and humidity probes and pyranometer the station is completed with a data logger and a gsm communication module to transfer the data automatically several times a day meteorological records are registered every 30 min and then aggregated to hourly and daily data to be served through the api in the stations of the siar network preventive maintenance is carried out every six months performing a general review in the same way an annual calibration of the station sensors is done in a laboratory corrective maintenance of any anomaly detected in the station is carried out 2 3 modeling framework since the final purpose of this work was developing a dynamic eto mapping procedure to deliver site specific irrigation recommendations according to fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation was adopted to calculate the reference evapotranspiration eto 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa ºc 1 r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 día 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 día 1 u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa ºc 1 e s e a is the saturation vapour pressure deficit kpa and t m is the mean daily air temperature ºc in this work an interpolate then calculate approach was adopted thus a continuous grid cell map per meteorological variable involved in the pm56 eto had to be previously interpolated based on the daily records registered for the awn the spatial resolution of the grid cell maps for all cases was 100 m fig 4 describes the proposed modeling framework three different spatial interpolation procedures were applied and then compared using model performance metrics i meteoland r package ii monthly static regression based interpolation sri and iii daily dynamic regression based interpolation dri the three procedures are shortly described here with some detail hereafter in the next section i meteoland de cáceres et al 2018 r package implements with few modifications the daily weather interpolation algorithms developed by thornton et al 2021 1997 and thornton and running 1999 that underpin the daymet dataset https daymet ornl gov the interpolation procedure is based on a truncated gaussian filter and the correction of the meteorological variables for the elevation effect is solved using a weighted least square regression between stations and target points to be interpolated daily potential solar radiation is calculated after garnier and ohmura 1968 and the incident radiation after thornton and running 1999 further details about the algorithms and procedures can be seen in de cáceres et al 2018 and the r package documentation https cran r project org web packages meteoland index html meteoland was employed to interpolate 365 daily continuous surfaces year 2022 of the mean tm maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperature maximum hrmax and minimum hrmin relative humidity wind velocity u 2 and incident solar radiation rs using 49 training stations of siar network as defined in fig 2 results were validated using 14 validation stations of the siar network as well as illustrated in fig 2 finally applying layer algebra for each grid cell the pm56 eto map was obtained ii monthly static regression based interpolation sri is a regression based procedure calculated using exactly the same methodology after vicente serrano et al 2007 using a 15 year period 2007 2021 monthly multiple regression equations were obtained using those static monthly regression equations based on historical data 365 daily for the year 2022 continuous grid cell maps of tm tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u 2 were obtained an upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm was employed to obtain rs on a monthly basis finally applying layer algebra for each grid cell the pm56 eto map was derived the same procedure of validation as described in the meteoland procedure was employed explained in more detail in the next section iii daily dynamic regression based interpolation dri it turns out to be the very novelty proposal of this paper based on the sri procedure a new regression equation is obtained every day instead of using static regression equations obtained from historical data according to the atmospheric conditions of each day different geographical features are able to explain spatial variability 365 daily continuous grid cell maps for the year 2022 of tm tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u2 were obtained using this method an upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm was employed to get rs on a daily basis finally applying layer algebra for each grid cell the pm56 eto map was derived the same validation procedure described in the meteoland procedure was employed explained in more detail in the next section 2 4 monthly static sri and daily dynamic dri regression based interpolation procedures 2 4 1 maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity and wind speed interpolation procedure for this purpose the regression based technique of interpolation after vicente serrano et al 2007 and previously ninyerola et al 2000 was applied the value of the variable in the space among weather stations was calculated using the equation z x a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n where z x is the predicted value of the temperature humidity or wind speed ºc or m s 1 respectively a 0 to a n are the regression coefficients and x 1 to x n are the values of the independent variables geographical features at the spatial point x table 1 includes the geographical features acting as independent variables the linear relationship between them and the predicted temperature humidity wind speed was investigated using a multiple regression forward stepwise procedure only independent variables with p value 0 01 were included in the regression avoiding collinearity problems derived from using the complete set hair et al 2010 homoscedasticity using residual plots and no residual autocorrelation using the durbin watson parameter were checked as well after obtaining the geographical variables involved and the coefficients of the multiple regression equations a continuous map was obtained by simply combining the raster layers with the information of each geographic variable and applying the algebraic formula logically at the location of each weather station the value of the registered and modeled temperature humidity wind speed does not match residuals use to be interpolated over the entire study area and summed up to the predicted value using local techniques in this case the splines with tension method mitášová and mitáš 1993 was employed to do that this way registered and predicted values at the weather station locations employed to train the model training stations in fig 2 coincide and the validation in other locations improves substantially validation stations in fig 2 according to ninyerola et al 2000 and agnew and palutikof 2000 for sri monthly regression equations were obtained using a 15 year period of daily data 2007 2021 those static monthly regression equations based on historical data were obtained only once and then employed in the generation of new daily continuous grid cell maps of tm tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u 2 for the year 2022 nevertheless in dri based on the registered daily data along the awn a new regression equation was obtained specifically for each day only those geographical features with statical significance were included being the case as they might be different even for two contiguous days 2 4 2 radiation interpolation procedure solar radiation plays a key role in the et process due to the fact that is responsible of contributing the necessary energy to transform water from liquid to vapor state hence the spatial heterogeneity of the incoming solar energy produced by a complex topography elevation slope aspect and shadows creates strong local gradients that determine the dynamic of the et tovar pescador et al 2006 that cannot be ignored assuming a flat terrain for that reason several models and almost all gis platforms have developed algorithms for estimating solar radiation spatially adapted to the relief solarflux for arcinfo dubayah and rich 1995 solar analyst for arc view fu and rich 2000 srad wilson and gallant 2000 solei for idrisi miklánek 1993 miramon gis pons 2006 mtclim logic daymet thornton et al 2021 1997 thornton and running 1999 meteoland de cáceres et al 2018 or r sun for grass qgis hofierka et al 2002 are some examples of this some of the aforementioned models employ the upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm the viewshed algorithm is a virtualized version of hemispherical canopy photography kodysh et al 2013 three main results are obtained from them i global ii direct and iii diffuse radiation regardless of the version of the upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm employed two parameters control the algorithm i atmosphere transmissivity and ii diffuse radiation rate transmissivity is a property of the atmosphere and is the quotient between the radiation received at the top of the atmosphere and that reaching the earth s surface ranging from 0 no transmission to 1 complete transmission typically observed values are 0 6 0 7 for very clear sky conditions and 0 5 for a generally clear sky the percentage of global radiation that is diffused is approximately 0 2 for very clear sky conditions and 0 7 for very cloudy sky conditions arcgis help 2022 kodysh et al 2013 it should be noted that transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate depend on atmospheric conditions and are constantly changing not only cloud cover but also precipitation dust or aerosol presence attenuate the amount of diffuse and direct solar radiation for a given surface hence transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate are time space specific and they are constantly changing to consider this attribute consistent with a feasible computational effort the following method was applied for the 2022 year 365 different grid maps of potential radiation pr one for each doy were obtained using the upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm and assuming values of transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate for the very best clear sky conditions 0 6 and 0 2 respectively for each day we want to obtain a radiation map the ratio of the actual radiation rs registered for each weather station to doy specific pr at the weather station location was calculated these punctual rs pr ratio values were then spatially interpolated using the splines with tension method mitášová and mitáš 1993 obtaining an rs pr grid cell map then a daily rs grid cell map was derived by multiplying this rs pr ratio grid and the pr grid in this work solar analyst for arcgis environment was employed in order to obtain the 365 doy specific pr maps and v surf rst for grass environment to interpolate daily rs pr ratio values using the splines with tension method a monthly radiation average map was aggregated using the same method for the monthly basis calculations further details about those algorithms can be found in the aforementioned references and gis platform s user manuals 2 5 sensitivity analysis of pm56 eto to the meteorological variables in order to assess the sensitivity of the eto to the meteorological variable changes a sensitivity analysis was developed in this analysis all the meteorological variables except one were maintained constant on the average monthly values while the eto was calculated using the minimum and the maximum value of the range of each variable the difference between them δeto is expressed as a percentage of the eto for the average conditions this sensitivity analysis methodology has been widely employed in the literature for the very same purpose goyal 2004 irmak et al 2006 paturel et al 1995 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2006 2 6 maps validation and model performance the accuracy of the interpolated maps has to be assessed by comparing modeled vs actual registered data in other weather stations different from the one employed in the interpolation procedure for this purpose 20 of the awn stations 14 out 63 were randomly selected to be employed only for the validation tests as shown in fig 2 as explained before the rest of the stations 49 out 63 were employed exclusively in the interpolation procedures a number of statistical metrics can be found in the literature with the aim of assessing the ability of models to capture reality according to legates and mccabe 1999 a model performance assessment should include one or several absolute relative error measures and one or several goodness of ﬁt measures taking into account that the square of deviations e g root mean square error rmse use to be more sensitive to outliers than deviations p j o j in an absolute value sense e g mean absolute error mae or mean bias error mbe the statistical metrics included in table 2 were employed to assess the eto maps as regards the performance comparison between models two dimensionless indices were calculated i willmott index of agreement d willmott 1981 and ii nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse ranges between 1 and nse 1 means a perfect match between model outputs and observed values and nse 0 means that the average of the observations would be a better predictor than the model output regarding the wilmott index of agreement d has limits of 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement groenendijk et al 2014 the three evaluated models were graphically compared using a taylor diagram taylor 2001 the similarity between two patterns in the taylor diagram is quantified in terms of their correlation the amplitude of their variations standard deviations and their centered root mean square difference in the taylor diagram only one mark per model output is represented using the three dimensions the closer the model mark regarding the observed mark is the better the agreement was finally the impact of using the dri interpolated vs nearest weather station eto value on a daily irrigation recommendation was assessed and quantified as follows the area that is closest to each jrs weather station was obtained by creating the thiessen polygons fig 10 for each weather station on the other hand the centroid of each individual plot or farm was obtained and the dri eto value from the interpolated maps was assigned to it the total number of plots in the jrs was 263 413 the difference between the dri interpolated and the recorded in the nearest weather station eto value was computed for each plot and compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 interpolation procedures performance assessment the final purpose of this paper was to develop a dynamic method of mapping eto at the end of each day a programmed script could produce a new continuous surface of pm56 eto using the registered data of an awn however since the proposed method does not make a direct spatial interpolation of eto values but requires one interpolated surface of each meteorological variable involved in the pm56 eto equation not only the eto maps should be assessed in order to understand how the different methods worked out rs tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u 2 maps in addition to reference evapotranspiration were compared the validation of the maps was developed by comparing the map value in those grid cells where 14 out 63 stations see fig 2 not included in the interpolation process were located to the actual values registered in those stations for each meteorological variable fig 5 a predicted vs observed scatter plot was generated including all the validation weather stations and all the daily observations of the year 2022 365 14 5110 a legend with the statistical metrics was also incorporated in the body of the scatter plot sri showed the worst performance in all statistical metrics and for all meteorological variables demonstrating that static regressions method based on historical data did not accurately capture the variability of daily eto in respect of the monthly averaged values they come from at the other end the best performance was encountered for the dri procedure dri and meteoland exhibited a similar performance for tmax and tmin and relatively close for rs however meteoland showed a poor performance in hrmin hrmax and u 2 this aspect was transmitted to the final eto results and was reflected on the metrics producing an r 2 of 0 95 vs 0 91 nse of 0 95 vs 0 91 and d of 0 99 vs 0 97 for dri and meteoland respectively a lesser error was also obtained according to the metrics for dri as well another way of comparing models performance is by means of the taylor diagram the similarity between patterns in this graphical method is quantified in terms of their correlation amplitude of their variations standard deviations and their centered root mean square difference each model is represented in the body of the plot using those three coordinates the closer a point in respect of the point representing the actual observed values is the better performance the model has similar results to the one obtained using the statistical metrics could be observed in this analysis the advantage of this graph over other performance evaluation methods is that it allows understanding at a glance how far one model is from the actual data and from the other models they are being compared in fig 6 can be seen the taylor diagrams of the eto and the different meteorological variables involved in the interpolation procedures fig 6 was plotted using plotrix r package lemon 2006 another additional aspect can be seen in this graph when two models exhibit similar values of correlation and error the standard deviation breaks the tie the standard deviation of the observed values is represented with a solid black line along the graph the closer the point is in respect to this line the better because this is a symptom of the similarity of probability distributions as can be seen in fig 6 sri showed the worst performance and dri the best one in those meteorological variables with similar behavior when dri and meteoland were compared always dri was closer to the standard deviation line as was mentioned in the last paragraph the shape of the distribution function between observed and modeled values is also important for this purpose in the fig 7 both a frequency histogram with its density function and overlapped violin plots were generated for observed dri sri and meteoland values of eto the violin plot adler et al 2022 is a symmetric representation of a box and whiskers plot a similar shape in those three plots guarantees a similar distribution of probability as can be seen in fig 7 dri was able to reproduce with greater similarity than the other methods the shape of the observed eto distribution 3 2 sensitivity analysis of pm56 eto in order to understand the behavior of the different interpolation procedures a sensitivity analysis of the pm56 eto to the different meteorological variables involved was developed for the year 2022 in the ab09 validation station see fig 2 this station was selected because it is located just in the center of the jrs first of all average values of tmax tmin hrmax hrmin rs and u 2 on a monthly basis were calculated and assigned to the 15th day of the month on the other hand each month s minimum and maximum absolute values of each variable were recorded indicating the range of this variable in this month results were exposed in table 3 in this table the first column on the left indicates the day of the year doy for each 15th day of each month following this in the first row 9 79 mj m2 d 1 is the monthly average value of rs for january and occupies the second column and finally 5 21 mj m2 d 1 and 12 81 mj m2 d 1 is the range of rs for the same month that can be seen in the third and fourth columns next columns are showing the same information for the rest of the meteorological variables to finish with the last column shows the daily average conditions pm56 eto mm d 1 obtained for this synthetic 2022 year with only one day per month emulating the same structure of table 3 results of the sensitivity analysis were summarized in table 4 in this analysis all the meteorological variables except one were maintained constant on the average monthly values exposed in table 3 then the eto was calculated using the minimum and the maximum value of the range of each variable and the difference between them δeto expressed as a percentage of the eto for the average conditions pointed out in table 4 thus for the first raw when rs adopted the minimum value in january eto was 1 03 mm d 1 third column exactly the same when rs adopted the maximum value fourth column being 0 the increment of the eto produced the next columns are showing the same information for the rest of the meteorological variables this sensitivity analysis methodology has been widely employed in the literature for the very same purpose goyal 2004 irmak et al 2006 paturel et al 1995 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2006 based on the results of table 4 table 5 summarize the effect of each meteorological variable on eto the first part of the table is referred to the ab09 weather station we used as an example and the second part is the result of averaging δeto for all the validation weather stations prior to calculating table 5 only significant differences were encountered in wind velocity u 2 according to this changes in rs has no effect on eto in winter a slightly effect in summer but a deep influence in spring summer and autumn tmax has a slightly effect in summer but a high influence in the rest of the year hrmin demonstrated capacity to modify eto in autumn and winter and finally u 2 showed a high or very high influence on eto although this depends on the wind exposure of the area the station ab09 showed a deep influence to wind in summer however the average of the validation weather station showed a low influence in summer tmin and hrmax had no influence at all to modify the eto fig 8 shows the complete eto values of the year 2022 for the validation station ab09 according to the table 5 and taking into account the good performance of both meteoland and dri for rs and tmax we can conclude that the meteorological variable responsible of the deviations between observed and modeled eto values fig 8 is the wind velocity new investigations have to be done in this field to improve the accuracy of this interpolation 3 3 daily dynamic dri vs monthly static sri regression based interpolation comparison of tmax tmin hrmax hrmin u 2 as was explained before sri and dri from a mathematical sight are the same interpolation procedure the sri procedure produces only once the regression equations from historical data one equation per meteorological variable and per month and they are utilized every day to generate new maps that is why we called this method static however in dri using exactly the same process a new regression equation is obtained every day according to the atmospheric conditions of each day different geographical features are able to explain spatial variability dri adapts to the synoptic pattern of that day using some geographical features or others as appropriate to explain the spatial variability for the year 2022 365 days x 6 meteorological variables 2190 regression equations were generated in order to illustrate how the procedure worked in table 6 we reproduced the regression equation coefficients of 7 consecutive days for tmax it is worth emphasizing how the geographical features involved are constantly changing from one day to another it can be checked that the behavior was always exactly like that for all the variables and all the days of the year and that is why we call this method dynamic this capacity of adaptation to the synoptic pattern is undoubtedly the best quality of that method and the cause of the good results 3 3 radiation rs interpolation procedure many efforts can be found in the literature addressing how to produce radiation maps dubayah and rich 1995 fu and rich 2000 wilson and gallant 2000 miklánek 1993 pons 2006 thornton et al 1997 2021 thornton and running 1999 de cáceres et al 2018 hofierka et al 2002 those algorithms solve precisely the amount of radiation that reaches at the top of the atmosphere one specific doy the effect of the relief in the actual amount that reaches the soil and when the real atmospheric parameters are known the effect of the atmosphere all the uncertainty of this method is related to those parameters transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate because they depend on the cloud cover precipitation dust or aerosols presence etc that use to be constantly changing in addition those parameters are not registered for the awn in this work to overcome this a simple but effective method was applied each doy a map of potential radiation was generated using the best clear conditions using a commercial software then using the registered data of radiation rs each day at each weather stations a rs pr ratio was obtained and spatially interpolated this way the real effect of the atmosphere in the radiation was spatially accounted for rs maps were compared to a contrasted method and a better performance was encountered again the proposed method can be called dynamic because using the registered data at the awn is able to adapt to the synoptic pattern 3 4 final dri pm56 eto maps in this study 365 maps of pm56 eto for the jrs were obtained to illustrate the final product the corresponding map to the 15th day of each month of the year 2022 were plotted and can be seen in fig 9 3 5 impact of using the dri interpolated vs nearest weather station eto value on a daily irrigation recommendation for this purpose the landscape of the jrs was divided into enclosures that belong to each weather station using the thiessen s polygon method as can be seen in fig 10 for the 15th day of each month of the year 2022 and for each thiessen polygon the eto registered in the weather station was compared to the dri interpolated eto value corresponding to each individual plot to do this the centroid of each individual plot or farm was obtained and the dri eto value from the interpolated maps was assigned to it and then compared to the one registered at the weather station table 7 summarizes that comparison due to the extension of that table only one month was included june after checking that results are representative of the rest of the year the dri eto range into each thiessen polygon was obtained was calculated by subtracting the maximum and the minimum values and expressed as absolute value mm and relative value respectively taking into account that crop water needs according to fao 56 methodology use to be calculated as etc eto x kc being etc the crop evapotranspiration and kc the crop coefficient and thus a linear combination of eto the very same deviation observed when the nearest weather station eto value is employed instead of the site specific interpolated value is expected to be transferred to the water needs the mean value of that difference for the entire jrs was 9 14 for the year 2022 employed as a demonstrative example throughout this entire work but with punctual values reaching more than 30 this reveals the necessity of using an interpolation method capable to adapt the synoptic pattern of each day producing site specific values of eto for each farm using the nearest weather station value of eto must be overcome 4 conclusions several targets were set prior to begin with this investigation however the germ was a purely practical objective to develop a dynamic method of mapping eto that could be used to produce site specific irrigation recommendations at the end of each day a programmed script could produce a new continuous surface of pm56 eto using the registered data of an awn however as the work progressed a second objective was gaining weight contributing to an improved comprehension of the eto mapping on a daily basis considering the geographical characteristics of the landscape our study was conducted in the jucar river system a mediterranean region of eastern spain where the intensive irrigated agriculture and a pronounced relief in certain areas provided an excellent context to address this problem on the one hand we had the necessity of generating eto maps and on the other a proper geographical context based on an existing statistical interpolation procedure developed to work on a monthly basis dri a new version adapted to work on a daily basis dri was developed with the only aim to know the quality of the results both existing and proposed algorithms were compared to a contrasted interpolation method meteoland using performance model assessment statistics demonstrated that the interpolation method originally planned to work monthly was unable to produce proper maps of any meteorological variable nor eto dri exhibited a similar performance than meteoland for tmax and tmin and a better performance in the rest of meteorological variables both models demonstrated a poor performance in u 2 on the other hand a very simple but effective method to interpolate rs was proposed and demonstrating a very good performance both dri and rs interpolation methods we called them dynamic methods because of their capacity of adapt to the synoptic pattern of each day being without any doubt the best quality of them and the cause of the good results besides dri was the only method that had the ability of reproducing the shape of the observed eto distribution deviations between observed and modeled eto values could be attributed to the low performance mapping the wind speed although the quality of the eto maps produced is very high new investigations have to be done in this field to improve the accuracy of the wind velocity interpolation this would be especially important in windy areas where the potential influence of u 2 on eto has been demonstrated could be very high the impact of using the nearest weather station eto vs dri interpolated value on a daily irrigation recommendation was investigated and near 10 average value of error was encountered for the whole jrs in the year 2022 declaration of competing interest

8841,modern agriculture is underpinned by actual meteorological data registered using automated meteorological stations forming networks specifically created for advising purposes in many cases those data used to be accessible online by means of apis application programming interface one of the most common cases is the irrigation advice weather network implemented with the aim of obtaining eto values to be used in irrigation recommendations however those punctual values of eto scattered throughout the territory do not allow to produce specific irrigation recommendations for each farm the only way of disposing site specific values of eto is by compiling maps that describe its spatial variation with this objective a new dynamic procedure based on an existing regression based technique of interpolation was proposed using the meteorological data registered at the end of each day maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind velocity and radiation maps were interpolated and then an eto map was derived the proposed procedure demonstrated a special adaptation capacity to the synoptic pattern of each day using some geographical features or others as appropriate to explain the spatial variability of the interpolated meteorological variable in those months where radiation plays a key role in the eto value growing season eto maps obtained were especially fine grained in areas with significant relief this procedure improved other contrasted methodologies they were compared with the impact of using the nearest weather station eto vs interpolated value on a daily water needs was investigated and near 10 average value of error was encountered in the case study keywords reference evapotranspiration regression based interpolation procedures eto mapping agricultural weather networks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent times a multitude of agricultural weather networks awn have been developed around the world with the aim of advising agricultural activities shulski et al 2018 certainly fostered by the exponential growth of digital technologies few years ago the installation and maintenance of these kinds of facilities were only within reach of governmental agencies and national weather services of countries however nowadays cooperative extensions universities growers associations and regional or even local governments are providing this service thanks to the automated weather stations furthermore adopting modern information and communication technologies allows data to be available in real time among the different ways of serving the registered data to the users weather apis application programming interface are gaining space due to their flexibility any authorized user can retrieve data online from the awn creating software applications that directly consume the data in this sense it is worth to highlight the increase of the awns specifically set up to advice irrigators elliott et al 2000 this type of weather station uses to be equipped with enough sensors temperature and relative humidity probes anemometer and pyranometer to derive the fao 56 penman monteith pm56 reference evapotranspiration eto brown 2007 as an expression of the daily evaporative demand of the atmosphere raes et al 2009 eto along with the registered rainfall allows to provide irrigation recommendations using the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 nonetheless even if an irrigation advice weather network exists in a region stations density does not allow producing specific irrigation recommendations for each farm depending on the relative location of the farm in respect of the weather station the eto employed could come from many kilometers apart martínez lüscher et al 2022 under this circumstance the only way of disposing site specific values of eto is by compiling maps that describe its spatial variation vicente serrano et al 2007 to do that two main procedures can be identified in the literature on the one hand a number of authors employed geostatistical or deterministic interpolation methods hodam et al 2017 mancosu et al 2014 noshadi and sepaskhah 2005 and martinez cob 1996 utilized ordinary kriging residual kriging cokriging and inverse distance squared martínez cob and cuenca 1992 and mardikis et al 2005 proposed variations in some of them to include the terrain elevation as a covariate due to its deep influence in landscapes with some relief on the other hand and considering that eto would be spatially influenced by not only elevation but other geographical features other authors opted for statistical techniques of mapping previously employed successfully to map other meteorological variables like temperature agnew and palutikof 2000 ninyerola et al 2007a precipitation daly et al 2002 ninyerola et al 2007b or radiation pons and ninyerola 2008 this kind of interpolation method uses to be based on multiple linear regressions in which the explained meteorological variable is related to some geographical characteristic like latitude longitude elevation continentality slope aspect etc acting as independent variables to date only a few studies have explicitly addressed this eto mapping approach furthermore the existing ones are obtained on a monthly basis vicente serrano et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2007 a definitely time step not valid to be used to make irrigation recommendations that need at most weekly or preferably daily eto values it is worth emphasizing that the aforementioned regression based statistical techniques of mapping eto can be addressed under two different headings mcvicar et al 2007 i calculate then interpolate approach interpolating directly the punctual eto values obtained in each weather station on the region covered for the awn martí and zarzo 2012 or ii interpolate then calculate approach interpolating separately each meteorological variable involved in the pm56 formulation maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity 2 meter height wind speed and solar radiation and then applying layer algebra for each grid cell to derive the eto map vicente serrano et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2007 as a general rule in the previous monthly basis works authors agreed that better results were obtained using the second approach despite the error propagation along with each interpolation involved vicente serrano et al 2007 conversely from a temporal point of view those previous monthly basis works are static due to the fact that the regression coefficients were obtained using a certain weather station percentage of the network and validated in the rest of them e g 80 mapping 20 validation but for the same period of time e g same 15 20 or whatever period of years it is not proven that this approach guarantees the adequacy of these regression equations for a new period i e for a new month of a new year not to mention for producing daily eto maps in relation to the generation of daily meteorological variable surfaces a special mention deserves the contribution of thornton et al 1997 they improved the mtclim logic model hungerford et al 1989 applying a truncated gaussian filter as an interpolation method and a weighted least square regression between pairs of stations as a correction for the effect of the elevation on the variables using this method important products like daymet dataset oak ridge national laboratory supported by nasa usa thornton et al 2021 1997 have been delivered daymet dataset provides long term continuous gridded estimates of daily weather and climatology variables on a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface over continental north america from 1980 but does not exist in other regions or in other resolutions using this same algorithm with a few modifications the r package meteoland de cáceres et al 2018 allows the spatial interpolation of daily weather records from meteorological stations in order to produce continuous surfaces in this case the user decides the spatial resolution by means of the resolution of the elevation surface or digital elevation model dem employed in the interpolation procedure in regions covered by awns specifically devoted to irrigation advice with weather api real time access to the data it is peremptory to investigate the development of a dynamic algorithm capable to obtain reliable eto maps on a daily basis and with an adequate spatial resolution to produce site specific irrigation recommendations and not just referred to the nearest weather station at the end of each day the api should serve a new map along with the regular daily meteorological records this study aims at contributing to an improved comprehension of eto mapping on a daily basis considering the geographical characteristics of the landscape our study was conducted in the jucar river system a mediterranean region of eastern spain where the intensive irrigated agriculture and a pronounced relief in certain areas provided an excellent context to address the following research questions rq rq1 are monthly interpolation procedures capable to produce proper eto maps on a daily basis using static equations coming from historical data rq2 do all the meteorological variables involved in the pm56 eto calculation have the same influence on the final eto value and is this influence constant throughout the year rq3 derived from the previous question does the lack of precision interpolating one meteorological variable have the same impact as another 2 material and methods 2 1 case study area the jucar river system jrs placed in the east of spain fig 1 the jucar river system jrs almost exactly matches the same name river basin according to the published information by the river authority confederación hidrográfica del júcar 2022 the basin is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate the annual average precipitation is about 500 mm ranging from 300 to 780 mm the rainfall regime combines intense rains in autumn october is the rainiest month with nearly 60 mm and spring with dry summers july is the driest month with nearly 13 mm the average temperature ranges from 11 c in winter to 26 6 c in summer the average eto for the period 1980 2018 was 992 7 mm the geographical area of the jrs is 2 226 093 ha of which 210 000 ha are irrigated to finish with citrus trees are the main crop occupying nearly 40 of the irrigated area being cereals vineyards fruit trees horticulture crops and olives the other 60 confederación hidrográfica del júcar 2022 2 2 meteorological data siar agricultural weather network irrigated areas of the jucar river system jrs are covered by the awn named siar agro climatic information system for irrigation www siar es siar was created in 1998 to promote water savings by means of proper irrigation recommendations and covering the main irrigable areas of spain with a total of 460 automated weather stations 63 of them located into or near the perimeter of the jrs as can be seen in fig 2 siar was promoted by the spanish ministry of agriculture fisheries and food mapa and is maintained and in some cases densified with additional stations by the different regional governments that is the case of the jrs whose weather stations are maintained by the valencian community and castile la mancha community regional governments in fig 3 can be seen a typical automated weather station equipped with a bucket rainfall sensor anemometer and wind direction located at 2 m normalized high from the ground temperature and humidity probes and pyranometer the station is completed with a data logger and a gsm communication module to transfer the data automatically several times a day meteorological records are registered every 30 min and then aggregated to hourly and daily data to be served through the api in the stations of the siar network preventive maintenance is carried out every six months performing a general review in the same way an annual calibration of the station sensors is done in a laboratory corrective maintenance of any anomaly detected in the station is carried out 2 3 modeling framework since the final purpose of this work was developing a dynamic eto mapping procedure to deliver site specific irrigation recommendations according to fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation was adopted to calculate the reference evapotranspiration eto 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa ºc 1 r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 día 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 día 1 u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa ºc 1 e s e a is the saturation vapour pressure deficit kpa and t m is the mean daily air temperature ºc in this work an interpolate then calculate approach was adopted thus a continuous grid cell map per meteorological variable involved in the pm56 eto had to be previously interpolated based on the daily records registered for the awn the spatial resolution of the grid cell maps for all cases was 100 m fig 4 describes the proposed modeling framework three different spatial interpolation procedures were applied and then compared using model performance metrics i meteoland r package ii monthly static regression based interpolation sri and iii daily dynamic regression based interpolation dri the three procedures are shortly described here with some detail hereafter in the next section i meteoland de cáceres et al 2018 r package implements with few modifications the daily weather interpolation algorithms developed by thornton et al 2021 1997 and thornton and running 1999 that underpin the daymet dataset https daymet ornl gov the interpolation procedure is based on a truncated gaussian filter and the correction of the meteorological variables for the elevation effect is solved using a weighted least square regression between stations and target points to be interpolated daily potential solar radiation is calculated after garnier and ohmura 1968 and the incident radiation after thornton and running 1999 further details about the algorithms and procedures can be seen in de cáceres et al 2018 and the r package documentation https cran r project org web packages meteoland index html meteoland was employed to interpolate 365 daily continuous surfaces year 2022 of the mean tm maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperature maximum hrmax and minimum hrmin relative humidity wind velocity u 2 and incident solar radiation rs using 49 training stations of siar network as defined in fig 2 results were validated using 14 validation stations of the siar network as well as illustrated in fig 2 finally applying layer algebra for each grid cell the pm56 eto map was obtained ii monthly static regression based interpolation sri is a regression based procedure calculated using exactly the same methodology after vicente serrano et al 2007 using a 15 year period 2007 2021 monthly multiple regression equations were obtained using those static monthly regression equations based on historical data 365 daily for the year 2022 continuous grid cell maps of tm tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u 2 were obtained an upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm was employed to obtain rs on a monthly basis finally applying layer algebra for each grid cell the pm56 eto map was derived the same procedure of validation as described in the meteoland procedure was employed explained in more detail in the next section iii daily dynamic regression based interpolation dri it turns out to be the very novelty proposal of this paper based on the sri procedure a new regression equation is obtained every day instead of using static regression equations obtained from historical data according to the atmospheric conditions of each day different geographical features are able to explain spatial variability 365 daily continuous grid cell maps for the year 2022 of tm tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u2 were obtained using this method an upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm was employed to get rs on a daily basis finally applying layer algebra for each grid cell the pm56 eto map was derived the same validation procedure described in the meteoland procedure was employed explained in more detail in the next section 2 4 monthly static sri and daily dynamic dri regression based interpolation procedures 2 4 1 maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity and wind speed interpolation procedure for this purpose the regression based technique of interpolation after vicente serrano et al 2007 and previously ninyerola et al 2000 was applied the value of the variable in the space among weather stations was calculated using the equation z x a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n where z x is the predicted value of the temperature humidity or wind speed ºc or m s 1 respectively a 0 to a n are the regression coefficients and x 1 to x n are the values of the independent variables geographical features at the spatial point x table 1 includes the geographical features acting as independent variables the linear relationship between them and the predicted temperature humidity wind speed was investigated using a multiple regression forward stepwise procedure only independent variables with p value 0 01 were included in the regression avoiding collinearity problems derived from using the complete set hair et al 2010 homoscedasticity using residual plots and no residual autocorrelation using the durbin watson parameter were checked as well after obtaining the geographical variables involved and the coefficients of the multiple regression equations a continuous map was obtained by simply combining the raster layers with the information of each geographic variable and applying the algebraic formula logically at the location of each weather station the value of the registered and modeled temperature humidity wind speed does not match residuals use to be interpolated over the entire study area and summed up to the predicted value using local techniques in this case the splines with tension method mitášová and mitáš 1993 was employed to do that this way registered and predicted values at the weather station locations employed to train the model training stations in fig 2 coincide and the validation in other locations improves substantially validation stations in fig 2 according to ninyerola et al 2000 and agnew and palutikof 2000 for sri monthly regression equations were obtained using a 15 year period of daily data 2007 2021 those static monthly regression equations based on historical data were obtained only once and then employed in the generation of new daily continuous grid cell maps of tm tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u 2 for the year 2022 nevertheless in dri based on the registered daily data along the awn a new regression equation was obtained specifically for each day only those geographical features with statical significance were included being the case as they might be different even for two contiguous days 2 4 2 radiation interpolation procedure solar radiation plays a key role in the et process due to the fact that is responsible of contributing the necessary energy to transform water from liquid to vapor state hence the spatial heterogeneity of the incoming solar energy produced by a complex topography elevation slope aspect and shadows creates strong local gradients that determine the dynamic of the et tovar pescador et al 2006 that cannot be ignored assuming a flat terrain for that reason several models and almost all gis platforms have developed algorithms for estimating solar radiation spatially adapted to the relief solarflux for arcinfo dubayah and rich 1995 solar analyst for arc view fu and rich 2000 srad wilson and gallant 2000 solei for idrisi miklánek 1993 miramon gis pons 2006 mtclim logic daymet thornton et al 2021 1997 thornton and running 1999 meteoland de cáceres et al 2018 or r sun for grass qgis hofierka et al 2002 are some examples of this some of the aforementioned models employ the upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm the viewshed algorithm is a virtualized version of hemispherical canopy photography kodysh et al 2013 three main results are obtained from them i global ii direct and iii diffuse radiation regardless of the version of the upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm employed two parameters control the algorithm i atmosphere transmissivity and ii diffuse radiation rate transmissivity is a property of the atmosphere and is the quotient between the radiation received at the top of the atmosphere and that reaching the earth s surface ranging from 0 no transmission to 1 complete transmission typically observed values are 0 6 0 7 for very clear sky conditions and 0 5 for a generally clear sky the percentage of global radiation that is diffused is approximately 0 2 for very clear sky conditions and 0 7 for very cloudy sky conditions arcgis help 2022 kodysh et al 2013 it should be noted that transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate depend on atmospheric conditions and are constantly changing not only cloud cover but also precipitation dust or aerosol presence attenuate the amount of diffuse and direct solar radiation for a given surface hence transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate are time space specific and they are constantly changing to consider this attribute consistent with a feasible computational effort the following method was applied for the 2022 year 365 different grid maps of potential radiation pr one for each doy were obtained using the upward looking hemispherical viewshed algorithm and assuming values of transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate for the very best clear sky conditions 0 6 and 0 2 respectively for each day we want to obtain a radiation map the ratio of the actual radiation rs registered for each weather station to doy specific pr at the weather station location was calculated these punctual rs pr ratio values were then spatially interpolated using the splines with tension method mitášová and mitáš 1993 obtaining an rs pr grid cell map then a daily rs grid cell map was derived by multiplying this rs pr ratio grid and the pr grid in this work solar analyst for arcgis environment was employed in order to obtain the 365 doy specific pr maps and v surf rst for grass environment to interpolate daily rs pr ratio values using the splines with tension method a monthly radiation average map was aggregated using the same method for the monthly basis calculations further details about those algorithms can be found in the aforementioned references and gis platform s user manuals 2 5 sensitivity analysis of pm56 eto to the meteorological variables in order to assess the sensitivity of the eto to the meteorological variable changes a sensitivity analysis was developed in this analysis all the meteorological variables except one were maintained constant on the average monthly values while the eto was calculated using the minimum and the maximum value of the range of each variable the difference between them δeto is expressed as a percentage of the eto for the average conditions this sensitivity analysis methodology has been widely employed in the literature for the very same purpose goyal 2004 irmak et al 2006 paturel et al 1995 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2006 2 6 maps validation and model performance the accuracy of the interpolated maps has to be assessed by comparing modeled vs actual registered data in other weather stations different from the one employed in the interpolation procedure for this purpose 20 of the awn stations 14 out 63 were randomly selected to be employed only for the validation tests as shown in fig 2 as explained before the rest of the stations 49 out 63 were employed exclusively in the interpolation procedures a number of statistical metrics can be found in the literature with the aim of assessing the ability of models to capture reality according to legates and mccabe 1999 a model performance assessment should include one or several absolute relative error measures and one or several goodness of ﬁt measures taking into account that the square of deviations e g root mean square error rmse use to be more sensitive to outliers than deviations p j o j in an absolute value sense e g mean absolute error mae or mean bias error mbe the statistical metrics included in table 2 were employed to assess the eto maps as regards the performance comparison between models two dimensionless indices were calculated i willmott index of agreement d willmott 1981 and ii nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse ranges between 1 and nse 1 means a perfect match between model outputs and observed values and nse 0 means that the average of the observations would be a better predictor than the model output regarding the wilmott index of agreement d has limits of 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement groenendijk et al 2014 the three evaluated models were graphically compared using a taylor diagram taylor 2001 the similarity between two patterns in the taylor diagram is quantified in terms of their correlation the amplitude of their variations standard deviations and their centered root mean square difference in the taylor diagram only one mark per model output is represented using the three dimensions the closer the model mark regarding the observed mark is the better the agreement was finally the impact of using the dri interpolated vs nearest weather station eto value on a daily irrigation recommendation was assessed and quantified as follows the area that is closest to each jrs weather station was obtained by creating the thiessen polygons fig 10 for each weather station on the other hand the centroid of each individual plot or farm was obtained and the dri eto value from the interpolated maps was assigned to it the total number of plots in the jrs was 263 413 the difference between the dri interpolated and the recorded in the nearest weather station eto value was computed for each plot and compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 interpolation procedures performance assessment the final purpose of this paper was to develop a dynamic method of mapping eto at the end of each day a programmed script could produce a new continuous surface of pm56 eto using the registered data of an awn however since the proposed method does not make a direct spatial interpolation of eto values but requires one interpolated surface of each meteorological variable involved in the pm56 eto equation not only the eto maps should be assessed in order to understand how the different methods worked out rs tmax tmin hrmax hrmin and u 2 maps in addition to reference evapotranspiration were compared the validation of the maps was developed by comparing the map value in those grid cells where 14 out 63 stations see fig 2 not included in the interpolation process were located to the actual values registered in those stations for each meteorological variable fig 5 a predicted vs observed scatter plot was generated including all the validation weather stations and all the daily observations of the year 2022 365 14 5110 a legend with the statistical metrics was also incorporated in the body of the scatter plot sri showed the worst performance in all statistical metrics and for all meteorological variables demonstrating that static regressions method based on historical data did not accurately capture the variability of daily eto in respect of the monthly averaged values they come from at the other end the best performance was encountered for the dri procedure dri and meteoland exhibited a similar performance for tmax and tmin and relatively close for rs however meteoland showed a poor performance in hrmin hrmax and u 2 this aspect was transmitted to the final eto results and was reflected on the metrics producing an r 2 of 0 95 vs 0 91 nse of 0 95 vs 0 91 and d of 0 99 vs 0 97 for dri and meteoland respectively a lesser error was also obtained according to the metrics for dri as well another way of comparing models performance is by means of the taylor diagram the similarity between patterns in this graphical method is quantified in terms of their correlation amplitude of their variations standard deviations and their centered root mean square difference each model is represented in the body of the plot using those three coordinates the closer a point in respect of the point representing the actual observed values is the better performance the model has similar results to the one obtained using the statistical metrics could be observed in this analysis the advantage of this graph over other performance evaluation methods is that it allows understanding at a glance how far one model is from the actual data and from the other models they are being compared in fig 6 can be seen the taylor diagrams of the eto and the different meteorological variables involved in the interpolation procedures fig 6 was plotted using plotrix r package lemon 2006 another additional aspect can be seen in this graph when two models exhibit similar values of correlation and error the standard deviation breaks the tie the standard deviation of the observed values is represented with a solid black line along the graph the closer the point is in respect to this line the better because this is a symptom of the similarity of probability distributions as can be seen in fig 6 sri showed the worst performance and dri the best one in those meteorological variables with similar behavior when dri and meteoland were compared always dri was closer to the standard deviation line as was mentioned in the last paragraph the shape of the distribution function between observed and modeled values is also important for this purpose in the fig 7 both a frequency histogram with its density function and overlapped violin plots were generated for observed dri sri and meteoland values of eto the violin plot adler et al 2022 is a symmetric representation of a box and whiskers plot a similar shape in those three plots guarantees a similar distribution of probability as can be seen in fig 7 dri was able to reproduce with greater similarity than the other methods the shape of the observed eto distribution 3 2 sensitivity analysis of pm56 eto in order to understand the behavior of the different interpolation procedures a sensitivity analysis of the pm56 eto to the different meteorological variables involved was developed for the year 2022 in the ab09 validation station see fig 2 this station was selected because it is located just in the center of the jrs first of all average values of tmax tmin hrmax hrmin rs and u 2 on a monthly basis were calculated and assigned to the 15th day of the month on the other hand each month s minimum and maximum absolute values of each variable were recorded indicating the range of this variable in this month results were exposed in table 3 in this table the first column on the left indicates the day of the year doy for each 15th day of each month following this in the first row 9 79 mj m2 d 1 is the monthly average value of rs for january and occupies the second column and finally 5 21 mj m2 d 1 and 12 81 mj m2 d 1 is the range of rs for the same month that can be seen in the third and fourth columns next columns are showing the same information for the rest of the meteorological variables to finish with the last column shows the daily average conditions pm56 eto mm d 1 obtained for this synthetic 2022 year with only one day per month emulating the same structure of table 3 results of the sensitivity analysis were summarized in table 4 in this analysis all the meteorological variables except one were maintained constant on the average monthly values exposed in table 3 then the eto was calculated using the minimum and the maximum value of the range of each variable and the difference between them δeto expressed as a percentage of the eto for the average conditions pointed out in table 4 thus for the first raw when rs adopted the minimum value in january eto was 1 03 mm d 1 third column exactly the same when rs adopted the maximum value fourth column being 0 the increment of the eto produced the next columns are showing the same information for the rest of the meteorological variables this sensitivity analysis methodology has been widely employed in the literature for the very same purpose goyal 2004 irmak et al 2006 paturel et al 1995 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2006 based on the results of table 4 table 5 summarize the effect of each meteorological variable on eto the first part of the table is referred to the ab09 weather station we used as an example and the second part is the result of averaging δeto for all the validation weather stations prior to calculating table 5 only significant differences were encountered in wind velocity u 2 according to this changes in rs has no effect on eto in winter a slightly effect in summer but a deep influence in spring summer and autumn tmax has a slightly effect in summer but a high influence in the rest of the year hrmin demonstrated capacity to modify eto in autumn and winter and finally u 2 showed a high or very high influence on eto although this depends on the wind exposure of the area the station ab09 showed a deep influence to wind in summer however the average of the validation weather station showed a low influence in summer tmin and hrmax had no influence at all to modify the eto fig 8 shows the complete eto values of the year 2022 for the validation station ab09 according to the table 5 and taking into account the good performance of both meteoland and dri for rs and tmax we can conclude that the meteorological variable responsible of the deviations between observed and modeled eto values fig 8 is the wind velocity new investigations have to be done in this field to improve the accuracy of this interpolation 3 3 daily dynamic dri vs monthly static sri regression based interpolation comparison of tmax tmin hrmax hrmin u 2 as was explained before sri and dri from a mathematical sight are the same interpolation procedure the sri procedure produces only once the regression equations from historical data one equation per meteorological variable and per month and they are utilized every day to generate new maps that is why we called this method static however in dri using exactly the same process a new regression equation is obtained every day according to the atmospheric conditions of each day different geographical features are able to explain spatial variability dri adapts to the synoptic pattern of that day using some geographical features or others as appropriate to explain the spatial variability for the year 2022 365 days x 6 meteorological variables 2190 regression equations were generated in order to illustrate how the procedure worked in table 6 we reproduced the regression equation coefficients of 7 consecutive days for tmax it is worth emphasizing how the geographical features involved are constantly changing from one day to another it can be checked that the behavior was always exactly like that for all the variables and all the days of the year and that is why we call this method dynamic this capacity of adaptation to the synoptic pattern is undoubtedly the best quality of that method and the cause of the good results 3 3 radiation rs interpolation procedure many efforts can be found in the literature addressing how to produce radiation maps dubayah and rich 1995 fu and rich 2000 wilson and gallant 2000 miklánek 1993 pons 2006 thornton et al 1997 2021 thornton and running 1999 de cáceres et al 2018 hofierka et al 2002 those algorithms solve precisely the amount of radiation that reaches at the top of the atmosphere one specific doy the effect of the relief in the actual amount that reaches the soil and when the real atmospheric parameters are known the effect of the atmosphere all the uncertainty of this method is related to those parameters transmissivity and diffuse radiation rate because they depend on the cloud cover precipitation dust or aerosols presence etc that use to be constantly changing in addition those parameters are not registered for the awn in this work to overcome this a simple but effective method was applied each doy a map of potential radiation was generated using the best clear conditions using a commercial software then using the registered data of radiation rs each day at each weather stations a rs pr ratio was obtained and spatially interpolated this way the real effect of the atmosphere in the radiation was spatially accounted for rs maps were compared to a contrasted method and a better performance was encountered again the proposed method can be called dynamic because using the registered data at the awn is able to adapt to the synoptic pattern 3 4 final dri pm56 eto maps in this study 365 maps of pm56 eto for the jrs were obtained to illustrate the final product the corresponding map to the 15th day of each month of the year 2022 were plotted and can be seen in fig 9 3 5 impact of using the dri interpolated vs nearest weather station eto value on a daily irrigation recommendation for this purpose the landscape of the jrs was divided into enclosures that belong to each weather station using the thiessen s polygon method as can be seen in fig 10 for the 15th day of each month of the year 2022 and for each thiessen polygon the eto registered in the weather station was compared to the dri interpolated eto value corresponding to each individual plot to do this the centroid of each individual plot or farm was obtained and the dri eto value from the interpolated maps was assigned to it and then compared to the one registered at the weather station table 7 summarizes that comparison due to the extension of that table only one month was included june after checking that results are representative of the rest of the year the dri eto range into each thiessen polygon was obtained was calculated by subtracting the maximum and the minimum values and expressed as absolute value mm and relative value respectively taking into account that crop water needs according to fao 56 methodology use to be calculated as etc eto x kc being etc the crop evapotranspiration and kc the crop coefficient and thus a linear combination of eto the very same deviation observed when the nearest weather station eto value is employed instead of the site specific interpolated value is expected to be transferred to the water needs the mean value of that difference for the entire jrs was 9 14 for the year 2022 employed as a demonstrative example throughout this entire work but with punctual values reaching more than 30 this reveals the necessity of using an interpolation method capable to adapt the synoptic pattern of each day producing site specific values of eto for each farm using the nearest weather station value of eto must be overcome 4 conclusions several targets were set prior to begin with this investigation however the germ was a purely practical objective to develop a dynamic method of mapping eto that could be used to produce site specific irrigation recommendations at the end of each day a programmed script could produce a new continuous surface of pm56 eto using the registered data of an awn however as the work progressed a second objective was gaining weight contributing to an improved comprehension of the eto mapping on a daily basis considering the geographical characteristics of the landscape our study was conducted in the jucar river system a mediterranean region of eastern spain where the intensive irrigated agriculture and a pronounced relief in certain areas provided an excellent context to address this problem on the one hand we had the necessity of generating eto maps and on the other a proper geographical context based on an existing statistical interpolation procedure developed to work on a monthly basis dri a new version adapted to work on a daily basis dri was developed with the only aim to know the quality of the results both existing and proposed algorithms were compared to a contrasted interpolation method meteoland using performance model assessment statistics demonstrated that the interpolation method originally planned to work monthly was unable to produce proper maps of any meteorological variable nor eto dri exhibited a similar performance than meteoland for tmax and tmin and a better performance in the rest of meteorological variables both models demonstrated a poor performance in u 2 on the other hand a very simple but effective method to interpolate rs was proposed and demonstrating a very good performance both dri and rs interpolation methods we called them dynamic methods because of their capacity of adapt to the synoptic pattern of each day being without any doubt the best quality of them and the cause of the good results besides dri was the only method that had the ability of reproducing the shape of the observed eto distribution deviations between observed and modeled eto values could be attributed to the low performance mapping the wind speed although the quality of the eto maps produced is very high new investigations have to be done in this field to improve the accuracy of the wind velocity interpolation this would be especially important in windy areas where the potential influence of u 2 on eto has been demonstrated could be very high the impact of using the nearest weather station eto vs dri interpolated value on a daily irrigation recommendation was investigated and near 10 average value of error was encountered for the whole jrs in the year 2022 declaration of competing interest

8842,there is information paucity on response of napier production to different irrigation water management strategies the study aimed at assessing the response of dry matter napier yields ton ha to different irrigation regimes a single factor experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design under drip irrigation with three treatments t1 full irrigation and two deficit treatments at 50 t2 and 25 t3 of full irrigation the control was rainfed t0 results indicated that t2 saved over 48 of irrigation water with minimal yield reductions 14 compared to t1 during peak dry season t2 water productivity was higher by 20 compared to t1 over 40 yield increase was observed in treatment t3 at peak dry season in comparison with t0 there was 132 average yield increase under t2 during the first

between the control full irrigation 50 and 25 deficit irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study was conducted at mbarara zonal agricultural research development institute mbazardi in the lake victoria basin mbarara district fig 1 which is also part of the cattle corridor in western uganda the study site was located close to a surface water source river rwizi the study involved three growth cycles which were conducted during the main growing period from august to november for 2021 first and from november to january for 2021 2022 second another experiment was conducted at the peak of the second growth cycle from february to april of 2022 third mbarara district lies within two agro ecological zones the pastoral system and the western banana coffee cattle system which are characterized with the semi arid conditions there are two rainy seasons that occur in march may and the other in august november with average annual rainfall estimated at 1373 mm the least and highest amounts of rainfall occur in january and april with the average precipitation of 33 mm and 183 mm respectively the temperatures are highest and lowest in february and august with 24 1 c and 21 6 c respectively two dry spells separate the rainy seasons the lengthy dry season extends from june to mid august and between january and february there is a short dry spell temperature in the district ranges from 15 c 25 c most of the year during the study period the experimental site had rainfall peaks in september and november while january had the lowest monthly precipitation at the site soil is predominated by ferrallitic soils which are mainly sandy loams with good drainage 0 04 slope at an altitude of 1395 m a s l with average sand clay and silt of 71 22 and 7 respectively average soil volumetric water content table 1 at field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp total available water taw and saturation sat was measured and found to be 22 29 13 76 8 53 and 45 05 respectively average saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and electrical conductivity ec were measured as 140 25 mm day and 51 98 µs cm respectively 2 2 experimental design and layout 2 2 1 experimental design sugar napier grass stem cuttings with two nodes were planted at a spacing of 50 50 cm by burying the bottom node underground and setting the top node above ground the single factor experiment under surface drip irrigation was arranged in a completely randomized design crd fig 2 with three treatments t1 full irrigation up to fc and two di treatments corresponding to 50 t2 and 25 t3 of irrigation depth refill to fc the control was under rainfed t0 each treatment was replicated five times and each replicate included 60 plants fig 2 shows experimental layout indicating allocation of treatments in different experimental units irrigation water was applied by button drip emitters with a design flow rate of 8 ℓ hr at operation pressure of 0 6 bar and application efficiency of 85 each plot was irrigated by one emitter per plant placed at lateral spacing of 50 cm and emitter spacing of 50 cm plasticized polyvinyl chloride pvc ball valves were installed on each sub main to control water delivery in the three treatments irrigation water was applied to different treatments by adjusting the irrigation duration corresponding to their irrigation levels based on soil laboratory analysis all experimental units were supplied with fertilizer 65 kgn ha and 40 kgp ha for each of the growth cycles so that plants would not be subjected to nutrient stress nitrogen was applied as urea at planting while phosphorus was applied as triple superphosphate tsp at 1 m plant height the experimental units were hand weeded manually by use of a hoe during each growth cycle 2 2 2 irrigation scheduling reference plots a k and t were used to schedule irrigations for t1 t2 and t3 respectively based on variations in soil water content swc fig 3a and b irrespective of napier growth stage based on swc variations in di reference plots k and t only a percentage of the soil water deficit corresponding to the irrigation level assigned was applied irrigation was scheduled such that available swc in the active root zone never exceeds field capacity and never goes below 50 of the total available water taw each reference plot had four profile probe access tubes for volumetric soil water content measurements θ at depths of 20 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 100 cm representative of 0 30 cm 31 60 cm 61 80 cm 81 100 cm depth ranges respectively using a ml3 thetaprobe soil moisture sensor connected to a hand held meter delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the probe was installed in between two plants on the same row through customized polyvinyl chloride pvc augured access tubes 50 mm diameter and daily measurements taken as three replicates per profile depth sensor s threaded base was connected to an optional 100 cm extension tube the access tubes were of sufficient depth to provide for detection of potential deep percolation measurements of swc were taken at the start of every growth cycle irrigation was initiated for all treatments whenever soil moisture in the reference plots was depleted by 50 the 50 depletion criterion used for scheduling of irrigation was constantly determined by monitoring the soil water status along the soil profile 1 m percentage depletion of available soil water in the effective root zone fig 4 was estimated as follows in eq 1 ntege et al 2021 1 d e p l e t i o n 100 1 n 1 n f c i θ i f c i w p where n is the number of horizons four of the effective rooting depth used in the soil moisture sampling fci is the soil moisture at field capacity for ith layer θi is the soil moisture in ith layer and wp is the soil moisture at permanent wilting point 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil data for in situ soil parameters physical characterization was done directly in the field and for laboratory analyses the following soil properties were considered including soil ph electrical conductivity soil texture proportions of sand cay and silt in addition core soil samples were taken from four horizons for analysis of important physical soil properties in relation to irrigation such as saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat field capacity saturation bulk density wilting point and plant available water all laboratory analyses were performed using the routine analytical procedures outlined by okalebo et al n d 2 3 2 rainfall data rainfall mm was the only weather parameter monitored daily at the study site by taking a record of the measuring cylinder graduated in mm inside the two 2 installed field rain gauges 2 3 3 crop development data crop development parameters like canopy cover plant height m and above ground biomass ton ha were measured for all the treatment replicates canopy cover cc ranges from zero at sowing to a maximum value at mid season which can be 1 when full canopy cover is reached and 100 soil surface cover during the expansion stage cc increases described by means of a canopy growth coefficient cgc at mid season maximum canopy cover ccx is constant whereas in the late season the cc decreases because of senescence this decrease is described by a canopy decline coefficient cdc steduto et al 2009 canopy cover was monitored from time of emergence to physiological maturity harvest measurements were obtained using a green canopy cover measurement tool canopeo developed by the soil physics research group http soilphysics okstate edu digital images were obtained from a vertical perspective approximately 1 5 m above the canopy using a stationary camera stand as described by lievens 2014 plant height was based on eight culms randomly selected from each plot from the ground level to the highest leaf using a meter rule 2 3 4 irrigation depth for every irrigation level drip conduits were joined together for the same application duration irrigation water was applied to different treatments by adjusting the irrigation duration corresponding to their irrigation levels the application rate of the emitters was 32 mm hr 2 3 5 crop water use crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated for the entire 1 m soil profile for the period between plant emergence to harvesting using the soil water balance eq 2 nakawuka et al 2014 parkash et al 2021 2 etc p i δsw d ro where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm dp is deep percolation mm below the root zone or capillary rise cr from a shallow water table ro is runoff mm δsw is the change in swc mm i e initial swc minus swc at harvest water was added to the soil reservoir by rainfall and irrigation deep percolation d was assumed as zero since the amount of irrigation was controlled it was hypothesized that there was no runoff ro produced by the drip irrigation system hence ro was zero for the analysis there were no shallow water tables in the study area hence capillary rise of water to the root zone was not of concern the access tubes in reference plots were of appropriate depth to provide for tracking of potential deep percolation soil water depletion mm for a given period was determined by subtracting swc at the end of a given period from swc at the start of that period 2 3 6 harvesting harvesting procedure of napier was similar to that previously described by buyinza et al 2015 and also corresponding to the required number of harvesting internodes 3 aboveground total fresh biomass was collected per plot and weighed total fresh biomass weight was recorded from each plot in the field using a 100 kg hanson type hanging weighing scale sample weight per plot was measured using an electronic compact scale ts200 2 3 7 napier dry matter yield laboratory analysis was done at mbazardi dry matter was analyzed according to procedures described by association of official analytical chemists aoac 1990 the collected fresh biomass samples were then taken to the laboratory and placed in a forced air oven gallenkamp sanyo omt oven model omt 225 xx2 c uk at 60 ºc for 72 hr in order to obtain the dm yield after every 24 hr the sample weight was recorded up to 72 hr napier yield was expressed in ton t of product per hectare ha dry matter dm yield was calculated using a recommended formula eq 2 by mutegi et al 2008 3 d r y m a t t e r y i e l d t o n h a t f w d w s s h a f w s s 10 where tfw

water consumed by a given species is highly linear steduto et al 2007 2 4 data analysis data was subjected to a normality test p 0 05 prior to performing further statistical analyses an analysis of variance anova was used to compare effects of irrigation water treatments p 0 05 on dm yield wp and iwp the treatment effects investigated were effects of the control no irrigation full irrigation and di on napier yield response wp and iwp comparisons of treatment means p 0 05 at each level of irrigation were done using duncan s multiple range test dmrt dry matter dm yields wp iwp and plant height in the first second and third growth cycles were compared using a student s t test p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using r software version 3 3 1 integrated development environment for r boston ma usa 3 results 3 1 rainfall distribution daily weather data on rainfall received during the three growing cycles is illustrated in table 2 and fig 5 during the first growth cycle from august to november rainfall was more frequent in october 14 65 dap although the highest 43 6 mm registered depth was in mid november 65 harvest period during the second growth cycle a similar peak of 43 4 mm was received in december 5 12 dap although rainfall was sporadic throughout the growth cycle and this was more pronounced in january typical of the start of a dry season during the third growth cycle from february to march peak rainfall amount 34 mm was lower in contrast with other growth cycles 3 2 soil moisture variations 3 2 1 first growth cycle the various irrigation levels applied per treatment were effective in providing variability in soil moisture conditions needed for this study as shown in fig 6 to fig 8 during the first growth cycle etc values were highest in t1 538 77 mm t2 488 66 mm and least in t3 464 51 mm there was an increase in the amount of stored soil water at harvest compared with the initial amount 5 14 dap period as shown in fig 6 soil water depletion was consistently highest in t3 followed by t2 and least in t1 thus most of the water extraction by napier occurred in the deficit treatments for the period 14 65 dap there was total soil water depletion of 0 95 mm along the soil profile in t1 3 2 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle stored soil water amount increased for the period 5 42 dap and decreased towards harvest period implying an increase in soil water depletion at harvest compared to the initial amount as shown in fig 7 soil water depletion was consistently highest in t3 followed by t2 and least in t1 thus most of the water extraction by napier occurred in the deficit treatments 3 2 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle etc values were highest in t1 781 33 mm t2 572 06 mm and least in t3 479 12 mm there was a decrease in the amount of stored soil water at harvest compared with the initial amount as shown in fig 8 soil water depletion was consistently highest in t3 followed by t2 and least in t1 thus most of the water extraction by napier occurred in the deficit treatments 3 3 canopy cover development 3 3 1 first growth cycle during the first growth cycle mean canopy cover cc ranged from zero at sowing to a maximum value of 74 94 98 and 88 at mid season for the control t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 9 canopy development in the irrigated treatments emerged fast days 6 7 after planting as compared to the rainfed days 9 11 after planting for the first growth cycle time period of 5 14 dap represents initial stage 14 65 represents development stage and 65 to harvest represents late stage 3 3 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle mean cc at harvesting reached 70 93 95 and 84 for the control t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 10 initial cc development for the irrigated was achieved 4 5 days after planting while for rainfed they were registered 7 8 days after planting during the second growth cycle time period of 5 12 dap represents initial stage 12 42 represents development stage and 42 to harvest represents late stage 3 3 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle mean cc at harvesting reached 77 95 97 44 and 92 for the control t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 11 initial cc development for the irrigated was achieved 4 5 days after planting while for rainfed they were registered 7 8 days after planting during the second growth cycle time period of 5 12 dap represents initial stage 12 42 represents development stage and 42 to harvest represents late stage 3 4 plant height 3 4 1 first growth cycle plant height varied with different irrigation depth across treatments mean height of treatments at harvest time was 278 263 2 237 and 186 6 cm for t1 t2 t3 and control implying that the irrigated treatments were substantially different from the rainfed for the first growth cycles as shown in fig 12 3 4 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle mean height of treatments at harvest time was 178 172 164 and 158 cm for t1 t2 t3 and control respectively fig 13 student t test results exhibits that mean height of treatments at first growth cycle harvest time were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the second growth cycle 3 4 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle mean height of treatments at harvest time was 188 5 183 5 174 67 and 164 5 cm for t1 t2 t3 and control respectively fig 14 student t test results exhibits that mean height of treatments at first growth cycle harvest time were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the first growth cycle but not significantly different p 0 05 from the second growth cycle 3 5 napier dry matter yields 3 5 1 first growth cycle the highest 40 53 ton ha and lowest 12 20 ton ha mean dm yields were observed in t1 and t0 respectively data were checked and it tends to normality p 0 05 according to shapiro wilk normality test significant differences p 0 05 were observed in dm yields among treatments comparison of treatment means table 3 indicates that t1 was significantly different p 0 05 in dm yields from t3 and t0 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in dm yields between t2 and t3 but significantly different from the control whilst the differences were not significant among some treatments yield results showed that napier grass was responsive to irrigation water applied there was no significant difference in napier wp between irrigated treatments t1 t2 and t3 however as compared to applied water in t1 nearly 6 06 of water was saved by irrigating t2 under this cycle 50 of applied irrigation water achieved water savings of nearly 20 and dm yield deficit of 11 ton ha compared to t1 3 5 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle the highest 31 46 ton ha and lowest 12 89 ton ha mean dm yields were observed in t1 and t0 respectively in table 4 data were checked and it tends to normality p 0 05 according to shapiro wilk normality test significant differences p 0 05 in dm yields were observed among treatments comparison of treatment means indicates that significant differences p 0 05 were observed among irrigation treatments t1 and t2 from t3 and t0 in equivalence with t0 there was 113 and 45 yield increase under t2 and t3 respectively in comparison with the control there was 144 and 113 yield increase under treatments t1 and t2 respectively wp was not significantly different p 0 05 among irrigated treatments however numerically t2 was higher than t1 and t3 implying that crops in t2 produced the highest dm yields for each unit of water used the student s t test results between the first and second growth cycles indicated that dm yields for the control t3 and t2 were not significantly different p 0 05 however dm yields for t1 in the first growth cycle were significantly different p 0 05 from those during the second growth cycle the etc values during the second growth cycle were lower in contrast with the first growth cycle a comparison between t2 and t1 indicates water savings of nearly 40 with dm yield deficit of 3 97 ton ha and improved 1 32 wp advantage 3 5 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle which coincided with the peak of the dry season the highest 30 36 ton ha and lowest 11 09 ton ha mean dm yields were observed in t1 and t0 respectively in table 5 data were checked and it tends to normality p 0 05 according to shapiro wilk normality test significant differences p 0 05 in dm yields were observed among treatments comparison of treatment means indicates that significant differences p 0 05 were observed among irrigation treatments it was observed that dm yields in t1 were not significantly different p 0 05 from yields in t2 however they were significantly different p 0 05 from yields in t3 and t0 it was also observed that dm yields in t3 were significantly different p 0 05 from yields in t0 in equivalence with t0 there was 141 and 41 48 yield increase under t2 and t3 respectively napier wp in t2 was significantly different p 0 05 from t1 and t3 the student s t test results between the third and preceding growth cycles indicated that dm yields for the control t3 and t2 were not significantly different p 0 05 however dm yields for t1 in the first growth cycle were significantly different p 0 05 from those during the third growth cycle di was able to stabilize napier dm yields at an average yield of 28 ton ha without compromising production with 50 of applied irrigation water at the peak of a dry season water savings of over 48 were achieved with minimal yield reductions 3 62 ton ha 14 and improved wp compared with t1 4 discussion for all the treatments during the study period etc values were consistently higher than applied irrigation depth implying water extraction by napier along the soil profile to meet crop water requirements in a study on forage sorghum pearl millet and corn bhattarai et al 2020 observed that et values were higher in most irrigated treatments compared to deficit treatments the consistent increase in soil water depletion in deficit treatments parkash et al 2021 implied that applied irrigation water was insufficient to meet crop water requirements thus crops fully utilized stored soil water to compensate for the deficit during the first growth cycle rainfall was received during the 14 65 dap period thus increasing stored soil water towards the harvest time compared to the initial amount 5 14 dap this enlightens the significant difference p 0 05 in dm yields between t1 and t0 for the period 14 65 dap during the first growth cycle there was total soil water depletion of 0 95 mm along the soil profile suggesting that the applied irrigation water was able to meet crop water needs for t1 significant difference p 0 05 in mean napier dm yields during the first growth cycle between t2 and t3 was attributed to the high variability within treatment replicates which was triggered by a substantial rainfall amount 271 6 mm availed during the period of plant development and mid growth stages considerable amount of rainfall enhances adequate available soil moisture at the root zones rushton et al 2006 de silva and rushton 2007 it also justifies the highest mean dm yields across all treatments for the first growing cycle in contrast with the second and third growth cycles similarly a study on brachiaria brizantha cultivars in brazil thaiana rueda da silva et al 2020 observed that aboveground dry biomass was highest at the first cutting period in comparison with other subsequent periods the difference was also attributed to an already established root system by napier during the first growth cycle the dm yields under full irrigation were comparable to previously reported yields by hidosa and kibiret 2020 in a range of 34 06 51 56 ton ha under irrigation in south omo ethiopia significant difference p 0 05 in mean dm yields between the first and second growth cycles were attributed to the amount of stored soil water to meet crop water requirements during 5 12 dap compounded with the peak rainfall during the same period during the second growth cycle a decrease in the amount of stored soil water at harvest compared with the initial amount explains the significant difference p 0 05 in dm yields between t2 and t3 similar to singh et al 2015 s observations the highest wp coincided with the second growth cycle for hybrid napier pennisetum purpureum x p americanum under semi arid indian region significant differences p 0 05 observed between t3 and t0 treatment were ascribable to water deficit which reduces plant productivity and is the major cause of decreased yield the lower values of etc during the second growth cycle were attributed to increase in stored soil water amount for the period 5 42 dap a similar observation on a study of cucumber by parkash et al 2021 in texas indicated that due to increase in stored soil water amount at harvest et was lower it was also attributed to an already established root system in the second growth cycle and high genetic potential of the napier variety to adapt adverse weather conditions correspondingly a study by rogers et al 2017 on perennial forage in australia observed that deeper root system allows them to access stored soil water from greater depths and in greater amounts getiso and mijena 2021 also supports our findings on a study conducted on napier grass penisetum purpuruem l schumach accessions in ethiopia that efficient water uptake corresponds with a developed root system during the third growth cycle significant differences p 0 05 in mean dm yields between t3 and t0 were attributed to reduced rainfall amounts which led to a decrease in stored soil water and gave a rise in soil water depletion to meet the crop water requirements napier wp in t2 was significantly different p 0 05 from t1 and t3 implying that crops in t2 produced the highest dm yields for each unit of water used this suggests that deficit irrigation is an efficient irrigation water management strategy as also reported by tian et al 2017 in alleviating adverse effects of unfavorable rainfall patterns which stabilizes and improves crop yields geerts and raes 2009 mean dm yield under control obtained from this study for all growth cycles was higher by 42 than previously reported values by mamaru b 2018 in the range of 1 4 7 t ha for ten elephant grass varieties under rainfed conditions however they were similar to yields reported by gemiyo et al 2017 in the range of 11 95 13 86 ton ha in southern ethiopia irrigated treatments had mean dm yields similar to those reported by and sinche et al 2021 in florida at 26 9 ton ha water savings of over 48 at the peak of the dry season with minimal yield reductions were similar to those reported in a study on peach trees by mirás avalos et al 2016 from 43 to 65 under different di strategies on comparison with t0 there was 140 113 and 144 yield increase under t2 during the first second and third growth cycles respectively therefore maximizing napier production with reduced water is critical in addressing the fodder gap and minimizing movement of animals in search of pasture hence increased livestock productivity maleko et al 2018 creemers and aranguiz 2019 5 conclusion dry matter yield results indicate that napier was responsive to different irrigation water management strategies during the third growth cycle which coincided with the peak of the dry season water savings of over 48 was achieved with minimal yield reductions in contrast with the control there was an increase of mean dm yields by an average of 132 in all the growth cycles such yield increases imply that deficit irrigation is an efficient irrigation water management strategy in a tropical setting therefore the study recommends adoption of deficit irrigation at 50 by farmers and extension workers as a contribution to sustainable intensification and minimizing napier yield gaps especially at the peak dry season

8842,there is information paucity on response of napier production to different irrigation water management strategies the study aimed at assessing the response of dry matter napier yields ton ha to different irrigation regimes a single factor experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design under drip irrigation with three treatments t1 full irrigation and two deficit treatments at 50 t2 and 25 t3 of full irrigation the control was rainfed t0 results indicated that t2 saved over 48 of irrigation water with minimal yield reductions 14 compared to t1 during peak dry season t2 water productivity was higher by 20 compared to t1 over 40 yield increase was observed in treatment t3 at peak dry season in comparison with t0 there was 132 average yield increase under t2 during the first second and third growth cycles thus irrigation at 50 total available water is critical in addressing the fodder gap and contributes to minimizing livestock movement in search of pasture hence

increase by more than 25 to 9 9 billion people by the year 2050 united nations un 2019 agriculture is expected to meet the proliferating food and agro pastoral demands food and agriculture organization fao 2019 from limited land and water resources concurrently the global water deficit in the agricultural sector is expected to increase by 29 9 by 2050 mainly affecting developing countries due to climate change huang et al 2021 according to un 2017 the efficient usage of water for food production is among the priority actions to discuss in the global agenda to mitigate the water crisis for most of the crops mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the contribution of green water footprint toward the total consumptive water footprint green and blue is more than 80 therefore up scaling

water resources against climate related risks and shocks food and agriculture organization fao 2020 fodder production under agro pastoral based system is not any exceptional in these global water concerns neal et al 2011 tian et al 2017 henceforth improvements to irrigation management perry et al 2009 rogers et al 2017 purbajanti et al 2012 like deficit irrigation di nakawuka et al 2014 are proposed as techniques of increasing agricultural production and reducing the demand for water napier grass pennisetum purpureum schumach also well known as elephant grass is the most important tropical perennial c4 grass native to sub saharan africa ssa and an underutilized source of biomass mohammed et al 2018 norsuwan et al 2014 singh et al 2013 napier like other forage crops has a lengthy period of yield formation throughout its growth cycle from emergence to harvesting which has a significant effect on its crop water requirements over its growth cycle napier expands its canopy cover and deepens its root system transpiring water and amassing biomass while progressing through its phenological stages some of its desirable characteristics comprise of high yields per unit harvestable area sarker et al 2021 high water use efficiency mwendia et al 2017 and adaptability to sporadic drought and a wide range of soil and agro ecologies conditions kabirizi et al 2015 rengsirikul et al 2013 making it a forage of priority although napier withstands minor dry spells it well adopts to altitudes of up to 2100 m a s l negawo et al 2017 and it establishes best in areas where the average annual precipitation is above 750 mm napier grass is known for a high dry matter dm yield potential up to 78 tons ha yr maria et al 2014 muktar et al 2022 however yield potential reduces annually by 20 under water availability constraints ntege et al 2021 marais et al 2002 noted that subtropical pastures are being used extensively to fulfil the fodder needs of the animals under intensive farming system and a large percentage are under irrigation due to their high production frequent unpredictable and prolonged droughts have caused seasonality of napier production farmers are often faced with having yield reductions and failure to meet agro pastoral demands in terms of quantity and quality creemers and aranguiz 2019 to avoid risks of yield penalty irrigation has been integrated into napier production to provide the highest productivity jha et al 2016 singh et al 2015 however there is an information meager on response of napier production to different irrigation water management strategies epule et al 2018 ntege et al 2021 previous studies have focused on variety improvement nutrient uptake type of irrigation system and agronomical practices

between the control full irrigation 50 and 25 deficit irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study was conducted at mbarara zonal agricultural research development institute mbazardi in the lake victoria basin mbarara district fig 1 which is also part of the cattle corridor in western uganda the study site was located close to a surface water source river rwizi the study involved three growth cycles which were conducted during the main growing period from august to november for 2021 first and from november to january for 2021 2022 second another experiment was conducted at the peak of the second growth cycle from february to april of 2022 third mbarara district lies within two agro ecological zones the pastoral system and the western banana coffee cattle system which are characterized with the semi arid conditions there are two rainy seasons that occur in march may and the other in august november with average annual rainfall estimated at 1373 mm the least and highest amounts of rainfall occur in january and april with the average precipitation of 33 mm and 183 mm respectively the temperatures are highest and lowest in february and august with 24 1 c and 21 6 c respectively two dry spells separate the rainy seasons the lengthy dry season extends from june to mid august and between january and february there is a short dry spell temperature in the district ranges from 15 c 25 c most of the year during the study period the experimental site had rainfall peaks in september and november while january had the lowest monthly precipitation at the site soil is predominated by ferrallitic soils which are mainly sandy loams with good drainage 0 04 slope at an altitude of 1395 m a s l with average sand clay and silt of 71 22 and 7 respectively average soil volumetric water content table 1 at field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp total available water taw and saturation sat was measured and found to be 22 29 13 76 8 53 and 45 05 respectively average saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and electrical conductivity ec were measured as 140 25 mm day and 51 98 µs cm respectively 2 2 experimental design and layout 2 2 1 experimental design sugar napier grass stem cuttings with two nodes were planted at a spacing of 50 50 cm by burying the bottom node underground and setting the top node above ground the single factor experiment under surface drip irrigation was arranged in a completely randomized design crd fig 2 with three treatments t1 full irrigation up to fc and two di treatments corresponding to 50 t2 and 25 t3 of irrigation depth refill to fc the control was under rainfed t0 each treatment was replicated five times and each replicate included 60 plants fig 2 shows experimental layout indicating allocation of treatments in different experimental units irrigation water was applied by button drip emitters with a design flow rate of 8 ℓ hr at operation pressure of 0 6 bar and application efficiency of 85 each plot was irrigated by one emitter per plant placed at lateral spacing of 50 cm and emitter spacing of 50 cm plasticized polyvinyl chloride pvc ball valves were installed on each sub main to control water delivery in the three treatments irrigation water was applied to different treatments by adjusting the irrigation duration corresponding to their irrigation levels based on soil laboratory analysis all experimental units were supplied with fertilizer 65 kgn ha and 40 kgp ha for each of the growth cycles so that plants would not be subjected to nutrient stress nitrogen was applied as urea at planting while phosphorus was applied as triple superphosphate tsp at 1 m plant height the experimental units were hand weeded manually by use of a hoe during each growth cycle 2 2 2 irrigation scheduling reference plots a k and t were used to schedule irrigations for t1 t2 and t3 respectively based on variations in soil water content swc fig 3a and b irrespective of napier growth stage based on swc variations in di reference plots k and t only a percentage of the soil water deficit corresponding to the irrigation level assigned was applied irrigation was scheduled such that available swc in the active root zone never exceeds field capacity and never goes below 50 of the total available water taw each reference plot had four profile probe access tubes for volumetric soil water content measurements θ at depths of 20 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 100 cm representative of 0 30 cm 31 60 cm 61 80 cm 81 100 cm depth ranges respectively using a ml3 thetaprobe soil moisture sensor connected to a hand held meter delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the probe was installed in between two plants on the same row through customized polyvinyl chloride pvc augured access tubes 50 mm diameter and daily measurements taken as three replicates per profile depth sensor s threaded base was connected to an optional 100 cm extension tube the access tubes were of sufficient depth to provide for detection of potential deep percolation measurements of swc were taken at the start of every growth cycle irrigation was initiated for all treatments whenever soil moisture in the reference plots was depleted by 50 the 50 depletion criterion used for scheduling of irrigation was constantly determined by monitoring the soil water status along the soil profile 1 m percentage depletion of available soil water in the effective root zone fig 4 was estimated as follows in eq 1 ntege et al 2021 1 d e p l e t i o n 100 1 n 1 n f c i θ i f c i w p where n is the number of horizons four of the effective rooting depth used in the soil moisture sampling fci is the soil moisture at field capacity for ith layer θi is the soil moisture in ith layer and wp is the soil moisture at permanent wilting point 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil data for in situ soil parameters physical characterization was done directly in the field and for laboratory analyses the following soil properties were considered including soil ph electrical conductivity soil texture proportions of sand cay and silt in addition core soil samples were taken from four horizons for analysis of important physical soil properties in relation to irrigation such as saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat field capacity saturation bulk density wilting point and plant available water all laboratory analyses were performed using the routine analytical procedures outlined by okalebo et al n d 2 3 2 rainfall data rainfall mm was the only weather parameter monitored daily at the study site by taking a record of the measuring cylinder graduated in mm inside the two 2 installed field rain gauges 2 3 3 crop development data crop development parameters like canopy cover plant height m and above ground biomass ton ha were measured for all the treatment replicates canopy cover cc ranges from zero at sowing to a maximum value at mid season which can be 1 when full canopy cover is reached and 100 soil surface cover during the expansion stage cc increases described by means of a canopy growth coefficient cgc at mid season maximum canopy cover ccx is constant whereas in the late season the cc decreases because of senescence this decrease is described by a canopy decline coefficient cdc steduto et al 2009 canopy cover was monitored from time of emergence to physiological maturity harvest measurements were obtained using a green canopy cover measurement tool canopeo developed by the soil physics research group http soilphysics okstate edu digital images were obtained from a vertical perspective approximately 1 5 m above the canopy using a stationary camera stand as described by lievens 2014 plant height was based on eight culms randomly selected from each plot from the ground level to the highest leaf using a meter rule 2 3 4 irrigation depth for every irrigation level drip conduits were joined together for the same application duration irrigation water was applied to different treatments by adjusting the irrigation duration corresponding to their irrigation levels the application rate of the emitters was 32 mm hr 2 3 5 crop water use crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated for the entire 1 m soil profile for the period between plant emergence to harvesting using the soil water balance eq 2 nakawuka et al 2014 parkash et al 2021 2 etc p i δsw d ro where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm dp is deep percolation mm below the root zone or capillary rise cr from a shallow water table ro is runoff mm δsw is the change in swc mm i e initial swc minus swc at harvest water was added to the soil reservoir by rainfall and irrigation deep percolation d was assumed as zero since the amount of irrigation was controlled it was hypothesized that there was no runoff ro produced by the drip irrigation system hence ro was zero for the analysis there were no shallow water tables in the study area hence capillary rise of water to the root zone was not of concern the access tubes in reference plots were of appropriate depth to provide for tracking of potential deep percolation soil water depletion mm for a given period was determined by subtracting swc at the end of a given period from swc at the start of that period 2 3 6 harvesting harvesting procedure of napier was similar to that previously described by buyinza et al 2015 and also corresponding to the required number of harvesting internodes 3 aboveground total fresh biomass was collected per plot and weighed total fresh biomass weight was recorded from each plot in the field using a 100 kg hanson type hanging weighing scale sample weight per plot was measured using an electronic compact scale ts200 2 3 7 napier dry matter yield laboratory analysis was done at mbazardi dry matter was analyzed according to procedures described by association of official analytical chemists aoac 1990 the collected fresh biomass samples were then taken to the laboratory and placed in a forced air oven gallenkamp sanyo omt oven model omt 225 xx2 c uk at 60 ºc for 72 hr in order to obtain the dm yield after every 24 hr the sample weight was recorded up to 72 hr napier yield was expressed in ton

variance anova was used to compare effects of irrigation water treatments p 0 05 on dm yield wp and iwp the treatment effects investigated were effects of the control no irrigation full irrigation and di on napier yield response wp and iwp comparisons of treatment means p 0 05 at each level of irrigation were done using duncan s multiple range test dmrt dry matter dm yields wp iwp and plant height in the first second and third growth cycles were compared using a student s t test p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using r software version 3 3 1 integrated development environment for r boston ma usa 3 results 3 1 rainfall distribution daily weather data on rainfall received during the three growing cycles is illustrated in table 2 and fig 5 during the first growth cycle from august to november rainfall was more frequent in october 14 65 dap although the highest 43 6 mm registered depth was in mid november 65 harvest period during the second growth cycle a similar peak of 43 4 mm was received in december 5 12 dap although rainfall was sporadic throughout the growth cycle and this was more pronounced in january typical of the start of a dry season during the third growth cycle from february to march peak rainfall amount 34 mm was lower in contrast with other growth cycles 3 2 soil moisture variations 3 2 1 first growth cycle the various irrigation levels applied per treatment were effective in providing variability in soil moisture conditions needed for this study as shown in fig 6 to fig 8 during the first growth cycle etc values were highest in t1 538 77 mm t2 488 66 mm and least in t3 464 51 mm there was an increase in the amount of stored soil water at harvest compared with the initial amount 5 14 dap period as shown in fig 6 soil water depletion was consistently highest in t3 followed by t2 and least in t1 thus most of the water extraction by napier occurred in the deficit treatments for the period 14 65 dap there was total soil water depletion of 0 95 mm along the soil profile in t1 3 2 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle stored soil water amount increased for the period 5 42 dap and decreased towards harvest period implying an increase in soil water depletion at harvest compared to the initial amount as shown in fig 7 soil water depletion was consistently highest in t3 followed by t2 and least in t1 thus most of the water extraction by napier occurred in the deficit treatments 3 2 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle etc values were highest in t1 781 33 mm t2 572 06 mm and least in t3 479 12 mm there was a decrease in the amount of stored soil water at harvest compared with the initial amount as shown in fig 8 soil water depletion was consistently highest in t3 followed by t2 and least in t1 thus most of the water extraction by napier occurred in the deficit treatments 3 3 canopy cover development 3 3 1 first growth cycle during the first growth cycle mean canopy cover cc ranged from zero at sowing to a maximum value of 74 94 98 and 88 at mid season for the control t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 9 canopy development in the irrigated treatments emerged fast days 6 7 after planting as compared to the rainfed days 9 11 after planting for the first growth cycle time period of 5 14 dap represents initial stage 14 65 represents development stage and 65 to harvest represents late stage 3 3 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle mean cc at harvesting reached 70 93 95 and 84 for the control t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 10 initial cc development for the irrigated was achieved 4 5 days after planting while for rainfed they were registered 7 8 days after planting during the second growth cycle time period of 5 12 dap represents initial stage 12 42 represents development stage and 42 to harvest represents late stage 3 3 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle mean cc at harvesting reached 77 95 97 44 and 92 for the control t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 11 initial cc development for the irrigated was achieved 4 5 days after planting while for rainfed they were registered 7 8 days after planting during the second growth cycle time period of 5 12 dap represents initial stage 12 42 represents development stage and 42 to harvest represents late stage 3 4 plant height 3 4 1 first growth cycle plant height varied with different irrigation depth across treatments mean height of treatments at harvest time was 278 263 2 237 and 186 6 cm for t1 t2 t3 and control implying that the irrigated treatments were substantially different from the rainfed for the first growth cycles as shown in fig 12 3 4 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle mean height of treatments at harvest time was 178 172 164 and 158 cm for t1 t2 t3 and control respectively fig 13 student t test results exhibits that mean height of treatments at first growth cycle harvest time were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the second growth cycle 3 4 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle mean height of treatments at harvest time was 188 5 183 5 174 67 and 164 5 cm for t1 t2 t3 and control respectively fig 14 student t test results exhibits that mean height of treatments at first growth cycle harvest time were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the first growth cycle but not significantly different p 0 05 from the second growth cycle 3 5 napier dry matter yields 3 5 1 first growth cycle the highest 40 53 ton ha and lowest 12 20 ton ha mean dm yields were observed in t1 and t0 respectively data were checked and it tends to normality p 0 05 according to shapiro wilk normality test significant differences p 0 05 were observed in dm yields among treatments comparison of treatment means table 3 indicates that t1 was significantly different p 0 05 in dm yields from t3 and t0 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in dm yields between t2 and t3 but significantly different from the control whilst the differences were not significant among some treatments yield results showed that napier grass was responsive to irrigation water applied there was no significant difference in napier wp between irrigated treatments t1 t2 and t3 however as compared to applied water in t1 nearly 6 06 of water was saved by irrigating t2 under this cycle 50 of applied irrigation water achieved water savings of nearly 20 and dm yield deficit of 11 ton ha compared to t1 3 5 2 second growth cycle during the second growth cycle the highest 31 46 ton ha and lowest 12 89 ton ha mean dm yields were observed in t1 and t0 respectively in table 4 data were checked and it tends to normality p 0 05 according to shapiro wilk normality test significant differences p 0 05 in dm yields were observed among treatments comparison of treatment means indicates that significant differences p 0 05 were observed among irrigation treatments t1 and t2 from t3 and t0 in equivalence with t0 there was 113 and 45 yield increase under t2 and t3 respectively in comparison with the control there was 144 and 113 yield increase under treatments t1 and t2 respectively wp was not significantly different p 0 05 among irrigated treatments however numerically t2 was higher than t1 and t3 implying that crops in t2 produced the highest dm yields for each unit of water used the student s t test results between the first and second growth cycles indicated that dm yields for the control t3 and t2 were not significantly different p 0 05 however dm yields for t1 in the first growth cycle were significantly different p 0 05 from those during the second growth cycle the etc values during the second growth cycle were lower in contrast with the first growth cycle a comparison between t2 and t1 indicates water savings of nearly 40 with dm yield deficit of 3 97 ton ha and improved 1 32 wp advantage 3 5 3 third growth cycle during the third growth cycle which coincided with the peak of the dry season the highest 30 36 ton ha and lowest 11 09 ton ha mean dm yields were observed in t1 and t0 respectively in table 5 data were checked and it tends to normality p 0 05 according to shapiro wilk normality test significant differences p 0 05 in dm yields were observed among treatments comparison of treatment means indicates that significant differences p 0 05 were observed among irrigation treatments it was observed that dm yields in t1 were not significantly different p 0 05 from yields in t2 however they were significantly different p 0 05 from yields in t3 and t0 it was also observed that dm yields in t3 were significantly different p 0 05 from yields in t0 in equivalence with t0 there was 141 and 41 48 yield increase under t2 and t3 respectively napier wp in t2 was significantly different p 0 05 from t1 and t3 the student s t test results between the third and preceding growth cycles indicated that dm yields for the control t3 and t2 were not significantly different p 0 05 however dm yields for t1 in the first growth cycle were significantly different p 0 05 from those during the third growth cycle di was able to stabilize napier dm yields at an average yield of 28 ton ha without compromising production with 50 of applied irrigation water at the peak of a dry season water savings of over 48 were achieved with minimal yield reductions 3 62 ton ha 14 and improved wp compared with t1 4 discussion for all the treatments during the study period etc values were consistently higher than applied irrigation depth implying water extraction by napier along the soil profile to meet crop water requirements in a study on forage sorghum pearl millet and corn bhattarai et al 2020 observed that et values were higher in most irrigated treatments compared to deficit treatments the consistent increase in soil water depletion in deficit treatments parkash et al 2021 implied that applied irrigation water was insufficient to meet crop water requirements thus crops fully utilized stored soil water to compensate for the deficit during the first growth cycle rainfall was received during the 14 65 dap period thus increasing stored soil water towards the harvest time compared to the initial amount 5 14 dap this enlightens the significant difference p 0 05 in dm yields between t1 and t0 for the period 14 65 dap during the first growth cycle there was total soil water depletion of 0 95 mm along the soil profile suggesting that the applied irrigation water was able to meet crop water needs for t1 significant difference p 0 05 in mean napier dm yields during the first growth cycle between t2 and t3 was attributed to the high variability within treatment replicates which was triggered by a substantial rainfall amount 271 6 mm availed during the period of plant development and mid growth stages considerable amount of rainfall enhances adequate available soil moisture at the root zones rushton et al 2006 de silva and rushton 2007 it also justifies the highest mean dm yields across all treatments for the first growing cycle in contrast with the second and third growth cycles similarly a study on brachiaria brizantha cultivars in brazil thaiana rueda da silva et al 2020 observed that aboveground dry biomass was highest at the first cutting period in comparison with other subsequent periods the difference was also attributed to an already established root system by napier during the first growth cycle the dm yields under full irrigation were comparable to previously reported yields by hidosa and kibiret 2020 in a range of 34 06 51 56 ton ha under irrigation in south omo ethiopia significant difference p 0 05 in mean dm yields between the first and second growth cycles were attributed to the amount of stored soil water to meet crop water requirements during 5 12 dap compounded with the peak rainfall during the same period during the second growth cycle a decrease in the amount of stored soil water at harvest compared with the initial amount explains the significant difference p 0 05 in dm yields between t2 and t3 similar to singh et al 2015 s observations the highest wp coincided with the second growth cycle for hybrid napier pennisetum purpureum x p americanum under semi arid indian region significant differences p 0 05 observed between t3 and t0 treatment were ascribable to water deficit which reduces plant productivity and is the major cause of decreased yield the lower values of etc during the second growth cycle were attributed to increase in stored soil water amount for the period 5 42 dap a similar observation on a study of cucumber by parkash et al 2021 in texas indicated that due to increase in stored soil water amount at harvest et was lower it was also attributed to an already established root system in the second growth cycle and high genetic potential of the napier variety to adapt adverse weather conditions correspondingly a study by rogers et al 2017 on perennial forage in australia observed that deeper root system allows them to access stored soil water from greater depths and in greater amounts getiso and mijena 2021 also supports our findings on a study conducted on napier grass penisetum purpuruem l schumach accessions in ethiopia that efficient water uptake corresponds with a developed root system during the third growth cycle significant differences p 0 05 in mean dm yields between t3 and t0 were attributed to reduced rainfall amounts which led to a decrease in stored soil water and gave a rise in soil water depletion to meet the crop water requirements napier wp in t2 was significantly different p 0 05 from t1 and t3 implying that crops in t2 produced the highest dm yields for each unit of water used this suggests that deficit irrigation is an efficient irrigation water management strategy as also reported by tian et al 2017 in alleviating adverse effects of unfavorable rainfall patterns which stabilizes and improves crop yields geerts and raes 2009 mean dm yield under control obtained from this study for all growth cycles was higher by 42 than previously reported values by mamaru b 2018 in the range of 1 4 7 t ha for ten elephant grass varieties under rainfed conditions however they were similar to yields reported by gemiyo et al 2017 in the range of 11 95 13 86 ton ha in southern ethiopia irrigated treatments had mean dm yields similar to those reported by and sinche et al 2021 in florida at 26 9 ton ha water savings of over 48 at the peak of the dry season with minimal yield reductions were similar to those reported in a study on peach trees by mirás avalos et al 2016 from 43 to 65 under different di strategies on comparison with t0 there was 140 113 and 144 yield increase under t2 during the first second and third growth cycles respectively therefore maximizing napier production with reduced water is critical in addressing the fodder gap and minimizing movement of animals in search of pasture hence increased livestock productivity maleko et al 2018 creemers and aranguiz 2019 5 conclusion dry matter yield results indicate that napier was responsive to different irrigation water management strategies during the third growth cycle which coincided with the peak of the dry season water savings of over 48 was achieved with minimal yield reductions in contrast with the control there was an increase of mean dm yields by an average of 132 in all the growth cycles such yield increases imply that deficit irrigation is an efficient irrigation water management strategy in a tropical setting therefore the study recommends adoption of deficit irrigation at 50 by farmers and extension workers as a contribution to sustainable intensification and minimizing napier yield gaps especially at the peak dry season

8843,substantial storage reductions by irrigation pumping in many of the world s major aquifers jeopardize future food production as a result new conservation measures are being utilized to reduce pumping and extend aquifer lifespans the key question is how effective are these practices in attaining true water conservation i e water use reduction for a given area relationships between pumping and precipitation help provide an answer as precipitation explains most of the variation in annual irrigation water use for aquifers in semi arid to sub humid climates when surface water supplies are limited our objective is to utilize correlations between radar precipitation and irrigation groundwater use at a range of spatial scales to assess the effectiveness of conservation approaches in the high plains aquifer in the central usa linear regressions between pumping and precipitation for a conservation area established in 2013 in northwest kansas indicate that water use and water use per irrigated area were over 27 less and 25 less respectively during 2013 2021 compared to the same climatic conditions during 2005 2012 similar regressions found over a 38 reduction and 23 reduction in irrigation water use and use per irrigated area respectively during 2018 2021 compared to the same conditions during 2005 2017 in a west central kansas county with conservation areas a decrease in irrigated area accounted for most of the difference between these reductions higher r2 values after conservation area establishment imply that irrigation tracks precipitation better due to use of soil moisture sensors and other measures as part of increased irrigation efficiency and enhanced water management the precipitation and water use relationships which are statistically significant for a

and sub humid portions of the state of kansas whittemore et al 2016 precipitation coverages such as radar precipitation and prism http prism oregonstate edu also yield good correlations with water use for a range of spatial scales whittemore et al 2021 we use precipitation for correlations in this work because it explains a high degree of the variability in irrigation water use and does not require additional data and calculations thus the correlations can be readily applied by state and local agencies over a range of spatial scales for groundwater management we used radar rather than prism precipitation data because it can be more accurate at smaller scales as explained in the methods section reliable measurements of annual pumping are required for correlations with precipitation although water level measurements are often available over aquifer areas in the us and elsewhere accurate water use data are not foster et al 2020 water use is typically estimated with a variety of approaches such as energy use for groundwater pumping and evapotranspiration estimates from remotely sensed images of cropland however considerable uncertainty can be introduced into analyses based on those pumping estimates kansas is an outlier in this regard as it has some of the best water use data for aquifers in the us usda 2019 and likely the world these data along with high quality precipitation records available online provide the basis for the precipitation and water use correlations discussed in this paper we use radar precipitation because of its ease in scaling and spatial detail allowing application from large regions down to areas as small as irrigated fields surrounding an individual well butler et al 2015 whittemore et al 2021 the objective of this paper is to demonstrate a simple approach for assessing the effectiveness of water conservation efforts based on precipitation and water use correlations that could be used in other areas with sufficient data for its application 1 1 study area and aquifer regulation the hpa is one of the world s largest aquifers and covers parts of eight states in the great plains region of the us fig 1 the aquifer primarily provides water for irrigation with much smaller amounts for drinking stock and industrial water supplies it is the most heavily pumped aquifer in the us accounting for nearly 15 of the nation s annual groundwater use lovelace et al 2020 however pumping from much of the hpa greatly exceeds inflows which has caused large water level declines in many areas mcguire and strauch 2022 the current withdrawal rates cannot be sustained and will be further exacerbated by projected climate change e g rosenberg et al 1999 2003 brunsell et al 2010 logan et al 2010 ou et al 2018 irrigation pumping which made up almost 95 of total withdrawals in 2015 lovelace et al 2020 is the main driver of water level changes in the hpa irrigation water primarily supplements precipitation for fall harvested row crops thus pumpage is concentrated during the summer growing season the kansas hpa which is the focus of this work can be divided into two regions whittemore et al 2018 the ogallala region of the aquifer covers much of the western third of kansas fig 1 where three groundwater management districts gmds are located gmds 1 3 and 4 the climate is semi arid with mean annual precipitation in the range 330 620 mm the depth to water is generally substantial 10 m to 100 m and most rivers and stream courses are ephemeral those that did flow in the past are now usually dry due to substantial water level declines in the aquifers that originally supplied them with water zipper et al 2021 the thickness of the aquifer in the ogallala region has substantially decreased in the last seven decades as shown in fig 1 fig 2 displays the thickness change starting with the mean for 2004 2006 and then for each individual year to 2021 for the three gmds in the ogallala region of western kansas based on the water level surface for wells with continuous annual winter measurements and the bedrock surface generated from well logs the absolute thickness decline for gmd1 2 6 m during the period resulted in a decline of 20 4 the thickness drop for gmd4 2 1 m was smaller than for gmd1 and resulted in a decline of 8 9 although the absolute thickness decrease for gmd3 8 6 m was substantially greater than for the other two gmds it amounted to a drop 16 1 that was less than that for gmd1 the absolute aquifer thicknesses remaining in 2021 for gmds 1 3 and 4 were 10 1 m 44 9 m and 21 1 m respectively no surface water is used based on water right permits in gmds 1 and 4 and average surface water use comprised 2 1 of total groundwater and surface water water use in gmd3 during 2005 2021 irrigation groundwater use was 95 1 93 7 and 97 6 of total use in gmds 1 3 and 4 respectively in 2005 2021 division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture kda dwr the quaternary region of the aquifer in south central kansas fig 1 has a sub humid climate with mean annual precipitation in the range 620 880 mm the depth to water is generally shallow 20 m and rivers and streams still flow in most of the region providing active stream aquifer interaction two gmds 2 and 5 cover the quaternary region although the aquifer thickness has decreased appreciably in some areas the thickness has not changed significantly in most of the region but fluctuates depending on extended wet and dry periods whittemore et al 2018 the absolute thicknesses remaining in 2021 in gmds 2 and 5 were 28 6 m and 33 1 m respectively which were greater than for gmds 1 and 4 the thickness decreases during 2005 2021 were very small for gmd2 0 3 m 1 0 and gmd5 0 08 m 0 2 surface water use was 1 1 and 2 7 of total water use in gmds 2 and 5 respectively in 2005 2021 irrigation groundwater use comprised 65 2 and 96 0 of total use in gmds 2 and 5 respectively during 2005 2021 kda dwr substantial data exist for water use across the hpa in kansas the reported water use data and their accuracy over the hpa in kansas are estimated to be the best for any large aquifer in the us based on the high percentage of wells with totalizing flowmeters now 98 and the supporting regulatory framework butler et al 2016 usda 2019 kansas has used water right permits based on the prior appropriation system for water use since 1945 the filing of annual water use reports for these permits became mandatory in 1988 peck 1995 the kda dwr which receives the water use reports began a program of reviewing the reports for accuracy in 1990 annual water use reports for all permitted wells are available since then stiff penalties exist for failure to provide accurate data including tampering with flowmeters kda dwr 2021 this dataset provides an excellent basis for examining precipitation as the meteorological driver of irrigation pumping irrigation efficiency has substantially increased in recent decades but this has not often led to true water conservation because pumping was not reduced either due to irrigating more water needy crops or expanding the irrigated area ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 sears et al 2018 in response to continued declines in the water table in the ogallala region of the kansas hpa the two gmds for which the estimated usable lifetime of the aquifer is the shortest gmds 1 and 4 buchanan et al 2023 began to implement water conservation measures using new management frameworks established by the kansas legislature butler et al 2018 griggs 2021 the first was the local enhanced management area lema program established in 2012 to facilitate pumping reductions a lema is initiated by stakeholders who propose a plan for pumping reductions the plan is approved by the gmd in which the lema is located and then accepted or rejected by the chief engineer of the kda dwr after hearings a lema includes regulatory oversight to ensure that all irrigators in the area follow the agreed upon reductions a later legislative initiative established the water conservation area wca program which allows any water right owner or group of owners to develop a management plan to reduce pumping a wca is typically smaller than a lema independent of a gmd and only needs the approval of the chief engineer the first lema the sheridan 6 sd 6 lema started in 2013 in a 255 km2 area in gmd4 in northwest kansas fig 1 the goal was to reduce the average annual groundwater use by 20 in 2018 a district wide lema was initiated in gmd4 with a more modest reduction goal that varied among townships area of a township is 93 km2 a series of wcas were established in wichita county in gmd1 crosshatched in fig 1 starting in 2017 followed by a county wide lema in 2021 the formation of a four county lema in gmd1 is currently in the hearing process of the kda dwr the effectiveness of these lemas and wcas will be assessed in the following sections 2 methods the methods involved selection and retrieval of precipitation and irrigation water use data including irrigated acreage for determining the correlations of radar precipitation with water use and water use per irrigated area estimating the relative importance of water savings from improved water efficiency compared to those from decreases in irrigated area and assessment of linear regressions of precipitation versus water use by statistical models we used monthly values of multi sensor precipitation observations primarily radar data that are available for download from the advanced hydrologic prediction service ahps of the national weather service nws http water weather gov precip for the us these data have been served online since 2005 for the conterminous us puerto rico and alaska in spatial images and digital coverages precipitation data are based on hourly estimates from wsr 88d nexrad that are compared to and then corrected for ground rainfall gauge reports where radar coverage is not available or limited precipitation estimates incorporate satellite observations the radar data are available at a spatial resolution of 4 4 km gridded values for 2005 2016 raster format thereafter thereby capturing the spatial variability in precipitation that can occur between precipitation gauges prism precipitation data could also be used for the correlations however a comparison to radar data found that prism values are typically less than those of radar precipitation for areas within the kansas hpa regardless of their size see supplemental material the region overlying the kansas hpa has short but intense spring through fall thunderstorms that can have areas of influence smaller than the distance between many of the prism precipitation stations thus the radar precipitation dataset may better capture the precipitation distribution across the region total irrigation groundwater use and irrigated area data were acquired from the kda dwr through the online water information management and analysis system wimas available on the kansas geological survey website https geohydro kgs ku edu geohydro wimas water use and water use per irrigated area were plotted against radar precipitation and linear regressions and confidence intervals for the lines at the 95 confidence interval were determined for the plots the typical irrigation season over the kansas hpa starts from mid march to the beginning of may and ends during late august to mid september based on water level hydrographs from a network of monitoring wells butler et al 2021b however precipitation in january and february can also affect water use dry conditions during these months can result in irrigators pumping water in march and april to build up soil moisture before planting row crops substantial rain and snow during january and february that provides ample soil moisture obviates the need for the pre planting irrigation although the primary crops are corn soybeans and sorghum grown during the main irrigation season march september winter wheat and hay such as alfalfa may be irrigated in january and february during especially dry periods thus the sum of january through september precipitation was considered the most appropriate quantity for use in correlations with groundwater pumping different sums of contiguous monthly precipitation within the main irrigation season of march september were also examined for water use reductions to compare with those based on january september precipitation as a means of evaluating uncertainty in the reduction values this is discussed in the supplemental material reductions in irrigation water use have two main components that produced by more effective water use strategies and that resulting from decreases in irrigated area the first component is evaluated by plotting irrigation water use per irrigated area versus precipitation the second component is obtained by plotting total irrigation water use versus precipitation the relative contribution of each can be determined by subtracting the reduction computed from the first plot from that for the second other factors besides precipitation and irrigation efficiency can affect annual water use from year to year most notably changes in irrigated area and crop types although the mixture of crop types has not changed substantially during the last two decades rogers and aguilar 2017 irrigated area has generally decreased in gmds 1 and 3 increased in gmds 2 and 4 and remained approximately constant in gmd5 based on data from wimas the correlations were performed with both annual irrigation water use and annual irrigation water use divided by the irrigated area for each year i e depth of applied water to remove the effect of changing irrigated area the emphasis in this paper is on the correlations for water use per irrigated area because of the uncertainty in whether water use reductions due to decreases in irrigated area were associated with conservation measures or due to the abandonment of irrigation as a result of insufficient aquifer thickness correlations of total irrigation groundwater use with precipitation are also included for comparison we illustrate the impacts of conservation primarily through graphical comparison of the water use per area or total versus precipitation regressions for the pre conservation and conservation periods in sd 6 wichita county and gmd1 to support the conclusions drawn from these comparisons we have used f tests draper and smith 1981 to assess the improvement in fit of two alternative models one with separate intercepts but a common slope for the two periods the parallel slopes model and one with separate intercepts and slopes the full model over a model in which all the data are fit with a single line the reference model we take the significance of this improvement as the indication of the impact of conservation measures the details of this procedure are given in the supplemental material 3 results and discussion water use and precipitation relationships were first examined for the areas in the kansas hpa in which groundwater conservation measures have been implemented the sd 6 lema was the earliest established management area and had the largest reduction goal the plot of irrigation pumping per unit area versus precipitation for the pre lema 2005 2012 and lema 2013 2021 periods demonstrates that true water conservation has been achieved fig 3 the reduction in water use as indicated by the offset in the two regression lines at the mean precipitation during january september for 2005 2021 is 25 0 the average irrigated area decreased after the lema started based on irrigator reports wimas data and satellite information deines et al 2019 the additional water savings from the smaller irrigated area is 2 4 based on the correlation of annual irrigation groundwater use with january september precipitation giving a reduction in the total irrigation groundwater use of 27 4 fig 4 although some of the scatter in the points for the pre lema period could be produced by uncertainty in the water use reporting flowmeter performance has been more closely checked after establishment of the lema much of the scatter is likely related to irrigators not tracking soil moisture conditions as well as during the lema for example simple measures such as cutting off pumps when it starts to rain which were not always done in the past have been important l letourneau water appropriations program manager kda dwr personal communication deines et al 2019 found that farmers attained most of their pumping reductions from increases in irrigation efficiency while generally maintaining irrigated area consistent with our correlation results soil moisture sensors allowed the irrigators to adjust water applications and track the precipitation variation closely as evidenced by precipitation explaining 90 of the variation in water use during the lema the water conservation measures implemented in the sd 6 lema have slowed water level declines in the aquifer compared to pre lema declines especially after adjustment for changes in annual climatic conditions butler et al 2023 as described in the supplemental material formal statistical testing confirms that there is a significant difference between the water use per area versus precipitation regressions for the pre lema and lema periods the f test assessing the significance of the improvement in fit of the parallel slopes model over the reference model yields a p value of 1 2 10 5 and that comparing the full model which produces regression lines equivalent to those in fig 3 to the reference model yields a p value of 9 9 10 5 table s4 a smaller p value indicates a more significant difference in fit for total water use the corresponding f tests yield p values 4 1 10 6 and 3 3 10 5 table s5 confirming a significant reduction in total water use as well in both cases the full model fails to provide a significant improvement over the parallel slopes model meaning the conservation impacts can be characterized as a constant reduction in use per area or total use with no significant change in slope the intercept difference estimates from the parallel slopes models indicate reductions of 8 0 cm in use per area and 8 7 106 m3 in total use a series of wcas were established in wichita county in gmd1 starting in march 2017 although the bulk of the enrolled area was after the 2017 irrigation season a lema was then approved for wichita county in february 2021 the plot of pumping per irrigated area versus precipitation for january september demonstrates that true water conservation has again been achieved fig 5 in this case the reduction in water use as indicated by the offset in the two regression lines is 23 4 at the mean precipitation during 2005 2021 the irrigated area also decreased during the study period the additional water savings from the smaller irrigated area is 15 1 based on the correlation of irrigation groundwater use with january september precipitation giving a total groundwater use reduction of 38 5 fig 6 for use per area in wichita county the f tests comparing the parallel slopes and full models to the reference model yield p values of 4 5 10 6 and 4 0 10 5 respectively table s4 and the corresponding tests for total use yield p values of 3 4 10 6 and 1 6 10 5 table s5 again confirming that conservation measures have had significant impact as in sd 6 the full models fail to yield significant improvements over the parallel slopes models again indicating approximately constant reduction across the range of precipitation values the reductions indicated by the parallel slopes models are 5 7 cm in use per area and 24 0 106 m3 in total use gmd4 established a district wide lema in 2018 but legal challenges to the lema were not resolved until the fall of 2019 these legal challenges possibly delayed the participation of some irrigators as the plot of pumping versus precipitation reveals that little water conservation was achieved in the first four years of the lema fig 7 in addition the annual maximum rates of irrigation applications allowed during the initial 5 year lema period were greater than the actual mean irrigation water use per unit area during 2005 2021 thus only those irrigators with particularly high application rates were required to reduce their rate several wcas have been established in two counties in gmd4 but their total area is not yet large enough to significantly affect water consumption those wcas with individual sizes exceeding 400 ha were developed during 2018 2022 gmd4 includes parts or all of ten counties in northwest kansas some of these counties show a separation between 2005 2017 and 2018 2021 plots of water use per irrigated area versus precipitation however a series of hailstorms during the late spring and early summer of 2018 destroyed crops in local areas across gmd4 resulting in some cessation of pumping additional years of data will be needed to determine if the apparent reductions in water use per irrigated area are statistically significant in the individual counties there is no district wide lema for gmd1 but the district has proposed that one be established in four of the five counties in the gmd despite that there is a separation between the 2005 2017 and 2018 2020 regression lines for gmd1 fig 8 this separation is mainly produced by the wichita county wcas fig 5 as well as the two counties to the east and the county to the west which have apparently adopted some conservation measures during this period the conservation measures appear to start in 2018 wcas started partway through 2017 and are likely partly driven by the relatively small thickness of the hpa in those areas which has forced some irrigators to reduce their water use the estimated reduction in the district wide water use per irrigated area for 2018 2021 for the same climatic condition during 2005 2017 is 10 1 based on fig 8 the water use reduction based on a correlation of irrigation water use versus january september precipitation is 24 1 fig 9 the additional 14 0 is undoubtedly due to the decrease in irrigated area in the district for gmd1 the f tests comparing the parallel slopes and full models to the reference model for use per area yield p values of 8 0 10 4 and 4 1 10 3 respectively table s4 still significant but less so than for sd 6 or wichita county for total water use the corresponding f tests yield p values of 1 1 10 5 and 8 5 10 6 table s5 reflecting the greater percentage reduction in total water use compared to use per area in this case the full model for use per area still fails to yield a significant improvement over the parallel slopes model but that for total use yields a marginally significant improvement with a p value of 0 03 and thus significant at the 5 level the reductions indicated by the parallel slopes models are 2 6 cm in use per area and 46 3 106 m3 in total use there are no lemas in the other three gmds 2 3 and 5 and wcas represent a small proportion of the total area in each of these districts as a result water conservation efforts do not yet appear to have had a substantial impact the plot of water use per unit area versus radar precipitation for gmd3 which is also in the ogallala region of the hpa where large water level declines occur shows no statistically significant indication of water conservation fig 10 the plots for gmds 2 and 5 are similar figs 11 and 12 plots of water use versus climatic indices for 1996 2012 also show no indication of water conservation in these districts whittemore et al 2016 although individual producers have adopted water conservation measures in gmd3 and points for the years 2019 2021 for gmd3 plot below the regression line in fig 10 their impact on district wide conditions for irrigation application rate is too small to show a statistically significant separation from prior conditions based on data for 2005 2021 however points for these three years fall appreciably below the lower confidence interval boundary in a graph of irrigation water use versus precipitation for gmd3 fig 13 indicating a general decrease in irrigated area in gmd3 since 2018 the water use and precipitation relationships are also useful for comparing irrigation rates among different areas for similar climatic conditions irrigation rates have ranged widely for the different gmds counties and the sd 6 lema in the ogallala region of the hpa as indicated by the relative positions of the regression lines for the radar precipitation and irrigation water use per irrigated area correlations in fig 14 gmd3 has had the largest application rate fig 10 and gmd1 the smallest fig 8 of the three western gmds the order of the irrigation rates is the same as the remaining aquifer thickness gmd3 has the greatest and gmd1 the least the relatively small aquifer thickness in gmd1 at predevelopment has decreased substantially as indicated in fig 1 especially in wichita county including a decrease of over 20 from 2005 to 2021 fig 2 this has compelled irrigators in gmd1 to reduce pumping to maintain sufficient aquifer thickness for irrigation even without a district wide lema the significant change in reduction occurred starting around 2018 the water use application reduction during the sd 6 lema 2013 2021 brought the regression line down from above the rate for gmd4 to close to that for wichita county and gmd1 during 2005 2017 but still higher than that for gmd1 during 2018 2021 fig 14 the irrigation water use per area in wichita county during 2005 2017 was already less than that for gmd1 during 2005 2017 the addition of a substantial number of wcas then caused a significant reduction from 2017 to 2018 the application rate during 2018 2021 is the lowest of any areas discussed in this paper therefore although lemas and wcas can lead to sizable water use reductions diminishing aquifer thickness particularly in areas where that thickness was already small can also lead to sizable reductions some areas of gmd3 have seen relatively large decreases in aquifer thickness leading to the establishment of a number of wcas but the involved area is too small relative to the size of the large district to produce a discernable change in the overall water use rate 4 conclusions the correlation of radar precipitation and water use in heavily irrigated areas of the hpa in kansas is highly statistically significant for a wide range of scales from groundwater management districts several thousand to over 20 000 km2 in area to sub county areas of a few hundred km2 although not discussed here similar results have been found for areas as small as a few km2 around individual wells butler et al 2021b the coefficients of determination range from about 0 7 to over 0 9 indicating that precipitation is the main driver of variations in water use the radar precipitation and water use relationship has allowed the impact of new approaches to groundwater management in the kansas hpa to be assessed we have shown that water use for a 255 km2 local enhanced management area lema has decreased over 27 in comparison to the pre lema use recently established water conservation areas wcas have produced reductions of over 23 relative to the pre wca use based on application rate alone and even more if some of the decrease in irrigated area is related to conservation measures we have also found that these recent water use reductions are now becoming apparent on a considerably larger scale than those of the lema and wcas this could be a product of emulation of the practices used in the conservation areas or simply the result of the aquifer thickness getting to a point that previous pumping rates cannot be maintained and fewer acres are irrigated the reduction in this case has been as large as 24 for gmd1 the implemented water conservation measures that are producing significant water savings are also slowing water level declines in the aquifer e g butler et al 2023 the reductions in water use identified here have two components the reduction produced by more effective water use strategies appears to be responsible for more than 40 to over 90 of the observed decreases in water use these strategies can be implemented either by more efficient irrigation of the same crops using soil moisture sensors and other measures or by irrigating less water needy and more drought tolerant crops the other component is the reduction produced by decreases in irrigated area the first component can be evaluated by plotting irrigation water use per irrigated area versus precipitation insight into the magnitude of the second component can be obtained by plotting total irrigation water use versus precipitation and subtracting the reduction computed from the first plot from that for the second this approach could also be used in assessing where an increase in irrigation efficiency leads to an increase in overall water use due to increases in irrigated area as an example of jevons paradox dumont et al 2013 sears et al 2018 linear regressions of water use versus precipitation allow prediction of future water use for climatic conditions in which only mean precipitation changes more importantly however these relationships should allow the impact of climate change to be identified if as climate change models forecast temperatures continue to rise and the frequency and length of arid conditions increases resulting in more soil water stress a shift in the linear regression for an area will occur even without substantial changes in management practices these relationships are dependent on high quality precipitation and groundwater use data high quality precipitation data are often available but reliable groundwater use data are not as we have stressed repeatedly in earlier publications e g butler et al 2018 2023 greater attention needs to be placed on the monitoring of groundwater use we have previously demonstrated that monitoring of a subset of the pumping wells in an aquifer can be a cost effective strategy that yields reliable data on groundwater use bohling et al 2021 when high quality pumping data are available we have shown here that radar precipitation and water use relationships can provide insights of great practical value

8843,substantial storage reductions by irrigation pumping in many of the world s major aquifers jeopardize future food production as a result new conservation measures are being utilized to reduce pumping and extend aquifer lifespans the key question is how effective are these practices in attaining true water conservation i e water use reduction for a given area relationships between pumping and precipitation help provide an answer as precipitation explains most of the variation in annual irrigation water use for aquifers in semi arid to sub humid climates when surface water supplies are limited our objective is to utilize correlations between radar precipitation and irrigation groundwater use at a range of spatial scales to assess the effectiveness of conservation approaches in the high plains aquifer in the central usa linear regressions between pumping and precipitation for a conservation area established in 2013 in northwest kansas indicate that water use and water use per irrigated area were over 27 less and 25 less respectively during 2013 2021 compared to the same climatic conditions during 2005 2012 similar regressions found over a 38 reduction and 23 reduction in irrigation water use and use per irrigated area respectively during 2018 2021 compared to the same conditions during 2005 2017 in a west central kansas county with conservation areas a decrease in irrigated area accounted for most of the difference between these reductions higher r2 values after conservation area establishment imply that irrigation tracks precipitation better due to use of soil moisture sensors and other measures as part of increased irrigation efficiency and enhanced water management the precipitation and water use relationships which are statistically significant for a

climatic indices and annual water use can be valuable tools for assessing the response of the high plains aquifer hpa in the central united states us to various climatic conditions in the semi arid and sub humid portions of the state of kansas whittemore et al 2016 precipitation coverages such as radar precipitation and prism http prism oregonstate edu also yield good correlations with water use for a range of spatial scales whittemore et al 2021 we use precipitation for correlations in this work because it explains a high degree of the variability in irrigation water use and does not require additional data and calculations thus the correlations can be readily applied by state and local agencies over a range of spatial scales for groundwater management we used radar rather than prism precipitation data because it can be more accurate at smaller scales as explained in the methods section reliable measurements of annual pumping are required for correlations with precipitation although water level measurements are often available over aquifer areas in the us and elsewhere accurate water use data are not foster et al 2020 water use is typically estimated with a variety of approaches such as energy use for groundwater pumping and evapotranspiration estimates from remotely sensed images of cropland however considerable uncertainty can be introduced into analyses based on those pumping estimates kansas is an outlier in this regard as it has some of the best water use data for aquifers in the us usda 2019 and likely the world these data along with high quality precipitation records available online provide the basis for the precipitation and water use correlations discussed in this paper we use radar precipitation because of its ease in scaling and spatial detail allowing application from large regions down to areas as small as irrigated fields surrounding an individual well butler et al 2015 whittemore et al 2021 the objective of this paper is to

which made up almost 95 of total withdrawals in 2015 lovelace et al 2020 is the main driver of water level changes in the hpa irrigation water primarily supplements precipitation for fall harvested row crops thus pumpage is concentrated during the summer growing season the kansas hpa which is the focus of this work can be divided into two regions whittemore et al 2018 the ogallala region of the aquifer covers much of the western third of kansas fig 1 where three groundwater management districts gmds are located gmds 1 3 and 4 the climate is semi arid with mean annual precipitation in the range 330 620 mm the depth to water is generally substantial 10 m to 100 m and most rivers and stream courses are ephemeral those that did flow in the past are now usually dry due to substantial water level declines in the aquifers that originally supplied them with water zipper et al 2021 the thickness of the aquifer in the ogallala region has substantially decreased in the last seven decades as shown in fig 1 fig 2 displays the thickness change starting with the mean for 2004 2006 and then for each individual year to 2021 for the three gmds in the ogallala region of western kansas based on the water level surface for wells with continuous annual winter measurements and the bedrock surface generated from well logs the absolute thickness decline for gmd1 2 6 m during the period resulted in a decline of 20 4 the thickness drop for gmd4 2 1 m was smaller than for gmd1 and resulted in a decline of 8 9 although the absolute thickness decrease for gmd3 8 6 m was substantially greater than for the other two gmds it amounted to a drop 16 1 that was less than that for gmd1 the absolute aquifer thicknesses remaining in 2021 for gmds 1 3 and 4 were 10 1 m 44 9 m and 21 1 m respectively no surface water is used based on water right permits in gmds 1 and 4 and average surface water use comprised 2 1 of total groundwater and surface water water use in gmd3 during 2005 2021 irrigation groundwater use was 95 1 93 7 and 97 6 of total use in gmds 1 3 and 4 respectively in 2005 2021 division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture kda dwr the quaternary region of the aquifer in south central kansas fig 1 has a sub humid climate with mean annual precipitation in the range 620 880 mm the depth to water is generally shallow 20 m and rivers and streams still flow in most of the region providing active stream aquifer interaction two gmds 2 and 5 cover the quaternary region although the aquifer thickness has decreased appreciably in some areas the thickness has not changed significantly in most of the region but fluctuates depending on extended wet and dry periods whittemore et al 2018 the absolute thicknesses remaining in 2021 in gmds 2 and 5 were 28 6 m and 33 1 m respectively which were greater than for gmds 1 and 4 the thickness decreases during 2005 2021 were very small for gmd2 0 3 m 1 0 and gmd5 0 08 m 0 2 surface water use was 1 1 and 2 7 of total water use in gmds 2 and 5 respectively in 2005 2021 irrigation groundwater use comprised 65 2 and 96 0 of total use in gmds 2 and 5 respectively during 2005 2021 kda dwr substantial data exist for water use across the hpa in kansas the reported water use data and their accuracy over the hpa in kansas are estimated to be the best for any large aquifer in the us based on the high percentage of wells with totalizing flowmeters now 98 and the supporting regulatory framework butler et al 2016 usda 2019 kansas has used water right permits based on the prior appropriation system for water use since 1945 the filing of annual water use reports for these permits became mandatory in 1988 peck 1995 the kda dwr which receives the water use reports began a program of reviewing the reports for accuracy in 1990 annual water use reports for all permitted wells are available since then stiff penalties exist for failure to provide accurate data including tampering with flowmeters kda dwr 2021 this dataset provides an excellent basis for examining precipitation as the meteorological driver of irrigation pumping irrigation efficiency has substantially increased in recent decades but this has not often led to true water conservation because pumping was not reduced either due to irrigating more water needy crops or expanding the irrigated area ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 sears et al 2018 in response to continued declines in the water table in the ogallala region of the kansas hpa the two gmds for which the estimated usable lifetime of the aquifer is the shortest gmds 1 and 4 buchanan et al 2023 began to implement water conservation measures using new management frameworks established by the kansas legislature butler et al 2018 griggs 2021 the first was the local enhanced management area lema program established in 2012 to facilitate pumping reductions a lema is initiated by stakeholders who propose a plan for pumping reductions the plan is approved by the gmd in which the lema is located and then accepted or rejected by the chief engineer of the kda dwr after hearings a lema includes regulatory oversight to ensure that all irrigators in the area follow the agreed upon reductions a later legislative initiative established the water conservation area wca program which allows any water right owner or group of owners to develop a management plan to reduce pumping a wca is typically smaller than a lema independent of a gmd and only needs the approval of the chief engineer the first lema the sheridan 6 sd 6 lema started in 2013 in a 255 km2 area in gmd4 in northwest kansas fig 1 the goal was to reduce the average annual groundwater use by 20 in 2018 a district wide lema was initiated in gmd4 with a more modest reduction goal that varied among townships area of a township is 93 km2 a series of wcas were established in wichita county in gmd1 crosshatched in fig 1 starting in 2017 followed by a county wide lema in 2021 the formation of a four county lema in gmd1 is currently in the hearing process of the kda dwr the effectiveness of these lemas and wcas will be assessed in the following sections 2 methods the methods involved selection and retrieval of precipitation and irrigation water use data including irrigated acreage for determining the correlations of radar precipitation with water use and water use per irrigated area estimating the relative importance of water savings from improved water efficiency compared to those from decreases in irrigated area and assessment of linear regressions of precipitation versus water use by statistical models we used monthly values of multi sensor precipitation observations primarily radar data that are available for download from the advanced hydrologic prediction service ahps of the national weather service nws http water weather gov precip for the us these data have been served online since 2005 for the conterminous us puerto rico and alaska in spatial images and digital coverages precipitation data are based on hourly estimates from wsr 88d nexrad that are compared to and then corrected for ground rainfall gauge reports where radar coverage is not available or limited precipitation estimates incorporate satellite observations the radar data are available at a spatial resolution of 4 4 km gridded values for 2005 2016 raster format thereafter thereby capturing the spatial variability in precipitation that can occur between precipitation gauges prism precipitation data could also be used for the correlations however a comparison to radar data found that prism values are typically less than those of radar precipitation for areas within the kansas hpa regardless of their size see supplemental material the region overlying the kansas hpa has short but intense spring through fall thunderstorms that can have areas of influence smaller than the distance between many of the prism precipitation stations thus the radar precipitation dataset may better capture the precipitation distribution across the region total irrigation groundwater use and irrigated area data were acquired from the kda dwr through the online water information management and analysis system wimas available on the kansas geological survey website https geohydro kgs ku edu geohydro wimas water use and water use per irrigated area were plotted against radar precipitation and linear regressions and confidence intervals for the lines at the 95 confidence interval were determined for the plots the typical irrigation season over the kansas hpa starts from mid march to the beginning of may and ends during late august to mid september based on water level hydrographs from a network of monitoring wells butler et al 2021b however precipitation in january and february can also affect water use dry conditions during these months can result in irrigators pumping water in march and april to build up soil moisture before planting row crops substantial rain and snow during january and february that provides ample soil moisture obviates the need for the pre planting irrigation although the primary crops are corn soybeans and sorghum grown during the main irrigation season march september winter wheat and hay such as alfalfa may be irrigated in january and february during especially dry periods thus the sum of january through september precipitation was considered the most appropriate quantity for use in correlations with groundwater pumping different sums of contiguous monthly precipitation within the main irrigation season of march september were also examined for water use reductions to compare with those based on january september precipitation as a means of evaluating uncertainty in the reduction values this is discussed in the supplemental material reductions in irrigation water use have two main components that produced by more effective water use strategies and that resulting from decreases in irrigated area the first component is evaluated by plotting irrigation water use per irrigated area versus precipitation the second component is obtained by plotting total irrigation water use versus precipitation the relative contribution of each can be determined by subtracting the reduction computed from the first plot from that for the second other factors besides precipitation and irrigation efficiency can affect annual water use from year to year most notably changes in irrigated area and crop types although the mixture of crop types has not changed substantially during the last two decades rogers and aguilar 2017 irrigated area has generally decreased in gmds 1 and 3 increased in gmds 2 and 4 and remained approximately constant in gmd5 based on data from wimas the correlations were performed with both annual irrigation water use and annual irrigation water use divided by the irrigated area for each year i e depth of applied water to remove the effect of changing irrigated area the emphasis in this paper is on the correlations for water use per irrigated area because of the uncertainty in whether water use reductions due to decreases in irrigated area were associated with conservation measures or due to the abandonment of irrigation as a result of insufficient aquifer thickness correlations of total irrigation groundwater use with precipitation are also included for comparison we illustrate the impacts of conservation primarily through graphical comparison of the water use per area or total versus precipitation regressions for the pre conservation and conservation periods in sd 6 wichita county and gmd1 to support the conclusions drawn from these comparisons we have used f tests draper and smith 1981 to assess the improvement in fit of two alternative models one with separate intercepts but a common slope for the two periods the parallel slopes model and one with separate intercepts and slopes the full model over a model in which all the data are fit with a single line the reference model we take the significance of this improvement as the indication of the impact of conservation measures the details of this procedure are given in the supplemental material 3 results and discussion water use and precipitation relationships were first examined for the areas in the kansas hpa in which groundwater conservation measures have been implemented the sd 6 lema was the earliest established management area and had the largest reduction goal the plot of irrigation pumping per unit area versus precipitation for the pre lema 2005 2012 and lema 2013 2021 periods demonstrates that true water conservation has been achieved fig 3 the reduction in water use as indicated by the offset in the two regression lines at the mean precipitation during january september for 2005 2021 is 25 0 the average irrigated area decreased after the lema started based on irrigator reports wimas data and satellite information deines et al 2019 the additional water savings from the smaller irrigated area is 2 4 based on the correlation of annual irrigation groundwater use with january september precipitation giving a reduction in the total irrigation groundwater use of 27 4 fig 4 although some of the scatter in the points for the pre lema period could be produced by uncertainty in the water use reporting flowmeter performance has been more closely checked after establishment of the lema much of the scatter is likely related to irrigators not tracking soil moisture conditions as well as during the lema for example simple measures such as cutting off pumps when it starts to rain which were not always done in the past have been important l letourneau water appropriations program manager kda dwr personal communication deines et al 2019 found that farmers attained most of their pumping reductions from increases in irrigation efficiency while generally maintaining irrigated area consistent with our correlation results soil moisture sensors allowed the irrigators to adjust water applications and track the precipitation variation closely as evidenced by precipitation explaining 90 of the variation in water use during the lema the water conservation measures implemented in the sd 6 lema have slowed water level declines in the aquifer compared to pre lema declines especially after adjustment for changes in annual climatic conditions butler et al 2023 as described in the supplemental material formal statistical testing confirms that there is a significant difference between the water use per area versus precipitation regressions for the pre lema and lema periods the f test assessing the significance of the improvement in fit of the parallel slopes model over the reference model yields a p value of 1 2 10 5 and that comparing the full model which produces regression lines equivalent to those in fig 3 to the reference model yields a p value of 9 9 10 5 table s4 a smaller p value indicates a more significant difference in fit for total water use the corresponding f tests yield p values 4 1 10 6 and 3 3 10 5 table s5 confirming a significant reduction in total water use as well in both cases the full model fails to provide a significant improvement over the parallel slopes model meaning the conservation impacts can be characterized as a constant reduction in use per area or total use with no significant change in slope the intercept difference estimates from the parallel slopes models indicate reductions of 8 0 cm in use per area and 8 7 106 m3 in total use a series of wcas were established in wichita county in gmd1 starting in march 2017 although the bulk of the enrolled area was after the 2017 irrigation season a lema was then approved for wichita county in february 2021 the plot of pumping per irrigated area versus precipitation for january september demonstrates that true water conservation has again been achieved fig 5 in this case the reduction in water use as indicated by the offset in the two regression lines is 23 4 at the mean precipitation during 2005 2021 the irrigated area also decreased during the study period the additional water savings from the smaller irrigated area is 15 1 based on the correlation of irrigation groundwater use with january september precipitation giving a total groundwater use reduction of 38 5 fig 6 for use per area in wichita county the f tests comparing the parallel slopes and full models to the reference model yield p values of 4 5 10 6 and 4 0 10 5 respectively table s4 and the corresponding tests for total use yield p values of 3 4 10 6 and 1 6 10 5 table s5 again confirming that conservation measures have had significant impact as in sd 6 the full models fail to yield significant improvements over the parallel slopes models again indicating approximately constant reduction across the range of precipitation values the reductions indicated by the parallel slopes models are 5 7 cm in use per area and 24 0 106 m3 in total use gmd4 established a district wide lema in 2018 but legal challenges to the lema were not resolved until the fall of 2019 these legal challenges possibly delayed the participation of some irrigators as the plot of pumping versus precipitation reveals that little water conservation was achieved in the first four years of the lema fig 7 in addition the annual maximum rates of irrigation applications allowed during the initial 5 year lema period were greater than the actual mean irrigation water use per unit area during 2005 2021 thus only those irrigators with particularly high application rates were required to reduce their rate several wcas have been established in two counties in gmd4 but their total area is not yet large enough to significantly affect water consumption those wcas with individual sizes exceeding 400 ha were developed during 2018 2022 gmd4 includes parts or all of ten counties in northwest kansas some of these counties show a separation between 2005 2017 and 2018 2021 plots of water use per irrigated area versus precipitation however a series of hailstorms during the late spring and early summer of 2018 destroyed crops in local areas across gmd4 resulting in some cessation of pumping additional years of data will be needed to determine if the apparent reductions in water use per irrigated area are statistically significant in the individual counties there is no district wide lema for gmd1 but the district has proposed that one be established in four of the five counties in the gmd despite that there is a separation between the 2005 2017 and 2018 2020 regression lines for gmd1 fig 8 this separation is mainly produced by the wichita county wcas fig 5 as well as the two counties to the east and the county to the west which have apparently adopted some conservation measures during this period the conservation measures appear to start in 2018 wcas started partway through 2017 and are likely partly driven by the relatively small thickness of the hpa in those areas which has forced some irrigators to reduce their water use the estimated reduction in the district wide water use per irrigated area for 2018 2021 for the same climatic condition during 2005 2017 is 10 1 based on fig 8 the water use reduction based on a correlation of irrigation water use versus january september precipitation is 24 1 fig 9 the additional 14 0 is undoubtedly due to the decrease in irrigated area in the district for gmd1 the f tests comparing the parallel slopes and full models to the reference model for use per area yield p values of 8 0 10 4 and 4 1 10 3 respectively table s4 still significant but less so than for sd 6 or wichita county for total water use the corresponding f tests yield p values of 1 1 10 5 and 8 5 10 6 table s5 reflecting the greater percentage reduction in total water use compared to use per area in this case the full model for use per area still fails to yield a significant improvement over the parallel slopes model but that for total use yields a marginally significant improvement with a p value of 0 03 and thus significant at the 5 level the reductions indicated by the parallel slopes models are 2 6 cm in use per area and 46 3 106 m3 in total use there are no lemas in the other three gmds 2 3 and 5 and wcas represent a small proportion of the total area in each of these districts as a result water conservation efforts do not yet appear to have had a substantial impact the plot of water use per unit area versus radar precipitation for gmd3 which is also in the ogallala region of the hpa where large water level declines occur shows no statistically significant indication of water conservation fig 10 the plots for gmds 2 and 5 are similar figs 11 and 12 plots of water use versus climatic indices for 1996 2012 also show no indication of water conservation in these districts whittemore et al 2016 although individual producers have adopted water conservation measures in gmd3 and points for the years 2019 2021 for gmd3 plot below the regression line in fig 10 their impact on district wide conditions for irrigation application rate is too small to show a statistically significant separation from prior conditions based on data for 2005 2021 however points for these three years fall appreciably below the lower confidence interval boundary in a graph of irrigation water use versus precipitation for gmd3 fig 13 indicating a general decrease in irrigated area in gmd3 since 2018 the water use and precipitation relationships are also useful for comparing irrigation rates among different areas for similar climatic conditions irrigation rates have ranged widely for the different gmds counties and the sd 6 lema in the ogallala region of the hpa as indicated by the relative positions of the regression lines for the radar precipitation and irrigation water use per irrigated area correlations in fig 14 gmd3 has had the largest application rate fig 10 and gmd1 the smallest fig 8 of the three western gmds the order of the irrigation rates is the same as the remaining aquifer thickness gmd3 has the greatest and gmd1 the least the relatively small aquifer thickness in gmd1 at predevelopment has decreased substantially as indicated in fig 1 especially in wichita county including a decrease of over 20 from 2005 to 2021 fig 2 this has compelled irrigators in gmd1 to reduce pumping to maintain sufficient aquifer thickness for irrigation even without a district wide lema the significant change in reduction occurred starting around 2018 the water use application reduction during the sd 6 lema 2013 2021 brought the regression line down from above the rate for gmd4 to close to that for wichita county and gmd1 during 2005 2017 but still higher than that for gmd1 during 2018 2021 fig 14 the irrigation water use per area in wichita county during 2005 2017 was already less than that for gmd1 during 2005 2017 the addition of a substantial number of wcas then caused a significant reduction from 2017 to 2018 the application rate during 2018 2021 is the lowest of any areas discussed in this paper therefore although lemas and wcas can lead to sizable water use reductions diminishing aquifer thickness particularly in areas where that thickness was already small can also lead to sizable reductions some areas of gmd3 have seen relatively large decreases in aquifer thickness leading to the establishment of a number of wcas but the involved area is too small relative to the size of the large district to produce a discernable change in the overall water use rate 4 conclusions the correlation of radar precipitation and water use in heavily irrigated areas of the hpa in kansas is highly statistically significant for a wide range of scales from groundwater management districts several thousand to over 20 000 km2 in area to sub county areas of a few hundred km2 although not discussed here similar results have been found for areas as small as a few km2 around individual wells butler et al 2021b the coefficients of determination range from about 0 7 to over 0 9 indicating that precipitation is the main driver of variations in water use the radar precipitation and water use relationship has allowed the impact of new approaches to groundwater management in the kansas hpa to be assessed we have shown that water use for a 255 km2 local enhanced management area lema has decreased over 27 in comparison to the pre lema use recently established water conservation areas wcas have produced reductions of over 23 relative to the pre wca use based on application rate alone and even more if some of the decrease in irrigated area is related to conservation measures we have also found that these recent water use reductions are now becoming apparent on a considerably larger scale than those of the lema and wcas this could be a product of emulation of the practices used in the conservation areas or simply the result of the aquifer thickness getting to a point that previous pumping rates cannot be maintained and fewer acres are irrigated the reduction in this case has been as large as 24 for gmd1 the implemented water conservation measures that are producing significant water savings are also slowing water level declines in the aquifer e g butler et al 2023 the reductions in water use identified here have two components the reduction produced by more effective water use strategies appears to be responsible for more than 40 to over 90 of the observed decreases in water use these strategies can be implemented either by more efficient irrigation of the same crops using soil moisture sensors and other measures or by irrigating less water needy and more drought tolerant crops the other component is the reduction produced by decreases in irrigated area the first component can be evaluated by plotting irrigation water use per irrigated area versus precipitation insight into the magnitude of the second component can be obtained by plotting total irrigation water use versus precipitation and subtracting the reduction computed from the first plot from that for the second this approach could also be used in assessing where an increase in irrigation efficiency leads to an increase in overall water use due to increases in irrigated area as an example of jevons paradox dumont et al 2013 sears et al 2018 linear regressions of water use versus precipitation allow prediction of future water use for climatic conditions in which only mean precipitation changes more importantly however these relationships should allow the impact of climate change to be identified if as climate change models forecast temperatures continue to rise and the frequency and length of arid conditions increases resulting in more soil water stress a shift in the linear regression for an area will occur even without substantial changes in management practices these relationships are dependent on high quality precipitation and groundwater use data high quality precipitation data are often available but reliable groundwater use data are not as we have stressed repeatedly in earlier publications e g butler et al 2018 2023 greater attention needs to be placed on the monitoring of groundwater use we have previously demonstrated that monitoring of a subset of the pumping wells in an aquifer can be a cost effective strategy that yields reliable data on groundwater use bohling et al 2021 when high quality pumping data are available we have shown here that radar precipitation and water use relationships can provide insights of great practical value

8844,lodging results in severe yield loss and harvest difficulty in wheat production especially in the drip irrigation technique dominated wheat system in arid area of north west china we assume that our previously developed enlarging lateral space els drip irrigation pattern benefits plant lodging resistance due to the enlarged border row space brs by narrowing row space nrs in a three year field experiment we compared spring wheat lodging resistance of the els patterns with the conventional drip irrigation pattern of tr4 one drip t ube serves plant r ows tr of four with normal row space rs of 15 cm as control six els patterns included the normal els patterns of tr6 and tr8 expanding tr from four to six and eight with normal rs of 15 cm large brs els patterns of tr6l brs of 35 cm and tr8l brs of 45 cm by narrowing rs to 10 cm and shorter brs els patterns of tr6s and tr8s with brs of 25 cm and rs of 10 cm the normal els patterns with even rs tr6 tr8 10 82 48 21 significantly increased lodging rate as compared with tr4 7 22 42 41 reversely patterns with broadened brs effectively reduced lodging rate 5 62 39 55 for tr6l tr8l 6 18 41 73 for tr6s tr8s the much improved lodging resistance of the outermost or the border rows essentially contributed to the much lower lodging rate of the modified els patterns the border plants in the modified els patterns performed higher photosynthesis of leaf and lignin content in basal stems subsequently increased stem pole substantial degree and finally improved stem mechanical properties in addition the modified els patterns also optimized accumulation and redistribution of dry matter in stems in the outermost rows therefore the modified els drip irrigation patterns via nrs which leaved border effects were recommended as low lodging risks approach towards stabilized wheat productivity of which tr6s was strongly recommended keywords border row effect enlarging lateral space drip irrigation pattern lodging resistance spring wheat stem mechanical property data availability data will be provided when required 1 introduction as one dominant staple crop wheat is essential for ensuring world food security since it contributes more than 20 calories and proteins as well as provides higher than 30 of energy human being fao 2016 braun et al 2010 chen et al 2015 however shortage of fresh water resource severely limits wheat production in most wheat production regions especially in the arid and semi arid areas mphande et al 2021 wang et al 2013 xinjiang uygur autonomous region north west of china is the very typical one where the annual rainfall is less than 200 mm but the annual evaporation over 2000 mm lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 chen et al 2015 the efficient water saving irrigation technologies are then of key importance for supporting wheat production in these areas chen et al 2015 as the most water saving technology drip irrigation is successfully developed and widely adopted in wheat production in xinjiang due to the very high use efficiencies of both water and fertilizers and high gains in both productivity and economic benefit chen et al 2015 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 however lodging due to heavy wind wet soft soil during irrigation and inappropriate management seriously threatens drip irrigation wheat production in xinjiang li et al 2017a b liang et al 2017 men et al 2014 acreche slafer 2011 lodging has become one dominant agricultural meteorological disaster in xinjiang where gale weather frequently happens acreche slafer 2011 wu et al 2021 yang et al 2020 lodging is reported to cut yield of drip irrigation wheat by 20 30 and reaches up to 40 in severe cases men et al 2014 acreche slafer 2011 lodging also results in mechanical harvesting difficulty raises risks of harvest loss lowers harvesting efficiency and worsens grain quality peng et al 2014 berry spink 2012 reducing height and gravity center of plant by foliar application of pleiotropis or gibberellin inhibitors could improve lodging resistance in wheat loycea et al 2008 pinthus 1974 rajala et al 2002 tripathi et al 2003 zhang et al 2001 magome et al 2004 iqbal ashraf 2013 however these measures are usually accompanied with reductions in biomass and grain yield law et al 1978 fernandez et al 2009 gooding et al 2012 zhang et al 2001 acreche slafer 2011 moreover approaches to reduce lodging risks to our best knowledge are rare in drip irrigation wheat fortunately we observed that planting configurations essentially affected plant lodging resistance of drip irrigation wheat in previous field experiments we firstly designed the normal els by expanding the tr from four tr4 the conventional planting pattern in xinjiang in which one drip tube serves four rows of wheat plants to six tr6 and eight tr8 without changing the rs we then reconfigured the normal els patterns of tr6 and tr8 by nrs which leaved border rows with unmodified large brs as patterns of tr6l and tr8l and with modified brs patterns of tr6s and tr8s see details in the materials and methods session the optimized planting patterns improved both productivity and profit wan et al 2022 it was amazing that the nrs els patterns with or without modified brs showed strong lodging resistance as compared with the normal rs patterns tr4 tr6 tr8 lodging resistance is commonly dependant on the height of the gravity center and the physical strength of internodes supporting the erection of plant rajala et al 2002 liang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 peng et al 2014 the basal internodes are known to play key roles in lodging resistance for instance lodging resistance index of wheat was significantly positively correlated with the physical strength of the second basal internodes and improving physical strength of the basal internode effectively reduced lodging rate fan et al 2012 guo et al 2010 berry et al 2003 niu et al 2012 there are two important traits of physical strength of crop stem the stalk bending strength sbs and the rind penetration strength rps berry et al 2003 fan et al 2012 niu et al 2012 peng et al 2014 yang et al 2020 the stem pole substantial degree spsd is an important factor indicating the physical strength and higher spsd parallels with stronger lodging resistance of wheat stem feng et al 2015 in addition lignin one of the key structural biochemical components in the secondary cell walls of vascular plants is not only associated with plant growth and development but also confers mechanical strength to plants yang et al 2020 ma 2009 therefore content of lignin was generally higher in lodging resistant wheat cultivars than sensitive ones berry et al 2003 chen et al 2011 to better understand the advantages of plant lodging resistance in the modified els drip irrigation patterns we carried out a three year field experiment with different plant to drip tube configurations 2019 2020 and 2021 we observed plant lodging performances stem mechanical properties and physiological traits related to substances accumulation in stems of different rows and of the overall patterns the objectives were i to optimize plant to drip tube configuration in enlarging lateral space drip irrigated wheat towards less risk of lodging ii to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the lodging resistance improvement in the recommended drip irrigation patterns the results should help guide establishment of environmental resilient or risk less drip irrigation patterns with high productivity and economic profit for wheat production in arid and semi arid areas 2 materials and methods

xinjiang uyghur autonomous region china the locally widely grown wheat cultivar xinchun 44 xc44 was used for this experiment the sowing dates were march 28th april 1st and april 6th in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the plants and drip tube configurations were followed by our previous report wan et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 in total seven patterns were included i e the conventional drip irrigation system of tr4 the drip t ube serves number of wheat r ows of four with rs of 15 cm and ls of 60 cm as control the els patterns by expanding tr from four tr4 to six tr6 rs of 15 cm ls of 90 cm and eight tr8 rs of 15 cm ls of 120 cm the narrowed rs from 15 cm to 10 cm els patterns of tr6l ls of 90 cm with large brs of 35 cm and tr8l ls of 120 cm with large brs of 45 cm the further shortened brs nrs els patterns of tr6s ls of 80 cm with brs of 25 cm and tr8s ls of 100 cm with brs of 25 cm the experiment was randomized complete block design with three replicates for each planting pattern in this experiment each plot size of planting pattern was more than 100 m2 the density of planting was consistent for all planting patterns and the planting density of 180 104 plants ha 1 since the total row number in the same size of plot is the same in tr4 tr6 tr8 tr6l and tr8l the same grain number was sowing in each row but there were more rows in tr6s and tr8s and grain number per row was according reduced to ensure the unity of plant density in different pattern we have developed wheat precision planters for each drip irrigation patter the electronic control system of precise sowing quantity was applied in each wheat precision planters to ensure that the target sowing density the irrigation and fertilization strategies were followed our previous report and local recommendations wan et al 2022 in brief the irrigation amount was 900 900 900 675 675 and 450 m3 ha 1 at three leaf stage stem elongation booting anthesis early milk stage and late milk stage respectively the nitrogen rate was 60 36 96 48 36 and 24 kg ha 1 at pre sowing three leaf stage stem elongation booting anthesis and early milk stage respectively in order to ensure that the amount of irrigation and fertilization of all planting patterns are consistent and accurate we use the precision water meter installed in each experimental plot to control the amount of irrigation while the fertilizer is quantitatively controlled by the plastic fertilizer tank installed 2 2 sampling and measurements the lodging of drip irrigation spring wheat mainly consists of stalk lodging at grain filling stage and stalk lodging occurs most frequently at the basal second internode bsi above the soil surface in xinjiang fig s1 therefore the lodging rate lodging resistance mechanical properties stem lignin content and stem pole substantial degree were measured on the bsi at the grain filling stage in this experiment 2 2 1 stalk bending strength sbs and rind penetration strength rps sbs was measured according to the method of peng et al 2014 with a stalk strength tester yyd 1 hangzhou top instrument co ltd hangzhou china for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s seven continuously grown wheat plants in each row were harvest and the main stem of each plant was selected for measurement of sbs and rps the overall sbs or rps of each pattern was then mean of from all rows the sample bsi with sheath were put on the groove of support pillars with a distance of 5 cm the sbs test probe of the stalk strength tester provides force in the direction perpendicular to each stalk until the bsi was broken fig s2 the peak force to bend or break the stalk was defined as sbs n the rps was measured according to the method of ma et al 2018 with a few modifications bsi with sheath of each samples was put on the groove of support pillars with a distance of 0 5 cm the rind penetration strength test probe of the stalk strength tester was slowly inserted into the stalk of bsi fig s2 the peak force to penetrate the stalk was defined as the rps n the lodging rate of different wheat rows was calculated using eq 1 1 the lodging rate number of lodging plants total plants 100 the lodging plants are defined when the angle between plant and the ground is less than or equal to 45 keller et al 1999 number of lodging and non lodging plants were counted in 1 m length of each row in each replicate of each treatment 2 2 2 stem pole substantial degree spsd and stem lignin content slc for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s seven representative uniform wheat plants in each row were selected for measurements of spsd and slc length of bsi was measured with a ruler before being put into paper bags the internodes were enzyme deactivated at 105 c for 30 min followed by being dried at 80 c to a constant weight the spsd g cm 1 of bsi was calculated by dividing the dry weight g by length cm of the internode peng et al 2014 wang et al 2015a the overall spsd of each pattern was the mean all rows in addition the slc of bsi was determined according to wang et al 2015a half gram of culm samples was homogenized with a pestle in a mortar with an ethanol solution containing 4 ml of 95 v v following homogenization the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 2600 g after extracted with two successive 2 h extraction in 4 ml of 95 v v ethanol at 80 the sediments were extracted with another two successive 1 h extraction using 4 ml of concentrated ethanol in hexane 1 2 v v at 62 sediments were then dried for 2 days at 50 a 3 6 ml solution of 25 v v acetyl bromide in acetic acid was added to dried sediments following being incubated at 70 c in a water bath for 0 5 h half ml extract was mixed with 0 9 ml of 2 mol l 1 naoh and 5 ml acetic acid meanwhile 0 1 ml 7 5 mol l 1 hydroxylamine hydrochloride was applied to terminate the reaction the final volume was adjusted to 15 ml using acetic acid and the measurement of absorbance at a280 was performed by a spectrophotometer uv 5800pc shanghai china the overall slc of each pattern was the mean of all rows 2 2 3 the net photosynthetic rate spad height and angle of flag leaf for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s three representative uniform wheat plants in each row were selected for measurements of photosynthesis spad soil and plant analyzer development value as indicator of chlorophyll content leaf height and angle at the grain filling stage photosynthesis was measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor inc ne usa at a light intensity of 1700 μmol photon m 2 s 1 under uniform conditions 400 500 μmol co2 mol 1 spad value was measured using a chlorophyll meter spad 502plus konica minolta inc japan the height and angle of flag leaf were determined using a ruler and protractor according to liu et al 2009 specifically photosynthesis spad height and angle of flag leaf and height of stem gravity center were not measured due to severe lodging in 2019 the overall net photosynthetic rate spad value height and angle of flag leaf of each pattern were the corresponding means all rows 2 2 4 height of stem gravity center hgc for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s three representative uniform wheat plants in each row were selected and the main stems were taken for measurement of hgc following to the method of liang et al 2017 the positioning of hgc was shown in fig s3 and the distance cm between the hgc point and the stem base was the value of hgc 2 3 statistical analysis data from the different years 2019 2020 and 2021 were analyzed separately our random factors were different planting patterns and different wheat rows in the same patterns among them data analysis of the conventional planting pattern of tr4 r1 and r2 used the independent sample t test other planting patterns were submitted to one way analysis of variance anova followed by lsd test at p 0 05 to test the differences between different planting patterns and different rows using the software spss 18 0 in addition the data analysis was performed on the performance of lodging rate under all factors including rs tr ls and brs the f value is the statistic value of the f test and the larger the f value indicate the more significant the difference between the data groups being compared finally path analysis was taken to elucidate the contributions of all measured indicators to lodging resistance the path analysis was performed using the stepwise regression analysis module of the spss 18 0 the stepwise regression analysis was firstly conducted in which lodging rate was taken as dependent variable y and all other indicators e g rps sbs spsd slc and spad et al as independent variables x according to the model with the largest r2 in stepwise regression we select the direct and indirect influencing factors e g rps in fig 6 that affect the lodging rate to further explore which factor affect rps we again set rps as the dependent variable y and all other indicators e g sbs spsd spsd sbs npr etc as independent variables x for stepwise regression analysis after the data analysis results were generated we selected the model with the highest r2 to screen for factors affecting rps directly or indirectly for example the spsd and sbs are the most direct factors affecting rps in this experiment by analogy with this method we have researched and sorted out the logical relationship of mutual influence between all indicators in this experiment the results of the stepwise analysis were then illustrated in charts generated with the origin 9 software systat software inc san jose california usa 3 results 3 1 overall lodging rate of different planting patterns lodging rate of spring wheat in the conventional planting pattern of tr4 was 42 41 2019 14 07 2020 and 7 22 2021 respectively table 1 normally els to 90 cm tr6 and 120 cm tr8 without narrowing rs significantly increased lodging rate in relation to tr4 however nrs from 15 cm to 10 cm leaving large brs from 15 cm to 35 cm tr6l and 45 cm tr8l significantly reduced lodging rate as compared with both tr4 and the corresponding normal patterns of tr6 and tr8 in all three growth seasons in addition nrs incorporation with shortened brs from 15 cm to 25 cm tr6s and tr8s also showed lower lodging rate than tr4 and significantly lower than the corresponding normal els patterns of tr6 and tr8 this could be further proved by the field lodging resistance performance of different planting patterns as shown in fig 1 data analysis was performed on the performance of lodging rate under all factors including rs tr ls brs treated in the experiment table 2 the results showed that there was no significant difference in the lodging rate of wheat under the change of rs 10 cm and 15 cm although enlarging tr can improved the lodging rate of wheat the difference is not significant in most cases this is understandable since brs was found to have the greatest impact on the lodging rate with the highest f value 82 160 101 104 and significant difference in the lodging rate p 0 001 on this basis the lodging rate of enlarged tr planting patterns with brs effect can be effectively reduced to a certain extent additionally enlarging ls remarkably increased the lodging rate of wheat in most cases which was also verified by the performance of wheat canopy lodging at the filling stage of different planting systems fig 1 notably despite the extremely significant difference in the lodging rate of wheat under different ls p 0 001 the f value 5 282 10 826 was far lower than that of brs 82 160 101 104 therefore in this experiment brs effect figured prominently in the improvement of the wheat lodging resistance under drip irrigation system 3 2 the lodging rate between rows under different planting patterns in the normal rs drip irrigation patterns of tr4 tr6 and tr8 the lodging rate generally increased outwardly from r1 the 1strow adjacent to the drip tube to the outermost row r2 for tr4 r3 for tr6 and r4 for tr8 fig 2 especially for r3 in tr6 tr8 and for r4 in tr8 lodging rate dramatically increased as compared with r1 and r2 however nrs incorporation with large brs tr6l tr8l or shortened brs patterns tr6s tr8s much lower lodging rate in the outermost row r3 for tr6l and tr6s r4 for tr8l and tr8s than the corresponding r1 and r2 moreover tr6l and tr8l showed lower lodging rate of r3 and r4 in paralleling with the lowered overall lodging performance than the corresponding shortened brs patterns of tr6s and tr8s therefore nrs oriented border rows with broadened brs effectively reduced lodging rate of plants distant to drip tube which essentially contributed to the improved overall lodging resistance 3 3 the changes in the mechanical properties of stems the stem mechanical properties of sbs and rps of tr4 did not differ significantly between rows fig 3 in the normal els planting patterns of tr6 and tr8 however sbs and rps decreased outwardly from r1 and with a sharp drop from r2 to r3 and r4 reversely sbs and rps of tr6s tr8s tr6l and tr8l were much higher r3 and r4 than the corresponding r1 and r2 therefore nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s effectively improved wheat stem mechanical strength at the border rows which could enhance the overall lodging resistance of the modified els planting pattern 3 4 the changes in stem lignin content slc and stem pole substantial degree spsd similar to the stem mechanical properties slc and spsd in wheat stem decreased outwardly from r1 to the outermost rows in the normal els planting patterns of tr6 and tr8 fig 4 however in the modified els patterns of tr6s tr6l tr8s and tr8l the slc and spsd of the border rows were much higher than the corresponding r1 and r2 the increased slc and spsd in stems of the border rows would benefit the improved stem mechanical properties which further confer lodging resistance in the nrs els patterns with large brs 3 5 the changes in wheat canopy structure and photosynthetic performance of flag leaf as shown in fig 5a there are significant differences in the flag leaf height lh of wheat normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 shown the same trend as tr4 with lh showing a gradient decrease from r1 to the farthest row and in most cases there is a significant difference between rows only except for the non significant difference in lh between r2 and r3 of tr8 in 2020 tr8 however nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s effectively alleviate the decrease in lh of the farthest wheat rows under the normal wheat row spacing 15 cm of drip irrigation patterns tr4 tr6 and tr8 the la of wheat between rows was not significantly different except for the significant lower la of tr6 in r3 than in the inner row in 2020 and the significant lower la of tr8 in r3 and r4 than in the inner row in 2020 fig 5b reducing the row spacing is beneficial to increase the la of farthest row wheat the la of the farthest row r3 of tr6l and tr6s was significantly higher than that of r1 and r2 the la of wheat in the farthest row r4 of tr8l and tr8s was also significantly higher than that of r1 all drip irrigation patterns showed a decreasing trend in the spad from the inner row r1 to the farthest row fig 5c among them the spad differences between rows were not significant in tr4 however all els patterns tr6 tr6l tr6s tr8 tr8l and tr8s significantly reduced the spad of the farthest wheat rows but compared with normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s effectively reduced the degree of spad decrease in the farthest wheat rows the flag leaf net photosynthetic rate npr between rows of tr4 was not significantly fig 5d however npr of normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 decreased gradually from r1 to the farthest row with significantly lower npr in the farthest row compared to r1 similar to the changes in lh and la between rows nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s significantly increased npr in the farthest row 3 6 the results of path analysis to investigate the logical relationship between all the lodging resistance measurement indicators in the experiment path analysis was performed based on all the data fig 6 the results showed that rps had the most direct effect on wheat lodging rate with direct path coefficients above 0 9 in both years sbs and spsd all had a direct effect on rps with the direct path coefficient of sbs being greater than that of spsd this suggests that the mechanical properties of stems rps and sbs are the most direct indicator affecting wheat lodging rate furthermore wheat slc was found to have a direct impact on spsd indicating that an increase in slc is beneficial for improving spsd and enhancing the mechanical properties of stems thereby positively affecting wheat lodging resistance additionally the analysis of direct and indirect path coefficients revealed that npr is directly or indirectly affected by slc and spsd which in turn affect the mechanical properties of stems sbs and rps moreover although the positions of the lh and hgc for 2020 and 2021 change in the path analysis diagram but overall the npr of wheat is directly or indirectly influenced by changes in lh la and hgc this confirms our findings that the nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s broaden the growing space for wheat plant in distant row contribute to improved the canopy structure of distant row wheat by increasing the lh and la has a positive effect on npr the increased in npr of distant row wheat promotes the slc which in turn directly affects the stem mechanical properties of lodging resistance especially rps by enhancing the spsd ultimately this effectively reduces the lodging rate of wheat in this experiment spad was negatively affect wheat lodging resistance but to a lesser extent 4 discussion drip irrigation is currently the most water saving irrigation technology which has been well adopted in the arid and semi arid areas especially in xinjiang the north west china chen et al 2015 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 unlike the large size broad rs field crops such as maize and cotton and fruit trees in which one drip tube usually serves only one or two rows of crops in the small size with relatively narrow rs commonly 15 cm and densely planting crop of wheat one drip tube has to serve four rows of wheat plants drip tube to row number ratio of 4 tr4 due to very limited transporting distance of drip irrigated water chen et al 2015 and the concern of cost of drip tubes lv et al 2019 to reduce the drip tube cost we endeavored to develop the els planting patterns for drip irrigated wheat in recent years we suggested that els patterns by nrs which leaved border rows with broadened border row space brs were potential profitable drip irrigation patterns with close productivity with much lower drip tube input as compared with the traditional tr4 pattern wan et al 2022 it is very interesting that these modified els patterns tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s owning border rows not only significantly improved economic benefits wan et al 2022 but also showed much stronger resistance to lodging than tr4 as shown in the present study fig 1 this confers promising and prospective solutions for drip irrigation wheat production towards high yield low input and low risks of grain yield fluctuation since very strong convective weathers with frequently heavy winds dominate the whole growth period which result in severe yield losses in xinjiang li et al 2017a b liang et al 2017 men et al 2014 acreche slafer 2011 further analysis found that the border row space effect played an important role in improving the lodging resistance of wheat in drip irrigation system in this experiment table 2 the lodging resistance was essentially improved on plants at the border rows or the outermost rows most distant to the drip tube fig 2 which eventually contributed to the overall lodging resistance improved of nrs incorporation with large brs tr6l tr8l or shortened brs patterns tr6s tr8s table 1 considering the obvious broad brs or large space between the most distant rows to the drip tube resulted from the narrowed row space in the els patterns vs the even row space in tr4 tr6 and tr8 the so called border effects were assumed to contribute to the enhanced plant lodging resistance of the outermost rows the healthier plants grown under abundant conditions were firstly assumed to contribute to the improved lodging resistance of the outermost rows or the border rows in the nrs els patterns the border effects usually refer to better growth status and higher productive of the marginal plants due to less competitions of resources such as space above ground radiation and co2 and soil water and nutrient than the inner row plants wang et al 2015b gao et al 2013 ayisi et al 1997 wheat plants at the border rows were more productive wan et al 2022 wang et al 2015b than the inner row plants in the wide narrow row mixed patterns the border plants were usually stronger with larger size fan et al 2012 wan et al 2022 wang et al 2015b more tillers and accumulation of dry matters fan et al 2012 wan et al 2022 and subsequently would confer improved resistance to lodging fan et al 2012 here the modified els patterns by nrs leaved broadened inter block or border row space of 35 cm 45 cm and 25 cm for tr6l tr8l and both tr6s and tr8s respectively fig 1 this allowed wheat of the outermost or most distant rows to the drip tube to access to better ventilation co2 and light conditions wan et al 2022 wang et al 2015b which favored accumulation of photo assimilates and growth of plants wan et al 2022 fan et al 2012 here the border row plants of the nrs els patterns had higher flag leaf height and larger flag leaf angle than inner row plants figs 5a b also shown in fig s4 which would facilitate the light interception by the canopy truong et al 2015 betsabe et al 2017 this of course would lead to better leaf photosynthetic performance gaju et al 2014 nehe et al 2020 and deposit of photo assimilates which was proved in the present study that flag photosynthetic rate fig 5d and biomass wan et al 2022 were much higher in the outermost rows of the nrs els patterns than the normal els patterns and tr4 the improved accumulation of photosynthetic assimilates would allow enough carbohydrates to be transported and converted into the filling substances or the structural substances in internodes to construct stronger stems of the border plants fan et al 2012 yang et al 2020 wan et al 2022 the substances include cellulose hemicellulose and lignin et al which are essentially beneficial to strong stems and lodging resistance xue et al 2016 yang et al 2020 this well agreed our findings here that the filling degree of stem as exemplified by the increased slc and the spsd was much higher in the outermost rows in the nrs els patterns than the normal even row space patterns fig 4 moreover both stem lignin content and spsd were higher which indicated stronger border effects in the larger brs patterns of tr6l and tr8l than the relatively shortened brs patterns of tr6s and tr8s this further proved the positive border effects on construction of strong straws of the outermost rows to resist lodging of plants in the nrs els patterns in addition the contribution rate of photoassimilates temporarily stored in vegetative organs a large proportion from stems and sheathes before anthesis which was redistributed to grain after anthesis was much higher in plants of the outermost rows in the normal els patterns to better cope with the more severe water deficit in relation to the border rows in the nrs els patterns wan et al 2020 this could further reduce the substrates for synthesis of the filling substances in stems which consequently led to weakened straws in the outermost rows of the normal els patterns as compared with the border rows in the nrs els patterns as shown in the present study fig 4 there is no doubt that well filled straws gain better mechanical properties to better resist plant lodging in crops fan et al 2012 high contents of cellulose semi cellulose and lignin positively correlate to mechanical strength toughness and elasticity of stems in wheat berry et al 2003 chen et al 2011 ma 2009 and other crops yang et al 2020 xue et al 2016 here both sbs and rps of wheat stems were much higher in the border rows of the nrs els patterns than the corresponding outermost rows distant to drip tube in the normal els patterns tr6l tr6s vs tr6 tr8l tr8s vs tr8 as shown in fig 3 in addition sbs and rps of the border rows were high in the large brs 45 cm than the modified shortened brs 25 cm els patterns fig 1 indicating that broader brs conferred stronger border effects on mechanical properties and lodging resistant capacity further path analysis well agreed with the above conclusions fig 6 the nrs els patterns well increased the lh and la the hgc of plants at the border rows rows most distant to the drip tube which allowed the plants to better intercept radiation as compared with the outermost rows in the normal els patterns in combination with the increased spad the npr was improved to contribute to the slc which further enhanced the spsd in the modified els patterns thereafter the mechanical properties of the sbs and especially the rps were improved to enhance the resistance to lodging by the border effects moreover the border effects also regulated the morphology of wheat plants at the border rows of the modified els patterns such as hgc table s1 hgc is an important factor affecting lodging resistance and lower hgc usually allows the stem to support heavier head and thus is commonly required for lodging resistant varieties liang et al 2017 in wheat production exogenous plant growth inhibitors are usually applied to lower down hgc of plants pinthus 1974 rajala et al 2002 tripathi et al 2003 zhang et al 2001 magome et al 2004 iqbal ashraf 2013 this was in disagreement with our present results that hgc of the border rows in the nrs els patterns was much higher than the corresponding outermost rows of the normal els patterns r3 in tr6l tr6s vs tr6 and r3 r4 in tr8l and tr8s vs tr8 table s1 of course this further proved that the border effects resulted in much stronger plants with higher biomass and larger size height of plants to achieve both higher productivity and stronger resistance to lodging in the nrs els patterns than the normal even row space patterns of tr4 tr6 and tr8 we also further analyzed the relationship between lodging performance and irrigation water evenness for different planting patterns as shown by previous studies the difference in the received irrigation water riw between rows of tr4 was minimal and the water uniformity between rows was the highest the coefficient of variation between rows in riw was only 3 60 6 77 wan et al 2022 els decreased the uniformity of moisture among which the riw of the normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 showed a gradient decrease from the inner rows to outer rows with the worst moisture uniformity the coefficient of variation between rows in riw was 59 09 75 65 wan et al 2022 that is to say wheat plants far from the drip tube could easily suffer from a certain water deficit under normal els patterns which often leads to weaker wheat stalks this explains its wheat lodging rate trend of an increase from the inner rows to outer rows in comparison to normal els patterns nrs els patterns tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s made all wheat rows closer to the drip tube and the water uniformity increased wan et al 2022 this could help explain the lower lodging rate of nrs els patterns than normal els patterns to a certain extent notably the riw in outer rows was lower than inner rows under nrs els patterns but the lodging resistance in outer rows was significantly higher than inner rows fig 2 indicating that the improvement of lodging resistance in nrs els patterns is mainly related to border effects therefore nrs incorporation via nrs with brs that can be recommended as cultivation measures to improve the lodging resistance ability of drip irrigation wheat in combination with performances of overall grain yield and economic benefits the tr6s has a satisfactory yield and the highest economic benefit wan et al 2022 then tr6s was strongly recommended as the local drip irrigated wheat patterns with both high yield and profit and less risk of yield loss due to lodging 5 conclusion the nrs led broadened brs effectively reduced lodging rate of wheat plants in the els drip irrigation patterns as result of the essentially improved lodging resistance of plants at the border rows the modified morphology including height and angle of flag leaf and height of stem gravity center and flag leaf spad value by border effects allowed the outermost wheat plants to intercept more radiation which further promoted photosynthetic capacity meanwhile lignin accumulation and the filling degree or the pole substantial degree of the basal internodes were increased by the border effects to facilitate the construction of the mechanical properties and finally improved the lodging resistance of wheat plants at the border rows in the modified els patterns providing high grain yield and economic profit as revealed in previous study wan et al 2022 and low risk of yield loss due to lodging the tr6s pattern was recommended as promised drip irrigation

8844,lodging results in severe yield loss and harvest difficulty in wheat production especially in the drip irrigation technique dominated wheat system in arid area of north west china we assume that our previously developed enlarging lateral space els drip irrigation pattern benefits plant lodging resistance due to the enlarged border row space brs by narrowing row space nrs in a three year field

resistance of the outermost or the border rows essentially contributed to the much lower lodging rate of the modified els patterns the border plants in the modified els patterns performed higher photosynthesis of leaf and lignin content in basal stems subsequently increased stem pole substantial degree and finally improved stem mechanical properties in addition the modified els patterns also optimized accumulation and redistribution of dry matter in stems in the outermost rows therefore the modified els drip irrigation patterns via nrs which leaved border effects were recommended as low

could improve lodging resistance in wheat loycea et al 2008 pinthus 1974 rajala et al 2002 tripathi et al 2003 zhang et al 2001 magome et al 2004 iqbal ashraf 2013 however these measures are usually accompanied with reductions in biomass and grain yield law et al 1978 fernandez et al 2009 gooding et al 2012 zhang et al 2001 acreche slafer 2011 moreover approaches to reduce lodging risks to our best knowledge are rare in drip irrigation wheat fortunately we observed that planting configurations essentially affected plant lodging resistance of drip irrigation wheat in previous field experiments we firstly designed the normal els by expanding the tr from four tr4 the conventional planting pattern in xinjiang in which one drip tube serves four rows of wheat plants to six tr6 and eight tr8 without changing the rs we then reconfigured the normal els patterns of tr6 and tr8 by nrs which leaved border rows with unmodified large brs as patterns of tr6l and tr8l and with modified brs patterns of tr6s and tr8s see details in the materials and methods session the optimized planting patterns improved both productivity and profit wan et al 2022 it was amazing that the nrs els patterns with or without modified brs showed strong lodging resistance as compared with the normal rs patterns tr4 tr6 tr8 lodging resistance is commonly dependant on the height of the gravity center and the physical strength of internodes supporting the erection of plant rajala et al 2002 liang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 peng et al 2014 the basal internodes are known to play key roles in lodging resistance for instance lodging resistance index of wheat was significantly positively correlated with the physical strength of the second basal internodes and improving physical strength of the basal internode effectively reduced lodging rate fan et al 2012 guo et al 2010 berry et al 2003 niu et al 2012 there are two important traits of physical strength of crop stem the stalk bending strength sbs and the rind penetration strength rps berry et al 2003 fan et al 2012 niu et al 2012 peng et al 2014 yang et al 2020 the stem pole substantial degree spsd is an important factor indicating the physical strength and higher spsd parallels with stronger lodging resistance of wheat stem feng et al 2015 in addition lignin one of the key structural biochemical components in the secondary cell walls of vascular plants is not only associated with plant growth and development but also confers mechanical strength to plants yang et al 2020 ma 2009 therefore content of lignin was generally higher in lodging resistant wheat cultivars than sensitive ones berry et al 2003 chen et al 2011 to better understand the advantages of plant lodging resistance in the modified els drip irrigation patterns we carried out a three year field experiment with different plant to drip tube configurations 2019 2020 and 2021 we observed plant lodging performances stem mechanical properties and physiological traits related to substances accumulation in stems of different rows and of the overall patterns the objectives were i to optimize plant to drip tube configuration in enlarging lateral space drip irrigated wheat towards less risk of lodging ii to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the lodging resistance improvement in the recommended drip irrigation patterns the results should help guide establishment of environmental resilient or risk less drip irrigation patterns with high productivity and economic profit for wheat production in arid and semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design field experiment was performed in three growth seasons of spring wheat 2019 2020 and 2021 at the experimental station of shihezi university 44 21 n 86 04 e altitude of 450 m in xinjiang uyghur autonomous region china the locally widely grown wheat cultivar xinchun 44 xc44 was used for this experiment the sowing dates were march 28th april 1st and april 6th in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the plants and drip tube configurations were followed by our previous report wan et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 in total seven patterns were included i e the conventional drip irrigation system of tr4 the drip t ube serves number of wheat r ows of four with rs of 15 cm and ls of 60 cm as control the els patterns by expanding tr from four tr4 to six tr6 rs of 15 cm ls of 90 cm and eight tr8 rs of 15 cm ls of 120 cm the narrowed rs from 15 cm to 10 cm els patterns of tr6l ls of 90 cm with large brs of 35 cm and tr8l ls of 120 cm with large brs of 45 cm the further shortened brs nrs els patterns of tr6s ls of 80 cm with brs of 25 cm and tr8s ls of 100 cm with brs of 25 cm the experiment was randomized complete block design with three replicates for each planting pattern in this experiment each plot size of planting pattern was more than 100 m2 the density of planting was consistent for all planting patterns and the planting density of 180 104 plants ha 1 since the total row number in the same size of plot is the same in tr4 tr6 tr8 tr6l and tr8l the same grain number was sowing in each row but there were more rows in tr6s and tr8s and grain number per row was according reduced to ensure the unity of plant density in different pattern we have developed wheat precision planters for each drip irrigation patter the electronic control system of precise sowing quantity was applied in each wheat precision planters to ensure that the target sowing density the irrigation and fertilization strategies were followed our previous report and local recommendations wan et al 2022 in brief the irrigation amount was 900 900 900 675 675 and 450 m3 ha 1 at three leaf stage stem elongation booting anthesis early milk stage and late milk stage respectively the nitrogen rate was 60 36 96 48 36 and 24 kg ha 1 at pre sowing three leaf stage stem elongation booting anthesis and early milk stage respectively in order to ensure that the amount of irrigation and fertilization of all planting patterns are consistent and accurate we use the precision water meter installed in each experimental plot to control the amount of irrigation while the fertilizer is quantitatively controlled by the plastic fertilizer tank installed 2 2 sampling and measurements the lodging of drip irrigation spring wheat mainly consists of stalk lodging at grain filling stage and stalk lodging occurs most frequently at the basal second internode bsi above the soil surface in xinjiang fig s1 therefore the lodging rate lodging resistance mechanical properties stem lignin content and stem pole substantial degree were measured on the bsi at the grain filling stage in this experiment 2 2 1 stalk bending strength sbs and rind penetration strength rps sbs was measured according to the method of peng et al 2014 with a stalk strength tester yyd 1 hangzhou top instrument co ltd hangzhou china for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s seven continuously grown wheat plants in each row were harvest and the main stem of each plant was selected for measurement of sbs and rps the overall sbs or rps of each pattern was then mean of from all rows the sample bsi with sheath were put on the groove of support pillars with a distance of 5 cm the sbs test probe of the stalk strength tester provides force in the direction perpendicular to each stalk until the bsi was broken fig s2 the peak force to bend or break the stalk was defined as sbs n the rps was measured according to the method of ma et al 2018 with a few modifications bsi with sheath of each samples was put on the groove of support pillars with a distance of 0 5 cm the rind penetration strength test probe of the stalk strength tester was slowly inserted into the stalk of bsi fig s2 the peak force to penetrate the stalk was defined as the rps n the lodging rate of different wheat rows was calculated using eq 1 1 the lodging rate number of lodging plants total plants 100 the lodging plants are defined when the angle between plant and the ground is less than or equal to 45 keller et al 1999 number of lodging and non lodging plants were counted in 1 m length of each row in each replicate of each treatment 2 2 2 stem pole substantial degree spsd and stem lignin content slc for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s seven representative uniform wheat plants in each row were selected for measurements of spsd and slc length of bsi was measured with a ruler before being put into paper bags the internodes were enzyme deactivated at 105 c for 30 min followed by being dried at 80 c to a constant weight the spsd g cm 1 of bsi was calculated by dividing the dry weight g by length cm of the internode peng et al 2014 wang et al 2015a the overall spsd of each pattern was the mean all rows in addition the slc of bsi was determined according to wang et al 2015a half gram of culm samples was homogenized with a pestle in a mortar with an ethanol solution containing 4 ml of 95 v v following homogenization the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 2600 g after extracted with two successive 2 h extraction in 4 ml of 95 v v ethanol at 80 the sediments were extracted with another two successive 1 h extraction using 4 ml of concentrated ethanol in hexane 1 2 v v at 62 sediments were then dried for 2 days at 50 a 3 6 ml solution of 25 v v acetyl bromide in acetic acid was added to dried sediments following being incubated at 70 c in a water bath for 0 5 h half ml extract was mixed with 0 9 ml of 2 mol l 1 naoh and 5 ml acetic acid meanwhile 0 1 ml 7 5 mol l 1 hydroxylamine hydrochloride was applied to terminate the reaction the final volume was adjusted to 15 ml using acetic acid and the measurement of absorbance at a280 was performed by a spectrophotometer uv 5800pc shanghai china the overall slc of each pattern was the mean of all rows 2 2 3 the net photosynthetic rate spad height and angle of flag leaf for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s three representative uniform wheat plants in each row were selected for measurements of photosynthesis spad soil and plant analyzer development value as indicator of chlorophyll content leaf height and angle at the grain filling stage photosynthesis was measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor inc ne usa at a light intensity of 1700 μmol photon m 2 s 1 under uniform conditions 400 500 μmol co2 mol 1 spad value was measured using a chlorophyll meter spad 502plus konica minolta inc japan the height and angle of flag leaf were determined using a ruler and protractor according to liu et al 2009 specifically photosynthesis spad height and angle of flag leaf and height of stem gravity center were not measured due to severe lodging in 2019 the overall net photosynthetic rate spad value height and angle of flag leaf of each pattern were the corresponding means all rows 2 2 4 height of stem gravity center hgc for each wheat row in each planting pattern of each replicate r1 and r2 for tr4 r1 r2 and r3 for tr6 tr6l and tr6s r1 r2 r3 and r4 for tr8 tr8l and tr8s three representative uniform wheat plants in each row were selected and the main stems were taken for measurement of hgc following to the method of liang et al 2017 the positioning of hgc was shown in fig s3 and the distance cm between the hgc point and the stem base was the value of hgc 2 3 statistical analysis data from the different years 2019 2020 and 2021 were analyzed separately our random factors were different planting patterns and different wheat rows in the same patterns among them data analysis of the conventional planting pattern of tr4 r1 and r2 used the independent sample t test other planting patterns were submitted to one way analysis of variance anova followed by lsd test at p 0 05 to test the differences between different planting patterns and different rows using the software spss 18 0 in addition the data analysis was performed on the performance of lodging rate under all factors including rs tr ls and brs the f value is the statistic value of the f test and the larger the f value indicate the more significant the difference between the data groups being compared finally path analysis was taken to elucidate the contributions of all measured indicators to lodging resistance the path analysis was performed using the stepwise regression analysis module of the spss 18 0 the stepwise regression analysis was firstly conducted in which lodging rate was taken as dependent variable y and all other indicators e g rps sbs spsd slc and spad et al as independent variables x according to the model with the largest r2 in stepwise regression we select the direct and indirect influencing factors e g rps in fig 6 that affect the lodging rate to further explore which factor affect rps we again set rps as the dependent variable y and all other indicators e g sbs spsd spsd sbs npr etc as independent variables x for stepwise regression analysis after the data analysis results were generated we selected the model with the highest r2 to screen for factors affecting rps directly or indirectly for example the spsd and sbs are the most direct factors affecting rps in this experiment by analogy with this method we have researched and sorted out the logical relationship of mutual influence between all indicators in this experiment the results of the stepwise analysis were then illustrated in charts generated with the origin 9 software systat software inc san jose california usa 3 results 3 1 overall lodging rate of different planting patterns lodging rate of spring wheat in the conventional planting pattern of tr4 was 42 41 2019 14 07 2020 and 7 22 2021 respectively table 1 normally els to 90 cm tr6 and 120 cm tr8 without narrowing rs significantly increased lodging rate in relation to tr4 however nrs from 15 cm to 10 cm leaving large brs from 15 cm to 35 cm tr6l and 45 cm tr8l significantly reduced lodging rate as compared with both tr4 and the corresponding normal patterns of tr6 and tr8 in all three growth seasons in addition nrs incorporation with shortened brs from 15 cm to 25 cm tr6s and tr8s also showed lower lodging rate than tr4 and significantly lower than the corresponding normal els patterns of tr6 and tr8 this could be further proved by the field lodging resistance performance of different planting patterns as shown in fig 1 data analysis was performed on the performance of lodging rate under all factors including rs tr ls brs treated in the experiment table 2 the results showed that there was no significant difference in the lodging rate of wheat under the change of rs 10 cm and 15 cm although enlarging tr can improved the lodging rate of wheat the difference is not significant in most cases this is understandable since brs was found to have the greatest impact on the lodging rate with the highest f value 82 160 101 104 and significant difference in the lodging rate p 0 001 on this basis the lodging rate of enlarged tr planting patterns with brs effect can be effectively reduced to a certain extent additionally enlarging ls remarkably increased the lodging rate of wheat in most cases which was also verified by the performance of wheat canopy lodging at the filling stage of different planting systems fig 1 notably despite the extremely significant difference in the lodging rate of wheat under different ls p 0 001 the f value 5 282 10 826 was far lower than that of brs 82 160 101 104 therefore in this experiment brs effect figured prominently in the improvement of the wheat lodging resistance under drip irrigation system 3 2 the lodging rate between rows under different planting patterns in the normal rs drip irrigation patterns of tr4 tr6 and tr8 the lodging rate generally increased outwardly from r1 the 1strow adjacent to the drip tube to the outermost row r2 for tr4 r3 for tr6 and r4 for tr8 fig 2 especially for r3 in tr6 tr8 and for r4 in tr8 lodging rate dramatically increased as compared with r1 and r2 however nrs incorporation with large brs tr6l tr8l or shortened brs patterns tr6s tr8s much lower lodging rate in the outermost row r3 for tr6l and tr6s r4 for tr8l and tr8s than the corresponding r1 and r2 moreover tr6l and tr8l showed lower lodging rate of r3 and r4 in paralleling with the lowered overall lodging performance than the corresponding shortened brs patterns of tr6s and tr8s therefore nrs oriented border rows with broadened brs effectively reduced lodging rate of plants distant to drip tube which essentially contributed to the improved overall lodging resistance 3 3 the changes in the mechanical properties of stems the stem mechanical properties of sbs and rps of tr4 did not differ significantly between rows fig 3 in the normal els planting patterns of tr6 and tr8 however sbs and rps decreased outwardly from r1 and with a sharp drop from r2 to r3 and r4 reversely sbs and rps of tr6s tr8s tr6l and tr8l were much higher r3 and r4 than the corresponding r1 and r2 therefore nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s effectively improved wheat stem mechanical strength at the border rows which could enhance the overall lodging resistance of the modified els planting pattern 3 4 the changes in stem lignin content slc and stem pole substantial degree spsd similar to the stem mechanical properties slc and spsd in wheat stem decreased outwardly from r1 to the outermost rows in the normal els planting patterns of tr6 and tr8 fig 4 however in the modified els patterns of tr6s tr6l tr8s and tr8l the slc and spsd of the border rows were much higher than the corresponding r1 and r2 the increased slc and spsd in stems of the border rows would benefit the improved stem mechanical properties which further confer lodging resistance in the nrs els patterns with large brs 3 5 the changes in wheat canopy structure and photosynthetic performance of flag leaf as shown in fig 5a there are significant differences in the flag leaf height lh of wheat normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 shown the same trend as tr4 with lh showing a gradient decrease from r1 to the farthest row and in most cases there is a significant difference between rows only except for the non significant difference in lh between r2 and r3 of tr8 in 2020 tr8 however nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s effectively alleviate the decrease in lh of the farthest wheat rows under the normal wheat row spacing 15 cm of drip irrigation patterns tr4 tr6 and tr8 the la of wheat between rows was not significantly different except for the significant lower la of tr6 in r3 than in the inner row in 2020 and the significant lower la of tr8 in r3 and r4 than in the inner row in 2020 fig 5b reducing the row spacing is beneficial to increase the la of farthest row wheat the la of the farthest row r3 of tr6l and tr6s was significantly higher than that of r1 and r2 the la of wheat in the farthest row r4 of tr8l and tr8s was also significantly higher than that of r1 all drip irrigation patterns showed a decreasing trend in the spad from the inner row r1 to the farthest row fig 5c among them the spad differences between rows were not significant in tr4 however all els patterns tr6 tr6l tr6s tr8 tr8l and tr8s significantly reduced the spad of the farthest wheat rows but compared with normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s effectively reduced the degree of spad decrease in the farthest wheat rows the flag leaf net photosynthetic rate npr between rows of tr4 was not significantly fig 5d however npr of normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 decreased gradually from r1 to the farthest row with significantly lower npr in the farthest row compared to r1 similar to the changes in lh and la between rows nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s significantly increased npr in the farthest row 3 6 the results of path analysis to investigate the logical relationship between all the lodging resistance measurement indicators in the experiment path analysis was performed based on all the data fig 6 the results showed that rps had the most direct effect on wheat lodging rate with direct path coefficients above 0 9 in both years sbs and spsd all had a direct effect on rps with the direct path coefficient of sbs being greater than that of spsd this suggests that the mechanical properties of stems rps and sbs are the most direct indicator affecting wheat lodging rate furthermore wheat slc was found to have a direct impact on spsd indicating that an increase in slc is beneficial for improving spsd and enhancing the mechanical properties of stems thereby positively affecting wheat lodging resistance additionally the analysis of direct and indirect path coefficients revealed that npr is directly or indirectly affected by slc and spsd which in turn affect the mechanical properties of stems sbs and rps moreover although the positions of the lh and hgc for 2020 and 2021 change in the path analysis diagram but overall the npr of wheat is directly or indirectly influenced by changes in lh la and hgc this confirms our findings that the nrs els patterns with border rows tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s broaden the growing space for wheat plant in distant row contribute to improved the canopy structure of distant row wheat by increasing the lh and la has a positive effect on npr the increased in npr of distant row wheat promotes the slc which in turn directly affects the stem mechanical properties of lodging resistance especially rps by enhancing the spsd ultimately this effectively reduces the lodging rate of wheat in this experiment spad was negatively affect wheat lodging resistance but to a lesser extent 4 discussion drip irrigation is currently the most water saving irrigation technology which has been well adopted in the arid and semi arid areas especially in xinjiang the north west china chen et al 2015 lv et al 2019 wan et al 2022 unlike the large size broad rs field crops such as maize and cotton and fruit trees in which one drip tube usually serves only one or two rows of crops in the small size with relatively narrow rs commonly 15 cm and densely planting crop of wheat one drip tube has to serve four rows of wheat plants drip tube to row number ratio of 4 tr4 due to very limited transporting distance of drip irrigated water chen et al 2015 and the concern of cost of drip tubes lv et al 2019 to reduce the drip tube cost we endeavored to develop the els planting patterns for drip irrigated wheat in recent years we suggested that els patterns by nrs which leaved border rows with broadened border row space brs were potential profitable drip irrigation patterns with close productivity with much lower drip tube input as compared with the traditional tr4 pattern wan et al 2022 it is very interesting that these modified els patterns tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s owning border rows not only significantly improved economic benefits wan et al 2022 but also showed much stronger resistance to lodging than tr4 as shown in the present study fig 1 this confers promising and prospective solutions for drip irrigation wheat production towards high yield low input and low risks of grain yield fluctuation since very strong convective weathers with frequently heavy winds dominate the whole growth period which result in severe yield losses in xinjiang li et al 2017a b liang et al 2017 men et al 2014 acreche slafer 2011 further analysis found that the border row space effect played an important role in improving the lodging resistance of wheat in drip irrigation system in this experiment table 2 the lodging resistance was essentially improved on plants at the border rows or the outermost rows most distant to the drip tube fig 2 which eventually contributed to the overall lodging resistance improved of nrs incorporation with large brs tr6l tr8l or shortened brs patterns tr6s tr8s table 1 considering the obvious broad brs or large space between the most distant rows to the drip tube resulted from the narrowed row space in the els patterns vs the even row space in tr4 tr6 and tr8 the so called border effects were assumed to contribute to the enhanced plant lodging resistance of the outermost rows the healthier plants grown under abundant conditions were firstly assumed to contribute to the improved lodging resistance of the outermost rows or the border rows in the nrs els patterns the border effects usually refer to better growth status and higher productive of the marginal plants due to less competitions of resources such as space above ground radiation and co2 and soil water and nutrient than the inner row plants wang et al 2015b gao et al 2013 ayisi et al 1997 wheat plants at the border rows were more productive wan et al 2022 wang et al 2015b than the inner row plants in the wide narrow row mixed patterns the border plants were usually stronger with larger size fan et al 2012 wan et al 2022 wang et al 2015b more tillers and accumulation of dry matters fan et al 2012 wan et al 2022 and subsequently would confer improved resistance to lodging fan et al 2012 here the modified els patterns by nrs leaved broadened inter block or border row space of 35 cm 45 cm and 25 cm for tr6l tr8l and both tr6s and tr8s respectively fig 1 this allowed wheat of the outermost or most distant rows to the drip tube to access to better ventilation co2 and light conditions wan et al 2022 wang et al 2015b which favored accumulation of photo assimilates and growth of plants wan et al 2022 fan et al 2012 here the border row plants of the nrs els patterns had higher flag leaf height and larger flag leaf angle than inner row plants figs 5a b also shown in fig s4 which would facilitate the light interception by the canopy truong et al 2015 betsabe et al 2017 this of course would lead to better leaf photosynthetic performance gaju et al 2014 nehe et al 2020 and deposit of photo assimilates which was proved in the present study that flag photosynthetic rate fig 5d and biomass wan et al 2022 were much higher in the outermost rows of the nrs els patterns than the normal els patterns and tr4 the improved accumulation of photosynthetic assimilates would allow enough carbohydrates to be transported and converted into the filling substances or the structural substances in internodes to construct stronger stems of the border plants fan et al 2012 yang et al 2020 wan et al 2022 the substances include cellulose hemicellulose and lignin et al which are essentially beneficial to strong stems and lodging resistance xue et al 2016 yang et al 2020 this well agreed our findings here that the filling degree of stem as exemplified by the increased slc and the spsd was much higher in the outermost rows in the nrs els patterns than the normal even row space patterns fig 4 moreover both stem lignin content and spsd were higher which indicated stronger border effects in the larger brs patterns of tr6l and tr8l than the relatively shortened brs patterns of tr6s and tr8s this further proved the positive border effects on construction of strong straws of the outermost rows to resist lodging of plants in the nrs els patterns in addition the contribution rate of photoassimilates temporarily stored in vegetative organs a large proportion from stems and sheathes before anthesis which was redistributed to grain after anthesis was much higher in plants of the outermost rows in the normal els patterns to better cope with the more severe water deficit in relation to the border rows in the nrs els patterns wan et al 2020 this could further reduce the substrates for synthesis of the filling substances in stems which consequently led to weakened straws in the outermost rows of the normal els patterns as compared with the border rows in the nrs els patterns as shown in the present study fig 4 there is no doubt that well filled straws gain better mechanical properties to better resist plant lodging in crops fan et al 2012 high contents of cellulose semi cellulose and lignin positively correlate to mechanical strength toughness and elasticity of stems in wheat berry et al 2003 chen et al 2011 ma 2009 and other crops yang et al 2020 xue et al 2016 here both sbs and rps of wheat stems were much higher in the border rows of the nrs els patterns than the corresponding outermost rows distant to drip tube in the normal els patterns tr6l tr6s vs tr6 tr8l tr8s vs tr8 as shown in fig 3 in addition sbs and rps of the border rows were high in the large brs 45 cm than the modified shortened brs 25 cm els patterns fig 1 indicating that broader brs conferred stronger border effects on mechanical properties and lodging resistant capacity further path analysis well agreed with the above conclusions fig 6 the nrs els patterns well increased the lh and la the hgc of plants at the border rows rows most distant to the drip tube which allowed the plants to better intercept radiation as compared with the outermost rows in the normal els patterns in combination with the increased spad the npr was improved to contribute to the slc which further enhanced the spsd in the modified els patterns thereafter the mechanical properties of the sbs and especially the rps were improved to enhance the resistance to lodging by the border effects moreover the border effects also regulated the morphology of wheat plants at the border rows of the modified els patterns such as hgc table s1 hgc is an important factor affecting lodging resistance and lower hgc usually allows the stem to support heavier head and thus is commonly required for lodging resistant varieties liang et al 2017 in wheat production exogenous plant growth inhibitors are usually applied to lower down hgc of plants pinthus 1974 rajala et al 2002 tripathi et al 2003 zhang et al 2001 magome et al 2004 iqbal ashraf 2013 this was in disagreement with our present results that hgc of the border rows in the nrs els patterns was much higher than the corresponding outermost rows of the normal els patterns r3 in tr6l tr6s vs tr6 and r3 r4 in tr8l and tr8s vs tr8 table s1 of course this further proved that the border effects resulted in much stronger plants with higher biomass and larger size height of plants to achieve both higher productivity and stronger resistance to lodging in the nrs els patterns than the normal even row space patterns of tr4 tr6 and tr8 we also further analyzed the relationship between lodging performance and irrigation water evenness for different planting patterns as shown by previous studies the difference in the received irrigation water riw between rows of tr4 was minimal and the water uniformity between rows was the highest the coefficient of variation between rows in riw was only 3 60 6 77 wan et al 2022 els decreased the uniformity of moisture among which the riw of the normal els patterns tr6 and tr8 showed a gradient decrease from the inner rows to outer rows with the worst moisture uniformity the coefficient of variation between rows in riw was 59 09 75 65 wan et al 2022 that is to say wheat plants far from the drip tube could easily suffer from a certain water deficit under normal els patterns which often leads to weaker wheat stalks this explains its wheat lodging rate trend of an increase from the inner rows to outer rows in comparison to normal els patterns nrs els patterns tr6l tr6s tr8l and tr8s made all wheat rows closer to the drip tube and the water uniformity increased wan et al 2022 this could help explain the lower lodging rate of nrs els patterns than normal els patterns to a certain extent notably the riw in outer rows was lower than inner rows under nrs els patterns but the lodging resistance in outer rows was significantly higher than inner rows fig 2 indicating that the improvement of lodging resistance in nrs els patterns is mainly related to border effects therefore nrs incorporation via nrs with brs that can be recommended as cultivation measures to improve the lodging resistance ability of drip irrigation wheat in combination with performances of overall grain yield and economic benefits the tr6s has a satisfactory yield and the highest economic benefit wan et al 2022 then tr6s was strongly recommended as the local drip irrigated wheat patterns with both high yield and profit and less risk of yield loss due to lodging 5 conclusion the nrs led broadened brs effectively reduced lodging rate of wheat plants in the els drip irrigation patterns as result of the essentially improved lodging resistance of plants at the border rows the modified morphology including height and angle of flag leaf and height of stem gravity center and flag leaf spad value by border effects allowed the outermost wheat plants to intercept more radiation which further promoted photosynthetic capacity meanwhile lignin accumulation and the filling degree or the pole substantial degree of the basal internodes were increased by the border effects to facilitate the construction of the mechanical properties and finally improved the lodging resistance of wheat plants at the border rows in the modified els patterns providing high grain yield and economic profit as revealed in previous study wan et al 2022 and low risk of yield loss due to lodging the tr6s pattern was recommended as promised drip irrigation
