22390,the effective wave slope is a fundamental concept in simplified 1 dof roll models and predicted roll motion strongly depends on the assumed effective wave slope coefficient this is relevant to regulatory frameworks based on 1 dof roll models such as imo weather criterion or the under development second generation intact stability criteria the paper examines different methods for effective wave slope coefficient prediction which could potentially be used for intact stability assessment of river sea ships in fact there is a lack of studies specifically addressing this type of vessels a database of existing inland and river sea vessels is used for determining the effective wave slope coefficient by the considered methods and results are compared and discussed the used approaches comprise a direct calculation method based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamics methods based on froude krylov approximation and semi empirical methods obtained results suggest that the considered methods based on froude krylov approximation provide similar predictions for river sea ships and tend to be conservative in the vast majority of cases results also suggest that the considered semi empirical methods for effective wave slope coefficient prediction at natural roll frequency are unsuitable for river sea ships with a general tendency towards the overestimation keywords effective wave slope coefficient river sea ships roll motion second generation intact stability criteria weather criterion 1 introduction river sea ships are principally inland navigation vessels that make use of short but regular voyages in coastal areas it is therefore necessary to conduct a proper assessment of stability of river sea ships in maritime navigation however a common international regulatory framework for river sea ships does not exist bačkalov 2019 chatelier et al 2017 on the other hand because of their unconventional design in comparison to standard sea going ships the suitability of the present mandatory ship stability regulations laid out in imo 2008 is code imo 2008a involving semi empirical and simplified analytical methods may not be appropriate a rational solution could be possibly found in the application of the methods under development in the framework of second generation intact stability criteria sgisc to river sea ships with some modifications reflecting the specific design and operational features of this type of vessels see rudaković and bačkalov 2019 an important step in the assessment of ship safety in rough weather in intact condition is to properly account for roll excitation moment induced by waves as the fluid ship interaction is complex the concept of effective wave slope coefficient was developed as a simplification tool to be embedded in approaches for roll motion prediction based on 1 dof roll modelling in the past the effective wave slope coefficient was usually considered only at natural roll frequency e g blume 1979 fujino et al 1993 imo 2008a b yamagata 1959 or in regions of frequency close to the roll natural frequency e g francescutto et al 2001 francescutto and serra 2002 however in the sgisc framework a frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient is necessary in a wide range of frequencies when applying the level 2 vulnerability assessment approach for dead ship condition imo 2016 2017 to this end a simplified approach was proposed within sgisc imo method hereinafter which accounts for froude krylov roll moment only and where ship sections at different longitudinal positions as an approximation are substituted by rectangles imo 2016 2017 at the same time other approaches based on froude krylov assumption which are able to more accurately account for the exact hull shape by direct pressure integration are also readily available and simple to implement such approaches are either based on a 3d panelling of the hull surface or on a strip theory approximation it is also noted that direct froude krylov pressure integration for the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient is also presently considered as a possible calculation option within the draft sgisc framework imo 2017 in this context umeda et al 2007 suggested that the simplified froude krylov approach based on rectangular approximation of ship sections could provide acceptable results in terms of capsizing probability predictions when compared with other methods however due to the importance of the effective wave slope coefficient it is reasonable to consider also more advanced and more precise methods possibly based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamic in this respect mizuno 1973 1975 formulated the frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient from the coupled linear roll sway dynamical system taking into account all mechanic and hydrodynamic terms in the 2 dof dynamical system the results reported by mizuno 1973 1975 considering both calculations and experiments appear to indicate that the effective wave slope calculated according to the froude krylov approximation tends to be conservative leading to overestimation of roll motion when used in numerical predictions at the same time results by mizuno 1973 1975 indicate that the froude krylov approximation for the effective wave slope coefficient is appropriate in the region of low frequencies i e for long waves and this is in line with the indications from umeda and tsukamoto 2008 who made reference for the same purpose to the study by tasai 1965 an approach for the determination of frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient accounting for the 3 dof linear sway roll yaw coupling was presented by bulian et al 2008 2009 bulian and francescutto 2009 míguez gonzalez and bulian 2018 this latter approach which is one of the approaches that are going to be used in the present paper accounts for the coupling of roll with both sway and yaw but it is an approximate method because it neglects the effect of damping nevertheless experimental results reported by bulian and francescutto 2009 and bulian et al 2009 indicate that the approach is capable to provide the effective wave slope coefficient with sufficient accuracy for the prediction of roll amplitude in beam waves the focus of this paper will be on the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient for inland river sea ships which are characterised by full hull forms long parallel middle bodies and large breadth to draught ratios in addition such ships may have high position of centre of gravity above the waterline compared to the ship draught to the authors best knowledge there seems to be no systematic studies on effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships available in literature nevertheless in the past studies were carried out for other types of vessels sharing some of the characteristics of the ships considered herein fujino et al 1993 investigated the effective wave slope coefficient in case of small craft with large breadth and shallow draught they determined the effective wave slope coefficient from experiments measurement in regular beam waves of wave exciting roll moment or resonant roll angle and from calculations based on froude krylov approximation and they compared the results with the predictions from the formula in the present weather criterion imo 2008a they found that the formula from the weather criterion significantly overestimated both the results obtained from experiments and also the results obtained from froude krylov calculations particularly for conditions with high position of centre of gravity above the waterline fujino et al 1993 also noticed that the effective wave slope coefficient from the froude krylov approach had a tendency to overestimate the values obtained from experimental measurement of wave exciting roll moment with models fixed in roll and with unconstrained sway and heave in beam waves on the completely opposite side of the spectrum of vessels size francescutto et al 2001 and francescutto and serra 2002 studied the effective wave slope coefficient for the case of large passenger ships which are also characterised by large breadth to draught ratios and high position of centre of gravity above the waterline in proportion to the draught they determined the effective wave slope coefficient from the analysis of experimental resonant roll motion in regular beam waves and they also found that the formula from the weather criterion imo 2008a systematically overestimated the effective wave slope coefficient obtained from the analysis of experiments the overestimation tendency of weather criterion formula was also confirmed by the experimental tests on two dimensional models by sato et al 2008 while the focus of this paper is on roll excitation in beam waves it is worth mentioning also some works that although being related to surf riding share some conceptual similarities with the present study specifically begovic et al 2018 feng et al 2015 2017 and umeda et al 2015 analysed the effect of taking into account the diffraction component of the surge force in the assessment of surf riding inception in comparison to the use of froude krylov force only with reference to the framework of sgisc all mentioned studies concur in concluding that the use of the froude krylov approximation for the surge force neglecting diffraction effects provides conservative outcomes with specific reference to inland vessels and river sea ships the overall goal of this paper is to provide a better insight into some of the existing methods for effective wave slope coefficient prediction and to identify what type of approach may be considered more suitable for intact stability assessment of river sea ships when using simplified methods as those within the sgisc framework therefore first the methods considered in this study are described in section 2 with the associated appendix a then section 3 and the associated appendix b provide an overview of the developed database of 31 inland vessels or river sea ships which are used in section 4 for the systematic comparisons among different effective wave slope coefficient prediction methods three specific vessels have been selected from the existing database and are used in section 4 for reporting more in depth analyses and comparisons finally a summary of the obtained results a series of concluding remarks and possible directions for future work are provided in section 5 for all the quantities in the paper the si system of units is used 2 effective wave slope coefficient definition and prediction methods in general the effective wave slope coefficient at a generic wave frequency ω can be defined as 1 r ω m r o l l δ g m k w a w where m roll is the amplitude of a properly defined wave induced roll moment δ is the displacement force g m is the metacentric height k w is the wave number and a w is the wave amplitude the specific definition of m roll depends on the method used for the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient as discussed in the following sections irrespective of the calculation method the effective wave slope function r ω shows some characteristic properties the low frequency limit is lim ω 0 r ω 1 whereas the high frequency limit is lim ω r ω 0 usually r ω can be expected to be in the range between 0 and 1 however in some cases the effective wave slope function may also exceed 1 in some ranges of frequencies as it can happen for small metacentric heights at relatively high frequencies according to 1 the frequencies where r ω 0 correspond to the frequencies where m roll 0 for conventional hull shapes and loading conditions the natural frequency is typically between ω 0 and the first minimum or first zero of r ω an example of the behaviour of the effective wave slope function r ω is shown in fig 1 for a conventional hull the considered vessel is the duisburg test case dtc containership el moctar et al 2012 for a realistic loading condition the figure shows r ω as calculated by the reduced 3dof method and by the 3d panel method which are described hereinafter in section 2 1 and in section 2 2 respectively the roll natural frequency ω φ reported in the figure has been determined as described hereinafter in section 2 1 for the example in fig 1 linear hydrodynamics data for the reduced 3dof method and for the determination of ω φ have been calculated with an in house linear seakeeping code bulian and francescutto 2009 based on stf strip theory salvesen et al 1970 and frank close fit method frank 1967 from equation 1 it can be seen that the problem of prediction of the effective wave slope coefficient comes down to the problem of calculation of the amplitude of a properly defined roll moment m roll the paper therefore addresses the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient considering a series of different methods namely predictions using direct calculations based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamics hereinafter shortly reduced 3dof approach predictions based on linear froude krylov approximation predictions using semi empirical methods the considered methods are described in detail in the following sections 2 1 direct calculation based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamics reduced 3dof approach direct calculation in this paper is carried out by means of a linear hydrodynamic approach following bulian et al 2008 and bulian and francescutto 2009 the starting point is the classical linear seakeeping frequency domain 3 dof model for sway roll yaw 2 m a ω x b ω x c x f ˆ ω where m is the mass matrix a is the added mass matrix b is the damping matrix c is the restoring matrix f ˆ is the vector of complex generalised forces ω is the wave frequency x is the complex state vector and dots indicate time derivatives the method is based on the derivation of a single 1 dof equation for roll implicitly embedding the coupling with sway and yaw but omitting the effect of damping this approximation was used in the past although for different purposes by hutchison 1991 and by naciri and lledo 2001 who considered the case of coupled sway roll dynamics neglecting also the coupling with yaw by removing the damping matrix b equation 2 becomes 3 q ω x c x f ˆ ω with q ω m a ω the system 3 corresponds to the following set of three equations 4 q 22 y q 24 φ q 26 ψ f ˆ 2 q 42 y q 44 φ q 46 ψ c 44 φ f ˆ 4 q 62 y q 64 φ q 66 ψ f ˆ 6 where subscript indices refer to the standard 6 dof linear seakeeping nomenclature for anti symmetric motions 2 sway 4 roll 6 yaw the roll degree of freedom in system 4 can be virtually decoupled by variables substitutions in order to obtain a single equation containing only roll as explicit state variable but still preserving the effects of coupling with sway and yaw motion as described in detail in appendix a the resulting 1 dof roll equation has the following familiar form 5 i 44 c ω φ c 44 φ f ˆ 4 c ω where the roll moment in complex notation is bulian et al 2008 bulian and francescutto 2009 6 f ˆ 4 c f ˆ 4 f ˆ 2 q 42 q 66 q 46 q 62 f ˆ 6 q 42 q 26 q 46 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 the effective wave slope coefficient r ω can eventually be obtained by substituting the modulus of f ˆ 4 c for m r o l l in 1 it is important to highlight that the result is independent from the arbitrarily chosen centre of reference system used for the seakeeping computations the model 5 can also be used to estimate the undamped natural roll frequency of the ship ω φ as the solution of the following equation 7 ω φ c 44 i 44 c ω φ with i 44 c ω φ q 44 q 42 q 24 q 66 q 64 q 26 q 46 q 24 q 62 q 64 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 where q i j q i j ω φ i j 2 4 6 details of the derivation of 5 6 and 7 are reported in appendix a which also reports an analysis of the effectiveness of the reduced 3dof modelling compared to other modelling for the roll moment considered herein it is noted at this point that also tasai 1971 addressed the problem of the determination of the undamped natural roll frequency of the coupled sway roll yaw linear model and he also used the approximation of neglecting the effect of damping although the derivation procedures herein and by tasai 1971 are different the final results are equivalent and the undamped natural roll frequencies determined by 7 and by equation a 10 of tasai 1971 coincide 2 2 linear froude krylov approach es this approach in line with the linear approximation determines the roll moment by direct integration of undisturbed wave pressure on the wetted surface i e froude krylov roll moment of a fixed hull considering beam monochromatic waves the moment is calculated with respect to the centre of gravity g and it can be formally written as follows 8 m f k g s x x g p n d s where x x g is the radius vector from g to the generic point on the hull surface s p is the undisturbed wave pressure and n is unitary normal vector of s pointing to the fluid as the approach is linear the integration is carried out on the wetted hull surface in calm water in time domain m fk g is a sinusoidal function of time for an incident monochromatic wave for the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient the amplitude of m fk g is substituted for m roll in 1 in case the calculation is carried out equivalently in frequency domain m fk g in 8 corresponds to the phasor of the froude krylov moment and its modulus is substituted for m roll in 1 the distinctive positive characteristic of this method is that it is very simple to be implemented the main drawback is associated with the fact that this approach totally neglects diffraction effects and effects associated with coupling from other relevant motions sway and yaw the linear froude krylov method can be implemented using various approaches which in practice differ in the way of describing the hull shape for carrying out the integration in 1 the methods used in the present work are explained in the following the most precise froude krylov method is based on the accounting for the exact three dimensional shape of the hull the hull is then discretised by a finite number of polygonal in this paper triangular panels allowing to accurately describe also complex hull shapes see fig 2 each panel is associated to a relevant set of particulars area centroid position and unitary normal vector which are used to determine the froude krylov roll moment using the discretisation of 8 this method provides an accurate estimation of the froude krylov excitation a less precise method is based on the strip theory approximation which however can make effective use of the classical simplified representation of vessels through sections in this approach as usual the integral 8 is approximated by an integration of roll moments calculated for 2d sections along the hull to determine the sectional roll moment each hull section is discretised with a finite number of 2d linear panels see fig 3 which are then used for determining froude krylov forces and moments acting on each panel each panel is defined with a set of particulars length centroid position and unit normal vector the summation of contributions from each panel in the section provides the sectional roll moment the drawback of this method is that it does not account for the exact three dimensional hull shape but rather uses the strip theory approximation to obtain the total froude krylov roll moment nevertheless the strip method can be expected to provide results that are close to those obtained from the 3d panel method for hull shapes having high values of longitudinal prismatic coefficient c p a further simplification is applied in the method proposed by imo imo method in the framework of second generation intact stability criteria for level 2 vulnerability assessment for dead ship condition imo 2017 the principle of the method is to transform each true hull section into an equivalent rectangular section keeping as far as possible the section breadth at waterline and the sectional underwater area see fig 4 this transformation allows using the exact analytical solution for the sectional froude krylov wave moment of rectangular sections instead of requiring the panelisation of the true section the total wave moment is then obtained following the strip theory approach by integration of sectional wave moments over the ship length a first version of this simplified methodology was presented by umeda and tsukamoto 2008 however since ship sections are in general not rectangular in some cases the imo methodology may provide poor approximations of the true froude krylov roll moment conversely the imo method can be expected to provide better approximations for full hull forms having high vertical prismatic coefficient c vp as well as high longitudinal prismatic coefficient c p 2 3 semi empirical methods in general semi empirical methods for effective wave slope coefficient estimation are easy to use but strictly speaking their prediction accuracy is limited to hull forms which do not significantly differ from those used in the development of the method such methods are based on some form of regression of the effective wave slope coefficient and can be developed in principle from experimental data or from calculations of higher complexity and accuracy moreover in such methods the effective wave slope coefficient is typically provided at natural roll frequency only there is a limited number of semi empirical methods available in literature e g blume 1979 imo 2008a b watanabe 1938 yamagata 1959 and none of them to the authors best knowledge is intended to cover river sea ships the semi empirical prediction method proposed by blume 1979 provides the effective wave slope coefficient only at natural roll frequency the effective wave slope coefficient as a function of the non dimensional natural roll period according to blume 1979 is reconstructed in fig 5 in the figure the full line is the mean prediction curve corresponding to conventional at the time of development hull shapes and g m values and the dashed lines provide an indication of the prediction intervals on the horizontal axis of fig 5 t φ is the roll natural period b is the ship breadth and g is the gravitational acceleration another semi empirical method is given in the 2008 is code within the weather criterion imo 2008a as the weather criterion is designed to assess the ability of the ship to withstand the combined effect of wind gust and beam waves at resonance the effective wave slope coefficient for this purpose is estimated as in case of blume 1979 only at natural roll frequency as indicated in msc 1 circ 1281 imo 2008b the method derives from the work of watanabe 1938 with subsequent simplifications from yamagata 1959 more precisely watanabe 1938 developed an approximate formula based on froude krylov calculations assuming trochoidal waves for simplified hull shapes with the effective wave slope coefficient formula depending on a set of influential parameters wave length vertical position of centre of gravity metacentric height breadth draught block coefficient and water plane area coefficient a further simplification was then reported by yamagata 1959 having the following form 9 r 0 73 0 6 o g t which is the form presently used within the imo weather criterion in the expression 9 o g k g t is the vertical position of centre of gravity above the waterline and t is the ship draught yamagata 1959 reported a good agreement between formula 9 and results calculated for 60 actual ships using the approach by watanabe 1938 as reconstructed in fig 6 conversely results from fujino et al 1993 francescutto et al 2001 and francescutto and serra 2002 indicate that the semi empirical formula 9 can be conservative compared to experimental results or froude krylov calculations for vessels with large values of b t and or o g t 3 vessel database and loading conditions for the purpose of the present study a set of typical inland or river sea ships was selected for systematic calculation of effective wave slope coefficient as a function of frequency as well as at natural roll frequency using different methodologies for each vessel a range of operational conditions was considered in order to have a broad range of characteristic parameters an overview of the vessels particulars and principal dimensionless coefficients is given in appendix b in total 31 self propelled vessels were gathered comprising 23 tankers 4 general cargo vessels 3 container vessels and 1 lpg tanker it should be noted however that the hull shape and the dimensions of european inland vessels are not significantly influenced by the vessel type at the time of the analysis 2017 2018 most of the vessels were approximately from 5 to 10 years in service the typical propulsion arrangement consists of two propellers in stern tunnels as in figs 2 and 7 9 although some vessels in the database have a single screw for the purpose of the study three draughts were used for each vessel a maximum draught corresponding to the scantling draught a draught corresponding to the minimum draught enabling full immersion of the tunnels and an intermediate draught conventionally set as the average between the previous two all calculations were carried out for even keel condition i e zero trim regarding the loading conditions a wide range of tested k g was chosen so as to cover realistic loading conditions the minimum k g was taken about half of the scantling draught whereas the maximum k g corresponds to metacentric heights around 0 3 m 0 5 m depending on the vessel and draught for simplicity the range of k g was kept constant when varying the calculation draught the considered database eventually comprises a total of 567 vessel draught k g combinations for each vessel and loading condition in the database different dry roll radii of inertia k xx were considered corresponding to 0 25 b 0 3 b 0 35 b 0 4 b and 0 45 b the dry yaw radius of inertia k zz was kept constant and equal to 0 25 l wl therefore a total of 2835 vessel draught k g k xx combinations were considered furthermore for each vessel and condition the natural roll frequency ω φ was calculated according to 7 the length of the vessels ranges from 66 m for small inland navigation vessels up to 135 m corresponding to the largest contemporary inland self propelled vessels in western europe the vessels have full hull forms with block coefficients up to c b 0 92 due to long parallel middle bodies in combination with full midship coefficients c m typically exceeding 0 99 due to restrictions in waterway dimensions inland vessels have relatively small draught which is compensated with greater beam resulting in somewhat high b t ratios in the range of 2 5 4 5 for the scantling draught and much higher ratios for lower draughts furthermore more detailed calculation results are provided for three selected vessels their particulars and considered loading conditions are given in table 1 together with the roll natural frequencies ω φ according to 7 and the corresponding roll natural period t φ 2 π ω φ in addition the body plans of the sample vessels a b and c are reported in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the cross sections in the figures are equally spaced at 500 mm distance whereby station 0 represents the aftmost station 4 comparison of effective wave slope coefficient calculation methods in this section the methods described in section 2 are applied to the database of vessels described in section 3 and results of the predictions are compared the reduced 3dof method section 2 1 is assumed to be the most accurate among the considered methods because it better represents hydrodynamic effects within the limit of the considered approximations as described in appendix a for this reason it will therefore be used as reference in the comparisons hydrodynamic coefficients for the reduced 3dof method section 2 1 were determined for the vessels in the database by the strip theory code shipmopc version 3 5 8 with sectional calculations based on boundary element method mctaggart 1997 the 3d panel method section 2 2 was applied by discretizing the actual hull surface into approximately 5000 43000 panels depending on the size and complexity of a hull afterwards to increase the accuracy of numerical integration of 8 the mesh was refined through three sequential applications of regular refinement splitting of each triangle in four triangles using midpoints of edges the imo method section 2 2 was applied by using a total of 21 sections for each vessel representative examples of effective wave slope coefficients calculated with the three methods for the three sample vessels and associated loading condition given in table 1 are shown in figs 10 12 it can be noticed that for all three vessels the 3d panel method and the imo method which are both based on the froude krylov approximation provide very close results particularly for vessels b and c which have the largest c b and c p see table 1 the effective wave slope coefficient calculated by the reduced 3dof method tends to be smaller than that obtained by the other two methods for all three vessels as discussed hereinafter the tendencies observed for the three sample vessels will be confirmed by the behaviour observed for the whole database furthermore it is noted that qualitatively similar results were obtained in the past by mizuno 1973 1975 when he compared the effective wave slope coefficient based on linear froude krylov assumption and the effective wave slope coefficient calculated by using a coupled roll sway model based on linear hydrodynamics neglecting yaw but taking into accound the effect of linear damping his findings were also supported by experimental results figs 10 12 also show that the effective wave slope coefficient calculated with the exact froude krylov approach 3d panel and by considering hydrodynamic effects reduced 3dof while being noticeably different at the roll natural frequency tend to converge in the region of low frequencies this confirms the considerations of umeda and tsukamoto 2008 based on the work by tasai 1965 regarding the suitability of the froude krylov approximation in the range of long waves in order to represent the large dataset the first set of results will be presented herein in terms of percentile levels as obtained from the distribution of data in particular the data will be represented through 25 50 median and 75 percentiles in addition minimum and maximum values will also be reported to give an indication of the extremes the range between the 25 and the 75 percentiles is the interquartile range and it contains 50 of the data the original effective wave slope coefficient data were calculated as a function of the dimensional wave frequency ω the same set of calculation frequencies was used for all vessels from 0 1 rad s up to 4 0 rad s with constant steps of 0 1 rad s to better cover the low frequency range an additional calculation frequency was also considered at 0 05 rad s however in order to combine results from different vessels data have been eventually analysed as a function of the non dimensional wave number defined as follows 10 k ˆ k w b ω 2 b g as a result of the quadratic transformation from ω to k ˆ the available data are not uniformly distributed in terms of non dimensional wave number k ˆ moreover non dimensional wave numbers for which data are available do not coincide among different vessels unless the vessels have the same breadth therefore the distribution of data and the associated percentile levels were calculated using a sliding window technique where subsets of data are analysed for different intervals i e windows of k ˆ in this study the windows specified for the analysis are non overlapping and have adaptive widths which try to follow the distribution of data points with the aim of keeping a similar number of samples in each window fig 13 shows the number of data points within each window as a function of the centre of the window and the widths of the bins in the figure correspond to the widths of the corresponding windows used in the analysis it is underlined that the number of points in each window can exceed the total number of combinations vessel draught k g k xx i e 2835 see section 3 as data from multiple calculation frequencies can fall in the same window of analysis first fig 14 shows the analysis of data in terms of effective wave slope coeffcient as estimated by the reduced 3dof method as a function of k ˆ then the reduced 3dof approach is compared to two linear froude krylov methods the imo method and the 3d panel method both discussed in section 2 2 these analyses were carried out for all the vessel loading condition combinations 2835 in total described in section 3 the comparison is carried out by analysing differences as function of k ˆ between imo method and reduced 3dof method calculated as δ r k ˆ r i m o k ˆ r 3 d o f k ˆ with results shown in fig 15 and differences as function of k ˆ between 3d panel method and reduced 3dof method calculated as δ r k ˆ r 3 d p a n e l k ˆ r 3 d o f k ˆ with results shown in fig 16 it is noted that all considered methods in the present comparison are such that the effective wave slope coefficient tends to 1 0 as the frequency ω tends to zero therefore differences among methods for k ˆ 0 always tend to zero although calculations could not be numerically performed for exactly zero frequency for numerical reasons such theoretical limit was used in the reporting of results from the results in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that in general the imo method and the 3d panel method i e methods based on the froude krylov approximation can be considered to be more conservative than the reduced 3dof method having a tendency to a positive median in the difference with a maximum median difference of about 0 3 nevertheless there is a minor number of conditions where the imo and the 3d panel methods can estimate significantly smaller values of effective wave slope coefficient at some frequencies this can occur for low metacentric heights for frequencies significantly higher than typically realistic natural roll frequencies it can also occur for higher metacentric heights in the high frequency region as a result of the humps and hollows of the effective wave slope coefficient based on froude krylov approximation compared to the smoother behaviour of the effective wave slope coefficient based on the reduced 3dof method however these latter cases are generally associated with small effective wave slope coefficients the results of the difference between imo method and reduced 3dof method fig 15 are apparently similar to the corresponding results for the 3d panel method fig 16 therefore a comparison of results between 3d panel method and imo method has been performed for the overall database and the corresponding statistical analysis is shown in fig 17 the outcomes indicate that for the considered database of vessels and loading conditions these two methods provide a very close estimation of the frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient having maximum absolute value of median difference of about 0 015 and maximum interquartile range of about 0 025 moreover the overall bias difference between these two methods is very small with a tendency for the 3d panel method to predict slightly larger effective wave slope coefficients than the imo method in the range of low dimensionless wave numbers and with the opposite occurring in the range of high wave numbers the overall good matching between these two methods is a consequence of the full hull forms of river sea ships with long parallel middle bodies and high midship coefficients with vessels having such characteristics the sectional transformation performed by the imo methodology where actual sections are substituted by equivalent rectangles still provides a good matching between original and transformed sections these outcomes are actually in line with the example results obtained for the three sample vessels figs 10 12 where the 3d panel method and the imo method provide very close results for all vessels overall this implies that the imo method and the 3d panel method both of which are based on the linear froude krylov approach for the estimation of the effective wave coefficient can be expected to provide close results when applied to river sea ships further comparisons are carried out between the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency as estimated by the reduced 3dof method and by the two semi empirical methods discussed in section 2 3 blume method and imo weather criterion method in figs 18 and 19 the effective wave slope coefficients obtained by the reduced 3dof method at natural roll frequency are compared to the blume s curve the figures report information for the overall database and in addition they report also curves of effective wave slope coefficient for different dimensionless roll natural periods t φ g b for the sample vessels a b and c in the plotting of the curves for the three vessels in fig 18 the dry roll radius of inertia was kept constant for each vessel see table 1 whereas k g was varied for each vessel vessel a 2 5 m k g 4 5 m vessel b 2 5 m k g 5 0 m vessel c 2 0 m k g 4 0 m variation step δ k g 0 5 m for all vessels instead in fig 19 the k g of each vessel was kept constant see table 1 and the dry roll radius of inertia was varied for each vessel in the range 0 25 k x x b 0 45 with a variation step δ k x x b 0 05 for all vessels in accordance with the variation of k xx b for all the vessels in the database as discussed in section 3 results for the whole database in figs 18 and 19 indicate that the effective wave slope coefficient predicted by the blume s approach tends to be larger and thus conservative in comparison to results by the reduced 3dof method however the overall trends of the blume s method and the reduced 3dof method appears to be similar this is particularly well exemplified by the curves associated with the three sample vessels by considering both the results in fig 18 and in fig 19 for the three sample vessels it seems that the blume s trend better represents results from the reduced 3dof if it is assumed that k xx b increases when increasing k g in fig 20 a similar comparison for the overall database is presented but this time between the results obtained with the reduced 3dof method and with the imo weather criterion method see 9 it can be seen that the effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships at natural roll frequency predicted by the imo weather criterion formula significantly differs from the results obtained by the reduced 3dof method the comparisons appear to be worse than those reported in figs 18 and 19 for the blume method river sea ships have higher b t ratios than standard sea going ships and for high k g the ratio o g t can be significantly higher than the indicated applicability range of the imo weather criterion formula in fact the indicated ranges of applicability of imo weather criterion are b t 3 5 0 3 o g t 0 5 and roll period smaller than 20s imo 2008a having in mind the typical parameters of river sea ships see appendix b the disagreement between the results obtained by the imo weather criterion formula and the reduced 3dof method could have been expected moreover the effective wave slope coefficients predicted by the imo weather criterion formula appear to be unrealistic in the range of large o g t ratios these outcomes confirm the results obtained in the past for sea going vessels and also simplified two dimensional sections characterised by large values of b t and or o g t fujino et al 1993 francescutto et al 2001 francescutto and serra 2002 imo 2002 sato et al 2008 similarly to figs 18 and 19 fig 21 constant k xx b variable k g and fig 22 variable k xx b constant k g compare the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency from the 3dof method for the three sample vessels as function of o g t with predictions from imo weather criterion in fig 21 an almost linear increase of r ωφ is observed with the increase of o g t for constant k xx b and this is somehow in line with the weather criterion formula at least in terms of general qualitative trend considering both results from figs 21 and 22 it seems that also in this case the comparison may be improved if an increase of k g is assumed to be associated also with an increase of k xx b among the three sample vessels vessel a which is the one with the smallest b t ratio and the smallest c b and c p coefficients shows the best agreement with the imo weather criterion formula however considering the other two vessels and the overall database it appears that predictions of effective wave slope coefficient at the roll natural frequency according to imo weather criterion are unsuitable for river sea ships 5 summary conclusions and future work this study presented an investigation on the applicability of different methods for the effective wave slope coefficient prediction to river sea ships a proper determination of the effective wave slope coefficient is indeed of particular importance in intact stability assessment when roll motion is to be predicted on the basis of simplified 1 dof approaches this section provides a summary of the approach used in the study the main conclusions drawn from the analysis and some ideas for possible future work 5 1 summary several methods for prediction of effective wave slope coefficient either over a range of wave frequencies or at the natural roll frequency have been presented and compared in the typical beam waves condition a 3dof approach based on linear hydrodynamics which considers the coupling of sway and yaw with roll motion under the approximation of neglecting the effect of damping and provides a frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient reduced 3dof method section 2 1 two linear approaches taking into account froude krylov roll moment only one based on a direct 3d panelisation of the hull and one based on a strip theory approach where the hull sections are approximated by rectangular sections both providing a frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient 3d panel method and imo method respectively section 2 2 two semi empirical methods both estimating the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency only blume method and imo weather criterion method section 2 3 the methods are characterised by different levels of complexity and accuracy in addressing the underlying hydrodynamics the study was carried out on 31 self propelled inland or river sea vessels considering different loading conditions and mechanical characteristics which resulted in a total of 2835 examined vessel draught k g k xx combinations in addition more detailed results have been reported and discussed for three specific sample vessels from the presented database in the study the reduced 3dof method was considered as the method more faithfully representing the linear hydrodynamics of coupled sway roll yaw motion within the limits of the aforementioned approximation of neglecting damping this idea has been supported by a thorough discussion in appendix a presenting a detailed derivation of the reduced 3dof approach comparing linear roll motion predictions based on different approaches as well as making reference to some existing experimental results therefore the reduced 3dof method was used as reference in the comparisons with the other methods 5 2 conclusions based on the obtained results the following may be concluded the two tested froude krylov methods 3d panel method and imo method provide very similar results in the examined range of frequencies this indicates that the two methods may be considered basically equivalent for the purpose of determination of the effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships see figs 10 12 15 16 and in particular fig 17 this result can be explained by the full hull forms typical of river sea ships which are characterised by long parallel middle bodies and high midship section coefficients consequently the use of strip theory and the approximation of ship sections with rectangles as done in the imo method provide a sufficiently good approximation of the froude krylov effective wave slope coefficient based on the exact hull form 3d panel method larger differences were observed in fact for the slenderer vessels compare fig 10 with figs 11 and 12 therefore since the agreement between the two tested methods based on froude krylov assumption is a result of the specific typical hull geometry of river sea ships the outcomes of the analysis should not be considered as valid for conventional sea going ships which are usually featuring lower longitudinal and vertical prismatic coefficients the two tested semi empirical methods for the estimation of effective wave slope coefficient at the natural roll frequency are targeting standard sea going ships due to differences in design between river sea ships and standard sea going ships the two examined approaches appeared to be unsuitable for application to river sea ships see figs 18 22 furthermore when applied to river sea ships the two semi empirical methods exhibit a general tendency to overestimate the effective wave slope coefficient at the natural roll frequency when compared to the results obtained by the reduced 3dof method this particularly applies to the predictions obtained by the method embedded in the imo weather criterion such results should have been however expected as the characteristics of river sea ships are for the most part outside of the ranges of parameters used in the development of the imo weather criterion according to the obtained results the approaches based on froude krylov assumption 3d panel method and imo method appear to be conservative in comparison to the reduced 3dof method in the vast majority of cases the effective wave slope coefficients from the 3d panel method and from the imo method are greater than those from the reduced 3dof method in the tested range of frequencies see figs 10 12 15 and 16 particularly in the vicinity of realistic values of the roll natural frequency the level of conservativeness in some cases was very large such results are also supported by the available literature the opposite was found to be possible in case of high frequencies for metacentric heights towards the lower bound of tested intervals of g m for larger metacentric heights this may happen in regions of high frequencies where the effective wave slope coefficient is in general small therefore for the purposes of intact stability assessment of river sea ships on the basis of simplified roll models wave excitation could be accounted for by one of the following methods a a method based on froude krylov assumption e g a direct pressure integration method or the simplified so called imo method which is simple to implement but comes at the cost of conservativeness and limited accuracy b the herein presented reduced 3dof method or another similar method considering dynamic and hydrodynamic coupling of roll with sway and yaw which provides for a more accurate representation of dynamic and hydrodynamic effects but requires the use of a seakeeping software while option b may be more computationally challenging the cost of its use could be offset by the benefits of a more appropriate stability assessment of river sea ships from a regulatory perspective option a is simpler and it is likely to generally provide conservative assessments at the same time however its observed inaccuracy requires caution in considering its generalised application in fact taking into account the advances in design and computational tools the use of more advanced and accurate methods as a reference basis should be considered as a preferred choice the development of stability assessment approaches based on such methods would lead in general to more physically sound and realistic appraisal which would be beneficial from both a design and an operational point of view in addition the use of more accurate calculation methodologies would provide a fairer assessment of vessels with different hull forms and different typical loading conditions which could be otherwise affected by different levels of conservativeness approximation when evaluated through simplified conservative approaches it would also enable a proper stability assessment of unconventional vessels which may considerably differ from the standard ones and for which simpler methods may prove not to be conservative finally the use of calculation methods intended to assess the actual ship behaviour would facilitate also the implementation of alternative equivalent approaches based on experimental methods nevertheless provided a simpler approach would prove being conservative an assessment framework could be envisioned in which a simpler approach may be used as an alternative to the reference more complex but also more accurate one therefore in the actual application the designer may choose to use either the reference approach or as an alternative a simplified approach with such a framework the use of less advanced and less accurate tools would be compensated by an intrinsic conservativeness and the designer would also be properly informed in this respect the choice of applying the reference accurate approach or a simplified conservative one would therefore be left to the designer and this choice may be governed by economic considerations e g potential gain in payload and or other constraints e g other criteria constraining the loading conditions this way of thinking would also be in line with the basic logic of the sgisc framework as a global result the implementation of more advanced calculation approaches could have a beneficial impact from an economic technical and also cultural perspective 5 3 future work it should be noted that semi empirical methods for predicting the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency with sufficient accuracy are not available for river sea ships a possible way of addressing this problem could be to develop a new semi empirical model based on systematic analysis of directly calculated frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficients for river sea ships then it shall be underlined that the reduced 3dof method applied herein is not fully consistent from a hydrodynamic perspective even in the framework of linear seakeeping because it neglects the effect of potential damping in this respect future work will be dedicated to exploring the possible extension of this approach in order to account also for the effect of potential damping which would also allow for the quantification of the effects of the approximation of neglecting damping used herein finally it should be underlined that this work was based solely on numerical calculations although some experimental results available in literature support the outcomes of the present study the suitability of different methodologies for the prediction of effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships cannot be fully assessed until dedicated experimental tests are carried out and results are compared with numerical predictions this was not undertaken in the framework of the present work and it should definitely be considered as a target

appendix provides the details of the derivation of the reduced 3dof approach i e the single roll equation 5 embedding the coupling with sway and yaw neglecting the effect of potential damping the starting point is the coupled sway roll yaw system 4 expressed in frequency domain which for ease of reference is reported again in the following a 1 q 22 y q 24 φ q 26 ψ f ˆ 2 q 42 y q 44 φ q 46 ψ c

sway and yaw motions is implicitly embedded in the terms of the roll equation to this end the sway equation first equation of a 1 and yaw equation second equation of a 1 are rearranged as follows a 2 q 22 y q 26 ψ f ˆ 2 q 24 φ q 62 y q 66 ψ f ˆ 6 q 64 φ the first sway equation in a 2 is now multiplied by q 66 the second yaw equation in a 2 is multiplied by q 26 and the two equations are subtracted

q 64 q 22 c 44 φ f ˆ 4 by rearranging the terms in a 7 and by recalling the definition of d in a 5 the roll equation can be finally written as follows a 8 i 44 c ω φ c 44 φ f ˆ 4 c ω with i 44 c ω q 44 q 42 q 24 q 66 q 64 q 26 q 46 q 24 q 62 q 64 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 f ˆ 4 c ω f ˆ 4 f ˆ 2 q 42 q 66 q 46 q 62 f ˆ 6 q 42 q 26 q 46 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 where q i j q i j ω i j 2 4 6 f ˆ i f ˆ i ω i 2 4 6 the solution of the single roll equation a 8 is totally equivalent to the roll motion as obtained by the solution of the original coupled system a 1 while in a 1 the coupling of roll with sway and yaw is explicit in a 8 the same coupling is implicitly embedded through the total inertia term i 44 c and the total forcing moment f ˆ 4 c the roll forcing moment f ˆ 4 c in a 8 provides a forcing magnitude and phase which is such to lead to the same roll response as the original system a 1 moreover the total inertia term i 44 c is such to provide a resonance roll frequency equivalent to the original system a 1 this however is obtained in the approximation of neglecting the damping matrix from the original full linear seakeeping sway roll yaw system see 2 from a hydrodynamic point of view neglecting damping leads to a method which is not fully consistent nevertheless from a dynamics perspective focussing on roll the effect of damping on roll motion is limited to a range of frequencies close to the natural frequency moreover roll damping has a typically small effect on the actual resonance frequency furthermore viscous effects are dominant in case of roll motion which inevitably requires to introduce some additional semi empirical damping term in the motion equation which typically breaks the overall consistency of linear seakeeping equations as a result it appears that the use of a 8 could be justified from a practical application perspective in order to show that the forcing f ˆ 4 c in a 8 provides a reasonably accurate forcing magnitude and that it better represents roll motion forcing compared to the pure froude krylov forcing moment an example application is carried out for the vessel b described in section 3 of the paper the linear roll response has been calculated according to the following approaches fls full linear seakeeping system 2 this approach consistently accounts for all linear hydrodynamic effects fls nod linear seakeeping system of equations neglecting the damping matrix this approach neglects dissipation effects due to wave radiation and corresponds to the solution of a 1 reduced 3dof single degree of freedom roll motion equation as obtained by the reported decoupling procedure this corresponds to using a 8 and the roll response obtained from this approach is equal to the roll response obtained by the fls nod approach described above fk in this approach the forcing in the 1 dof model a 8 is substituted by the pure froude krylov moment calculated with respect to the centre of gravity m ˆ f k g ω in order to guarantee that the roll resonance frequency is the same as the approaches fls nod and reduced 3dof the total moment of inertia is kept as i 44 c as defined in a 8 the resulting mathematical model takes the following form a 9 i 44 c ω φ c 44 φ m ˆ f k g ω for the present example hydrodynamic coefficients and forces have been calculated as in case of fig 1 moreover in this specific case for the sake of higher consistency of comparisons the froude krylov moment m ˆ f k g ω has been calculated using the same strip theory approach as the one used for the determination of hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction forces results of the calculations are shown in figure a 1 in terms of roll transfer function φ k w a w roll amplitude per unit wave slope in addition to the roll transfer function top graph the figure also shows for ease of analysis the effective wave slope coefficient bottom graph calculated according to the reduced 3dof approach and by using the froude krylov moment with respect to the centre of gravity fk figure a 1 vessel b top roll transfer functions using different modelling simplifications bottom effective wave slope coefficient using the reduced 3dof method and using the froude krylov moment with respect to the centre of gravity fk figure a 1 from the results in figure a 1 top it can be seen that as expected models fls nod and reduced 3dof provide the very same roll transfer function the roll transfer function from the reduced 3dof model is also very close to the roll transfer function from the fls model with the exception of the region close to the resonance frequency in that region of frequencies the presence of damping in the fls model limits the roll response whereas this does not happen for fls nod reduced 3dof models due to the neglecting of damping however the observed difference in the roll response in that limited region is given by the resonance of the system and not by a sudden variation of the forcing which is to be considered as a smooth function of the frequency this is confirmed by the smooth behaviour of the effective wave slope coefficients shown in the bottom graph of figure a 1 looking now at the results from the fk model a 9 where the roll forcing is based on the froude krylov moment with respect to the centre of gravity it can be seen that the corresponding roll transfer function is systematically larger than the roll response obtained from all the other models the roll transfer function from the fk model becomes closer to the fls fls nod and reduced 3dof models in the region of very low frequencies i e in the region of long waves and this is in line with outcomes from the studies and considerations by tasai 1965 mizuno 1973 1975 and umeda and tsukamoto 2008 the larger roll transfer function obtained from the model fk indicates an excessive level of forcing and this is confirmed by the comparison of effective wave slope coefficient functions in figure a 1 bottom from the example results for vessel b reported in figure a 1 it appears therefore that the reduced 3dof model is able to provide a level of forcing which is in line with the original fls model also the roll resonance frequency is properly captured by the reduced 3dof model this indicates that the simplification of neglecting the damping terms although hydrodynamically not fully consistent appears to be practically acceptable it is also noted that some comparisons between experimental results and numerical roll predictions based on nonlinear 1 dof roll models making use of the effective wave slope coefficient calculated according to the reduced 3dof method presented herein have been reported for multi hulls bulian and francescutto 2009 and for a conventional hull form bulian et al 2009 in both cases predictions compared well with experiments although more experiments are surely necessary for a wider and more thorough assessment the mentioned results support the numerical analysis shown in figure a 1 indicating that the effective wave slope coefficient determined in accordance with the reduced 3dof method seems to provide a reasonable estimation of the actual magnitude of roll forcing nevertheless as mentioned in the introduction of the paper mizuno 1973 1975 presented a method for determining the effective wave slope coefficient in the case of coupled sway roll in the framework of linear hydrodynamics accounting also for damping but neglecting the coupling with yaw future work will therefore be dedicated to exploring the possible extension of the reduced 3dof approach in order to account also for the effect of potential damping which would also allow for the quantification of the effects of the approximation of neglecting damping appendix b details of vessels in the

22390,the effective wave slope is a fundamental concept in simplified 1 dof roll models and predicted roll motion strongly depends on the assumed effective wave slope coefficient this is relevant to regulatory frameworks based on 1 dof roll models such as imo weather criterion or the under development second generation intact stability criteria the paper examines different methods for effective wave slope coefficient prediction which could potentially be used for intact stability assessment of river sea ships in fact there is a lack of studies specifically addressing this type of vessels a database of existing inland and river sea vessels is used for determining the effective wave slope coefficient by the considered methods and results are compared and discussed the used approaches comprise a direct calculation method based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamics methods based on froude krylov approximation and semi empirical methods obtained results suggest that the considered methods based on froude krylov approximation provide similar predictions for river sea ships and tend to be conservative in the vast majority of cases results also suggest that the considered semi empirical methods for effective wave slope coefficient prediction at natural roll frequency are unsuitable for river sea ships with a general tendency towards the overestimation keywords effective wave slope coefficient river sea ships roll motion second generation intact stability criteria weather criterion 1 introduction river sea ships are principally inland navigation vessels that make use of short but regular voyages in coastal areas it is therefore necessary to conduct a proper assessment of stability of river sea ships in maritime navigation however a common international regulatory framework for river sea ships does not exist bačkalov 2019 chatelier et al 2017 on the other hand because of their unconventional design in comparison to standard sea going ships the suitability of the present mandatory ship stability regulations laid out in imo 2008 is code imo 2008a involving semi empirical and simplified analytical methods may not be appropriate a rational solution could be possibly found in the application of the methods under development in the framework of second generation intact stability criteria sgisc to river sea ships with some modifications reflecting the specific design and operational features of this type of vessels see rudaković and bačkalov 2019 an important step in the assessment of ship safety in rough weather in intact condition is to properly account for roll excitation moment induced by waves as the fluid ship interaction is complex the concept of effective wave slope coefficient was developed as a simplification tool to be embedded in approaches for roll motion prediction based on 1 dof roll modelling in the past the effective wave slope coefficient was usually considered only at natural roll frequency e g blume 1979 fujino et al 1993 imo 2008a b yamagata 1959 or in regions of frequency close to the roll natural frequency e g francescutto et al 2001 francescutto and serra 2002 however in the sgisc framework a frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient is necessary in a wide range of frequencies when applying the level 2 vulnerability assessment approach for dead ship condition imo 2016 2017 to this end a simplified approach was proposed within sgisc imo method hereinafter which accounts for froude krylov roll moment only and where ship sections at different longitudinal positions as an approximation are substituted by rectangles imo 2016 2017 at the same time other approaches based on froude krylov assumption which are able to more accurately account for the exact hull shape by direct pressure integration are also readily available and simple to implement such approaches are either based on a 3d panelling of the hull surface or on a strip theory approximation it is also noted that direct froude krylov pressure integration for the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient is also presently considered as a possible calculation option within the draft sgisc framework imo 2017 in this context umeda et al 2007 suggested that the simplified froude krylov approach based on rectangular approximation of ship sections could provide acceptable results in terms of capsizing probability predictions when compared with other methods however due to the importance of the effective wave slope coefficient it is reasonable to consider also more advanced and more precise methods possibly based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamic in this respect mizuno 1973 1975 formulated the frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient from the coupled linear roll sway dynamical system taking into account all mechanic and hydrodynamic terms in the 2 dof dynamical system the results reported by mizuno 1973 1975 considering both calculations and experiments appear to indicate that the effective wave slope calculated according to the froude krylov approximation tends to be conservative leading to overestimation of roll motion when used in numerical predictions at the same time results by mizuno 1973 1975 indicate that the froude krylov approximation for the effective wave slope coefficient is appropriate in the region of low frequencies i e for long waves and this is in line with the indications from umeda and tsukamoto 2008 who made reference for the same purpose to the study by tasai 1965 an approach for the determination of frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient accounting for the 3 dof linear sway roll yaw coupling was presented by bulian et al 2008 2009 bulian and francescutto 2009 míguez gonzalez and bulian 2018 this latter approach which is one of the approaches that are going to be used in the present paper accounts for the coupling of roll with both sway and yaw but it is an approximate method because it neglects the effect of damping nevertheless experimental results reported by bulian and francescutto 2009 and bulian et al 2009 indicate that the approach is capable to provide the effective wave slope coefficient with sufficient accuracy for the prediction of roll amplitude in beam waves the focus of this paper will be on the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient for inland river sea ships which are characterised by full hull forms long parallel middle bodies and large breadth to draught ratios in addition such ships may have high position of centre of gravity above the waterline compared to the ship draught to the authors best knowledge there seems to be no systematic studies on effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships available in literature nevertheless in the past studies were carried out for other types of vessels sharing some of the characteristics of the ships considered herein fujino et al 1993 investigated the effective wave slope coefficient in case of small craft with large breadth and shallow draught they determined the effective wave slope coefficient from experiments measurement in regular beam waves of wave exciting roll moment or resonant roll angle and from calculations based on froude krylov approximation and they compared the results with the predictions from the formula in the present weather criterion imo 2008a they found that the formula from the weather criterion significantly overestimated both the results obtained from experiments and also the results obtained from froude krylov calculations particularly for conditions with high position of centre of gravity above the waterline fujino et al 1993 also noticed that the effective wave slope coefficient from the froude krylov approach had a tendency to overestimate the values obtained from experimental measurement of wave exciting roll moment with models fixed in roll and with unconstrained sway and heave in beam waves on the completely opposite side of the spectrum of vessels size francescutto et al 2001 and francescutto and serra 2002 studied the effective wave slope coefficient for the case of large passenger ships which are also characterised by large breadth to draught ratios and high position of centre of gravity above the waterline in proportion to the draught they determined the effective wave slope coefficient from the analysis of experimental resonant roll motion in regular beam waves and they also found that the formula from the weather criterion imo 2008a systematically overestimated the effective wave slope coefficient obtained from the analysis of experiments the overestimation tendency of weather criterion formula was also confirmed by the experimental tests on two dimensional models by sato et al 2008 while the focus of this paper is on roll excitation in beam waves it is worth mentioning also some works that although being related to surf riding share some conceptual similarities with the present study specifically begovic et al 2018 feng et al 2015 2017 and umeda et al 2015 analysed the effect of taking into account the diffraction component of the surge force in the assessment of surf riding inception in comparison to the use of froude krylov force only with reference to the framework of sgisc all mentioned studies concur in concluding that the use of the froude krylov approximation for the surge force neglecting diffraction effects provides conservative outcomes with specific reference to inland vessels and river sea ships the overall goal of this paper is to provide a better insight into some of the existing methods for effective wave slope coefficient prediction and to identify what type of approach may be considered more suitable for intact stability assessment of river sea ships when using simplified methods as those within the sgisc framework therefore first the methods considered in this study are described in section 2 with the associated appendix a then section 3 and the associated appendix b provide an overview of the developed database of 31 inland vessels or river sea ships which are used in section 4 for the systematic comparisons among different effective wave slope coefficient prediction methods three specific vessels have been selected from the existing database and are used in section 4 for reporting more in depth analyses and comparisons finally a summary of the obtained results a series of concluding remarks and possible directions for future work are provided in section 5 for all the quantities in the paper the si system of units is used 2 effective wave slope coefficient definition and prediction methods in general the effective wave slope coefficient at a generic wave frequency ω can be defined as 1 r ω m r o l l δ g m k w a w where m roll is the amplitude of a properly defined wave induced roll moment δ is the displacement force g m is the metacentric height k w is the wave number and a w is the wave amplitude the specific definition of m roll depends on the method used for the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient as discussed in the following sections irrespective of the calculation method the effective wave slope function r ω shows some characteristic properties the low frequency limit is lim ω 0 r ω 1 whereas the high frequency limit is lim ω r ω 0 usually r ω can be expected to be in the range between 0 and 1 however in some cases the effective wave slope function may also exceed 1 in some ranges of frequencies as it can happen for small metacentric heights at relatively high frequencies according to 1 the frequencies where r ω 0 correspond to the frequencies where m roll 0 for conventional hull shapes and loading conditions the natural frequency is typically between ω 0 and the first minimum or first zero of r ω an example of the behaviour of the effective wave slope function r ω is shown in fig 1 for a conventional hull the considered vessel is the duisburg test case dtc containership el moctar et al 2012 for a realistic loading condition the figure shows r ω as calculated by the reduced 3dof method and by the 3d panel method which are described hereinafter in section 2 1 and in section 2 2 respectively the roll natural frequency ω φ reported in the figure has been determined as described hereinafter in section 2 1 for the example in fig 1 linear hydrodynamics data for the reduced 3dof method and for the determination of ω φ have been calculated with an in house linear seakeeping code bulian and francescutto 2009 based on stf strip theory salvesen et al 1970 and frank close fit method frank 1967 from equation 1 it can be seen that the problem of prediction of the effective wave slope coefficient comes down to the problem of calculation of the amplitude of a properly defined roll moment m roll the paper therefore addresses the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient considering a series of different methods namely predictions using direct calculations based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamics hereinafter shortly reduced 3dof approach predictions based on linear froude krylov approximation predictions using semi empirical methods the considered methods are described in detail in the following sections 2 1 direct calculation based on linear seakeeping hydrodynamics reduced 3dof approach direct calculation in this paper is carried out by means of a linear hydrodynamic approach following bulian et al 2008 and bulian and francescutto 2009 the starting point is the classical linear seakeeping frequency domain 3 dof model for sway roll yaw 2 m a ω x b ω x c x f ˆ ω where m is the mass matrix a is the added mass matrix b is the damping matrix c is the restoring matrix f ˆ is the vector of complex generalised forces ω is the wave frequency x is the complex state vector and dots indicate time derivatives the method is based on the derivation of a single 1 dof equation for roll implicitly embedding the coupling with sway and yaw but omitting the effect of damping this approximation was used in the past although for different purposes by hutchison 1991 and by naciri and lledo 2001 who considered the case of coupled sway roll dynamics neglecting also the coupling with yaw by removing the damping matrix b equation 2 becomes 3 q ω x c x f ˆ ω with q ω m a ω the system 3 corresponds to the following set of three equations 4 q 22 y q 24 φ q 26 ψ f ˆ 2 q 42 y q 44 φ q 46 ψ c 44 φ f ˆ 4 q 62 y q 64 φ q 66 ψ f ˆ 6 where subscript indices refer to the standard 6 dof linear seakeeping nomenclature for anti symmetric motions 2 sway 4 roll 6 yaw the roll degree of freedom in system 4 can be virtually decoupled by variables substitutions in order to obtain a single equation containing only roll as explicit state variable but still preserving the effects of coupling with sway and yaw motion as described in detail in appendix a the resulting 1 dof roll equation has the following familiar form 5 i 44 c ω φ c 44 φ f ˆ 4 c ω where the roll moment in complex notation is bulian et al 2008 bulian and francescutto 2009 6 f ˆ 4 c f ˆ 4 f ˆ 2 q 42 q 66 q 46 q 62 f ˆ 6 q 42 q 26 q 46 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 the effective wave slope coefficient r ω can eventually be obtained by substituting the modulus of f ˆ 4 c for m r o l l in 1 it is important to highlight that the result is independent from the arbitrarily chosen centre of reference system used for the seakeeping computations the model 5 can also be used to estimate the undamped natural roll frequency of the ship ω φ as the solution of the following equation 7 ω φ c 44 i 44 c ω φ with i 44 c ω φ q 44 q 42 q 24 q 66 q 64 q 26 q 46 q 24 q 62 q 64 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 where q i j q i j ω φ i j 2 4 6 details of the derivation of 5 6 and 7 are reported in appendix a which also reports an analysis of the effectiveness of the reduced 3dof modelling compared to other modelling for the roll moment considered herein it is noted at this point that also tasai 1971 addressed the problem of the determination of the undamped natural roll frequency of the coupled sway roll yaw linear model and he also used the approximation of neglecting the effect of damping although the derivation procedures herein and by tasai 1971 are different the final results are equivalent and the undamped natural roll frequencies determined by 7 and by equation a 10 of tasai 1971 coincide 2 2 linear froude krylov approach es this approach in line with the linear approximation determines the roll moment by direct integration of undisturbed wave pressure on the wetted surface i e froude krylov roll moment of a fixed hull considering beam monochromatic waves the moment is calculated with respect to the centre of gravity g and it can be formally written as follows 8 m f k g s x x g p n d s where x x g is the radius vector from g to the generic point on the hull surface s p is the undisturbed wave pressure and n is unitary normal vector of s pointing to the fluid as the approach is linear the integration is carried out on the wetted hull surface in calm water in time domain m fk g is a sinusoidal function of time for an incident monochromatic wave for the determination of the effective wave slope coefficient the amplitude of m fk g is substituted for m roll in 1 in case the calculation is carried out equivalently in frequency domain m fk g in 8 corresponds to the phasor of the froude krylov moment and its modulus is substituted for m roll in 1 the distinctive positive characteristic of this method is that it is very simple to be implemented the main drawback is associated with the fact that this approach totally neglects diffraction effects and effects associated with coupling from other relevant motions sway and yaw the linear froude krylov method can be implemented using various approaches which in practice differ in the way of describing the hull shape for carrying out the integration in 1 the methods used in the present work are explained in the following the most precise froude krylov method is based on the accounting for the exact three dimensional shape of the hull the hull is then discretised by a finite number of polygonal in this paper triangular panels allowing to accurately describe also complex hull shapes see fig 2 each panel is associated to a relevant set of particulars area centroid position and unitary normal vector which are used to determine the froude krylov roll moment using the discretisation of 8 this method provides an accurate estimation of the froude krylov excitation a less precise method is based on the strip theory approximation which however can make effective use of the classical simplified representation of vessels through sections in this approach as usual the integral 8 is approximated by an integration of roll moments calculated for 2d sections along the hull to determine the sectional roll moment each hull section is discretised with a finite number of 2d linear panels see fig 3 which are then used for determining froude krylov forces and moments acting on each panel each panel is defined with a set of particulars length centroid position and unit normal vector the summation of contributions from each panel in the section provides the sectional roll moment the drawback of this method is that it does not account for the exact three dimensional hull shape but rather uses the strip theory approximation to obtain the total froude krylov roll moment nevertheless the strip method can be expected to provide results that are close to those obtained from the 3d panel method for hull shapes having high values of longitudinal prismatic coefficient c p a further simplification is applied in the method proposed by imo imo method in the framework of second generation intact stability criteria for level 2 vulnerability assessment for dead ship condition imo 2017 the principle of the method is to transform each true hull section into an equivalent rectangular section keeping as far as possible the section breadth at waterline and the sectional underwater area see fig 4 this transformation allows using the exact analytical solution for the sectional froude krylov wave moment of rectangular sections instead of requiring the panelisation of the true section the total wave moment is then obtained following the strip theory approach by integration of sectional wave moments over the ship length a first version of this simplified methodology was presented by umeda and tsukamoto 2008 however since ship sections are in general not rectangular in some cases the imo methodology may provide poor approximations of the true froude krylov roll moment conversely the imo method can be expected to provide better approximations for full hull forms having high vertical prismatic coefficient c vp as well as high longitudinal prismatic coefficient c p 2 3 semi empirical methods in general semi empirical methods for effective wave slope coefficient estimation are easy to use but strictly speaking their prediction accuracy is limited to hull forms which do not significantly differ from those used in the development of the method such methods are based on some form of regression of the effective wave slope coefficient and can be developed in principle from experimental data or from calculations of higher complexity and accuracy moreover in such methods the effective wave slope coefficient is typically provided at natural roll frequency only there is a limited number of semi empirical methods available in literature e g blume 1979 imo 2008a b watanabe 1938 yamagata 1959 and none of them to the authors best knowledge is intended to cover river sea ships the semi empirical prediction method proposed by blume 1979 provides the effective wave slope coefficient only at natural roll frequency the effective wave slope coefficient as a function of the non dimensional natural roll period according to blume 1979 is reconstructed in fig 5 in the figure the full line is the mean prediction curve corresponding to conventional at the time of development hull shapes and g m values and the dashed lines provide an indication of the prediction intervals on the horizontal axis of fig 5 t φ is the roll natural period b is the ship breadth and g is the gravitational acceleration another semi empirical method is given in the 2008 is code within the weather criterion imo 2008a as the weather criterion is designed to assess the ability of the ship to withstand the combined effect of wind gust and beam waves at resonance the effective wave slope coefficient for this purpose is estimated as in case of blume 1979 only at natural roll frequency as indicated in msc 1 circ 1281 imo 2008b the method derives from the work of watanabe 1938 with subsequent simplifications from yamagata 1959 more precisely watanabe 1938 developed an approximate formula based on froude krylov calculations assuming trochoidal waves for simplified hull shapes with the effective wave slope coefficient formula depending on a set of influential parameters wave length vertical position of centre of gravity metacentric height breadth draught block coefficient and water plane area coefficient a further simplification was then reported by yamagata 1959 having the following form 9 r 0 73 0 6 o g t which is the form presently used within the imo weather criterion in the expression 9 o g k g t is the vertical position of centre of gravity above the waterline and t is the ship draught yamagata 1959 reported a good agreement between formula 9 and results calculated for 60 actual ships using the approach by watanabe 1938 as reconstructed in fig 6 conversely results from fujino et al 1993 francescutto et al 2001 and francescutto and serra 2002 indicate that the semi empirical formula 9 can be conservative compared to experimental results or froude krylov calculations for vessels with large values of b t and or o g t 3 vessel database and loading conditions for the purpose of the present study a set of typical inland or river sea ships was selected for systematic calculation of effective wave slope coefficient as a function of frequency as well as at natural roll frequency using different methodologies for each vessel a range of operational conditions was considered in order to have a broad range of characteristic parameters an overview of the vessels particulars and principal dimensionless coefficients is given in appendix b in total 31 self propelled vessels were gathered comprising 23 tankers 4 general cargo vessels 3 container vessels and 1 lpg tanker it should be noted however that the hull shape and the dimensions of european inland vessels are not significantly influenced by the vessel type at the time of the analysis 2017 2018 most of the vessels were approximately from 5 to 10 years in service the typical propulsion arrangement consists of two propellers in stern tunnels as in figs 2 and 7 9 although some vessels in the database have a single screw for the purpose of the study three draughts were used for each vessel a maximum draught corresponding to the scantling draught a draught corresponding to the minimum draught enabling full immersion of the tunnels and an intermediate draught conventionally set as the average between the previous two all calculations were carried out for even keel condition i e zero trim regarding the loading conditions a wide range of tested k g was chosen so as to cover realistic loading conditions the minimum k g was taken about half of the scantling draught whereas the maximum k g corresponds to metacentric heights around 0 3 m 0 5 m depending on the vessel and draught for simplicity the range of k g was kept constant when varying the calculation draught the considered database eventually comprises a total of 567 vessel draught k g combinations for each vessel and loading condition in the database different dry roll radii of inertia k xx were considered corresponding to 0 25 b 0 3 b 0 35 b 0 4 b and 0 45 b the dry yaw radius of inertia k zz was kept constant and equal to 0 25 l wl therefore a total of 2835 vessel draught k g k xx combinations were considered furthermore for each vessel and condition the natural roll frequency ω φ was calculated according to 7 the length of the vessels ranges from 66 m for small inland navigation vessels up to 135 m corresponding to the largest contemporary inland self propelled vessels in western europe the vessels have full hull forms with block coefficients up to c b 0 92 due to long parallel middle bodies in combination with full midship coefficients c m typically exceeding 0 99 due to restrictions in waterway dimensions inland vessels have relatively small draught which is compensated with greater beam resulting in somewhat high b t ratios in the range of 2 5 4 5 for the scantling draught and much higher ratios for lower draughts furthermore more detailed calculation results are provided for three selected vessels their particulars and considered loading conditions are given in table 1 together with the roll natural frequencies ω φ according to 7 and the corresponding roll natural period t φ 2 π ω φ in addition the body plans of the sample vessels a b and c are reported in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the cross sections in the figures are equally spaced at 500 mm distance whereby station 0 represents the aftmost station 4 comparison of effective wave slope coefficient calculation methods in this section the methods described in section 2 are applied to the database of vessels described in section 3 and results of the predictions are compared the reduced 3dof method section 2 1 is assumed to be the most accurate among the considered methods because it better represents hydrodynamic effects within the limit of the considered approximations as described in appendix a for this reason it will therefore be used as reference in the comparisons hydrodynamic coefficients for the reduced 3dof method section 2 1 were determined for the vessels in the database by the strip theory code shipmopc version 3 5 8 with sectional calculations based on boundary element method mctaggart 1997 the 3d panel method section 2 2 was applied by discretizing the actual hull surface into approximately 5000 43000 panels depending on the size and complexity of a hull afterwards to increase the accuracy of numerical integration of 8 the mesh was refined through three sequential applications of regular refinement splitting of each triangle in four triangles using midpoints of edges the imo method section 2 2 was applied by using a total of 21 sections for each vessel representative examples of effective wave slope coefficients calculated with the three methods for the three sample vessels and associated loading condition given in table 1 are shown in figs 10 12 it can be noticed that for all three vessels the 3d panel method and the imo method which are both based on the froude krylov approximation provide very close results particularly for vessels b and c which have the largest c b and c p see table 1 the effective wave slope coefficient calculated by the reduced 3dof method tends to be smaller than that obtained by the other two methods for all three vessels as discussed hereinafter the tendencies observed for the three sample vessels will be confirmed by the behaviour observed for the whole database furthermore it is noted that qualitatively similar results were obtained in the past by mizuno 1973 1975 when he compared the effective wave slope coefficient based on linear froude krylov assumption and the effective wave slope coefficient calculated by using a coupled roll sway model based on linear hydrodynamics neglecting yaw but taking into accound the effect of linear damping his findings were also supported by experimental results figs 10 12 also show that the effective wave slope coefficient calculated with the exact froude krylov approach 3d panel and by considering hydrodynamic effects reduced 3dof while being noticeably different at the roll natural frequency tend to converge in the region of low frequencies this confirms the considerations of umeda and tsukamoto 2008 based on the work by tasai 1965 regarding the suitability of the froude krylov approximation in the range of long waves in order to represent the large dataset the first set of results will be presented herein in terms of percentile levels as obtained from the distribution of data in particular the data will be represented through 25 50 median and 75 percentiles in addition minimum and maximum values will also be reported to give an indication of the extremes the range between the 25 and the 75 percentiles is the interquartile range and it contains 50 of the data the original effective wave slope coefficient data were calculated as a function of the dimensional wave frequency ω the same set of calculation frequencies was used for all vessels from 0 1 rad s up to 4 0 rad s with constant steps of 0 1 rad s to better cover the low frequency range an additional calculation frequency was also considered at 0 05 rad s however in order to combine results from different vessels data have been eventually analysed as a function of the non dimensional wave number defined as follows 10 k ˆ k w b ω 2 b g as a result of the quadratic transformation from ω to k ˆ the available data are not uniformly distributed in terms of non dimensional wave number k ˆ moreover non dimensional wave numbers for which data are available do not coincide among different vessels unless the vessels have the same breadth therefore the distribution of data and the associated percentile levels were calculated using a sliding window technique where subsets of data are analysed for different intervals i e windows of k ˆ in this study the windows specified for the analysis are non overlapping and have adaptive widths which try to follow the distribution of data points with the aim of keeping a similar number of samples in each window fig 13 shows the number of data points within each window as a function of the centre of the window and the widths of the bins in the figure correspond to the widths of the corresponding windows used in the analysis it is underlined that the number of points in each window can exceed the total number of combinations vessel draught k g k xx i e 2835 see section 3 as data from multiple calculation frequencies can fall in the same window of analysis first fig 14 shows the analysis of data in terms of effective wave slope coeffcient as estimated by the reduced 3dof method as a function of k ˆ then the reduced 3dof approach is compared to two linear froude krylov methods the imo method and the 3d panel method both discussed in section 2 2 these analyses were carried out for all the vessel loading condition combinations 2835 in total described in section 3 the comparison is carried out by analysing differences as function of k ˆ between imo method and reduced 3dof method calculated as δ r k ˆ r i m o k ˆ r 3 d o f k ˆ with results shown in fig 15 and differences as function of k ˆ between 3d panel method and reduced 3dof method calculated as δ r k ˆ r 3 d p a n e l k ˆ r 3 d o f k ˆ with results shown in fig 16 it is noted that all considered methods in the present comparison are such that the effective wave slope coefficient tends to 1 0 as the frequency ω tends to zero therefore differences among methods for k ˆ 0 always tend to zero although calculations could not be numerically performed for exactly zero frequency for numerical reasons such theoretical limit was used in the reporting of results from the results in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that in general the imo method and the 3d panel method i e methods based on the froude krylov approximation can be considered to be more conservative than the reduced 3dof method having a tendency to a positive median in the difference with a maximum median difference of about 0 3 nevertheless there is a minor number of conditions where the imo and the 3d panel methods can estimate significantly smaller values of effective wave slope coefficient at some frequencies this can occur for low metacentric heights for frequencies significantly higher than typically realistic natural roll frequencies it can also occur for higher metacentric heights in the high frequency region as a result of the humps and hollows of the effective wave slope coefficient based on froude krylov approximation compared to the smoother behaviour of the effective wave slope coefficient based on the reduced 3dof method however these latter cases are generally associated with small effective wave slope coefficients the results of the difference between imo method and reduced 3dof method fig 15 are apparently similar to the corresponding results for the 3d panel method fig 16 therefore a comparison of results between 3d panel method and imo method has been performed for the overall database and the corresponding statistical analysis is shown in fig 17 the outcomes indicate that for the considered database of vessels and loading conditions these two methods provide a very close estimation of the frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient having maximum absolute value of median difference of about 0 015 and maximum interquartile range of about 0 025 moreover the overall bias difference between these two methods is very small with a tendency for the 3d panel method to predict slightly larger effective wave slope coefficients than the imo method in the range of low dimensionless wave numbers and with the opposite occurring in the range of high wave numbers the overall good matching between these two methods is a consequence of the full hull forms of river sea ships with long parallel middle bodies and high midship coefficients with vessels having such characteristics the sectional transformation performed by the imo methodology where actual sections are substituted by equivalent rectangles still provides a good matching between original and transformed sections these outcomes are actually in line with the example results obtained for the three sample vessels figs 10 12 where the 3d panel method and the imo method provide very close results for all vessels overall this implies that the imo method and the 3d panel method both of which are based on the linear froude krylov approach for the estimation of the effective wave coefficient can be expected to provide close results when applied to river sea ships further comparisons are carried out between the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency as estimated by the reduced 3dof method and by the two semi empirical methods discussed in section 2 3 blume method and imo weather criterion method in figs 18 and 19 the effective wave slope coefficients obtained by the reduced 3dof method at natural roll frequency are compared to the blume s curve the figures report information for the overall database and in addition they report also curves of effective wave slope coefficient for different dimensionless roll natural periods t φ g b for the sample vessels a b and c in the plotting of the curves for the three vessels in fig 18 the dry roll radius of inertia was kept constant for each vessel see table 1 whereas k g was varied for each vessel vessel a 2 5 m k g 4 5 m vessel b 2 5 m k g 5 0 m vessel c 2 0 m k g 4 0 m variation step δ k g 0 5 m for all vessels instead in fig 19 the k g of each vessel was kept constant see table 1 and the dry roll radius of inertia was varied for each vessel in the range 0 25 k x x b 0 45 with a variation step δ k x x b 0 05 for all vessels in accordance with the variation of k xx b for all the vessels in the database as discussed in section 3 results for the whole database in figs 18 and 19 indicate that the effective wave slope coefficient predicted by the blume s approach tends to be larger and thus conservative in comparison to results by the reduced 3dof method however the overall trends of the blume s method and the reduced 3dof method appears to be similar this is particularly well exemplified by the curves associated with the three sample vessels by considering both the results in fig 18 and in fig 19 for the three sample vessels it seems that the blume s trend better represents results from the reduced 3dof if it is assumed that k xx b increases when increasing k g in fig 20 a similar comparison for the overall database is presented but this time between the results obtained with the reduced 3dof method and with the imo weather criterion method see 9 it can be seen that the effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships at natural roll frequency predicted by the imo weather criterion formula significantly differs from the results obtained by the reduced 3dof method the comparisons appear to be worse than those reported in figs 18 and 19 for the blume method river sea ships have higher b t ratios than standard sea going ships and for high k g the ratio o g t can be significantly higher than the indicated applicability range of the imo weather criterion formula in fact the indicated ranges of applicability of imo weather criterion are b t 3 5 0 3 o g t 0 5 and roll period smaller than 20s imo 2008a having in mind the typical parameters of river sea ships see appendix b the disagreement between the results obtained by the imo weather criterion formula and the reduced 3dof method could have been expected moreover the effective wave slope coefficients predicted by the imo weather criterion formula appear to be unrealistic in the range of large o g t ratios these outcomes confirm the results obtained in the past for sea going vessels and also simplified two dimensional sections characterised by large values of b t and or o g t fujino et al 1993 francescutto et al 2001 francescutto and serra 2002 imo 2002 sato et al 2008 similarly to figs 18 and 19 fig 21 constant k xx b variable k g and fig 22 variable k xx b constant k g compare the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency from the 3dof method for the three sample vessels as function of o g t with predictions from imo weather criterion in fig 21 an almost linear increase of r ωφ is observed with the increase of o g t for constant k xx b and this is somehow in line with the weather criterion formula at least in terms of general qualitative trend considering both results from figs 21 and 22 it seems that also in this case the comparison may be improved if an increase of k g is assumed to be associated also with an increase of k xx b among the three sample vessels vessel a which is the one with the smallest b t ratio and the smallest c b and c p coefficients shows the best agreement with the imo weather criterion formula however considering the other two vessels and the overall database it appears that predictions of effective wave slope coefficient at the roll natural frequency according to imo weather criterion are unsuitable for river sea ships 5 summary conclusions and future work this study presented an investigation on the applicability of different methods for the effective wave slope coefficient prediction to river sea ships a proper determination of the effective wave slope coefficient is indeed of particular importance in intact stability assessment when roll motion is to be predicted on the basis of simplified 1 dof approaches this section provides a summary of the approach used in the study the main conclusions drawn from the analysis and some ideas for possible future work 5 1 summary several methods for prediction of effective wave slope coefficient either over a range of wave frequencies or at the natural roll frequency have been presented and compared in the typical beam waves condition a 3dof approach based on linear hydrodynamics which considers the coupling of sway and yaw with roll motion under the approximation of neglecting the effect of damping and provides a frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient reduced 3dof method section 2 1 two linear approaches taking into account froude krylov roll moment only one based on a direct 3d panelisation of the hull and one based on a strip theory approach where the hull sections are approximated by rectangular sections both providing a frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficient 3d panel method and imo method respectively section 2 2 two semi empirical methods both estimating the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency only blume method and imo weather criterion method section 2 3 the methods are characterised by different levels of complexity and accuracy in addressing the underlying hydrodynamics the study was carried out on 31 self propelled inland or river sea vessels considering different loading conditions and mechanical characteristics which resulted in a total of 2835 examined vessel draught k g k xx combinations in addition more detailed results have been reported and discussed for three specific sample vessels from the presented database in the study the reduced 3dof method was considered as the method more faithfully representing the linear hydrodynamics of coupled sway roll yaw motion within the limits of the aforementioned approximation of neglecting damping this idea has been supported by a thorough discussion in appendix a presenting a detailed derivation of the reduced 3dof approach comparing linear roll motion predictions based on different approaches as well as making reference to some existing experimental results therefore the reduced 3dof method was used as reference in the comparisons with the other methods 5 2 conclusions based on the obtained results the following may be concluded the two tested froude krylov methods 3d panel method and imo method provide very similar results in the examined range of frequencies this indicates that the two methods may be considered basically equivalent for the purpose of determination of the effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships see figs 10 12 15 16 and in particular fig 17 this result can be explained by the full hull forms typical of river sea ships which are characterised by long parallel middle bodies and high midship section coefficients consequently the use of strip theory and the approximation of ship sections with rectangles as done in the imo method provide a sufficiently good approximation of the froude krylov effective wave slope coefficient based on the exact hull form 3d panel method larger differences were observed in fact for the slenderer vessels compare fig 10 with figs 11 and 12 therefore since the agreement between the two tested methods based on froude krylov assumption is a result of the specific typical hull geometry of river sea ships the outcomes of the analysis should not be considered as valid for conventional sea going ships which are usually featuring lower longitudinal and vertical prismatic coefficients the two tested semi empirical methods for the estimation of effective wave slope coefficient at the natural roll frequency are targeting standard sea going ships due to differences in design between river sea ships and standard sea going ships the two examined approaches appeared to be unsuitable for application to river sea ships see figs 18 22 furthermore when applied to river sea ships the two semi empirical methods exhibit a general tendency to overestimate the effective wave slope coefficient at the natural roll frequency when compared to the results obtained by the reduced 3dof method this particularly applies to the predictions obtained by the method embedded in the imo weather criterion such results should have been however expected as the characteristics of river sea ships are for the most part outside of the ranges of parameters used in the development of the imo weather criterion according to the obtained results the approaches based on froude krylov assumption 3d panel method and imo method appear to be conservative in comparison to the reduced 3dof method in the vast majority of cases the effective wave slope coefficients from the 3d panel method and from the imo method are greater than those from the reduced 3dof method in the tested range of frequencies see figs 10 12 15 and 16 particularly in the vicinity of realistic values of the roll natural frequency the level of conservativeness in some cases was very large such results are also supported by the available literature the opposite was found to be possible in case of high frequencies for metacentric heights towards the lower bound of tested intervals of g m for larger metacentric heights this may happen in regions of high frequencies where the effective wave slope coefficient is in general small therefore for the purposes of intact stability assessment of river sea ships on the basis of simplified roll models wave excitation could be accounted for by one of the following methods a a method based on froude krylov assumption e g a direct pressure integration method or the simplified so called imo method which is simple to implement but comes at the cost of conservativeness and limited accuracy b the herein presented reduced 3dof method or another similar method considering dynamic and hydrodynamic coupling of roll with sway and yaw which provides for a more accurate representation of dynamic and hydrodynamic effects but requires the use of a seakeeping software while option b may be more computationally challenging the cost of its use could be offset by the benefits of a more appropriate stability assessment of river sea ships from a regulatory perspective option a is simpler and it is likely to generally provide conservative assessments at the same time however its observed inaccuracy requires caution in considering its generalised application in fact taking into account the advances in design and computational tools the use of more advanced and accurate methods as a reference basis should be considered as a preferred choice the development of stability assessment approaches based on such methods would lead in general to more physically sound and realistic appraisal which would be beneficial from both a design and an operational point of view in addition the use of more accurate calculation methodologies would provide a fairer assessment of vessels with different hull forms and different typical loading conditions which could be otherwise affected by different levels of conservativeness approximation when evaluated through simplified conservative approaches it would also enable a proper stability assessment of unconventional vessels which may considerably differ from the standard ones and for which simpler methods may prove not to be conservative finally the use of calculation methods intended to assess the actual ship behaviour would facilitate also the implementation of alternative equivalent approaches based on experimental methods nevertheless provided a simpler approach would prove being conservative an assessment framework could be envisioned in which a simpler approach may be used as an alternative to the reference more complex but also more accurate one therefore in the actual application the designer may choose to use either the reference approach or as an alternative a simplified approach with such a framework the use of less advanced and less accurate tools would be compensated by an intrinsic conservativeness and the designer would also be properly informed in this respect the choice of applying the reference accurate approach or a simplified conservative one would therefore be left to the designer and this choice may be governed by economic considerations e g potential gain in payload and or other constraints e g other criteria constraining the loading conditions this way of thinking would also be in line with the basic logic of the sgisc framework as a global result the implementation of more advanced calculation approaches could have a beneficial impact from an economic technical and also cultural perspective 5 3 future work it should be noted that semi empirical methods for predicting the effective wave slope coefficient at natural roll frequency with sufficient accuracy are not available for river sea ships a possible way of addressing this problem could be to develop a new semi empirical model based on systematic analysis of directly calculated frequency dependent effective wave slope coefficients for river sea ships then it shall be underlined that the reduced 3dof method applied herein is not fully consistent from a hydrodynamic perspective even in the framework of linear seakeeping because it neglects the effect of potential damping in this respect future work will be dedicated to exploring the possible extension of this approach in order to account also for the effect of potential damping which would also allow for the quantification of the effects of the approximation of neglecting damping used herein finally it should be underlined that this work was based solely on numerical calculations although some experimental results available in literature support the outcomes of the present study the suitability of different methodologies for the prediction of effective wave slope coefficient of river sea ships cannot be fully assessed until dedicated experimental tests are carried out and results are compared with numerical predictions this was not undertaken in the framework of the present work and it should definitely be considered as a target

starting point is the coupled sway roll yaw system 4 expressed in frequency domain which for ease of reference is reported again in the following a 1 q 22 y q 24 φ q 26 ψ f ˆ 2 q 42 y q 44 φ q 46 ψ c 44 φ f ˆ 4 q 62 y q 64 φ q 66 ψ f ˆ 6 the scope is to rewrite a 1 in an equivalent form where the roll motion appears as the solution of a single degree of freedom equation and the coupling with the sway and yaw motions is implicitly embedded in the terms of the roll equation to this end the sway equation first equation of a 1 and yaw equation second equation of a 1 are rearranged as follows a 2 q 22 y q 26 ψ f ˆ 2 q 24 φ q 62 y q 66 ψ f ˆ 6 q 64 φ the first sway equation in a 2 is now multiplied by q 66 the second yaw equation in a 2 is multiplied by q 26 and the two equations are subtracted

equation in a 2 is multiplied by q 62 the second yaw equation in a 2 is multiplied by q 22 and the two equations are subtracted a 4 q 22 q 62 y q 26 q 62 ψ f ˆ 2 q 62 q 24 q 62 φ q 62 q 22 y q 66 q 22

now be rewritten as a 6 y f ˆ 2 q 66 f ˆ 6 q 26 d φ q 64 q 26 q 24 q 66 d ψ f ˆ 6 q 22 f ˆ 2 q 62 d φ q 24 q 62 q 64 q 22 d the sway acceleration y and the yaw acceleration ψ from a 6 can now be inserted into the roll equation of the original coupled system second equation in a 1 leading to a 7 q 42 d f ˆ 2 q 66 f ˆ 6 q 26 φ q 64 q 26 q 24 q 66 q 44 φ q 46 d f ˆ 6 q 22 f ˆ 2 q 62 φ q 24 q 62 q 64 q 22 c 44 φ f ˆ 4 by rearranging the terms in a 7 and by recalling the definition of d in a 5 the roll equation can be finally written as follows a 8 i 44 c ω φ c 44 φ f ˆ 4 c ω with i 44 c ω q 44 q 42 q 24 q 66 q 64 q 26 q 46 q 24 q 62 q 64 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 f ˆ 4 c ω f ˆ 4 f ˆ 2 q 42 q 66 q 46 q 62 f ˆ 6 q 42 q 26 q 46 q 22 q 22 q 66 q 26 q 62 where q i j q i j ω i j 2 4 6 f ˆ i f ˆ i ω i 2 4 6 the solution of the single roll equation a 8 is totally equivalent to the roll motion as obtained by the solution of the original coupled system a 1 while in a 1 the coupling of roll with sway and yaw is explicit in a 8 the same coupling is implicitly embedded through the total inertia term i 44 c and the total forcing moment f ˆ 4 c the roll forcing moment f ˆ 4 c in a 8 provides a forcing magnitude and phase which is such to lead to the same roll response as the original system a 1 moreover the total inertia term i 44 c is such to provide a resonance roll frequency equivalent to the original system a 1 this however is obtained in the approximation of neglecting the damping matrix from the original full linear seakeeping sway roll yaw system see 2 from a hydrodynamic point of view neglecting damping leads to a method which is not fully consistent nevertheless from a dynamics perspective focussing on roll the effect of damping on roll motion is limited to a range of frequencies close to the natural frequency moreover roll damping has a typically small effect on the actual resonance frequency furthermore viscous effects are dominant in case of roll motion which inevitably requires to introduce some additional semi empirical damping term in the motion equation which typically breaks the overall consistency of linear seakeeping equations as a result it appears that the use of a 8 could be justified from a practical application perspective in order to show that the forcing f ˆ 4 c in a 8 provides a reasonably accurate forcing magnitude and that it better represents roll motion forcing compared to the pure froude krylov forcing moment an example application is carried out for the vessel b described in section 3 of the paper the linear roll response has been calculated according to the following approaches fls full linear seakeeping system 2 this approach consistently accounts for all linear hydrodynamic effects fls nod linear seakeeping system of equations neglecting the damping matrix this approach neglects dissipation effects due to wave radiation and corresponds to the solution of a 1 reduced 3dof single degree of freedom roll motion equation as obtained by the reported decoupling procedure this corresponds to using a 8 and the roll response obtained from this approach is equal to the roll response obtained by the fls nod approach described above fk in this approach the forcing in the 1 dof model a 8 is substituted by the pure froude krylov moment calculated with respect to the centre of gravity m ˆ f k g ω in order to guarantee that the roll resonance frequency is the same as the approaches fls nod and reduced 3dof the total moment of inertia is kept as i 44 c as defined in a 8 the resulting mathematical model takes the following form a 9 i 44 c ω φ c 44 φ m ˆ f k g ω for the present example hydrodynamic coefficients and forces have been calculated as in case of fig 1 moreover in this specific case for the sake of higher consistency of comparisons the froude krylov moment m ˆ f k g ω has been calculated using the same strip theory approach as the one used for the determination of hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction forces results of the calculations are shown in figure a 1 in terms of roll transfer function φ k w a w roll amplitude per unit wave slope in addition to the roll transfer function top graph the figure also shows for ease of analysis the effective wave slope coefficient bottom graph calculated according to the reduced 3dof approach and by using the froude krylov moment with respect to the centre of gravity fk figure a 1 vessel b top roll transfer functions using different modelling simplifications bottom effective wave slope coefficient using the reduced 3dof method and using the froude krylov moment with respect to the centre of gravity fk figure a 1 from the results in figure a 1 top it can be seen that as expected models fls nod and reduced 3dof provide the very same roll transfer function the roll transfer function from the reduced 3dof model is also very close to the roll transfer function from the fls model with the exception of the region close to the resonance frequency in that region of frequencies the presence of damping in the fls model limits the roll response whereas this does not happen for fls nod reduced 3dof models due to the neglecting of damping however the observed difference in the roll response in that limited region is given by the resonance of the system and not by a sudden variation of the forcing which is to be considered as a smooth function of the frequency this is confirmed by the smooth behaviour of the effective wave slope coefficients shown in the bottom graph of figure a 1 looking now at the results from the fk model a 9 where the roll forcing is based on the froude krylov moment with respect to the centre of gravity it can be seen that the corresponding roll transfer function is systematically larger than the roll response obtained from all the other models the roll transfer function from the fk model becomes closer to the fls fls nod and reduced 3dof models in the region of very low frequencies i e in the region of long waves and this is in line with outcomes from the studies and considerations by tasai 1965 mizuno 1973 1975 and umeda and tsukamoto 2008 the larger roll transfer function obtained from the model fk indicates an excessive level of forcing and this is confirmed by the comparison of effective wave slope coefficient functions in figure a 1 bottom from the example results for vessel b reported in figure a 1 it appears therefore that the reduced 3dof model is able to provide a level of forcing which is in line with the original fls model also the roll resonance frequency is properly captured by the reduced 3dof model this indicates that the simplification of neglecting the damping terms although hydrodynamically not fully consistent appears to be practically acceptable it is also noted that some comparisons between experimental results and numerical roll predictions based on nonlinear 1 dof roll models making use of the effective wave slope coefficient calculated according to the reduced 3dof method presented herein have been reported for multi hulls bulian and francescutto 2009 and for a conventional hull form bulian et al 2009 in both cases predictions compared well with experiments although more experiments are surely necessary for a wider and more thorough assessment the mentioned results support the numerical analysis shown in figure a 1 indicating that the effective wave slope coefficient determined in accordance with the reduced 3dof method seems to provide a reasonable estimation of the actual magnitude of roll forcing nevertheless as mentioned in the introduction of the paper mizuno 1973 1975 presented a method for determining the effective wave slope coefficient in the case of coupled sway roll in the framework of linear hydrodynamics accounting also for damping but neglecting the coupling with yaw future work will therefore be dedicated to exploring the possible extension of the reduced 3dof approach in order to account also for the effect of potential damping which would also allow for the quantification of the effects of the approximation of neglecting damping appendix b details of vessels in the

22391,ships are periodically dry docked for inspection corrosion elimination and coatings to prevent corrosion of the hull managing the balance between the frequency of costly dry docking and the ship structural safety level is of interests to all relevant stakeholders the structural performance of a ship is uncertain because of the uncertainties associated with external loadings and deteriorating resistance due to corrosion fatigue and other stressors the minimum expected life cycle cost rule and utility theories have been used to develop optimal maintenance planning for ships under uncertainty however the solutions dictated by these theories are inconsistent with the preference of decision makers due to people s subjective perception of uncertainties and consequences this paper investigates the preference over the dry docking interval of corroded ship hull girders using the cumulative prospect theory to this end the reliability analysis and life cycle cost evaluation of the corroded hull girder considering the impact of dry docking maintenance is carried out through monte carlo simulation the effect of risk perception on the selection of dry docking time intervals is illustrated on two ship hull girders keywords corroded hull girder preferred dry docking inspection cumulative prospect theory uncertain decision making 1 introduction a major factor in the deterioration of the ship hull girder is metal loss due to corrosion it accounts for around 90 of ship damage zayed et al 2018 without adequate maintenance corrosion can inevitably reduce the resistance of the hull to the combined loadings of sea waves and still water threatening the integrity of the hull the failure of a ship is catastrophic with direct economic losses potential casualties and environmental impacts corrosion prevention and mitigation is a key task in maintaining ship safety throughout its service life it is mainly accomplished through periodical dry dockings i e minimum of two dry dockings in a period of 5 years cfr 2018 in the dry docking process a ship is taken out of the water the hull surface is exposed washed and recoated steel thickness is measured with non destructive tools and corroded members are renewed if the prescribed residual thickness is reached dry dockings are very effective in managing corrosion risks of the hull girder however the costs incurred during dry docking are significant and the downtime caused by dry dockings results in revenue loss in this regard a longer dry docking time interval is desirable while the structural safety of the hull during this time interval may be adversely affected because of insufficient hull maintenance the importance of developing cost effective ship maintenance planning to ensure the safety of the hull has been highlighted dong and frangopol 2015a garbatov et al 2018 exploring the optimal dry docking time interval is subjected to the uncertainties associated with corrosion growth material and geometric properties and external loadings probabilistic methods are widely utilized to deal with these uncertainties on the basis of reliability information it is often presumed that optimal maintenance planning can be achieved by minimizing the expected life cycle cost melc barone and frangopol 2014 bucher and frangopol 2006 frangopol 1999 2011 frangopol et al 1997 frangopol and das 1999 frangopol and kim 2019 furuta et al 2004 this criterion ensures the economic optimality in a probabilistic context in recent years this rule has been applied to the management of ship hull safety for example decò and frangopol 2013 investigated risk based optimal ship routes considering the effect of corrosion dong and frangopol 2015a explored the optimum maintenance time for a hull girder with corrosion and cracks garbatov et al 2018 introduced a risk based maintenance framework for corroded ship tankers by including a comprehensive failure consequence model considering casualties property losses and oil spills the melc reflects the risk neutral attitude however decision makers can be sensitive to the magnitude of the uncertainty of the life cycle cost a risk taking decision maker prefers potential high yielding returns despite the high likelihood of losses while risk averse decision making emphasizes guaranteed favorable returns the utility theory ut was introduced to incorporate the risk attitudes in decision making it is assumed that decision making is driven by maximizing the expected utility value ang and tang 1984 the utility value is transformed from the consequence by applying linear concave and convex functions for risk neutrality risk aversion and risk taking respectively ang and tang 1984 the application of ut has been reported on ship collisions dong and frangopol 2015b ship grounding liu and frangopol 2018 and hull maintenance liu et al 2019 sabatino and frangopol 2017 the flexibility of using ut as a normative model to select the optimal solution prescribed by the assumed degree of risk attitudes has been well demonstrated through these studies nonetheless decision making under risk is a complex cognitive activity decision makers behavior under uncertainty is not rational as assumed by ut because of their perception of risk from experimental behavioral observations cumulative prospect theory cpt was developed to better model the observations that cannot be explained by ut tversky and kahneman 1992 it is proposed that the subjective evaluation of outcomes is made in terms of the reference point that splits outcomes into gains and losses different utility functions are assigned to gains and losses and weighting functions are introduced to consider subjective distortion of probability the preferred design spectral acceleration for building structures faced with uncertain seismic hazards has been investigated using cpt goda and hong 2008 cha and ellingwood 2014 this study explores the preferred ship dry docking time interval considering risk perception the preference of dry docking planning is assessed by applying cpt to the probability distribution of the ship life cycle cost which is evaluated from the perspective of the ship owner note that the content of this study is an extension of earlier work by the authors on the optimal dry docking planning assuming risk neutral attitudes gong et al 2019 this study focuses on the role of risk perception on the selection of dry docking intervals the remainder of the paper is framed as follows section 2 provides the fundamentals of decision making theories including melc cpt and ut followed by the description of ship reliability formulation and failure consequence evaluation in section 3 in section 4 the preferred dry docking schedules of two illustrative ship hull girders are investigated and the impact of risk perception on the preferred dry docking schedules is studied in detail section 5 provides conclusions 2 decision making under uncertainty the life cycle cost considered in this study includes the dry docking cost structural renewal cost and failure cost it can be expressed in terms of a uniform dry docking interval τ and service life t as 1 c τ t c d τ t c r τ t c f τ t where c d τ t c r τ t and c f τ t are the life cycle dry docking cost the life cycle structural renewal cost and the life cycle failure cost associated with τ and τ respectively c d τ t can be considered deterministic if the cost of one dry docking does not significantly change over time c f τ t is uncertain due to the uncertain performance of the hull c r τ t is also uncertain because of the combinatorial effects of the deterministic condition based steel renewal criterion and the uncertain corrosion propagation in most cases the analytical solutions for c f τ t and c r τ t are intractable this study uses monte carlo simulation to obtain the probability distribution of c τ t it is worth noting that non uniform dry docking schedules can be more economical since new ships intuitively need less frequent inspections however considering non uniform inspections increases the dimension of optimization making the analysis computationally expensive efficient procedures for dealing with this issue will be studied in future studies the focus of this study is to compare the difference in dry docking solutions due to risk perception the assumption of uniform inspection planning is reasonable for this purpose the life cycle cost per unit time is expressed as c u τ t c τ t t the economically optimal dry docking schedule can be achieved by minimizing the expected life cycle cost per unit time 2 e c τ t j 1 n c j τ t p j where e is the expectation operation c j τ t is the jth possible outcome of c u τ t n is the number of possible outcomes p j is the probability of the jth possible outcome the melc does not necessarily result in the maximum satisfaction of decision makers this is addressed by cpt developed from psychological and behavioral experiments tversky and kahneman 1992 cpt incorporates the emotional and cognitive factors in describing the preference of decision makers over risky alternatives it evaluates the risk using a value function and a probability weighting function tversky and kahneman 1992 the value function describes the desirability of an outcome instead of taking the sum of the monetary outcomes the value function distinguishes gains and losses with a reference point the reference point represents the decision makers expectation of future outcomes kőszegi and rabin 2006 the life cycle cost relative to a reference point r is defined as c rj τ t r c j τ t j 1 2 n suppose that c rj τ t is ranked in ascending order then decision makers under cpt select the dry docking interval that results in the maximum expected prospect value 3 e v τ t j 1 m π j v 0 c r j τ t j m 1 n π j v 0 c r j τ t where c rj τ t j 1 m 0 c rj τ t j m 1 n 0 v 0 is the prospect function π j j 1 m and π j j m 1 n are decision weights for losses and gains respectively the decision weight function provided by tversky and kahneman 1992 is related to the probability weighting function w p j w p j is inverse s shaped see fig 1 accounting for the empirical observation that decision makers subjectively overweight small probabilities and underweight moderate and high probabilities the value function v 0 x suggested by tversky and kahneman 1992 is convex for losses x 0 and concave for gains x 0 see fig 2 which accommodates the observed people s risk taking and risk averse behaviors for losses and gains respectively the convex function is steeper describing that decision makers can be more sensitive to losses than gains or vice versa with the value of x away from zero the sensitivity of the value function with respect to x is diminishing modeling the fact that people are less sensitive to the changes in the distance far from the reference point the parameters of the probability weighting function and value function were inferred from artificial gambling experiments with small stakes tversky and kahneman 1992 note that the parameters obtained in controlled environments may not represent the real life situation for decision making problems in different fields the feasibility of the cpt parameters by tversky and kahneman 1992 should be verified due to the lack of such investigation the parameters suggested by tversky and kahneman 1992 are adopted in this paper if the probability weighting function is linear 0 1 0 1 cpt is equivalent to ut for risk taking attitudes if r 0 and for risk averse attitudes if r is greater than all possible outcomes of the life cycle cost this feature allows to quantitatively assess the impact of the nonlinear probability weighting on the preferred dry docking interval by comparing the solutions under cpt and ut finally it is important to emphasize the differences between solutions dictated by these risky decision making rules ut specifies the solution a rational decision maker with a given risk attitude should select melc is a special case of ut assuming risk neutral attitude aimed at achieving economic optimality and cpt predicts the actual choices 3 reliability and life cycle cost analysis 3 1 reliability analysis under the vertical bending moment due to still water and sea waves the dominant failure mode of the ship hull girder is the plastic collapse of the cross section at midship the ultimate limit state function associated with the plastic collapse of the hull girder is guedes soares 1996 4 g γ u μ u γ sw μ sw γ w γ w n μ we where μ u is the ultimate vertical bending capacity μ sw is the maximum still water induced bending moment during one voyage μ we is the annual maximum wave induced bending moment γ u γ sw γ w and γ w n account for the model uncertainties associated with the bending capacity still water load sea wave load and non linear hull responses under sea wave respectively the ultimate vertical bending strength of a hull girder can be approximated by using empirical formulas by paik and mansour 1995 it assumes that the hull failure occurs when the tensile flange of the cross section yields and the compressive flange collapses this formula provides an efficient and fairly accurate evaluation of ship strength the still water induced bending moment is caused by the unbalanced load distribution of the weight of the cargo and ship and water buoyancy through a statistical analysis of a representative set of oil tankers hørte et al 2007 and teixeira et al 2013 found that the maximum still water induced bending moment is normally distributed with the mean 0 7μ sw 0 and cov of 28 6 where μ sw 0 is the bending moment in the ship loading manual and is herein assumed equal to the maximum bending moment in the rule iacs 2012 the sea wave induced bending moment is the result of the dynamic interaction between the longitudinal distributed buoyancy forces and the ship hull girder the annual maximum wave induced bending moment can be characterized by a gumbel distribution gaspar et al 2016 5 f m w e m w e exp exp m w e λ 0 θ 0 where λ 0 μ w max ln n c ln10 8 and θ 0 μ w max ln10 8 are the characteristic value and the scale parameter of gumbel distribution respectively μ w max is the design bending moment of sea waves in the rule iacs 2012 n c is the expected number of sea wave cycles within a reference time period t re 1 year the time duration of a full load a partial load and a ballast load condition accounts for 35 15 and 35 of one year period time gaspar et al 2016 the probabilities of the hull girder failure in sagging and hogging are dominated by the full load condition and the ballast load condition respectively therefore the expected number of wave cycles can be approximated by n c 0 35 t re t w where t w 8s is the representative wave period of the north atlantic crossing teixeira et al 2013 3 2 condition based renewal of corroded structural elements in assessing the reliability of a hull girder and its life cycle cost the effects of the periodical dry docking maintenance on improving hull performance should be properly accounted for typical forms of corrosion of ship structures are general corrosion pitting edge corrosion and grooving iacs 2012 general corrosion which is uniformly distributed on the steel surface is the most common corrosion type guedes soares et al 2009 this form of corrosion is addressed in this paper it is recommended that the corroded structural element should be renewed during the dry docking inspection if the average of remaining thickness is less than t as built t was t ad where t as built is as built thickness of the structural element t was is the sum of single side wastage allowance rounded to the nearest 0 5 mm and t ad 0 5 mm is the additional wastage allowance accounting for corrosion growth for a 2 5 years inspection interval iacs 2012 this maintenance policy represents a common industry practice and is considered in the monte carlo simulation however t ad is assumed to be zero since the dry docking interval τ is varied in this study not fixed at 2 5 years renewed structural elements are required to have a material strength and thickness greater than or equal to those of as built ones therefore one can simply assume that a renewed member is as good as the original coating the renewed structural elements can delay the time of corrosion initialization and recoating the corroded element inhibits corrosion aggression for a certain period of time the effect of the dry docking maintenance on the thickness of a structural element is schematically illustrated in fig 3 3 3 life cycle cost evaluation the life cycle cost in eq 1 can be evaluated as follows 6 c τ t j 1 n i n c p 1 v τ j j 1 n i n c r j 1 v τ j l 1 n f c f 1 v τ l where c p one dry docking cost c r j structural renewal cost at the j th dry docking c f ship failure consequence n in number of dry docking inspections n f number of failure events v discount rate of money τ j jth dry docking inspection time and τ l time of the lth failure the dry docking cost includes the dock rental fees coating cost operation cost sonak et al 2010 among others estimating the dry docking cost is not easy because the dry docking cost varies by location economic climate and market demands butler 2012 the dry docking cost is dealt with through parametric analysis in this study the renewal cost of structural elements can be approximated using the formula by rahman and caldwell 1995 considering the consumption of labors and materials for a stiffened panel composed of several longitudinally stiffened plates the following expression can be used to calculate its cost 7 c panel c pl c st c we c in c ele where c pl cost of plating materials c st cost of materials for longitudinal stiffeners c we cost of welding stiffeners c in cost of intersections and preparation of brackets and joints c ele cost of electricity electrodes and fabrication cost of stiffeners the expressions for the cost item in eq 7 are given in rigterink et al 2013 the plastic collapse of the hull girder at midship leads to the direct loss of the ship loss of cargo oil spill and loss of life of crew members the cost of failure of a ship is assessed in terms of these four aspects the cost of the loss of a ship is assumed to equal the initial ship construction cost the cost of the cargo loss can be calculated as guia et al 2018 8 c c p p dwt c oil where p p 20 denotes the percentage of oil spilled dwt denotes the deadweight of the ship c oil 538 is the cost of oil per ton the cost of the oil spill refers to the cost of cleaning up oil spills expressed as guia et al 2018 9 c s p p p sl dwt cats where p sl 10 is the probability of spilled oil drifting to the shoreline the cost of averting a ton of oil split cats is 60 000 the cost of crew fatalities is approximately guia et al 2018 10 c l n crew p life icaf where n crew 25 is the expected number of crew members p life 16 is the probability of loss of life the implied cost of averting a fatality icaf is 3 07m 4 case studies 4 1 general the application of cpt to select the preferred dry docking time interval is demonstrated on a very large crude carrier vlcc and a double hull tanker the preferred solutions by cpt are compared with the optimal solutions prescribed by ut and melc to quantify the impact of subjective perception of risk in each analysis the dry docking inspection time interval is varied from 1 to 24 years using an increment of one year and cpt ut and melc are applied to the probability distributions of the life cycle costs associated with these 24 intervals to identify the preferred or optimal solutions as mentioned previously the reference point r in cpt describes the expectation by decision makers the value of this point is subjective and depends on the individual decision maker parametric analysis is conducted by assuming r 0 and r 100m in the case r 0 all possible outcomes of the life cycle cost per unit time are framed as losses toward which risk taking attitudes are undertaken r 100m implies that decision makers are overly pessimistic and expect a significant large life cycle cost in this case based on the analysis results all outcomes can be considered as gains therefore the results obtained from r 0 and r 100m by cpt are equivalent to those associated with risk taking and risk averse in ut respectively if a linear probability weighting function is assumed for cpt the scenario with mixed outcomes is not investigated since the life cycle cost associated with different dry docking intervals varies and it is difficult to find a specific value of r that guarantees mixed outcomes for all analyzed cases the thickness of the flange web and plate of each structural element is assumed normally distributed with means equal to their nominal values and coefficient of variation cov of 5 gaspar and guedes soares 2013 other geometric variables are assumed to be deterministic young modulus is assumed lognormally distributed with mean 206 000 n mm2 and cov 3 dong and frangopol 2015a γ sw γ w and γ w n in eq 4 have unit mean the covs of γ sw γ w and γ w n are 0 10 hussein and guedes soares 2009 the cov of γ u is 0 15 mansour and howen 1994 all these variables follow normal distribution with unit mean a linear corrosion growth model is assumed for the evolution of corrosion depth the annual corrosion follows the weibull distribution with mean values of 0 065 0 03 and 0 17 mm year and the covs of 0 5 0 1 and 0 5 for the deck the side and the double bottom respectively akpan et al 2002 it is considered that the coating life is 11 3 and 3 years for the deck the side and the double bottom respectively based on the statistical results reported by zayed et al 2018 it is further assumed that the annual corrosion growth rates associated with the same type of structural members i e the outer bottom inner bottom deck and sides are fully correlated and those corresponding to different member types are independent the variables of geometric and material properties associated with different structural members are fully correlated the analysis by gong and frangopol 2019 indicates that the assumption of dependence of variables has little impact on reliability of ship hull girder for each case analyzed one million simulations trials are employed to construct the probability distribution of the ship life cycle cost 4 2 vlcc the hull girder section of the vlcc at midship is shown in fig 4 adapted from khan and parmentier 2006 the values of wastage allowance t was at different locations of this corrosion section are shown in fig 5 the deadweight of this ship is 216 269 tons the block coefficient is assumed to be c b 0 73 the yield strength of steel material is assumed to be lognormally distributed with mean of 348 mpa and cov of 6 gaspar and guedes soares 2013 it is further assumed that the construction cost is 120m narula 2019 failure cost is estimated at 396m using eqs 8 10 fig 6 a illustrates the expected prospect values considering that the dry dock cost c p is 0 2m and the discount rate v is 0 5 for easy comparison the values of e v τ t are scaled to 0 and 0 5 for cpt r 0 and 100m respectively and to 1 0 and 1 5 for ut with risk taking and risk averse attitudes respectively for comparison with the economically optimal solutions the values of e c τ t are plotted in fig 6b the preferred dry docking interval suggested by cpt the optimal associated with ut and the economically optimal are the same i e 3 years risk perception does not influence the selected solution for this case in the case of cpt as the reference cost r increases from 0 to 100m the values of e v τ t become less sensitive to the dry docking inspection interval τ this is attributed to the diminished sensitivity of the value function the same reason can be also used to explain the reduced sensitivity of the values of e v τ t in the case of ut for risk averse attitudes compared with risk taking attitudes by comparing the values of e v τ t associated with cpt for r 0 100m and ut for risk taking risk averse it is found that cpt results in a higher sensitivity of the values of e v τ t to dry docking interval since the only difference between cpt and ut when same value functions are assumed i e concave or convex lies in the adopted probability weighting function it is clear that the increased sensitivity associated with cpt is caused by the nonlinear probability weighting the analysis that generates the results in fig 6a and 6b are repeated by considering c p 0 8m the obtained results are shown in figs 6c and 6d it is shown that the observation in fig 6a about the change in the sensitivity of e v τ t to the dry docking interval due to the selected probability weighting function and the reference cost is also applicable to fig 6c this figure shows that the preferred intervals under cpt are 4 and 3 years for r 0 and 100m respectively the fact that r 0 leads to a longer dry docking interval makes sense due to the convex value function i e risk taking over all life cycle cost outcomes the optimal dry docking interval corresponding to ut for risk taking risk averse is 5 4 years which is longer than that corresponding to cpt for r 0 100m this suggests that the nonlinear probability weighting reduces the optimal dry docking interval fig 6d indicates that the economically optimal interval is 4 years shorter than that associated with ut for risk taking but equal to that by cpt for r 0 this implies that although the convex value tends to increase the interval the impact of nonlinear probability weighting on reducing the interval can be more significant the ship owner may extend a ship service life beyond its design life to quantify the sensitivity of the implied dry docking interval under cpt to an extended service time of 15 years the analysis for fig 6 is repeated considering t 40 years the calculated results are presented in fig 7 fig 7a depicts the desirability of solutions associated with cpt and ut when c p 0 2m and fig 7b shows the expected life cycle costs all the decision making rules point to the same optimal dry docking intervals of 3 years which are the same as those given in fig 6a and b when t 25 years if c p 0 8m the optimal solution under the melc as shown in fig 7d is 5 years which agrees with cpt for r 0 and ut in fig 7c the preferred solution under cpt for r 100m is 3 years shorter than that by ut for risk averse again revealing the impact of the nonlinear probability weighting function on reducing the dry docking interval as observed in fig 6c furthermore the fitted curves of e v τ t in fig 7a and 7c again indicate the impact of nonlinear probability weighing on increasing the sensitivity of e v τ t to the dry docking interval it is worth noting that there exits jaggedness in the fitted curve of e c τ t in fig 7d for example the value of e c τ t associated with the dry docking interval τ 12 years is greater than that corresponding to τ 14 years a similar observation has been reported and explained in the application of the condition based maintenance methodologies by hong et al 2014 and zhang and zhou 2014 the reason behind can be explained by the fact that the corroded steel that does not satisfy the renewal criterion at the dry docking inspections associated with τ 12 years may cause failures while the maintenance associated with τ 14 years repairs critical corroded member and makes the hull safer the analysis for figs 6 and 7 is repeated considering v equal to 5 the obtained optimal dry docking interval associated with the different decision making rules are listed in table 1 for t 25 years and in table 2 for t 40 years and are compared with those from figs 6 and 7 for v 0 5 the discount rate of money does not change the optimal dry docking interval dictated by different decision making rules for all analyzed cases when c p 0 8m and t 25 years the increase in the value of c p increases the optimal dry docking interval dictated by the same decision making rule for all cases in tables 1 and 2 except for cpt when r 100m this can be simply explained by noting that the values of the life cycle costs relative to r 100m are far from the origin of the value function and the value function is insensitive to the changes in the life cycle cost as the value of c p increases from 0 2m to 0 8m another notable observation in tables 1 and 2 is that the optimal solution associated with ut for risk taking can be larger than the economical optimal solutions e g when t 25 years c p 0 8m and v 0 5 while all preferred dry docking time intervals by cpt despite risk taking assumed over all outcomes i e when r 0 are less than or equal to the solutions associated with melc 4 3 double hull tanker the cross section at midship of the double hull tanker adapted from hu et al 2004 is shown in fig 8 the values of the wastage allowance are illustrated in fig 9 the block coefficient is assumed c b 0 8 the yield strength of steel material is lognormally distributed with the mean of 269 mpa and cov of 8 gaspar and guedes soares 2013 the deadweight of the ship is assumed dwt 40 000 tons this assumption makes senses considering the length of the hull guo et al 2008 it is further assumed that the construction cost is 42m the geometric properties of the stiffened plates are provided in hu et al 2004 from eqs 8 10 the cost of failure is 108m the values of e v τ t and e c τ t are plotted in fig 10 a and b respectively considering t 25 years c p 0 2m and v 0 5 the preferred dry docking intervals suggested by cpt are 5 years for r 0m and 4 years for r 100m and the optimal dry docking interval under the melc i e 5 years the optimal solutions prescribed by ut are 9 and 5 years for risk taking and risk averse respectively comparing the solutions by cpt for r 0 100m and ut for risk taking risk averse again suggests that conservatism is embedded in cpt by nonlinearly weighting probability fig 10c and d shows the values of e v τ t and e c τ t respectively considering c p 0 8m the preferred by cpt with r 0 the optimal by ut with risk averse attitude and the economically optimal by melc are 13 years while cpt with r 100m suggested the interval of 5 years furthermore similar to the observations in fig 6a and c and in fig 7a and c the nonlinear probability weighting function in cpt increases the sensitivity of the values of e v τ t to the dry docking as shown in fig 10a and c tables 3 and 4 summarize the suggested solutions by cpt ut and melc for t 25 years and 40 years respectively where c p 0 2m and 0 8m and v 0 5 and 5 are considered it is seen that the use of concave value function alone i e ut for risk averse does not reduce the dry docking intervals compared with the melc for all analyzed cases combining the nonlinear probability weighting with the concave value function i e cpt for r 100m can lead to shorter dry docking intervals for example the suggested solutions corresponding to melc and ut in the case t 40 years and c p 0 8m are 8 10 years and those corresponding to cpt for r 100m are 4 5 years for v 0 5 5 see table 4 all preferred dry docking intervals under cpt are shorter or equal to the economically optimal by melc comparing the results in tables 3 and 4 and those in tables 1 and 2 reveals that the impact of considering risk perception as characterized by the difference in the suggested solutions by cpt or ut and melc is more significant for the double hull tanker this might be explained by the fact that the expected life cycle cost of the double hull tanker is insensitive to the dry docking interval around the economically optimal solution in this context the magnitude of uncertainty of the life cycle cost impacts the optimal solution under cpt and ut for a given inspection schedule the failure probability of the vlcc is consistently higher than that of the double hull tanker with a forecast period of 25 years the maximum annual failure probability corresponding to τ 5 years is 2 10 3 and 5 10 4 for the vlcc and double hull tanker respectively 5 conclusions the preferred dry docking time intervals of two corroding hull girders under uncertainty are investigated considering risk perception using cpt the probability distribution of the life cycle cost accounting for the effects of realistic condition based steel renewal practices is computed by monte carlo simulation the impact of the value function or the nonlinear probability weighting in cpt on the selection of dry docking intervals is investigated by comparing the solutions associated with cpt with those associated with ut and melc the following conclusions are drawn 1 the preferred dry docking intervals under cpt can be different from the economically optimal solutions by melc cpt can lead to a preferred dry docking time interval significantly shorter than that associated with melc the impact of the probability weighting on reducing the dry docking interval associated with melc can be more pronounced than the value function even though the value function is single sided and convex i e risk taking the dry docking intervals under cpt are not longer than those associated with melc this raises the caution for applying melc to determine the ship maintenance planning in the presence of uncertainties 2 if the same single sided value function is utilized for cpt and ut the nonlinear probability weighting is responsible for an increase in the sensitivity of the expected prospect value to the dry docking interval associated with cpt compared to that associated with ut 3 the reference point can affect the preference of dry docking interval by defining the shape of the value function a convex value function i e risk taking alone can result in a longer dry docking interval compared to melc however the concave value function i e risk averse without nonlinearly weighting probability is not found to lead to dry dock intervals different from those associated with melc 4 the impact of risk perceptions on the suggested solution depends on the ship hull analyzed in the two case studies analyzed the impact is

22391,ships are periodically dry docked for inspection corrosion elimination and coatings to prevent corrosion of the hull managing the balance between the frequency of costly dry docking and the ship structural safety level is of interests to all relevant stakeholders the structural performance of a ship is uncertain because of the uncertainties associated with external loadings and deteriorating resistance due to corrosion fatigue and other stressors the minimum expected life cycle cost rule and utility theories have been used to develop optimal maintenance planning for ships under uncertainty however the solutions dictated by these theories are inconsistent with the preference of decision makers due to people s subjective perception of uncertainties and consequences this paper investigates the preference over the dry docking interval of corroded ship hull girders using the cumulative prospect theory to this end the reliability analysis and life cycle cost evaluation of the corroded hull girder considering the impact of dry docking maintenance is carried out through monte carlo simulation the effect of risk perception on the selection of dry docking time intervals is illustrated on two ship hull girders keywords corroded hull girder preferred dry docking inspection cumulative prospect theory uncertain decision making 1 introduction a major factor in the deterioration of the ship hull girder is metal loss due to corrosion it accounts for around 90 of ship damage zayed et al 2018 without adequate maintenance corrosion can inevitably reduce the resistance of the hull to the combined loadings of sea waves and still water threatening the integrity of the hull the failure of a ship is catastrophic with direct economic losses potential casualties and environmental impacts corrosion prevention and mitigation is a key task in maintaining ship safety throughout its service life it is mainly accomplished through periodical dry dockings i e minimum of two dry dockings in a period of 5 years cfr 2018 in the dry docking process a ship is taken out of the water the hull surface is exposed washed and recoated steel thickness is measured with non destructive tools and corroded members are renewed if the prescribed residual thickness is reached dry dockings are very effective in managing corrosion risks of the hull girder however the costs incurred during dry docking are significant and the downtime caused by dry dockings results in revenue loss in this regard a longer dry docking time interval is desirable while the structural safety of the hull during this time interval may be adversely affected because of insufficient hull maintenance the importance of developing cost effective ship maintenance planning to ensure the safety of the hull has been highlighted dong and frangopol 2015a garbatov et al 2018 exploring the optimal dry docking time interval is subjected to the uncertainties associated with corrosion growth material and geometric properties and external loadings probabilistic methods are widely utilized to deal with these uncertainties on the basis of reliability information it is often presumed that optimal maintenance planning can be achieved by minimizing the expected life cycle cost melc barone and frangopol 2014 bucher and frangopol 2006 frangopol 1999 2011 frangopol et al 1997 frangopol and das 1999 frangopol and kim 2019 furuta et al 2004 this criterion ensures the economic optimality in a probabilistic context in recent years this rule has been applied to the management of ship hull safety for example decò and frangopol 2013 investigated risk based optimal ship routes considering the effect of corrosion dong and frangopol 2015a explored the optimum maintenance time for a hull girder with corrosion and cracks garbatov et al 2018 introduced a risk based maintenance framework for corroded ship tankers by including a comprehensive failure consequence model considering casualties property losses and oil spills the melc reflects the risk neutral attitude however decision makers can be sensitive to the magnitude of the uncertainty of the life cycle cost a risk taking decision maker prefers potential high yielding returns despite the high likelihood of losses while risk averse decision making emphasizes guaranteed favorable returns the utility theory ut was introduced to incorporate the risk attitudes in decision making it is assumed that decision making is driven by maximizing the expected utility value ang and tang 1984 the utility value is transformed from the consequence by applying linear concave and convex functions for risk neutrality risk aversion and risk taking respectively ang and tang 1984 the application of ut has been reported on ship collisions dong and frangopol 2015b ship grounding liu and frangopol 2018 and hull maintenance liu et al 2019 sabatino and frangopol 2017 the flexibility of using ut as a normative model to select the optimal solution prescribed by the assumed degree of risk attitudes has been well demonstrated through these studies nonetheless decision making under risk is a complex cognitive activity decision makers behavior under uncertainty is not rational as assumed by ut because of their perception of risk from experimental behavioral observations cumulative prospect theory cpt was developed to better model the observations that cannot be explained by ut tversky and kahneman 1992 it is proposed that the subjective evaluation of outcomes is made in terms of the reference point that splits outcomes into gains and losses different utility functions are assigned to gains and losses and weighting functions are introduced to consider subjective distortion of probability the preferred design spectral acceleration for building structures faced with uncertain seismic hazards has been investigated using cpt goda and hong 2008 cha and ellingwood 2014 this study explores the preferred ship dry docking time interval considering risk perception the preference of dry docking planning is assessed by applying cpt to the probability distribution of the ship life cycle cost which is evaluated from the perspective of the ship owner note that the content of this study is an extension of earlier work by the authors on the optimal dry docking planning assuming risk neutral attitudes gong et al 2019 this study focuses on the role of risk perception on the selection of dry docking intervals the remainder of the paper is framed as follows section 2 provides the fundamentals of decision making theories including melc cpt and ut followed by the description of ship reliability formulation and failure consequence evaluation in section 3 in section 4 the preferred dry docking schedules of two illustrative ship hull girders are investigated and the impact of risk perception on the preferred dry docking schedules is studied in detail section 5 provides conclusions 2 decision making under uncertainty the life cycle cost considered in this study includes the dry docking cost structural renewal cost and failure cost it can be expressed in terms of a uniform dry docking interval τ and service life t as 1 c τ t c d τ t c r τ t c f τ t where c d τ t c r τ t and c f τ t are the life cycle dry docking cost the life cycle structural renewal cost and the life cycle failure cost associated with τ and τ respectively c d τ t can be considered deterministic if the cost of one dry docking does not significantly change over time c f τ t is uncertain due to the uncertain performance of the hull c r τ t is also uncertain because of the combinatorial effects of the deterministic condition based steel renewal criterion and the uncertain corrosion propagation in most cases the analytical solutions for c f τ t and c r τ t are intractable this study uses monte carlo simulation to obtain the probability distribution of c τ t it is worth noting that non uniform dry docking schedules can be more economical since new ships intuitively need less frequent inspections however considering non uniform inspections increases the dimension of optimization making the analysis computationally expensive efficient procedures for dealing with this issue will be studied in future studies the focus of this study is to compare the difference in dry docking solutions due to risk perception the assumption of uniform inspection planning is reasonable for this purpose the life cycle cost per unit time is expressed as c u τ t c τ t t the economically optimal dry docking schedule can be achieved by minimizing the expected life cycle cost per unit time 2 e c τ t j 1 n c j τ t p j where e is the expectation operation c j τ t is the jth possible outcome of c u τ t n is the number of possible outcomes p j is the probability of the jth possible outcome the melc does not necessarily result in the maximum satisfaction of decision makers this is addressed by cpt developed from psychological and behavioral experiments tversky and kahneman 1992 cpt incorporates the emotional and cognitive factors in describing the preference of decision makers over risky alternatives it evaluates the risk using a value function and a probability weighting function tversky and kahneman 1992 the value function describes the desirability of an outcome instead of taking the sum of the monetary outcomes the value function distinguishes gains and losses with a reference point the reference point represents the decision makers expectation of future outcomes kőszegi and rabin 2006 the life cycle cost relative to a reference point r is defined as c rj τ t r c j τ t j 1 2 n suppose that c rj τ t is ranked in ascending order then decision makers under cpt select the dry docking interval that results in the maximum expected prospect value 3 e v τ t j 1 m π j v 0 c r j τ t j m 1 n π j v 0 c r j τ t where c rj τ t j 1 m 0 c rj τ t j m 1 n 0 v 0 is the prospect function π j j 1 m and π j j m 1 n are decision weights for losses and gains respectively the decision weight function provided by tversky and kahneman 1992 is related to the probability weighting function w p j w p j is inverse s shaped see fig 1 accounting for the empirical observation that decision makers subjectively overweight small probabilities and underweight moderate and high probabilities the value function v 0 x suggested by tversky and kahneman 1992 is convex for losses x 0 and concave for gains x 0 see fig 2 which accommodates the observed people s risk taking and risk averse behaviors for losses and gains respectively the convex function is steeper describing that decision makers can be more sensitive to losses than gains or vice versa with the value of x away from zero the sensitivity of the value function with respect to x is diminishing modeling the fact that people are less sensitive to the changes in the distance far from the reference point the parameters of the probability weighting function and value function were inferred from artificial gambling experiments with small stakes tversky and kahneman 1992 note that the parameters obtained in controlled environments may not represent the real life situation for decision making problems in different fields the feasibility of the cpt parameters by tversky and kahneman 1992 should be verified due to the lack of such investigation the parameters suggested by tversky and kahneman 1992 are adopted in this paper if the probability weighting function is linear 0 1 0 1 cpt is equivalent to ut for risk taking attitudes if r 0 and for risk averse attitudes if r is greater than all possible outcomes of the life cycle cost this feature allows to quantitatively assess the impact of the nonlinear probability weighting on the preferred dry docking interval by comparing the solutions under cpt and ut finally it is important to emphasize the differences between solutions dictated by these risky decision making rules ut specifies the solution a rational decision maker with a given risk attitude should select melc is a special case of ut assuming risk neutral attitude aimed at achieving economic optimality and cpt predicts the actual choices 3 reliability and life cycle cost analysis 3 1 reliability analysis under the vertical bending moment due to still water and sea waves the dominant failure mode of the ship hull girder is the plastic collapse of the cross section at midship the ultimate limit state function associated with the plastic collapse of the hull girder is guedes soares 1996 4 g γ u μ u γ sw μ sw γ w γ w n μ we where μ u is the ultimate vertical bending capacity μ sw is the maximum still water induced bending moment during one voyage μ we is the annual maximum wave induced bending moment γ u γ sw γ w and γ w n account for the model uncertainties associated with the bending capacity still water load sea wave load and non linear hull responses under sea wave respectively the ultimate vertical bending strength of a hull girder can be approximated by using empirical formulas by paik and mansour 1995 it assumes that the hull failure occurs when the tensile flange of the cross section yields and the compressive flange collapses this formula provides an efficient and fairly accurate evaluation of ship strength the still water induced bending moment is caused by the unbalanced load distribution of the weight of the cargo and ship and water buoyancy through a statistical analysis of a representative set of oil tankers hørte et al 2007 and teixeira et al 2013 found that the maximum still water induced bending moment is normally distributed with the mean 0 7μ sw 0 and cov of 28 6 where μ sw 0 is the bending moment in the ship loading manual and is herein assumed equal to the maximum bending moment in the rule iacs 2012 the sea wave induced bending moment is the result of the dynamic interaction between the longitudinal distributed buoyancy forces and the ship hull girder the annual maximum wave induced bending moment can be characterized by a gumbel distribution gaspar et al 2016 5 f m w e m w e exp exp m w e λ 0 θ 0 where λ 0 μ w max ln n c ln10 8 and θ 0 μ w max ln10 8 are the characteristic value and the scale parameter of gumbel distribution respectively μ w max is the design bending moment of sea waves in the rule iacs 2012 n c is the expected number of sea wave cycles within a reference time period t re 1 year the time duration of a full load a partial load and a ballast load condition accounts for 35 15 and 35 of one year period time gaspar et al 2016 the probabilities of the hull girder failure in sagging and hogging are dominated by the full load condition and the ballast load condition respectively therefore the expected number of wave cycles can be approximated by n c 0 35 t re t w where t w 8s is the representative wave period of the north atlantic crossing teixeira et al 2013 3 2 condition based renewal of corroded structural elements in assessing the reliability of a hull girder and its life cycle cost the effects of the periodical dry docking maintenance on improving hull performance should be properly accounted for typical forms of corrosion of ship structures are general corrosion pitting edge corrosion and grooving iacs 2012 general corrosion which is uniformly distributed on the steel surface is the most common corrosion type guedes soares et al 2009 this form of corrosion is addressed in this paper it is recommended that the corroded structural element should be renewed during the dry docking inspection if the average of remaining thickness is less than t as built t was t ad where t as built is as built thickness of the structural element t was is the sum of single side wastage allowance rounded to the nearest 0 5 mm and t ad 0 5 mm is the additional wastage allowance accounting for corrosion growth for a 2 5 years inspection interval iacs 2012 this maintenance policy represents a common industry practice and is considered in the monte carlo simulation however t ad is assumed to be zero since the dry docking interval τ is varied in this study not fixed at 2 5 years renewed structural elements are required to have a material strength and thickness greater than or equal to those of as built ones therefore one can simply assume that a renewed member is as good as the original coating the renewed structural elements can delay the time of corrosion initialization and recoating the corroded element inhibits corrosion aggression for a certain period of time the effect of the dry docking maintenance on the thickness of a structural element is schematically illustrated in fig 3 3 3 life cycle cost evaluation the life cycle cost in eq 1 can be evaluated as follows 6 c τ t j 1 n i n c p 1 v τ j j 1 n i n c r j 1 v τ j l 1 n f c f 1 v τ l where c p one dry docking cost c r j structural renewal cost at the j th dry docking c f ship failure consequence n in number of dry docking inspections n f number of failure events v discount rate of money τ j jth dry docking inspection time and τ l time of the lth failure the dry docking cost includes the dock rental fees coating cost operation cost sonak et al 2010 among others estimating the dry docking cost is not easy because the dry docking cost varies by location economic climate and market demands butler 2012 the dry docking cost is dealt with through parametric analysis in this study the renewal cost of structural elements can be approximated using the formula by rahman and caldwell 1995 considering the consumption of labors and materials for a stiffened panel composed of several longitudinally stiffened plates the following expression can be used to calculate its cost 7 c panel c pl c st c we c in c ele where c pl cost of plating materials c st cost of materials for longitudinal stiffeners c we cost of welding stiffeners c in cost of intersections and preparation of brackets and joints c ele cost of electricity electrodes and fabrication cost of stiffeners the expressions for the cost item in eq 7 are given in rigterink et al 2013 the plastic collapse of the hull girder at midship leads to the direct loss of the ship loss of cargo oil spill and loss of life of crew members the cost of failure of a ship is assessed in terms of these four aspects the cost of the loss of a ship is assumed to equal the initial ship construction cost the cost of the cargo loss can be calculated as guia et al 2018 8 c c p p dwt c oil where p p 20 denotes the percentage of oil spilled dwt denotes the deadweight of the ship c oil 538 is the cost of oil per ton the cost of the oil spill refers to the cost of cleaning up oil spills expressed as guia et al 2018 9 c s p p p sl dwt cats where p sl 10 is the probability of spilled oil drifting to the shoreline the cost of averting a ton of oil split cats is 60 000 the cost of crew fatalities is approximately guia et al 2018 10 c l n crew p life icaf where n crew 25 is the expected number of crew members p life 16 is the probability of loss of life the implied cost of averting a fatality icaf is 3 07m 4 case studies 4 1 general the application of cpt to select the preferred dry docking time interval is demonstrated on a very large crude carrier vlcc and a double hull tanker the preferred solutions by cpt are compared with the optimal solutions prescribed by ut and melc to quantify the impact of subjective perception of risk in each analysis the dry docking inspection time interval is varied from 1 to 24 years using an increment of one year and cpt ut and melc are applied to the probability distributions of the life cycle costs associated with these 24 intervals to identify the preferred or optimal solutions as mentioned previously the reference point r in cpt describes the expectation by decision makers the value of this point is subjective and depends on the individual decision maker parametric analysis is conducted by assuming r 0 and r 100m in the case r 0 all possible outcomes of the life cycle cost per unit time are framed as losses toward which risk taking attitudes are undertaken r 100m implies that decision makers are overly pessimistic and expect a significant large life cycle cost in this case based on the analysis results all outcomes can be considered as gains therefore the results obtained from r 0 and r 100m by cpt are equivalent to those associated with risk taking and risk averse in ut respectively if a linear probability weighting function is assumed for cpt the scenario with mixed outcomes is not investigated since the life cycle cost associated with different dry docking intervals varies and it is difficult to find a specific value of r that guarantees mixed outcomes for all analyzed cases the thickness of the flange web and plate of each structural element is assumed normally distributed with means equal to their nominal values and coefficient of variation cov of 5 gaspar and guedes soares 2013 other geometric variables are assumed to be deterministic young modulus is assumed lognormally distributed with mean 206 000 n mm2 and cov 3 dong and frangopol 2015a γ sw γ w and γ w n in eq 4 have unit mean the covs of γ sw γ w and γ w n are 0 10 hussein and guedes soares 2009 the cov of γ u is 0 15 mansour and howen 1994 all these variables follow normal distribution with unit mean a linear corrosion growth model is assumed for the evolution of corrosion depth the annual corrosion follows the weibull distribution with mean values of 0 065 0 03 and 0 17 mm year and the covs of 0 5 0 1 and 0 5 for the deck the side and the double bottom respectively akpan et al 2002 it is considered that the coating life is 11 3 and 3 years for the deck the side and the double bottom respectively based on the statistical results reported by zayed et al 2018 it is further assumed that the annual corrosion growth rates associated with the same type of structural members i e the outer bottom inner bottom deck and sides are fully correlated and those corresponding to different member types are independent the variables of geometric and material properties associated with different structural members are fully correlated the analysis by gong and frangopol 2019 indicates that the assumption of dependence of variables has little impact on reliability of ship hull girder for each case analyzed one million simulations trials are employed to construct the probability distribution of the ship life cycle cost 4 2 vlcc the hull girder section of the vlcc at midship is shown in fig 4 adapted from khan and parmentier 2006 the values of wastage allowance t was at different locations of this corrosion section are shown in fig 5 the deadweight of this ship is 216 269 tons the block coefficient is assumed to be c b 0 73 the yield strength of steel material is assumed to be lognormally distributed with mean of 348 mpa and cov of 6 gaspar and guedes soares 2013 it is further assumed that the construction cost is 120m narula 2019 failure cost is estimated at 396m using eqs 8 10 fig 6 a illustrates the expected prospect values considering that the dry dock cost c p is 0 2m and the discount rate v is 0 5 for easy comparison the values of e v τ t are scaled to 0 and 0 5 for cpt r 0 and 100m respectively and to 1 0 and 1 5 for ut with risk taking and risk averse attitudes respectively for comparison with the economically optimal solutions the values of e c τ t are plotted in fig 6b the preferred dry docking interval suggested by cpt the optimal associated with ut and the economically optimal are the same i e 3 years risk perception does not influence the selected solution for this case in the case of cpt as the reference cost r increases from 0 to 100m the values of e v τ t become less sensitive to the dry docking inspection interval τ this is attributed to the diminished sensitivity of the value function the same reason can be also used to explain the reduced sensitivity of the values of e v τ t in the case of ut for risk averse attitudes compared with risk taking attitudes by comparing the values of e v τ t associated with cpt for r 0 100m and ut for risk taking risk averse it is found that cpt results in a higher sensitivity of the values of e v τ t to dry docking interval since the only difference between cpt and ut when same value functions are assumed i e concave or convex lies in the adopted probability weighting function it is clear that the increased sensitivity associated with cpt is caused by the nonlinear probability weighting the analysis that generates the results in fig 6a and 6b are repeated by considering c p 0 8m the obtained results are shown in figs 6c and 6d it is shown that the observation in fig 6a about the change in the sensitivity of e v τ t to the dry docking interval due to the selected probability weighting function and the reference cost is also applicable to fig 6c this figure shows that the preferred intervals under cpt are 4 and 3 years for r 0 and 100m respectively the fact that r 0 leads to a longer dry docking interval makes sense due to the convex value function i e risk taking over all life cycle cost outcomes the optimal dry docking interval corresponding to ut for risk taking risk averse is 5 4 years which is longer than that corresponding to cpt for r 0 100m this suggests that the nonlinear probability weighting reduces the optimal dry docking interval fig 6d indicates that the economically optimal interval is 4 years shorter than that associated with ut for risk taking but equal to that by cpt for r 0 this implies that although the convex value tends to increase the interval the impact of nonlinear probability weighting on reducing the interval can be more significant the ship owner may extend a ship service life beyond its design life to quantify the sensitivity of the implied dry docking interval under cpt to an extended service time of 15 years the analysis for fig 6 is repeated considering t 40 years the calculated results are presented in fig 7 fig 7a depicts the desirability of solutions associated with cpt and ut when c p 0 2m and fig 7b shows the expected life cycle costs all the decision making rules point to the same optimal dry docking intervals of 3 years which are the same as those given in fig 6a and b when t 25 years if c p 0 8m the optimal solution under the melc as shown in fig 7d is 5 years which agrees with cpt for r 0 and ut in fig 7c the preferred solution under cpt for r 100m is 3 years shorter than that by ut for risk averse again revealing the impact of the nonlinear probability weighting function on reducing the dry docking interval as observed in fig 6c furthermore the fitted curves of e v τ t in fig 7a and 7c again indicate the impact of nonlinear probability weighing on increasing the sensitivity of e v τ t to the dry docking interval it is worth noting that there exits jaggedness in the fitted curve of e c τ t in fig 7d for example the value of e c τ t associated with the dry docking interval τ 12 years is greater than that corresponding to τ 14 years a similar observation has been reported and explained in the application of the condition based maintenance methodologies by hong et al 2014 and zhang and zhou 2014 the reason behind can be explained by the fact that the corroded steel that does not satisfy the renewal criterion at the dry docking inspections associated with τ 12 years may cause failures while the maintenance associated with τ 14 years repairs critical corroded member and makes the hull safer the analysis for figs 6 and 7 is repeated considering v equal to 5 the obtained optimal dry docking interval associated with the different decision making rules are listed in table 1 for t 25 years and in table 2 for t 40 years and are compared with those from figs 6 and 7 for v 0 5 the discount rate of money does not change the optimal dry docking interval dictated by different decision making rules for all analyzed cases when c p 0 8m and t 25 years the increase in the value of c p increases the optimal dry docking interval dictated by the same decision making rule for all cases in tables 1 and 2 except for cpt when r 100m this can be simply explained by noting that the values of the life cycle costs relative to r 100m are far from the origin of the value function and the value function is insensitive to the changes in the life cycle cost as the value of c p increases from 0 2m to 0 8m another notable observation in tables 1 and 2 is that the optimal solution associated with ut for risk taking can be larger than the economical optimal solutions e g when t 25 years c p 0 8m and v 0 5 while all preferred dry docking time intervals by cpt despite risk taking assumed over all outcomes i e when r 0 are less than or equal to the solutions associated with melc 4 3 double hull tanker the cross section at midship of the double hull tanker adapted from hu et al 2004 is shown in fig 8 the values of the wastage allowance are illustrated in fig 9 the block coefficient is assumed c b 0 8 the yield strength of steel material is lognormally distributed with the mean of 269 mpa and cov of 8 gaspar and guedes soares 2013 the deadweight of the ship is assumed dwt 40 000 tons this assumption makes senses considering the length of the hull guo et al 2008 it is further assumed that the construction cost is 42m the geometric properties of the stiffened plates are provided in hu et al 2004 from eqs 8 10 the cost of failure is 108m the values of e v τ t and e c τ t are plotted in fig 10 a and b respectively considering t 25 years c p 0 2m and v 0 5 the preferred dry docking intervals suggested by cpt are 5 years for r 0m and 4 years for r 100m and the optimal dry docking interval under the melc i e 5 years the optimal solutions prescribed by ut are 9 and 5 years for risk taking and risk averse respectively comparing the solutions by cpt for r 0 100m and ut for risk taking risk averse again suggests that conservatism is embedded in cpt by nonlinearly weighting probability fig 10c and d shows the values of e v τ t and e c τ t respectively considering c p 0 8m the preferred by cpt with r 0 the optimal by ut with risk averse attitude and the economically optimal by melc are 13 years while cpt with r 100m suggested the interval of 5 years furthermore similar to the observations in fig 6a and c and in fig 7a and c the nonlinear probability weighting function in cpt increases the sensitivity of the values of e v τ t to the dry docking as shown in fig 10a and c tables 3 and 4 summarize the suggested solutions by cpt ut and melc for t 25 years and 40 years respectively where c p 0 2m and 0 8m and v 0 5 and 5 are considered it is seen that the use of concave value function alone i e ut for risk averse does not reduce the dry docking intervals compared with the melc for all analyzed cases combining the nonlinear probability weighting with the concave value function i e cpt for r 100m can lead to shorter dry docking intervals for example the suggested solutions corresponding to melc and ut in the case t 40 years and c p 0 8m are 8 10 years and those corresponding to cpt for r 100m are 4 5 years for v 0 5 5 see table 4 all preferred dry docking intervals under cpt are shorter or equal to the economically optimal by melc comparing the results in tables 3 and 4 and those in tables 1 and 2 reveals that the impact of considering risk perception as characterized by the difference in the suggested solutions by cpt or ut and melc is more significant for the double hull tanker this might be explained by the fact that the expected life cycle cost of the double hull tanker is insensitive to the dry docking interval around the economically optimal solution in this context the magnitude of uncertainty of the life cycle cost impacts the optimal solution under cpt and ut for a given inspection schedule the failure probability of the vlcc is consistently higher than that of the double hull tanker with a forecast period of 25 years the maximum annual failure probability corresponding to τ 5 years is 2 10 3 and 5 10 4 for the vlcc and double hull tanker respectively 5 conclusions the preferred dry docking time intervals of two corroding hull girders under uncertainty are investigated considering risk perception using cpt the probability distribution of the life cycle cost accounting for the effects of realistic condition based steel renewal practices is computed by monte carlo simulation the impact of the value function or the nonlinear probability weighting in cpt on the selection of dry docking intervals is investigated by comparing the solutions associated with cpt with those associated with ut and melc the following conclusions are drawn 1 the preferred dry docking intervals under cpt can be different from the economically optimal solutions by melc cpt can lead to a preferred dry docking time interval significantly shorter than that associated with melc the impact of the probability weighting on reducing the dry docking interval associated with melc can be more pronounced than the value function even though the value function is single sided and convex i e risk taking the dry docking intervals under cpt are not longer than those associated with melc this raises the caution for applying melc to determine the ship maintenance planning in the presence of uncertainties 2 if the same single sided value function is utilized for cpt and ut the nonlinear probability weighting is responsible for an increase in the sensitivity of the expected prospect value to the dry docking interval associated with cpt compared to that associated with ut 3 the reference point can affect the preference of dry docking interval by defining the shape of the value function a convex value function i e risk taking alone can result in a longer dry docking interval compared to melc however the concave value function i e risk averse without nonlinearly weighting probability is not found to lead to dry dock intervals different from those associated with melc 4 the impact of risk perceptions on the suggested solution depends on the ship hull analyzed in the two case studies analyzed the impact is

22392,in this study unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computations based on a finite volume method was used to investigate the behavior of fluid flow around an optimized surface piercing propeller special blade section operating at immersion ratio of 0 3 sliding mesh technique was applied to simulate rotational motion of the propeller homogenous eulerian multiphase model including volume of fluid method was employed to solve two phase flow field equations as the results showed the highest thrust and efficiency of the key blade achieved at the regions near the rotation angle of

piercing propellers are specific type of supercavitating propellers that are commonly used as high performance propulsion system for high speed vessels the most important advantages of these propellers comparing with fully submerged propellers are that they can achieve high speeds improve performance of propulsion system and decrease noise and vibration they are suitable for larger scale design since there is no limitation in terms of blade body distance and maximum draft surface piercing propellers are also featured with lower corrosion due to a decrease or lack of the destructive cavitation additionally these propellers significantly decrease appendage drag so that they need a considerably less power to propel vessels comparing with the conventional propellers however since surface piercing propellers function in two phase condition each propeller blade enters water once in each revolution so thrust and torque of each blade hit maximum level and then become around zero as a result surface piercing propellers generate oscillating thrust and torque despite of being more than one century in operation as marine propellers there is still a great need for conducting survey of the performance of these propellers nowadays given the wide use of surface piercing propellers in a wide range of vessels many scientists are working on numerical and experimental studies on these propellers in the past and in absence of powerful software systems studies on surface piercing propellers were based on experimental tests and among these studies shiba 1953 hadler and hecker 1968 hecker 1973 rains 1981 rose and kruppa 1991 rose et al 1993 and wang 1977 are notable these studies were aimed to extract time averaged thrust torque bending moments and lateral forces and none managed to extract the accurate value of power and torque dobay 1970 olofsson 1996 miller and szantyr 1998 dyson 2000 dyson et al 2000 nozawa and takayama 2002a carried out experimental studies to calculate accurate force and torque on surface piercing propellers in addition to dynamic performance they tried to obtain induced forces on the blades shafts and hub other experimental studies have focused on the effects of different parameters such as propeller pitch angle blade profile shaft inclination angle propeller immersion depth and cavitation number on hydrodynamic performance of surface piercing propellers this can be seen for example in ferrando and scamardella 1996 1999 ferrando 1997 ferrando et al 2002 ferrando et al 2006 nozawa and takayama 2002a himei et al 2005 although experimental tests are a proper way for hydrodynamic analyses of surface piercing propellers they are not easy to conduct and also expensive and time consuming in other words to experimentally investigate performance of a surface piercing propeller at various flow regimes different equipment like free surface water channel capable of conducting tests at high speed with specific immersion ratio in free surface condition are needed needless to say the free surface is a key issue in surface piercing propeller experiments kruppa 1992 rose et al 1993 olofsson 1996 dyson 2000 moreover there is a need for multi component dynamometer to measure force and torque components hecker and crown 1970 dobay 1970 rose et al 1993 miller and szantyr 1998 additionally because of the phenomena like propeller blade vibrations there are special issues in scaling that need to be dealt with in such experimental tests hadler and hecker 1968 dobay 1970 olofsson 1996 dyson 2000 nozawa and takayama 2002b development of powerful and reliable computation tools for carrying out hydrodynamic analyses on surface piercing propellers using numerical methods has opened new and interesting avenue for researchers thanks to powerful computers some of experimental tests have been replaced by numerical estimates however since surface piercing propellers function in two phase mode and experience phenomena like ventilation adopting reliable numerical methods for hydrodynamic analysis of these propellers have always been faced several challenges yegorov and sadovnikov 1961 utilized blade element method based on two dimensional hydrofoil theory to analyze surface piercing propellers they neglected the effects of adjacent blades wake vortex and cavitation later oberembt 1968 employed lifting line theory approach to analyze surface piercing propeller while omitting ventilation and wake changes furuya 1984 1985 employed the same approach except that he added ventilation effects to the numerical modeling he assumed that while the face side is completely wetted the back side of the blade is fully ventilated started from the leading edge to account for free surface effects image method was used by him he used two dimensional theory implemented by wang 1977 1979 to predict thrust and torque coefficients of surface piercing propeller comparison of the results with experimental data reported by hadler and hecker 1968 revealed an acceptable accuracy of thrust coefficients however there were substantial disagreements with experimental data for torque coefficients wang et al 1990a examined the entering of a three dimensional hydrofoil into water using an unsteady lifting surface method afterwards wang et al 1990b 1992 developed proposed method to fully ventilated partially submerged propellers kudo and ukon 1994 and kudo and kinnas 1995 employed a three dimensional numerical method known as vortex lattice lifting surface method to analyze surface piercing propellers the method assumed that the propeller is fully submerged to generalize the findings to surface piercing propeller the obtained forces were multiplied by the submerge ratio of the propeller therefore this method only yielded an estimate of the mean forces and ignored the free surface effects especially at blades entry to and exit from the water surface later savineau and kinnas 1995 studied the flow field around a fully ventilated partially submerged hydrofoil using a two dimensional boundary element method to take free surface effects into account the negative image method was applied they only studied hydrofoil s entry to the water surface and hydrofoil s exit from the water surface was omitted young and kinnas 2003 developed a 3 d boundary element method to investigate unsteady flow around surface piercing and supercavitating propellers this method was mainly designed for cavitation analysis on conventional propellers the results were acceptably accurate comparing with experimental results caponnetto 2003 employed rans method to analyze a four blade surface piercing propeller the results obtained after one revolution of the propeller were compared with the results of boundary element method and experimental tests ghassemi 2009 used boundary element method and experimental tests to determine the hydrodynamic specifications of two surface piercing propellers three blade and six blade he obtained critical advance ratio at transition mode using an empirical equation based on weber number and pitch ratio yari and ghassemi 2016a 2016b 2016c and 2016d and yari 2017 conducted several studies on surface piercing propeller using boundary element method bem and finite volume method fvm 2d two dimensional sections of the blade and 3d numerical analysis of surface piercing propellers were investigated on the entrance and exit of water to study the pressure distribution spraying and water adhesion these researches describes the development of a computational method based on bem and fvm to predict the partially submerged propeller psp performance with and without cup effect and the 3d unsteady ventilation pattern as it occurs under open flow condition placed in a uniform inflow himei 2013 employed rans method for unsteady analysis of a surface piercing propeller reported by olofsson 1996 in open water condition where the free surface of the propeller was simulated through vof method califano and steen 2009 used rans numerical method to survey ventilation mechanisms in marine propellers in fully submerged condition alimirzazadeh et al 2016 employed unsteady rans method to analyze the surface piercing propeller introduced by olfosson the simulations were carried out at different submerge ratios and shaft inclination angles he used vof method to simulate free surface around the propeller in this paper hydrodynamic analysis of an optimized surface piercing propeller was performed using unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computations based on a finite volume method ansys cfx commercial code was applied to carry out all simulations at immersion ratio of i h d 0 3 as an operation condition of the propeller rotational motion of the propeller was simulated using cfx sliding mesh technique two phase flow field equations were solved using homogenous eulerian multiphase model to solve two phase flow field at the free surface accurately and deal with free surface effects in calculations cfx free surface model based on volume of fluid vof approach was used hydrodynamic characteristic curves of the propeller six component force and moment coefficients of the key blade detailed hydrodynamic analysis of the section blade at 0 7r in different advance coefficients will be dealt with in this paper 2 hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller hydrodynamic coefficients of the propeller including advance coefficient j thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η are defined as below 1 j v a n d k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η j 2 π k t k q where v a is advance velocity n is rotation rate d is propeller diameter and ρ is water density t and q represent time averaged thrust and torque respectively in one or some completed cycles 3 numerical modeling 3 1 governing equations conservation of mass and momentum equations are the governing equations in two phase flow field expressed ansys 2009a in eq 2 to eq 6 2 t r α ρ α r α ρ α v 0 α 1 2 3 t ρ v ρ v v p μ v v t 4 i r α v 0 5 r α v α v α 1 2 6 α 1 2 r α 1 where r α ρ α and v α are the volume fraction density and volume of phase α respectively the velocity vector is denoted by v while v is the total volume μ and ρ are the bulk viscosity and density respectively and p is the pressure the volume fraction of phase α r α represents a fraction of the volume filled by phase α and varies between 0 and 1 throughout numerical solution the sum of volume fraction of phases might exceeds from 1 however in a converged solution and based on volume conservation equation it is definitely equal to 1 ansys 2009b since solving these equations directly is extremely difficult rans equations are used reynolds averaged conservation of momentum equation is expressed in eq 7 7 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 μ u i x i x j u i u j ρ g i where u i is velocity component in i direction g i is gravity acceleration and u i u j stands for the reynolds stress that must be modeled using an appropriate turbulence model different methods have been proposed to model reynolds stress and each method suits a specific flow wilcox 1998 here k ω sst turbulence model is used to model reynolds stress in rans equations this turbulence model is a blend of k ε and k ω models the k ω sst turbulence model employs k ε model in vicinity of the wall and k ω model with a transformation function away from the wall therefore it takes advantages of the both models which are good convergence of k ε model and high accuracy of k ω model in vicinity of the wall mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 this two equation model is the best turbulence model to predict flow separation menter et al 2003 free surface model in cfx uses phasic continuation equation to compute the border between two phases in a two phase flow phasic continuity equation for phase α can be expressed as 8 t ρ α r α ρ α r α u α β 1 2 γ α β where γ α β denotes mass flow rate per unit volume from phase α to β lagrangian particle tracking and eulerian eulerian multiphase models are two main approaches used to model multiphase flows in cfx the former is one of the complicated multiphase flows models used for modeling a dispersed system with one or several separate phases in a continuous phase in this model each phase is computed separately in eulerian approach two procedures can be used inhomogeneous and homogeneous multiphase flow model in the former model velocity temperature and turbulence fields for each fluid are dealt with separately while the pressure field is shared by all fluids on the other hand in homogeneous multiphase flow model all fluids share the same velocity temperature and turbulence fields one of the common applications of homogeneous eulerian multiphase model is free surface flow in which water and air are separated by a distinct resolvable interface nevertheless when there is no distinct interface between two phases due to penetration of one phase within another inhomogeneous multiphase flow model is recommended the reason is that unequal velocity field in inhomogeneous analysis allows the phases to separate again and establish a distinct interface ansys 2009b since present study does not deal with significant splashing and jet sprays around the blades and two phases are regarded as continuous phases in a separated system homogenous eulerian multiphase model is employed it is worth mentioning that as in inhomogeneous models there is one solution field for each separate phase more memory and cpu time are needed to run ansys 2009b 3 2 propeller geometry the geometric model and main geometric parameters of the propeller are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 3 3 computational domain and grid generation to simulate propeller s rotation using sliding mesh method the computational domain is divided into rotating and fixed domains the former is a cylinder 1 1d in diameter and the latter is a cylinder 7d in diameters inlet boundary is located at 2d upstream and the outlet boundary is placed at 11d downstream fig 2 illustrates position of rotating and stationary computational domains icem cfd was applied to generate unstructured mesh in computational domains following steps were taken separately in grid generation process 1 using octree method to generate triangular surface mesh 2 using delauny method to generate tetrahedral volume mesh 3 generation of prismatic mesh to resolve boundary layer efficiently 4 merging prismatic mesh with tetrahedral volume mesh given that k ω sst turbulence model is used and the boundary layer is aimed to be fully resolved in prismatic mesh generation step y non dimensional distance from the wall to the first node away from the wall must be less than 1 the empirical equation 9 is used to estimate first prismatic layer thickness base on a specified value of y ansys 2009a 9 δ y 8 6 l y r e 13 14 where l is reference length and is equal to the cord length of the propeller at 0 7r c 0 7 r reynolds number r e is computed as 10 r e ρ v l μ ρ v a 2 0 7 d n π 2 c 0 7 r μ where v is the resultant of advance velocity v a and rotation rate n at 0 7r ρ is water density and μ is water dynamic viscosity with v a 20 knot and n 28 rps reynolds number is equal to 9 4 106 therefore given the limitation y and eq 9 first prismatic layer thickness δ y is 0 0005 mm to have a complete coverage of boundary layers 20 prismatic layers with expansion rate of 1 2 were utilized in generating prismatic mesh it is notable that the grid is adequately refined at the regions with geometric complicacies or severe changes of flow variables sever gradient like leading and trailing edges rotating domain and free surface fig 3 illustrates surface mesh on propeller and unstructured mesh in computational domains 3 4 boundary conditions normal speed condition with medium turbulence intensity 5 and the turbulence viscosity ratio of 10 was set on the inlet boundary outlet boundary condition with zero relative pressure was defined on the outlet boundary boundary condition for cylindrical side wall was considered to be opening boundary with opening pressure that use total pressure when the flow direction is into the domain or relative static pressure when it is leaving the domain moreover zero gradient condition was defined for turbulence intensity when the flow direction is into the domain no slip boundary condition was applied to the propeller to connect stationary and rotating domains together domain interface with ggi general grid interface mesh connection method was prescribed in general ggi connections permit non matching of node location element type surface extent surface shape and even non matching of the flow physics across the connection ansys 2009b the motion of rotating domain into the stationary domain was imposed using mesh motion technique high resolution advection scheme and second order backward euler transient scheme were used for all equations an interface compression level of 2 was applied to control volume fraction advection scheme in phasic continuity equation and in turn increase the air water interface sharpness coupled volume fraction algorithm was used to gain solution stability this algorithm enables solver to couple implicitly the equations for velocity pressure and volume fraction the volume fraction smoothing type was set to volume weighted to improve startup robustness the time step was chosen based on a courant number of 1 or less using a constant time step of 8 8e 5 s corresponding to propeller turn to 0 89 resulted in a proper courant number of 0 98 for the volume fraction equations time step was reduced by an order of magnitude below that of the other equations ansys 2009b while the maximum number of iterations per time step was set to 15 solution converged at each time step in iteration number of 5 or less double precision simulations with flow conditions indicated in table 2 were run on a cluster with 24 cores xeon processors and 96 gb internal memory with parallel computing implementation to assess the convergence of the simulations the criteria of rms 1e 5 solution imbalances 1 were set as another convergence criterion propeller thrust and torque were monitored during the solution process 3 5 grid independence study in order to perform the grid independence study five grid configurations were generated using a systematic grid refinement the variation of thrust coefficient k t with the grid size is then investigated the specifications of the studied grids are shown in table 3 at j 1 3 as shown in figs 4 and 5 there was a big rise of 20 17 in k t when the number of elements increased from 2 74 to 4 88 million then a growth of around 8 7 took place in thrust coefficient from grid 2 4 88 million to grid 3 7 52 million while thrust coefficient experienced an increase of 2 62 from grid 3 to grid 4 it remained intact with an insignificant growth of 0 62 from 10 to 12 7 million elements corresponding to grid 4 and 5 respectively it is worth mentioning that for grid 4 another grid study was conducted the obtained results showed that refinement in prismatic mesh using δy 0 0005 mm or more than 20 prismatic layers did not have any significant effect on the resulting thrust coefficient 3 6 verification study as a verification study the grid convergence index gci method was used to assess the capability of the proposed cfd model and current computer code ansys cfx in solving the system of equations when sufficiently fine grid resolution is employed the gci that is known as an acceptable and recommended method for estimation of discretization error in cfd simulations celik et al 2008 is based on richardson extrapolation re method richardson 1911 richardson and gant 1927 for three sets of grids grid 3 grid 4 and grid 5 the grid refinement factors r 45 and r 34 are computed as r 45 h 4 h 5 1 27 and r 34 h 3 h 4 1 33 where h i is a representative grid size of the i t h grid the apparent order of the method p a is calculated by 11 p a 1 ln r 45 ln ε 34 ε 45 q p a 12 q p a ln r 45 p a s r 34 p a s 13 s 1 s i g n ε 34 ε 45 where ε 34 3 4 ε 45 4 5 and k is the key variable on the k t h grid the extrapolated values are obtained via 14 e x t 45 r 45 p a 5 4 r 45 p a 1 the approximate and extrapolated relative errors are calculated using the following equations respectively 15 e a 45 5 4 5 16 e e x t 45 e x t 45 5 e x t 45 the fine grid convergence index is calculated by 17 g c i f i n e 45 1 25 e a 45 r 45 p a 1 for the three selected grids calculations of discretization error are presented in table 4 as can be seen numerical uncertainties for computed values of k t k q and η were 0 359 0 337 and 0 003 respectively therefore regarding grid independence study and numerical uncertainties estimated from verification study it was concluded that the use of grid 4 with 10066902 elements not only ensured that the results were grid independent but also was numerically cost effective 3 7 validation study since there is no experimental data available for propeller investigated in this paper experimental measurements of spp 841b propeller collected by olofsson 1996 are used to validate numerical results obtained in this study the photograph and cfd model of this propeller are shown in fig 6 to fulfill this purpose numerical method applied in current study was employed to predict hydrodynamic coefficients k t k q η of spp 841b propeller with principal particulars given in table 5 all simulations were carried out at i 0 33 flow conditions in each advance coefficient were set as shown in table 6 in all cases weber numbers are greater than 180 since according to shiba 1953 olofsson 1996 and kozlowska et al 2009 influence of the weber number on the ventilation becomes insignificant with this assumption domain and grid generation steps as well as boundary conditions for spp 841b simulations are similar to those used previously surface mesh on spp 841b propeller and unstructured volume mesh generated in cylindrical domain are shown in fig 7 apart from using small mesh size on leading and trailing edges the grid was considerably refined at the free surface location to resolve two phase flow field equations satisfactorily to indicate the free surface position clearly during unsteady solution in order to carry out the grid sensitivity study and absorb the effects of the grid resolution on the key variables three grid sizes classified as coarse medium and fine were generated indicated in table 7 for each mesh configuration hydrodynamic coefficients of the spp 841b propeller k t k q η were computed at j 1 2 and are also given in table 7 clearly the fine mesh configuration has the minimum relative differences from the experimental data therefore using fine mesh configuration ensured that the results were grid independent and numerically cost effective a verification study based on gci method was performed to estimate discretization error in cfd simulations of the spp 841b propeller for three mesh configurations represented in table 7 numerical uncertainties of computed values related to k t k q and η are calculated via eq 11 to eq 17 and also presented in table 8 as can be seen numerical uncertainties for computed values of k t k q and η were 0 393 0 715 and 0 012 respectively comparison between simulated and measured spp 841b open characteristics is shown in figs 8 and 9 according to the figures numerical results showed a reasonable agreement with experimental data collected by olofsson 1996 relative percentage error in different advance ratios between obtained numerical results and experimental measurements was presented in fig 10 as can be seen the highest relative errors took place at j 0 4 where the propeller was working under heavy load condition at this advance ratio the relative errors were 17 9 and 7 for k t k q and η respectively by contrast the lowest percentage of errors which were approximately 2 8 k t 2 2 k q and 0 58 η are recorded at j 1 2 comparison of the observed and simulated ventilation pattern of the key blade in angular position of θ 120 and j 1 2 is shown in fig 11 it is evident that numerical contour was in good conformity with experimental observation comparisons of the simulated and measured blade force and moment coefficients of k fx and k mx are shown in fig 12 as shown in this figure the simulated values agreed well with experimental measurements even though there are deviations in some regions especially at the blade entry the discrepancies can be attributed to the inability of the present simulation to model the effects of jet sprays and blade vibration in experiment at the instant of impact strong jets develop around the blade leading edge which not only cause high slamming loads but also increase wetted area on face side of the blade these blade entry phenomena contribute significantly to the hydrodynamic loads at the entry phase moreover in the current simulation propeller blades are assumed to be rigid thus the effects of blade vibrations cannot be captured blade vibration is a resonance phenomenon which has considerable impacts on the blade shape and loadings young 2002 4 numerical results since surface piercing propellers function in two phase condition each propeller blade hits the water surface once in each revolution meaning that thrust and torque for each blade increase from zero to the maximum level and then return to the minimum level as a result surface piercing propellers generate oscillating thrust and torque fig 13 illustrates the propeller thrust and torque oscillations in one revolution at j 1 3 fig 14 pictures thrust torque and performance coefficients of the propeller clearly in submerge ratio of i 0 33 the highest performance of the propeller is about 56 which happens at advance coefficient of j 1 1 fig 15 illustrates thrust and torque coefficients of one propeller blade named as key blade in different advance coefficients as the figure shows the thrust and torque start at zero and then increase when key blade enters the water and reach the maximum level at rotation angle of 180 afterwards both of them decrease and return the minimum level variation of thrust coefficient of the key blade just before exit from the water surface is shown in fig 16 as shown in this figure at all advance ratios thrust coefficients becomes zero before key blade exits from the free surface a b and c this means that thrust drag balance on the key blade took place before the blade exits free surface thoroughly and in angular position of θ balance 270 moreover at the higher advance ratios thrust drag balance was seen at lower angular positions as revealed in this figure for advance ratio of j 0 936 thrust drag balance on the key blade was at rotation angle of 248 5 point a for j 1 1 and j 1 3 balance happened at lower rotation angles of 246 point b and 243 point c respectively as pictured in fig 16 after thrust drag balance drag effects on the key blade exceed the thrust meaning that the blade has caused drag fig 17 illustrates volume fraction contour on the key blade at the thrust drag balance positions of a b and c clearly volume fraction of water at the pressure and suction sides of the blade was increased with increase in advance ratio therefore volume of the water that exit free surface was increased that created drag and in turn reduced the efficiency of the blade and caused waste of energy it is notable that the drag is trivial comparing with the maximum thrust produced by key blade according to the coordinate system shown in fig 2 and the definitions of k f x f y f z f x f y f z ρ n 2 d 4 and k m x m y m z m x m y m z ρ n 2 d 5 the six component force and moment coefficients of the key blade k fx k fy k fz k mx k my k mz are calculated and shown in fig 18 as can be seen in a specified advance coefficient k fx and k mz are the maximum force and moment coefficients of the key blade respectively additionally the role of the force component of fy in torque generation k mx is more important after θ 180 since at angular position below than 180 just positive value of fy generates key blade torque and negative value of fy reduces net key blade torque furthermore since fz is negative in 90 θ 270 it generates key blade torque in all angular positions fig 19 illustrates propeller blade section profile at 0 7r that is a reference section with an important role in propeller design process the predictions for pressure coefficient cp around the blade section at 0 7r in different rotation angles are shown in figs 20 22 for advance coefficients of j 0 934 1 1 and 1 3 respectively pressure coefficient is defined as 18 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ v a 2 0 7 d n π 2 where p p 0 is the relative pressure as shown in fig 20 in all rotation angles crossover of the cp curves occurs at x c critical near the trailing edge of the blade section and produces two loops the loop upstream of the crossover named as s thrust produces positive pressure difference which leads to thrust whereas the loop downstream of the crossover named as s drag produces negative pressure difference leading to a reduction of total thrust produced by the section as can be seen there was insignificant positive pressure difference between pressure and suction sides of the section at θ 90 which is why thrust was inconsiderable at this angular position at θ 135 cp was increased in pressure side and decreased in suction side of the blade leading to amplification of the overall positive pressure difference s thrust and therefore thrust was increased it is clear that at θ 135 maximum local positive pressure difference and in turn maximum local thrust was observed near the leading edge of the section meaning that resultant vector of the thrust on the section was close to leading edge of the section moreover as x c was increased from leading edge to trailing edge local positive pressure difference was declined and reached to zero at x c critical 0 85 for x c 0 85 as a result of a steep rise in cp value at pressure side of the section there was negative pressure difference that reduced total thrust produced by the section since at θ 180 the area covered by the cp curves s thrust was the biggest overall positive pressure difference and consequently total thrust of the section reached its maximum value as angular position θ was increased to 225 the overall positive pressure difference s thrust decreased dramatically and limited to 0 5 x c 0 9 additionally overall negative pressure difference s drag was increased as a result total thrust of the section was decreased at θ 225 at θ 270 there was no positive pressure difference along the section whereas drag was caused by negative pressure difference at trailing edge of the section according to figs 20 22 it is clear that in a specified rotation angle θ total thrust of the section was decreased with increase of advance coefficient j since overall positive pressure difference s thrust was declined at higher advance coefficients in a specified advance coefficient j from θ 90 to θ 180 total thrust of the section was increased and maximum local thrust took place close to leading edge of the section whereas from θ 180 to θ 270 total thrust of the section was decreased and maximum local thrust position got away from the leading edge pressure difference at trailing edge of the section was negative for all cases fluid volume fraction contours on both sides of the key blade along with volume fraction distribution on blade section at 0 7r at θ 180 and j 0 934 1 1 1 3 are shown in fig 23 according to contours air volume fraction on pressure side of the blade remained unchanged with increase of advance coefficient whereas it reduced noticeably at suction side of the blade this revealed that ventilation was reduced on suction side with increase of advance coefficient there was a similar pattern for volume fraction distribution on blade section while air volume fraction distribution on pressure side of the section remained stable with increase of advance coefficient it was changed at suction side of the section in other words for j 0 934 ventilation took place on suction side of the section at x c 0 55 and expanded to trailing edge x c 1 however for j 1 1 ventilation was delayed and its start point moved to x c 0 925 for j 1 3 no ventilation was observed on suction side of the section 5 conclusion in the present paper computational fluid dynamics based on a finite volume method was used to investigate unsteady flow around a surface pricing propeller operating in immersion ratio of 33 homogeneous eulerian multiphase model with vof approach was applied in rans solver to solve two phase flow field equations and predict induced hydrodynamic forces and ventilation patterns in range of advance coefficients the accuracy of the numerical method was verified using series of simulations on spp 841b propeller with existing experimental measurements comparison between simulated and measured spp 841b open characteristics as well as ventilation pattern of the key blade indicated a reasonable agreement with experimental data and observations regarding validated numerical method used in this work following conclusions were obtained spp propeller reached its maximum efficiency 56 at j 1 1 maximum thrust and torque coefficients of the key blade took place in angular position of θ 180 thrust drag balance on the key blade happened in angular position of θ balance 270 i e before the blade exit free surface thoroughly additionally θ balance was decreased at higher advance coefficients fluid volume fraction contours on the key blade at θ balance revealed that as advance coefficient was increased water volume fraction on both sides of the blade was increased meaning that more amount of water went out of the free surface in a specified rotation angle θ total thrust of the blade section at 0 7r was decreased with increase of advance coefficient because at higher advance coefficients overall positive pressure difference s thrust was declined in a specified advance coefficient j from θ 90 to θ 180 total thrust of the blade section was increased and maximum local thrust took place close to the leading edge whereas from θ 180 to θ 270 total thrust of the blade section was decreased and maximum local thrust position got away from the leading edge in all advance coefficients negative pressure difference was seen at the trailing edge of the blade section at θ 180 fluid volume fraction contours on both sides of the key blade demonstrated that ventilation was declined on suction side of the blade with increase of advance coefficient 
22392,in this study unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computations based on a finite volume method was used to investigate the behavior of fluid flow around an optimized surface piercing propeller special blade section operating at immersion ratio of 0 3 sliding mesh technique was applied to simulate rotational motion of the propeller homogenous eulerian multiphase model including volume of fluid method was employed to solve two phase flow field equations as the results showed the highest thrust and efficiency of the key blade achieved at the regions near the rotation angle of 180 additionally total thrust of the blade section 0 7r was decreased with increase of advance coefficient in a specified advance coefficient from rotation angle of 90 180 total thrust of the blade section was increased and maximum local thrust occurred at a location close to the leading edge whereas from rotation angle of 180 270 total thrust of the blade section was dropped and maximum local thrust position got away from the leading edge to validate the numerical results experimental data of spp 841b propeller was used comparison between numerically simulated results measured open water

piercing propellers are specific type of supercavitating propellers that are commonly used as high performance propulsion system for high speed vessels the most important advantages of these propellers comparing with fully submerged propellers are that they can achieve high speeds improve performance of propulsion system and decrease noise and vibration they are suitable for larger scale design since there is no limitation in terms of blade body distance and maximum draft surface piercing propellers are also featured with lower corrosion due to a decrease or lack of the destructive cavitation additionally these propellers significantly decrease appendage drag so that they need a considerably less power to propel vessels comparing with the conventional propellers however since surface piercing propellers function in two phase condition each propeller blade enters water once in each revolution so thrust and torque of each blade hit maximum level and then become around zero as a result surface piercing propellers generate oscillating thrust and torque despite of being more than one century in operation as marine propellers there is still a great need for conducting survey of the performance of these propellers nowadays given the wide use of surface piercing propellers in a wide range of vessels many scientists are working on numerical and experimental studies on these propellers in the past and in absence of powerful software systems studies on surface piercing propellers were based on experimental tests and among these studies shiba 1953 hadler and hecker 1968 hecker 1973 rains 1981 rose and kruppa 1991 rose et al 1993 and wang 1977 are notable these studies were aimed to extract time averaged thrust torque bending moments and lateral forces and none managed to extract the accurate value of power and torque dobay 1970 olofsson 1996 miller and szantyr 1998 dyson 2000 dyson et al 2000 nozawa and takayama 2002a carried out experimental studies to calculate accurate force and torque on surface piercing propellers in addition to dynamic performance they tried to obtain induced forces on the blades shafts and hub other experimental studies have focused on the effects of different parameters such as propeller pitch angle blade profile shaft inclination angle propeller immersion depth and cavitation number on hydrodynamic performance of surface piercing propellers this can be seen for example in ferrando and scamardella 1996 1999 ferrando 1997 ferrando et al 2002 ferrando et al 2006 nozawa and takayama 2002a himei et al 2005 although experimental tests are a proper way for hydrodynamic analyses of surface piercing propellers they are not easy to conduct and also expensive and time consuming in other words to experimentally investigate performance of a surface piercing propeller at various flow regimes different equipment like free surface water channel capable of conducting tests at high speed with specific immersion ratio in free surface condition are needed needless to say the free surface is a key issue in surface piercing propeller experiments kruppa 1992 rose et al 1993 olofsson 1996 dyson 2000 moreover there is a need for multi component dynamometer to measure force and torque components hecker and crown 1970 dobay 1970 rose et al 1993 miller and szantyr 1998 additionally because of the phenomena like propeller blade vibrations there are special issues in scaling that need to be dealt with in such experimental tests hadler and hecker 1968 dobay 1970 olofsson 1996 dyson 2000 nozawa and takayama 2002b development of powerful and reliable computation tools for carrying out hydrodynamic analyses on surface piercing propellers using numerical methods has opened new and interesting avenue for researchers thanks to powerful computers some of experimental tests have been replaced by numerical estimates however since surface piercing propellers function in two phase mode and experience phenomena like ventilation adopting reliable numerical methods for hydrodynamic analysis of these propellers have always been faced several challenges yegorov and sadovnikov 1961 utilized blade element method based on two dimensional hydrofoil theory to analyze surface piercing propellers they neglected the effects of adjacent blades wake vortex and cavitation later oberembt 1968 employed lifting line theory approach to analyze surface piercing propeller while omitting ventilation and wake changes furuya 1984 1985 employed the same approach except that he added ventilation effects to the numerical modeling he assumed that while the face side is completely wetted the back side of the blade is fully ventilated started from the leading edge to account for free surface effects image method was used by him he used two dimensional theory implemented by wang 1977 1979 to predict thrust and torque coefficients of surface piercing propeller comparison of the results with experimental data reported by hadler and hecker 1968 revealed an acceptable accuracy of thrust coefficients however there were substantial disagreements with experimental data for torque coefficients wang et al 1990a examined the entering of a three dimensional hydrofoil into water using an unsteady lifting surface method afterwards wang et al 1990b 1992 developed proposed method to fully ventilated partially submerged propellers kudo and ukon 1994 and kudo and kinnas 1995 employed a three dimensional numerical method known as vortex lattice lifting surface method to analyze surface piercing propellers the method assumed that the propeller is fully submerged to generalize the findings to surface piercing propeller the obtained forces were multiplied by the submerge ratio of the propeller therefore this method only yielded an estimate of the mean forces and ignored the free surface effects especially at blades entry to and exit from the water surface later savineau and kinnas 1995 studied the flow field around a fully ventilated partially submerged hydrofoil using a two dimensional boundary element method to take free surface effects into account the negative image method was applied they only studied hydrofoil s entry to the water surface and hydrofoil s exit from the water surface was omitted young and kinnas 2003 developed a 3 d boundary element method to investigate unsteady flow around surface piercing and supercavitating propellers this method was mainly designed for cavitation analysis on conventional propellers the results were acceptably accurate comparing with experimental results caponnetto 2003 employed rans method to analyze a four blade surface piercing propeller the results obtained after one revolution of the propeller were compared with the results of boundary element method and experimental tests ghassemi 2009 used boundary element method and experimental tests to determine the hydrodynamic specifications of two surface piercing propellers three blade and six blade he obtained critical advance ratio at transition mode using an empirical equation based on weber number and pitch ratio yari and ghassemi 2016a 2016b 2016c and 2016d and yari 2017 conducted several studies on surface piercing propeller using boundary element method bem and finite volume method fvm 2d two dimensional sections of the blade and 3d numerical analysis of surface piercing propellers were investigated on the entrance and exit of water to study the pressure distribution spraying and water adhesion these researches describes the development of a computational method based on bem and fvm to predict the partially submerged propeller psp performance with and without cup effect and the 3d unsteady ventilation pattern as it occurs under open flow condition placed in a uniform inflow himei 2013 employed rans method for unsteady analysis of a surface piercing propeller reported by olofsson 1996 in open water condition where the free surface of the propeller was simulated through vof method califano and steen 2009 used rans numerical method to survey ventilation mechanisms in marine propellers in fully submerged condition alimirzazadeh et al 2016 employed unsteady rans method to analyze the surface piercing propeller introduced by olfosson the simulations were carried out at different submerge ratios and shaft inclination angles he used vof method to simulate free surface around the propeller in this paper hydrodynamic analysis of an optimized surface piercing propeller was performed using unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computations based on a finite volume method ansys cfx commercial code was applied to carry out all simulations at immersion ratio of i h d 0 3 as an operation condition of the propeller rotational motion of the propeller was simulated using cfx sliding mesh technique two phase flow field equations were solved using homogenous eulerian multiphase model to solve two phase flow field at the free surface accurately and deal with free surface effects in calculations cfx free surface model based on volume of fluid vof approach was used hydrodynamic characteristic curves of the propeller six component force and moment coefficients of the key blade detailed hydrodynamic analysis of the section blade at 0 7r in different advance coefficients will be dealt with in this paper 2 hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller hydrodynamic coefficients of the propeller including advance coefficient j thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η are defined as below 1 j v a n d k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η j 2 π k t k q where v a is advance velocity n is rotation rate d is propeller diameter and ρ is water density t and q represent time averaged thrust and torque respectively in one or some completed cycles 3 numerical modeling 3 1 governing equations conservation of mass and momentum equations are the governing equations in two phase flow field expressed ansys 2009a in eq 2 to eq 6 2 t r α ρ α r α ρ α v 0 α 1 2 3 t ρ v ρ v v p μ v v t 4 i r α v 0 5 r α v α v α 1 2 6 α 1 2 r α 1 where r α ρ α and v α are the volume fraction density and volume of phase α respectively the velocity vector is denoted by v while v is the total volume μ and ρ are the bulk viscosity and density respectively and p is the pressure the volume fraction of phase α r α represents a fraction of the volume filled by phase α and varies between 0 and 1 throughout numerical solution the sum of volume fraction of phases might exceeds from 1 however in a converged solution and based on volume conservation equation it is definitely equal to 1 ansys 2009b since solving these equations directly is extremely difficult rans equations are used reynolds averaged conservation of momentum equation is expressed in eq 7 7 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 μ u i x i x j u i u j ρ g i where u i is velocity component in i direction g i is gravity acceleration and u i u j stands for the reynolds stress that must be modeled using an appropriate turbulence model different methods have been proposed to model reynolds stress and each method suits a specific flow wilcox 1998 here k ω sst turbulence model is used to model reynolds stress in rans equations this turbulence model is a blend of k ε and k ω models the k ω sst turbulence model employs k ε model in vicinity of the wall and k ω model with a transformation function away from the wall therefore it takes advantages of the both models which are good convergence of k ε model and high accuracy of k ω model in vicinity of the wall mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 this two equation model is the best turbulence model to predict flow separation menter et al 2003 free surface model in cfx uses phasic continuation equation to compute the border between two phases in a two phase flow phasic continuity equation for phase α can be expressed as 8 t ρ α r α ρ α r α u α β 1 2 γ α β where γ α β denotes mass flow rate per unit volume from phase α to β lagrangian particle tracking and eulerian eulerian multiphase models are two main approaches used to model multiphase flows in cfx the former is one of the complicated multiphase flows models used for modeling a dispersed system with one or several separate phases in a continuous phase in this model each phase is computed separately in eulerian approach two procedures can be used inhomogeneous and homogeneous multiphase flow model in the former model velocity temperature and turbulence fields for each fluid are dealt with separately while the pressure field is shared by all fluids on the other hand in homogeneous multiphase flow model all fluids share the same velocity temperature and turbulence fields one of the common applications of homogeneous eulerian multiphase model is free surface flow in which water and air are separated by a distinct resolvable interface nevertheless when there is no distinct interface between two phases due to penetration of one phase within another inhomogeneous multiphase flow model is recommended the reason is that unequal velocity field in inhomogeneous analysis allows the phases to separate again and establish a distinct interface ansys 2009b since present study does not deal with significant splashing and jet sprays around the blades and two phases are regarded as continuous phases in a separated system homogenous eulerian multiphase model is employed it is worth mentioning that as in inhomogeneous models there is one solution field for each separate phase more memory and cpu time are needed to run ansys 2009b 3 2 propeller geometry the geometric model and main geometric parameters of the propeller are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 3 3 computational domain and grid generation to simulate propeller s rotation using sliding mesh method the computational domain is divided into rotating and fixed domains the former is a cylinder 1 1d in diameter and the latter is a cylinder 7d in diameters inlet boundary is located at 2d upstream and the outlet boundary is placed at 11d downstream fig 2 illustrates position of rotating and stationary computational domains icem cfd was applied to generate unstructured mesh in computational domains following steps were taken separately in grid generation process 1 using octree method to generate triangular surface mesh 2 using delauny method to generate tetrahedral volume mesh 3 generation of prismatic mesh to resolve boundary layer efficiently 4 merging prismatic mesh with tetrahedral volume mesh given that k ω sst turbulence model is used and the boundary layer is aimed to be fully resolved in prismatic mesh generation step y non dimensional distance from the wall to the first node away from the wall must be less than 1 the empirical equation 9 is used to estimate first prismatic layer thickness base on a specified value of y ansys 2009a 9 δ y 8 6 l y r e 13 14 where l is reference length and is equal to the cord length of the propeller at 0 7r c 0 7 r reynolds number r e is computed as 10 r e ρ v l μ ρ v a 2 0 7 d n π 2 c 0 7 r μ where v is the resultant of advance velocity v a and rotation rate n at 0 7r ρ is water density and μ is water dynamic viscosity with v a 20 knot and n 28 rps reynolds number is equal to 9 4 106 therefore given the limitation y and eq 9 first prismatic layer thickness δ y is 0 0005 mm to have a complete coverage of boundary layers 20 prismatic layers with expansion rate of 1 2 were utilized in generating prismatic mesh it is notable that the grid is adequately refined at the regions with geometric complicacies or severe changes of flow variables sever gradient like leading and trailing edges rotating domain and free surface fig 3 illustrates surface mesh on propeller and unstructured mesh in computational domains 3 4 boundary conditions normal speed condition with medium turbulence intensity 5 and the turbulence viscosity ratio of 10 was set on the inlet boundary outlet boundary condition with zero relative pressure was defined on the outlet boundary boundary condition for cylindrical side wall was considered to be opening boundary with opening pressure that use total pressure when the flow direction is into the domain or relative static pressure when it is leaving the domain moreover zero gradient condition was defined for turbulence intensity when the flow direction is into the domain no slip boundary condition was applied to the propeller to connect stationary and rotating domains together domain interface with ggi general grid interface mesh connection method was prescribed in general ggi connections permit non matching of node location element type surface extent surface shape and even non matching of the flow physics across the connection ansys 2009b the motion of rotating domain into the stationary domain was imposed using mesh motion technique high resolution advection scheme and second order backward euler transient scheme were used for all equations an interface compression level of 2 was applied to control volume fraction advection scheme in phasic continuity equation and in turn increase the air water interface sharpness coupled volume fraction algorithm was used to gain solution stability this algorithm enables solver to couple implicitly the equations for velocity pressure and volume fraction the volume fraction smoothing type was set to volume weighted to improve startup robustness the time step was chosen based on a courant number of 1 or less using a constant time step of 8 8e 5 s corresponding to propeller turn to 0 89 resulted in a proper courant number of 0 98 for the volume fraction equations time step was reduced by an order of magnitude below that of the other equations ansys 2009b while the maximum number of iterations per time step was set to 15 solution converged at each time step in iteration number of 5 or less double precision simulations with flow conditions indicated in table 2 were run on a cluster with 24 cores xeon processors and 96 gb internal memory with parallel computing implementation to assess the convergence of the simulations the criteria of rms 1e 5 solution imbalances 1 were set as another convergence criterion propeller thrust and torque were monitored during the solution process 3 5 grid independence study in order to perform the grid independence study five grid configurations were generated using a systematic grid refinement the variation of thrust coefficient k t with the grid size is then investigated the specifications of the studied grids are shown in table 3 at j 1 3 as shown in figs 4 and 5 there was a big rise of 20 17 in k t when the number of elements increased from 2 74 to 4 88 million then a growth of around 8 7 took place in thrust coefficient from grid 2 4 88 million to grid 3 7 52 million while thrust coefficient experienced an increase of 2 62 from grid 3 to grid 4 it remained intact with an insignificant growth of 0 62 from 10 to 12 7 million elements corresponding to grid 4 and 5 respectively it is worth mentioning that for grid 4 another grid study was conducted the obtained results showed that refinement in prismatic mesh using δy 0 0005 mm or more than 20 prismatic layers did not have any significant effect on the resulting thrust coefficient 3 6 verification study as a verification study the grid convergence index gci method was used to assess the capability of the proposed cfd model and current computer code ansys cfx in solving the system of equations when sufficiently fine grid resolution is employed the gci that is known as an acceptable and recommended method for estimation of discretization error in cfd simulations celik et al 2008 is based on richardson extrapolation re method richardson 1911 richardson and gant 1927 for three sets of grids grid 3 grid 4 and grid 5 the grid refinement factors r 45 and r 34 are computed as r 45 h 4 h 5 1 27 and r 34 h 3 h 4 1 33 where h i is a representative grid size of the i t h grid the apparent order of the method p a is calculated by 11 p a 1 ln r 45 ln ε 34 ε 45 q p a 12 q p a ln r 45 p a s r 34 p a s 13 s 1 s i g n ε 34 ε 45 where ε 34 3 4 ε 45 4 5 and k is the key variable on the k t h grid the extrapolated values are obtained via 14 e x t 45 r 45 p a 5 4 r 45 p a 1 the approximate and extrapolated relative errors are calculated using the following equations respectively 15 e a 45 5 4 5 16 e e x t 45 e x t 45 5 e x t 45 the fine grid convergence index is calculated by 17 g c i f i n e 45 1 25 e a 45 r 45 p a 1 for the three selected grids calculations of discretization error are presented in table 4 as can be seen numerical uncertainties for computed values of k t k q and η were 0 359 0 337 and 0 003 respectively therefore regarding grid independence study and numerical uncertainties estimated from verification study it was concluded that the use of grid 4 with 10066902 elements not only ensured that the results were grid independent but also was numerically cost effective 3 7 validation study since there is no experimental data available for propeller investigated in this paper experimental measurements of spp 841b propeller collected by olofsson 1996 are used to validate numerical results obtained in this study the photograph and cfd model of this propeller are shown in fig 6 to fulfill this purpose numerical method applied in current study was employed to predict hydrodynamic coefficients k t k q η of spp 841b propeller with principal particulars given in table 5 all simulations were carried out at i 0 33 flow conditions in each advance coefficient were set as shown in table 6 in all cases weber numbers are greater than 180 since according to shiba 1953 olofsson 1996 and kozlowska et al 2009 influence of the weber number on the ventilation becomes insignificant with this assumption domain and grid generation steps as well as boundary conditions for spp 841b simulations are similar to those used previously surface mesh on spp 841b propeller and unstructured volume mesh generated in cylindrical domain are shown in fig 7 apart from using small mesh size on leading and trailing edges the grid was considerably refined at the free surface location to resolve two phase flow field equations satisfactorily to indicate the free surface position clearly during unsteady solution in order to carry out the grid sensitivity study and absorb the effects of the grid resolution on the key variables three grid sizes classified as coarse medium and fine were generated indicated in table 7 for each mesh configuration hydrodynamic coefficients of the spp 841b propeller k t k q η were computed at j 1 2 and are also given in table 7 clearly the fine mesh configuration has the minimum relative differences from the experimental data therefore using fine mesh configuration ensured that the results were grid independent and numerically cost effective a verification study based on gci method was performed to estimate discretization error in cfd simulations of the spp 841b propeller for three mesh configurations represented in table 7 numerical uncertainties of computed values related to k t k q and η are calculated via eq 11 to eq 17 and also presented in table 8 as can be seen numerical uncertainties for computed values of k t k q and η were 0 393 0 715 and 0 012 respectively comparison between simulated and measured spp 841b open characteristics is shown in figs 8 and 9 according to the figures numerical results showed a reasonable agreement with experimental data collected by olofsson 1996 relative percentage error in different advance ratios between obtained numerical results and experimental measurements was presented in fig 10 as can be seen the highest relative errors took place at j 0 4 where the propeller was working under heavy load condition at this advance ratio the relative errors were 17 9 and 7 for k t k q and η respectively by contrast the lowest percentage of errors which were approximately 2 8 k t 2 2 k q and 0 58 η are recorded at j 1 2 comparison of the observed and simulated ventilation pattern of the key blade in angular position of θ 120 and j 1 2 is shown in fig 11 it is evident that numerical contour was in good conformity with experimental observation comparisons of the simulated and measured blade force and moment coefficients of k fx and k mx are shown in fig 12 as shown in this figure the simulated values agreed well with experimental measurements even though there are deviations in some regions especially at the blade entry the discrepancies can be attributed to the inability of the present simulation to model the effects of jet sprays and blade vibration in experiment at the instant of impact strong jets develop around the blade leading edge which not only cause high slamming loads but also increase wetted area on face side of the blade these blade entry phenomena contribute significantly to the hydrodynamic loads at the entry phase moreover in the current simulation propeller blades are assumed to be rigid thus the effects of blade vibrations cannot be captured blade vibration is a resonance phenomenon which has considerable impacts on the blade shape and loadings young 2002 4 numerical results since surface piercing propellers function in two phase condition each propeller blade hits the water surface once in each revolution meaning that thrust and torque for each blade increase from zero to the maximum level and then return to the minimum level as a result surface piercing propellers generate oscillating thrust and torque fig 13 illustrates the propeller thrust and torque oscillations in one revolution at j 1 3 fig 14 pictures thrust torque and performance coefficients of the propeller clearly in submerge ratio of i 0 33 the highest performance of the propeller is about 56 which happens at advance coefficient of j 1 1 fig 15 illustrates thrust and torque coefficients of one propeller blade named as key blade in different advance coefficients as the figure shows the thrust and torque start at zero and then increase when key blade enters the water and reach the maximum level at rotation angle of 180 afterwards both of them decrease and return the minimum level variation of thrust coefficient of the key blade just before exit from the water surface is shown in fig 16 as shown in this figure at all advance ratios thrust coefficients becomes zero before key blade exits from the free surface a b and c this means that thrust drag balance on the key blade took place before the blade exits free surface thoroughly and in angular position of θ balance 270 moreover at the higher advance ratios thrust drag balance was seen at lower angular positions as revealed in this figure for advance ratio of j 0 936 thrust drag balance on the key blade was at rotation angle of 248 5 point a for j 1 1 and j 1 3 balance happened at lower rotation angles of 246 point b and 243 point c respectively as pictured in fig 16 after thrust drag balance drag effects on the key blade exceed the thrust meaning that the blade has caused drag fig 17 illustrates volume fraction contour on the key blade at the thrust drag balance positions of a b and c clearly volume fraction of water at the pressure and suction sides of the blade was increased with increase in advance ratio therefore volume of the water that exit free surface was increased that created drag and in turn reduced the efficiency of the blade and caused waste of energy it is notable that the drag is trivial comparing with the maximum thrust produced by key blade according to the coordinate system shown in fig 2 and the definitions of k f x f y f z f x f y f z ρ n 2 d 4 and k m x m y m z m x m y m z ρ n 2 d 5 the six component force and moment coefficients of the key blade k fx k fy k fz k mx k my k mz are calculated and shown in fig 18 as can be seen in a specified advance coefficient k fx and k mz are the maximum force and moment coefficients of the key blade respectively additionally the role of the force component of fy in torque generation k mx is more important after θ 180 since at angular position below than 180 just positive value of fy generates key blade torque and negative value of fy reduces net key blade torque furthermore since fz is negative in 90 θ 270 it generates key blade torque in all angular positions fig 19 illustrates propeller blade section profile at 0 7r that is a reference section with an important role in propeller design process the predictions for pressure coefficient cp around the blade section at 0 7r in different rotation angles are shown in figs 20 22 for advance coefficients of j 0 934 1 1 and 1 3 respectively pressure coefficient is defined as 18 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ v a 2 0 7 d n π 2 where p p 0 is the relative pressure as shown in fig 20 in all rotation angles crossover of the cp curves occurs at x c critical near the trailing edge of the blade section and produces two loops the loop upstream of the crossover named as s thrust produces positive pressure difference which leads to thrust whereas the loop downstream of the crossover named as s drag produces negative pressure difference leading to a reduction of total thrust produced by the section as can be seen there was insignificant positive pressure difference between pressure and suction sides of the section at θ 90 which is why thrust was inconsiderable at this angular position at θ 135 cp was increased in pressure side and decreased in suction side of the blade leading to amplification of the overall positive pressure difference s thrust and therefore thrust was increased it is clear that at θ 135 maximum local positive pressure difference and in turn maximum local thrust was observed near the leading edge of the section meaning that resultant vector of the thrust on the section was close to leading edge of the section moreover as x c was increased from leading edge to trailing edge local positive pressure difference was declined and reached to zero at x c critical 0 85 for x c 0 85 as a result of a steep rise in cp value at pressure side of the section there was negative pressure difference that reduced total thrust produced by the section since at θ 180 the area covered by the cp curves s thrust was the biggest overall positive pressure difference and consequently total thrust of the section reached its maximum value as angular position θ was increased to 225 the overall positive pressure difference s thrust decreased dramatically and limited to 0 5 x c 0 9 additionally overall negative pressure difference s drag was increased as a result total thrust of the section was decreased at θ 225 at θ 270 there was no positive pressure difference along the section whereas drag was caused by negative pressure difference at trailing edge of the section according to figs 20 22 it is clear that in a specified rotation angle θ total thrust of the section was decreased with increase of advance coefficient j since overall positive pressure difference s thrust was declined at higher advance coefficients in a specified advance coefficient j from θ 90 to θ 180 total thrust of the section was increased and maximum local thrust took place close to leading edge of the section whereas from θ 180 to θ 270 total thrust of the section was decreased and maximum local thrust position got away from the leading edge pressure difference at trailing edge of the section was negative for all cases fluid volume fraction contours on both sides of the key blade along with volume fraction distribution on blade section at 0 7r at θ 180 and j 0 934 1 1 1 3 are shown in fig 23 according to contours air volume fraction on pressure side of the blade remained unchanged with increase of advance coefficient whereas it reduced noticeably at suction side of the blade this revealed that ventilation was reduced on suction side with increase of advance coefficient there was a similar pattern for volume fraction distribution on blade section while air volume fraction distribution on pressure side of the section remained stable with increase of advance coefficient it was changed at suction side of the section in other words for j 0 934 ventilation took place on suction side of the section at x c 0 55 and expanded to trailing edge x c 1 however for j 1 1 ventilation was delayed and its start point moved to x c 0 925 for j 1 3 no ventilation was observed on suction side of the section 5 conclusion in the present paper computational fluid dynamics based on a finite volume method was used to investigate unsteady flow around a surface pricing propeller operating in immersion ratio of 33 homogeneous eulerian multiphase model with vof approach was applied in rans solver to solve two phase flow field equations and predict induced hydrodynamic forces and ventilation patterns in range of advance coefficients the accuracy of the numerical method was verified using series of simulations on spp 841b propeller with existing experimental measurements comparison between simulated and measured spp 841b open characteristics as well as ventilation pattern of the key blade indicated a reasonable agreement with experimental data and observations regarding validated numerical method used in this work following conclusions were obtained spp propeller reached its maximum efficiency 56 at j 1 1 maximum thrust and torque coefficients of the key blade took place in angular position of θ 180 thrust drag balance on the key blade happened in angular position of θ balance 270 i e before the blade exit free surface thoroughly additionally θ balance was decreased at higher advance coefficients fluid volume fraction contours on the key blade at θ balance revealed that as advance coefficient was increased water volume fraction on both sides of the blade was increased meaning that more amount of water went out of the free surface in a specified rotation angle θ total thrust of the blade section at 0 7r was decreased with increase of advance coefficient because at higher advance coefficients overall positive pressure difference s thrust was declined in a specified advance coefficient j from θ 90 to θ 180 total thrust of the blade section was increased and maximum local thrust took place close to the leading edge whereas from θ 180 to θ 270 total thrust of the blade section was decreased and maximum local thrust position got away from the leading edge in all advance coefficients negative pressure difference was seen at the trailing edge of the blade section at θ 180 fluid volume fraction contours on both sides of the key blade demonstrated that ventilation was declined on suction side of the blade with increase of advance coefficient 
22393,in this study a tsunami wave profile observed during the 2011 japan tsunami has been parameterized and applied for predicting hydrodynamic characteristics of coastal highway bridges under the impact of tsunami surge waves the propagation of tsunami waves from the open sea to the inshore bridge site and its final impact at coastal highway bridge are typical multiscale coastal flow phenomena whose integral simulation is beyond the reach of most existing numerical models to simulate such multiscale flow phenomena a newly developed coupled modeling system named the sifum fvcom system has been applied to study the tsunami wave impact at a coastal highway bridge deck the effects of three dominant factors particularly distance to the shoreline clearance height and tsunami wave height on the resultant hydrodynamic loads at the bridge deck have been numerically investigated the findings of this paper are believed to be instructive to improve our understandings on the hydrodynamic

modeling system sifum fvcom 1 introduction tsunamis are defined as long ocean waves of small steepness which are triggered by impulsive geophysical events of the seafloor such as earthquakes submarine and aerial mass failures volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts cho et al 2004 synolakis and bernard 2006 larsen et al 2017 at the beginning of this century several tsunami events have caused severe devastation to coastal community and infrastructures i e the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the 2009 samoa tsunami the 2010 chile tsunami and the 2011 japan tsunami the tsunami induced surge waves can easily push down residential buildings and damage coastal bridges resulted in huge human and socioeconomic losses for instance the great japan tsunami imposed devastating damages to the coastal region as far as 7 miles inland leading to 14 508 casualties and 11 452 missing people over 162 000 damaged buildings and 300 coastal highway bridges mori and takahashi 2012 sarfaraz and pak 2017 the property damage in value ranges from 16 to 25 trillion yen mimura et al 2011 fig 1 shows the typical examples of damaged building and highway bridge during the 2011 japan tsunami carey 2015 since 1970s solitary waves have been commonly used as a wave paradigm to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave and its devastating impact at coastal infrastructures using solitary wave the propagation of tsunami waves and their runup and breaking processes on the sloped beach have been tsunami 2011 investigated experimentally and numerically synolakis 1987 gedik et al 2005 cho et al 2004 hsiao and lin 2010 goseberg et al 2013 limura and norio 2012 liang et al 2013 maza et al 2015 empirical formulas were also proposed to predict the maximum runup height of the solitary wave synolakis 1986 1987 madsen and schaffer 2010 the hydrodynamic characteristics of different kinds of coastal infrastructure under the impact of tsunami waves have been also studied by adopting solitary wave i e cylinders zhao et al 2007 xiao et al 2013 lin and liao 2015 zhou et al 2016 aristodemo et al 2017 bai et al 2017 breakwaters huang et al 2003 liu et al 2011 wu and hsiao 2013 wu et al 2014

tsunami waves have been also extensively studied by adopting solitary wave profile as early as the 1960s flow structures and hydrodynamic loads of solitary waves impacting two dimensional plates were systematically investigated experimentally by el ghamry 1963 and french 1969 in recent years seiffert and his group colleagues carried out both experimental and numerical studies on solitary waves imping bridge deck seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 seiffert et al 2015 and effects of some prominent factors such as wave heights and submergence depths on the hydrodynamic loads and related flow phenomena were analyzed in detail the hydrodynamic characteristics of immovable bridge deck crowley et al 2018 fang et al 2018 ti et al 2019 movable bridge deck xu and cai 2015 cai et al 2017 xu et al 2018b and floating bridge deck cheng et al 2018 manisha et al 2019 viuff et al 2019 under extreme surge waves have been also studied extensively to prevent coastal bridges from damages during extreme waves sideroad wei and dalrymple 2016 and air vents xu et al 2016 xu et al 2018a qu et al 2017a installed at bridge deck are recommended qu et al 2018 systematically investigated hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck under joint action of solitary wave and current overall these studies have broadened our understandings on the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave impacting coastal bridges to some extent although solitary wave can capture some main features of tsunami waves the scales of realistic tsunamis differ drastically from that of solitary wave in both wave period and wave length chan and liu 2012 the feasibility of using solitary wave as tsunami wave model is gradually questioned by different researchers madsen et al 2008 madsen and schaffer 2010 it is found that tsunami wave can attack the beach with more energy and it is to break further upon the beach which could induce more damages to the coastal area qu et al 2017b time period during which the hydrodynamic loads act is much longer for the tsunami wave exposing the structure to a considerably larger impulse in comparison to the solitary wave qu et al 2017c hence a more realistic tsunami wave profile is needed in this paper a real world tsunami wave profile observed during the 2011 japan tsunami has been adopted for general application purpose this observed wave has been parameterized qu et al 2017c usually a tsunami starts as surface waves with tiny amplitude in a deep ocean with horizontal scales of o 1 000 km and it gradually evolves into huge walls of high level water and finally splashes against coastal infrastructures such as inland houses and bridges with horizontal scales of o 10 m hence the propagation of tsunami waves from the open sea to the inshore infrastructure site and its final impact at coastal highway bridge are multiscale coastal flow phenomena and simulation of both of them is beyond the reach of most existing numerical models to simulate this kind of multiscale flow phenomena in present paper a newly developed coupled modeling system has been applied to study the dynamic processes of tsunami wave propagation and its final impact at coastal highway bridge this coupled modeling system is established by integrating the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom and the solver for incompressible flow on unstructured mesh sifum by applying domain decomposition method and overset grid techniques qu et al 2019 besides the influences of three dominant factors particularly distance to the shoreline s l clearance height h c and tsunami wave height h t on the resultant hydrodynamic loads at bridge deck have been numerically investigated and discussed in detail the rest of this paper is organized as follows the governing equations of fvcom and sifum and their numerical methods are described in section 2 section 3 presents the framework for coupled modeling system sifum fvcom the open boundary conditions for real world tsunami wave are given in section 4 model validations are presented in section 5 the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave impacting coastal high way bridges and the corresponding discussions are reported in section 6 section 7 summarized the main findings of this study 2 governing equations and numerical methods the governing equations of the two immiscible fluids for the unsteady free surface capture solver sifum are the three dimensional 3d naiver stokes equations for incompressible flows which can be written in the vector form as 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u μ eff u u μ eff p ρ ρ ref g where u is the flow

turbulence viscosity μ t and g is the acceleration of gravity the reference density ρ ref is used to eliminate the hydrostatic pressure accumulation in the gas phase region the total pressure p p ρ ref r g where r is the vector that starts from the reference point to the locations where the total pressure values are calculated in this paper the turbulent viscosity is determined using the classic smagorinsky model 1963 and the turbulent viscosity is calculated as 3 μ t ρc s 2 λ 2 e where c s is a coefficient between 0 1 and 0 2 and a constant value c s 0 2 was used in our model e is the strain rate and λ is the volume of a mesh element s volume the standard log law based wall function is applied at the wall boundaries fergizer and peric 2002 for sifum the computational domain is represented by an unstructured hexahedron mesh to fit the complex solid boundaries all primary variables are stored at the centroid of the control cells to adopt a high order advection scheme the deferred correction proposed by fergizer and peric 2002 was applied to discretize the convective term which combines the first order upwind scheme and the second order gamma scheme jasak 1996 following fergizer and peric 2002 the diffusion term was approximated as central difference by using values at the auxiliary nodes which lie at the intersection of the cell face normal and straight lines connecting the node of the control volume and the neighboring nodes the pressure gradient term was treated as the same way as the diffusion term to compute the velocity and pressure with the discretized momentum equation the momentum interpolation method proposed by rhie and chow 1983 was applied to interpolate the velocities at the faces of the control cell the continuity equation was integrated by summation of the volume fluxes across the faces of each control cell and the velocity and pressure are coupled using pressure implicit split operator piso method proposed by issa 1985 the free surface between water and air is captured using the volume of fluid method vof which was originally proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 the transportation equation of volume of fluid has the following form 4 γ t γ u 0 where γ is the volume fraction of water in a cell and the volume fraction is defined by whether the control volume is filled by water or air as 5 γ 0 air 0 γ 1 interface γ 1 water the local density and viscosity as functions of γ are computed as 6 ρ ρ air γ ρ water ρ air 7 μ l μ air γ μ water μ air the convection equation of the volume fraction was calculated with an algebraic vof method with this method the finite volume method was applied to the convection equation and the volume fraction at the cell face was interpolated with the switching technique for advection and capturing of surfaces stacs proposed by darwish and moukalled 2006 stacs is a high resolution scheme based on the normalized variable diagram nvd concept leonard 1991 which switches between different high resolution differencing schemes to yield a bounded volume of fluid filed according to the free surface orientation for temporal discretization the crank nicolson c n differencing scheme was used to calculate the next time step values by solving the discretized equation it is generally recognized that predictions obtained by stacs are accurate with little diffusion more detailed logics of the normalized variable conception and the stacs scheme can be found in darwish and moukalled 2006 as a kind of geophysical flow dynamic model gfd fvcom has an external mode and an internal mode in its hydrostatic version the governing equations for its external mode are depth averaged continuity and momentum equations 8 η t h v i d 0 9 v i d t h v i v i d gd h η τ s τ b ρ o g the governing equations for the internal mode of the fvcom are the 3d continuity and momentum equations combined with the hydrostatic assumption in σ coordinate system 10 η t h v d ω σ 0 11 v d t h v v d v ω σ gd h η h κ e λ v σ σ d gd ρ o h d σ 0 ρdσ σρ h d h where h is the horizontal gradient in the external model τ b and τ s are the shear stress on the seabed and water surface respectively v i is the depth averaged velocity vector with v i v i x y g includes the rest terms such as coriolis force in the internal model v is the horizontal velocity σ is the vertical coordinate ω is the vertical velocity in σ coordinate e is the strain rate subscript σ is the derivative over σ h stands for the rest terms κ and λ are coefficients the mellor and yamada level 2 5 turbulent closure is used in present version of fvcom mellor and yamada 1974 in fvcom a finite volume method is adopted on a triangular mesh in the horizontal plane and a σ grid in the vertical direction and convection terms are approximated using second order upwind schemes and the time derivative terms are discretized by runge kutta methods the external and internal mode may use different time steps in fvcom pressure is not in presence but it can be recovered by the hydrostatic assumption accompanied with continuous water elevation evolution for further details of fvcom readers are referred to chen et al 2003 as shown in the description above it is found that the sifum and fvcom differ greatly in control equations numerical methods and computational meshes the sifum is designed to capture small scale unsteady 3d flow with free surface distortion involved and fvcom is developed to simulate the flow in oceanic scale to meet the urgent needs to integrally study the multi scale and multi physical coastal flows with free surface involved at an acceptable accuracy and reasonable computational cost a coupled modeling system has been developed qu et al 2019 and its coupled frame work will be illustrated concisely in the following section 3 coupled frame work in this section the concise procedures on integrating of sifum and fvcom will be given which can be regarded as an extension to the preliminary version of coupled modeling system tang et al 2014 by applying the domain decomposition method the whole computational domain has been divided into two subdomains in present coupled modeling system the fvcom is applied to resolve the large scale background flow in domain ω fvcom and sifum is applied to resolve a higher domain which contains both of air and water in the local region ω sifum around coastal infrastructures e g coastal bridge deck as demonstrated in fig 2 where overlapping region exists between sifum and fvcom in this coupled modeling system the boundaries of fvcom i e ω fvcom is located in the subdomain ω sifum and it is called the interface of fvcom portion of boundary ω sifum of ω sifum under the water surface is located in the submain ω fvcom i e a a and b b which is called the interface of sifum and can be denoted by ω sifum water since ω sifum has been divided into several portions different boundary conditions should be imposed according their boundary types the non slip wall boundary condition is imposed at boundary a b and surfaces of coastal structures velocities at ω sifum water a a and b b are interpolated from the fvcom region meanwhile neumann type boundary condition is implemented for pressure pressure outlet boundary condition is applied at boundaries i e a a a b and b b where the atmospheric pressure is imposed and these boundaries can be denoted as ω sifum air in addition the interface ω sifum water of sifum is usually selected in the hydrostatic dominated region where both sifum and fvcom can provide a good solution to run the coupled modeling system sifum and fvcom have to exchange solutions at model interface ω sifum water and ω fvcom since the sifum applies a finite volume method the velocities at the centroids of cells at the interface ω sifum water are transferred straightforward from fvcom region as 12 u sifum v fvcom with p n ρ ρ ref g at ω sifum water and at ω sifum air p 0 is imposed which is referred to atmospheric pressure the corresponding velocities are determined by implementing mass conservation principle at the face centroids of cells at ω sifum air when solution exchange is from sifum to fvcom interface ω fvcom the following conditions are implemented 13 v fvcom u sifum at ω fvcom 14 v fvcom u sifum at ω sifum ω fvcom for a detailed description about the coupled modeling system sifum fvcom such as the interpolation procedures for flow information exchange and numerical experiments and validations readers are referred to qu et al 2019 4 open boundary condition the temporal evolution of water elevation recorded at south iwate station japan during the great japan tsunami 2011 chan and liu 2012 is shown in fig 3 which has been used to drive the computation of fvcom as reported in chan and liu 2012 the distance between the station and the seashore is about 14 000 m and still water depth at the station site is about 204 m hence a plane beach with a slope 1 69 has been applied in present paper to approximate the realistic seashore topology as depicted in fig 3 the scales of realistic tsunamis differ drastically from that of solitary wave in both period and wave length obviously solitary wave cannot describe the leading depression wave and the following secondary elevated wave during a tsunami event based on the concept of n wave chan and liu 2012 used a combination of three sech2 wave profiles to approximate the initial satiation of tsunami wave this treatment was also adopted by schimmels et al 2016 in a large scale experimental facility and williams and fuhrman 2016 in a numerical simulation on tsunami scale wave boundary layers the formula of the combination of three sech2 wave can be described as 15 η x i t i 1 3 h i sech 2 ω i t t o t i in work of chan and liu 2012 eq 15 has been used to approximate the temporal evolution of the tsunami wave recorded at iwate south station during the tohoku tsunami with h i 0 8 2 2 5 85 m ω i 0 179 0 198 0 653 min 1 and t i 9 67 16 33 21 63 min the wave profile of combined sech2 wave has been plotted in fig 3 it is seen that the observed tsunami wave profile has been well represented by the combined sech2 wave in present paper the combined sech2 wave will be named as tsunami like wave to enable the application of tsunami like wave profile formulated by eq 15 in a more general situation the parameters for the tsunami like wave presented in chan and liu 2012 have been normalized by qu et al 2017b as 16 h 1 h o ω 1 ω o t 1 t o 0 119 0 0856 6 556 17 h 2 h o ω 2 ω o t 2 t o 0 328 0 0947 8 776 18 h 3 h o ω 3 ω o t 3 t o 0 873 0 31244 10 54 where h o ω o and t o are the wave height wave frequency and wave period of a solitary wave of the same wave height as tsunami like wave based on eqs 16 17 and 18 it can adapt any solitary wave to a tsunami like wave as one instance fig 4 depicts the profiles of the solitary wave and corresponding tsunami like wave whose parameters are determined through eqs 16 17 and 18 where the still water depth h is 100 m and wave height h is 5 m it clearly shows that tsunami like wave compared with the solitary wave profile can successfully describe a leading depression wave followed by a secondary elevated wave with a wide profile 5 model calibration in this section the reliability of sifum in predicting the local small scale flow has been verified firstly through numerically reproducing the runup and rundown processes of breaking solitary wave on a sloped beach then the proposed coupled modeling system sifum fvcom has been applied to predict the hydrodynamic load of square cylinder impinged by the dambreak induced surge bore for all of these calibration cases the corresponding experimental measurements are available for comparison purpose in addition validations of sifum in predicting solitary wave load at bridge deck and the mesh resolution and time sensitivity studies have been performed in our previous work already qu et al 2018 in this paper a similar mesh resolution near the wall of bridge deck is applied in studying tsunami wave hydrodynamic loads the tsunami like wave profiles have been numerically reproduced in our previous work qu et al 2017c zhao et al 2019 the computational accuracy and convergence rate study of our coupled modeling system sifum fvcom was performed in qu et al 2019 for several different test cases for more details readers are referred to qu et al 2018 and qu et al 2019 5 1 breaking solitary wave runup plane beach since the runup of tsunami wave on the plane beach will be discussed in present paper it requires us to verify the reliability of sifum in predicting the wave runup hence runup of a breaking solitary wave has been numerically simulated in this section the predicted snapshots of water elevation are compared to experimental data collected by synolakis 1987 fig 5 presents a schematic of the experimental layout with h as the incident solitary wave height h the still water depth l the wave length of the solitary wave and β the angle of the beach and tanβ 1 20 for the details of the laboratory setup readers are referred to synolakis 1987 and zelt 1991 during the computation the still water depth h is set as 0 2 m and the wave height h is set as 0 06 m the solitary was generated at a distance l 2 away from the toe of the sloping beach fig 6 compares the snapshots of predicted and measured water surface profiles during the runup and rundown processes of the breaking solitary wave on the sloping beach here after shifting the time scale of the simulated results to be in accordance with the experimental data it is seen that the simulated free surface profiles show good agreement with experimental data as solitary wave approaches the slope its amplitude remains unchanged within the portion where the water depth is constant as shown in fig 6a while it climbs the slope the wave front is increasingly sharpened as demonstrated in fig 6b and c and become more peaked finally the wave breaking happens fig 6d and the breaking wave is to run up along the beach fig 6e and f as shown in fig 6h the wave almost reaches its highest run up point which is about 0 6 ten times the wave height of the initial wave at this moment the water volume in a small region still moves upwards and the major portion of flow on the slope has started the run down process which is shown in fig 6i j k and l overall the agreement between the predictions and measurements are consistently good for both of the runup and rundown process showing that sifum is well suited in predicting wave runup 5 2 dambreak surge wave impact square cylinder to calibrate the computational capability of our coupled model system in predicting the hydrodynamic loads of surge wave at coastal infrastructures the dynamic process of dambreak induced surge wave impinging square cylinder is numerically reproduced the predicted horizontal load is compared with the corresponding experimental data collected by árnason 2005 the computational layout is plotted in fig 7 the computational domain is 16 6 m in length 0 6 m in width and 0 45 m in height the width of the square cylinder is 0 12 m and it locates in the middle with a distance of 11 1 m from the left boundary of the domain the initial water depth is 0 25 m at the left side and 0 02 m at the right side fig 7 as shown in fig 8 the computational mesh of fvcom covers the entire region with 4 000 elements in horizontal plane and 11 σ layers in vertical direction the computational domain of sifum only covers the portion of the region from x 8 47 16 6 m using 361 500 elements and the fine mesh spacing near the surface of square cylinder is 0 01 m the snapshots of the water body at different time instances are plotted in fig 9 a seen in fig 9 the dambreak induced surge bore can smoothly pass the interface between fvcom and sifum and the surge bore will gradually propagate from left side to right side fig 9a and it will impact the square cylinder at about t 3 6s fig 9b once the leading surge wave impacting square cylinder wave reflection is observed fig 9c and the surge bore will continually move forward fig 9d the time series of the predicted horizontal wave load of square cylinder is compared with corresponding measurement as shown in fig 10 overall the predicted wave load is in good agreement with the measurement hence the computational capability of the coupled modeling system sifum fvcom in predicting the wave load is well calibrated 6 result and discussion 6 1 tsunami wave runup as the first application the runup of tsunami wave onto the sloping beach 1 69 has been simulated in this section the elevation recorded at iwate south station as shown in fig 3 has been used to drive the computation the computational layout has been depicted in fig 11 the still water surface intersects with beach plane at x 0 m the still water depth at the inlet of the computational is 204 m the whole computational is covered by fvcom mesh by using 16 704 elements in horizontal plane and 21 layers in vertical direction the sifum solver only resolves a local region 0 x 2 000 m with 199 900 unstructured quadrilateral elements which locates 14 000 m away from inlet of the computational domain the width of the computational is 100 m for both of fvcom and sifum solvers in the all of the following computations 2d mode of sifum is applied with implementing slip boundary conditions at side walls of the computational domain while 3d mode of fvcom is applied with four mesh layers in the lateral direction since the hydrostatic assumption has been applied in the present version of fvcom it cannot predict tsunami wave runup with an acceptable accuracy especially for wave breaking process while its coupled with sifum can overcome such drawback hence this computational case is good example to show the main aspects of coupled modeling system sifum fvcom the snapshots of predicted water contours at different time instances have been plotted in fig 12 where both zoom out and zoom in views are available it shows that the tsunami wave surge doesn t enter the sifum domain until t 20 8 min fig 12b then the tsunami wave surge keeps running up onto the beach with an increasing water level fig 12c meanwhile the slope of surge front gradually becomes more and more steeper at t 29 2 min the wave breaking is going to happen fig 12c after wave breaking the surge bore keeps running up along the beach with a high velocity about 9 m s and nearly vertical surge front fig 12e f and g at t 32 5 min the tsunami surge reaches its maximum runup at about x 1200 m fig 12h later the wave surge receding happens fig 12i snapshots of total velocity contour at different time instances in sifum domain have been plotted in fig 13 it is interesting that the tsunami surge has higher velocity after breaking and a small water jump happens near the water surface fig 12e and f and 13b it is also notice that the water level at the left boundary of sifum has reached 12 5 m during the computation as discussion shown above the coupled modeling system sifum fvcom can capture the tsunami wave runup processes reasonably especially wave breaking process and also the tsunami surge flow can smoothly pass the interfaces between fvcom and sifum 6 2 tsunami wave impact bridge deck in this section the tsunami wave impact coastal highway bridge has been numerically investigated as shown in section 6 1 the predicted maximum runup distance of the observed tsunami wave is about 1200 m and it is also noticed that the tsunami wave breaking in the region 200 x 550 m after x 500 m the breaking tsunami wave surge propagates along the slope beach as shown in fig 12e h hence two basic runs have been designed with 1 bridge deck locating at x 300 m and 2 bridge deck locating at x 600 m fig 14 depicts the computational layout which is similar as that for the tsunami wave runup case in section 6 1 except the full scale bridge deck of that described in qu et al 2018 has been presented inside as shown in fig 15 the clearance height h c of the bridge deck is 4 m which is measured from the beach bed to the bottom of bridge girders the whole computational is covered by fvcom mesh by using 16 704 elements in horizontal plane and 21 layers in vertical direction the sifum solver only resolves a local region 0 x 1 300 m with 209 784 unstructured quadrilateral elements which locates 14 000 m away from inlet of the computational domain 6 2 1 case i tsunami impact bridge at x 300 m since the bridge deck is located in the region of tsunami breaking it takes about 22 92 min before the tsunami surge arriving at bridge site fig 16 a and the water elevation at the bridge deck site gradually increases as shown in fig 16b at some moment the water flow with high flow speed can reach a water level which is higher than the top wall of the bridge deck fig 16c then overtopping flow happens and finally make the whole bridge deck submerged fig 16d e and f meanwhile the overall water level in the bridge region keeps increasing as you can from fig 16b d the main process of tsunami wave impacting bridge deck happens within a temporal period less than 0 5 min which hints the reason for the tremendous power of tsunami fig 17 depicts the temporal evolution of horizontal and vertical components of tsunami hydrodynamic loads at the bridge deck both of the horizontal and vertical forces have a sharp increasing rate at time around t 29 17 min which is in accordance with the water contour shown in fig 16c both of the horizontal and vertical components of the tsunami wave forces have a huge positive peak value and the vertical force also exhibits a high negative peak value the large negative vertical force was mainly caused by the weight of a great amount of water overturning and flowing over the top of the bridge deck in addition the downward slamming force of the surge bore also contribute some portion of the negative vertical force 6 2 2 case ii tsunami impact bridge at x 600 m in this case the bridge deck is located outside of tsunami breaking region before the tsunami flow arrives at the bridge site a tsunami surge bore with a water level approximately 4 5 m has already formed which propagates with a high flow speed at about 10 m s to the bridge deck site as demonstrated in fig 18 b and the tsunami surge bore impacts the bridge deck at about t 29 71 min fig 18c since the bridge deck blocks some portion of the flow the water level at the front of deck increases very fast fig 18c and d later an overtopping flow happens fig 18e and f the temporal evolution of horizontal and vertical components of tsunami wave forces have been plotted in fig 19 which look similar as that in case i while the maximum horizontal force is little bit smaller than that in case i also due to the fluctuations of overtopping flow the vertical force exhibits a more fluctuating pattern compared with vertical force curve for case i besides it is found that some air has been trapped into the water flow as tsunami surge bore rushes on the beach as demonstrated in the water contour figures fig 18 6 3 effects of clearance height on tsunami wave impact bridge deck in this section bridge deck locating at x 600 m has been selected to investigate the clearance height on the tsunami wave loads besides the results for h c 4m another two clearance heights h c 2 and 3m have been selected fig 20 plots the snapshots of water contours at different time instances for bridge deck with h c 2 and 3m it is noticed that tsunami surge bore arrive at the bridge site at nearly same time although there is a little discrepancy in the surge shape and position according to the authors knowledge this could be attributed to the long computational time period mesh resolution and the instability of surge bore as the clearance height increases the tsunami surge impacting intensity is decreased as shown in different size of water jets fig 20b later overtopping flow happens fig 20c and the whole bridge decks are submerged by tsunami surge flow fig 20d similar as the results in previous sections some air has been also trapped into the water flow shown as light blue color in the water body contour figures fig 20 the time series of horizontal and vertical components of the tsunami wave loads have been depicted in fig 21 where the tsunami wave loads force case with h c 4 m is added for comparison purpose interestingly there are five force impulses in the vertical force as shown in the zoom in view of fig 21 which is in accordance with the number of chambers of bridge deck the variation of maximum tsunami wave loads under different clearance heights has been plotted in fig 22 it apparently shows that the maximum forces decrease linearly with the increasing of clearance heights for both horizontal and vertical components of hydrodynamic load this is directly caused by the reduced overtopping water weight as the clearance height increases meanwhile the resultant slamming force is also reduced 6 4 effect of wave height on tsunami wave impact bridge deck to investigate the effects of wave height on the tsunami hydrodynamic loads at the bridge deck three tsunami like wave profiles have been developed by applying eqs 15 18 bridge deck locating at x 600 m has been selected and the clearance height h c of the bridge deck is 4 m fig 23 plots the wave profiles for tsunami wave heights h 7 m 9 m and 11 m respectively as shown in fig 23 the leading depression wave becomes apparent as wave height increases fig 24 depicts the temporal evolution of water profile colored by total velocity magnitude for the tsunami wave with h 11m it is noticed that a huge surge front has been formed in front of bridge deck fig 24b and it directly run onto the bridge deck and huge overtopping water has been generated fig 24c later the bridge deck is submerged completely in a very short time period fig 24d as the flow develops vortices shedding phenomena happens as shown in fig 24e it is also observed that there is thin layer with low water velocity at the top of the surge bore this can be due to large water surface fluctuations formed as tsunami surge bore rushing onto the beach time series of tsunami wave forces have been plotted in fig 25 since a higher wave height will produce a higher wave celerity tsunami wave with h 11m arrives earlier at the bridge site it is also interesting that both maximum horizontal and vertical forces increase linearly with the increasing of wave heights as depicted in fig 26 as wave height increases the intensity of tsunami surge wave is enhanced leading to a higher runup height a stronger wall shape tsunami surge bore with a higher water level after the surge wave breaking can be formed which finally results in an increasing in the hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck 7 conclusion since the propagation of tsunami waves from the open sea to the bridge site and its final impact at coastal highway bridge are typical multiscale coastal flow phenomena and their integral simulation is beyond the reach of most existing numerical models in present paper a well calibrated coupled modeling system sifum fvcom designed for simulation of multiscale coastal flow phenomena has been applied to investigate the tsunami wave impacting coastal highway bridge to overcome the drawbacks of using solitary wave as the paradigm to study hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave and its devastating impact a tsunami wave profile observed during the 2011 japan tsunami has been applied the results presented in this paper has revealed that coastal bridge will undergo tsunami wave forces with different characteristics if they are located at different tsunami surge evolution stages also both clearance height of bridge and the tsunami wave height will have profound influence on the hydrodynamic loads of tsunami surge bore as the clearance height of the bridge deck increases the tsunami hydrodynamic loads will be substantially reduced in a linear mode it is also found that the both horizontal and vertical component of the tsunami wave force are linear function of wave height as wave height increases the intensity of tsunami surge wave is enhanced leading to a higher runup height a stronger wall shape tsunami surge bore with a higher water level after the surge wave breaking can be formed which finally results in an increase in the hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck in view of its performance in the simulaiton of this paper it is believed that coupled modeling system sifum fvcom is a powerful tool to handle different kinds of multiscale coastal flows

modeling system sifum fvcom 1 introduction tsunamis are defined as long ocean waves of small steepness which are triggered by impulsive geophysical events of the seafloor such as earthquakes submarine and aerial mass failures volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts cho et al 2004 synolakis and bernard 2006 larsen et al 2017 at the beginning of this century several tsunami events have caused severe devastation to coastal community and infrastructures i e the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the 2009 samoa tsunami the 2010 chile tsunami and the 2011 japan tsunami the tsunami induced surge waves can easily push down residential buildings and damage coastal bridges resulted in huge human and socioeconomic losses for instance the great japan tsunami imposed devastating damages to the coastal region as far as 7 miles inland leading to 14 508 casualties and 11 452 missing people over 162 000 damaged buildings and 300 coastal highway bridges mori and takahashi 2012 sarfaraz and pak 2017 the property damage in value ranges from 16 to 25 trillion yen mimura et al 2011 fig 1 shows the typical examples of damaged building and highway bridge during the 2011 japan tsunami carey 2015 since 1970s solitary waves have been commonly used as a wave paradigm to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave and its devastating impact at coastal infrastructures using solitary wave the propagation of tsunami waves and their runup and breaking processes on the sloped beach have been tsunami 2011 investigated experimentally and numerically synolakis 1987 gedik et al 2005 cho et al 2004 hsiao and lin 2010 goseberg et al 2013 limura and norio 2012 liang et al 2013 maza et al 2015 empirical formulas were also proposed to predict the maximum runup height of the solitary wave synolakis 1986 1987 madsen and schaffer 2010 the hydrodynamic characteristics of different kinds of coastal infrastructure under the impact of tsunami waves have been also studied by adopting solitary wave i e cylinders zhao et al 2007 xiao et al 2013 lin and liao 2015 zhou et al 2016 aristodemo et al 2017 bai et al 2017 breakwaters huang et al 2003 liu et al 2011 wu and hsiao 2013 wu et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 seawalls liang et al 2017 luo et al 2019 platforms wang et al 2018 you et al 2019 and beachfront houses xiao and huang 2008 etc besides the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under tsunami waves have been also extensively studied by adopting solitary wave profile as early as the 1960s flow structures and hydrodynamic loads of solitary waves impacting two dimensional plates were systematically investigated experimentally by el ghamry 1963 and french 1969 in recent years seiffert and his group colleagues carried out both experimental and numerical studies on solitary waves imping bridge deck seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 seiffert et al 2015 and effects of some prominent factors such as wave heights and submergence depths on the hydrodynamic loads and related flow phenomena were analyzed in detail the hydrodynamic characteristics of immovable bridge deck crowley et al 2018 fang et al 2018 ti et al 2019 movable bridge deck xu and cai 2015 cai et al 2017 xu et al 2018b and floating bridge deck cheng et al 2018 manisha et al 2019 viuff et al 2019 under extreme surge waves have been also studied extensively to prevent coastal bridges from damages during extreme waves sideroad wei and dalrymple 2016 and air vents xu et al 2016 xu et al 2018a qu et al 2017a installed at bridge deck are recommended qu et al 2018 systematically investigated hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck under joint action of solitary wave and current overall these studies have broadened our understandings on the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave impacting coastal bridges to some extent although solitary wave can capture some main features of tsunami waves the scales of realistic tsunamis differ drastically from that of solitary wave in both wave period and wave length chan and liu 2012 the feasibility of using solitary wave as tsunami wave model is gradually questioned by different researchers madsen et al 2008 madsen and schaffer 2010 it is found that tsunami wave can attack the beach with more energy and it is to break further upon the beach which could induce more damages to the coastal area qu et al 2017b time period during which the hydrodynamic loads act is much longer for the tsunami wave exposing the structure to a considerably larger impulse in comparison to the solitary wave qu et al 2017c hence a more realistic tsunami wave profile is needed in this paper a real world tsunami wave profile observed during the 2011 japan tsunami has been adopted for general application purpose this observed wave has been parameterized qu et al 2017c usually a tsunami starts as surface waves with tiny amplitude in a deep ocean with horizontal scales of o 1 000 km and it gradually evolves into huge walls of high level water and finally splashes against coastal infrastructures such as inland houses and bridges with horizontal scales of o 10 m hence the propagation of tsunami waves from the open sea to the inshore infrastructure site and its final impact at coastal highway bridge are multiscale coastal flow phenomena and simulation of both of them is beyond the reach of most existing numerical models to simulate this kind of multiscale flow phenomena in present paper a newly developed coupled modeling system has been applied to study the dynamic processes of tsunami wave propagation and its final impact at coastal highway bridge this coupled modeling system is established by integrating the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom and the solver for incompressible flow on unstructured mesh sifum by applying domain decomposition method and overset grid techniques qu et al 2019 besides the influences of three dominant factors particularly distance to the shoreline s l clearance height h c and tsunami wave height h t on the resultant hydrodynamic loads at bridge deck have been numerically investigated and discussed in detail the rest of this paper is organized as follows the governing equations of fvcom and sifum and their numerical methods are described in section 2 section 3 presents the framework for coupled modeling system sifum fvcom the open boundary conditions for real world tsunami wave are given in section 4 model validations are presented in section 5 the hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave impacting coastal high way bridges and the corresponding discussions are reported in section 6 section 7 summarized the main findings of this study 2 governing equations and numerical methods the governing equations of the two immiscible fluids for the unsteady free surface capture solver sifum are the three dimensional 3d naiver stokes equations for incompressible flows which can be written in the vector form as 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u μ eff u u μ eff p ρ ρ ref g where u is the flow

turbulence viscosity μ t and g is the acceleration of gravity the reference density ρ ref is used to eliminate the hydrostatic pressure accumulation in the gas phase region the total pressure p p ρ ref r g where r is the vector that starts from the reference point to the locations where the total pressure values are calculated in this paper the turbulent viscosity is determined using the classic smagorinsky model 1963 and the turbulent viscosity is calculated as 3 μ t ρc s 2 λ 2 e where c s is a coefficient between 0 1 and 0 2 and a constant value c s 0 2 was used in our model e is the strain rate and λ is the volume of a mesh element s volume the standard log law based wall function is applied at the wall boundaries fergizer and peric 2002 for sifum the computational domain is represented by an unstructured hexahedron mesh to fit the complex solid boundaries all primary variables are stored at the centroid of the control cells to adopt a high order advection scheme the deferred correction proposed by fergizer and peric 2002 was applied to discretize the convective term which combines the first order upwind scheme and the second order gamma scheme jasak 1996 following fergizer and peric 2002 the diffusion term was approximated as central difference by using values at the auxiliary nodes which lie at the intersection of the cell face normal and straight lines connecting the node of the control volume and the neighboring nodes the pressure gradient term was treated as the same way as the diffusion term to compute the velocity and pressure with the discretized momentum equation the momentum interpolation method proposed by rhie and chow 1983 was applied to interpolate the velocities at the faces of the control cell the continuity equation was integrated by summation of the volume fluxes across the faces of each control cell and the velocity and pressure are coupled using pressure implicit split operator piso method proposed by issa 1985 the free surface between water and air is captured using the volume of fluid method vof which was originally proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 the transportation equation of volume of fluid has the following form 4 γ t γ u 0 where γ is the volume fraction of water in a cell and the volume fraction is defined by whether the control volume is filled by water or air as 5 γ 0 air 0 γ 1 interface γ 1 water the local density and viscosity as functions of γ are computed as 6 ρ ρ air γ ρ water ρ air 7 μ l μ air γ μ water μ air the convection equation of the volume fraction was calculated with an algebraic vof method with this method the finite volume method was applied to the convection equation and the volume fraction at the cell face was interpolated with the switching technique for advection and capturing of surfaces stacs proposed by darwish and moukalled 2006 stacs is a high resolution scheme based on the normalized variable diagram nvd concept leonard 1991 which switches between different high resolution differencing schemes to yield a bounded volume of fluid filed according to the free surface orientation for temporal discretization the crank nicolson c n differencing scheme was used to calculate the next time step values by solving the discretized equation it is generally recognized that predictions obtained by stacs are accurate with little diffusion more detailed logics of the normalized variable conception and the stacs scheme can be found in darwish and moukalled 2006 as a kind of geophysical flow dynamic model gfd fvcom has an external mode and an internal mode in its hydrostatic version the governing equations for its external mode are depth averaged continuity and momentum equations 8 η t h v i d 0 9 v i d t h v i v i d gd h η τ s τ b ρ o g the governing equations for the internal mode of the fvcom are the 3d continuity and momentum equations combined with the hydrostatic assumption in σ coordinate system 10 η t h v d ω σ 0 11 v d t h v v d v ω σ gd h η h κ e λ v σ σ d gd ρ o h d σ 0 ρdσ σρ h d h where h is the horizontal gradient in the external model τ b and τ s are the shear stress on the seabed and water surface respectively v i is the depth averaged velocity vector with v i v i x y g includes the rest terms such as coriolis force in the internal model v is the horizontal velocity σ is the vertical coordinate ω is the vertical velocity in σ coordinate e is the strain rate subscript σ is the derivative over σ h stands for the rest terms κ and λ are coefficients the mellor and yamada level 2 5 turbulent closure is used in present version of fvcom mellor and yamada 1974 in fvcom a finite volume method is adopted on a triangular mesh in the horizontal plane and a σ grid in the vertical direction and convection terms are approximated using second order upwind schemes and the time derivative terms are discretized by runge kutta methods the external and internal mode may use different time steps in fvcom pressure is not in presence but it can be recovered by the hydrostatic assumption accompanied with continuous water elevation evolution for further details of fvcom readers are referred to chen et al 2003 as shown in the description above it is found that the sifum and fvcom differ greatly in control equations numerical methods and computational meshes the sifum is designed to capture small scale unsteady 3d flow with free surface distortion involved and fvcom is developed to simulate the flow in oceanic scale to meet the urgent needs to integrally study the multi scale and multi physical coastal flows with free surface involved at an acceptable accuracy and reasonable computational cost a coupled modeling system has been developed qu et al 2019 and its coupled frame work will be illustrated concisely in the following section 3 coupled frame work in this section the concise procedures on integrating of sifum and fvcom will be given which can be regarded as an extension to the preliminary version of coupled modeling system tang et al 2014 by applying the domain decomposition method the whole computational domain has been divided into two subdomains in present coupled modeling system the fvcom is applied to resolve the large scale background flow in domain ω fvcom and sifum is applied to resolve a higher domain which contains both of air and water in the local region ω sifum around coastal infrastructures e g coastal bridge deck as demonstrated in fig 2 where overlapping region exists between sifum and fvcom in this coupled modeling system the boundaries of fvcom i e ω fvcom is located in the subdomain ω sifum and it is called the interface of fvcom portion of boundary ω sifum of ω sifum under the water surface is located in the submain ω fvcom i e a a and b b which is called the interface of sifum and can be denoted by ω sifum water since ω sifum has been divided into several portions different boundary conditions should be imposed according their boundary types the non slip wall boundary condition is imposed at boundary a b and surfaces of coastal structures velocities at ω sifum water a a and b b are interpolated from the fvcom region meanwhile neumann type boundary condition is implemented for pressure pressure outlet boundary condition is applied at boundaries i e a a a b and b b where the atmospheric pressure is imposed and these boundaries can be denoted as ω sifum air in addition the interface ω sifum water of sifum is usually selected in the hydrostatic dominated region where both sifum and fvcom can provide a good solution to run the coupled modeling system sifum and fvcom have to exchange solutions at model interface ω sifum water and ω fvcom since the sifum applies a finite volume method the velocities at the centroids of cells at the interface ω sifum water are transferred straightforward from fvcom region as 12 u sifum v fvcom with p n ρ ρ ref g at ω sifum water and at ω sifum air p 0 is imposed which is referred to atmospheric pressure the corresponding velocities are determined by implementing mass conservation principle at the face centroids of cells at ω sifum air when solution exchange is from sifum to fvcom interface ω fvcom the following conditions are implemented 13 v fvcom u sifum at ω fvcom 14 v fvcom u sifum at ω sifum ω fvcom for a detailed description about the coupled modeling system sifum fvcom such as the interpolation procedures for flow information exchange and numerical experiments and validations readers are referred to qu et al 2019 4 open boundary condition the temporal evolution of water elevation recorded at south iwate station japan during the great japan tsunami 2011 chan and liu 2012 is shown in fig 3 which has been used to drive the computation of fvcom as reported in chan and liu 2012 the distance between the station and the seashore is about 14 000 m and still water depth at the station site is about 204 m hence a plane beach with a slope 1 69 has been applied in present paper to approximate the realistic seashore topology as depicted in fig 3 the scales of realistic tsunamis differ drastically from that of solitary wave in both period and wave length obviously solitary wave cannot describe the leading depression wave and the following secondary elevated wave during a tsunami event based on the concept of n wave chan and liu 2012 used a combination of three sech2 wave profiles to approximate the initial satiation of tsunami wave this treatment was also adopted by schimmels et al 2016 in a large scale experimental facility and williams and fuhrman 2016 in a numerical simulation on tsunami scale wave boundary layers the formula of the combination of three sech2 wave can be described as 15 η x i t i 1 3 h i sech 2 ω i t t o t i in work of chan and liu 2012 eq 15 has been used to approximate the temporal evolution of the tsunami wave recorded at iwate south station during the tohoku tsunami with h i 0 8 2 2 5 85 m ω i 0 179 0 198 0 653 min 1 and t i 9 67 16 33 21 63 min the wave profile of combined sech2 wave has been plotted in fig 3 it is seen that the observed tsunami wave profile has been well represented by the combined sech2 wave in present paper the combined sech2 wave will be named as tsunami like wave to enable the application of tsunami like wave profile formulated by eq 15 in a more general situation the parameters for the tsunami like wave presented in chan and liu 2012 have been normalized by qu et al 2017b as 16 h 1 h o ω 1 ω o t 1 t o 0 119 0 0856 6 556 17 h 2 h o ω 2 ω o t 2 t o 0 328 0 0947 8 776 18 h 3 h o ω 3 ω o t 3 t o 0 873 0 31244 10 54 where h o ω o and t o are the wave height wave frequency and wave period of a solitary wave of the same wave height as tsunami like wave based on eqs 16 17 and 18 it can adapt any solitary wave to a tsunami like wave as one instance fig 4 depicts the profiles of the solitary wave and corresponding tsunami like wave whose parameters are determined through eqs 16 17 and 18 where the still water depth h is 100 m and wave height h is 5 m it clearly shows that tsunami like wave compared with the solitary wave profile can successfully describe a leading depression wave followed by a secondary elevated wave with a wide profile 5 model calibration in this section the reliability of sifum in predicting the local small scale flow has been verified firstly through numerically reproducing the runup and rundown processes of breaking solitary wave on a sloped beach then the proposed coupled modeling system sifum fvcom has been applied to predict the hydrodynamic load of square cylinder impinged by the dambreak induced surge bore for all of these calibration cases the corresponding experimental measurements are available for comparison purpose in addition validations of sifum in predicting solitary wave load at bridge deck and the mesh resolution and time sensitivity studies have been performed in our previous work already qu et al 2018 in this paper a similar mesh resolution near the wall of bridge deck is applied in studying tsunami wave hydrodynamic loads the tsunami like wave profiles have been numerically reproduced in our previous work qu et al 2017c zhao et al 2019 the computational accuracy and convergence rate study of our coupled modeling system sifum fvcom was performed in qu et al 2019 for several different test cases for more details readers are referred to qu et al 2018 and qu et al 2019 5 1 breaking solitary wave runup plane beach since the runup of tsunami wave on the plane beach will be discussed in present paper it requires us to verify the reliability of sifum in predicting the wave runup hence runup of a breaking solitary wave has been numerically simulated in this section the predicted snapshots of water elevation are compared to experimental data collected by synolakis 1987 fig 5 presents a schematic of the experimental layout with h as the incident solitary wave height h the still water depth l the wave length of the solitary wave and β the angle of the beach and tanβ 1 20 for the details of the laboratory setup readers are referred to synolakis 1987 and zelt 1991 during the computation the still water depth h is set as 0 2 m and the wave height h is set as 0 06 m the solitary was generated at a distance l 2 away from the toe of the sloping beach fig 6 compares the snapshots of predicted and measured water surface profiles during the runup and rundown processes of the breaking solitary wave on the sloping beach here after shifting the time scale of the simulated results to be in accordance with the experimental data it is seen that the simulated free surface profiles show good agreement with experimental data as solitary wave approaches the slope its amplitude remains unchanged within the portion where the water depth is constant as shown in fig 6a while it climbs the slope the wave front is increasingly sharpened as demonstrated in fig 6b and c and become more peaked finally the wave breaking happens fig 6d and the breaking wave is to run up along the beach fig 6e and f as shown in fig 6h the wave almost reaches its highest run up point which is about 0 6 ten times the wave height of the initial wave at this moment the water volume in a small region still moves upwards and the major portion of flow on the slope has started the run down process which is shown in fig 6i j k and l overall the agreement between the predictions and measurements are consistently good for both of the runup and rundown process showing that sifum is well suited in predicting wave runup 5 2 dambreak surge wave impact square cylinder to calibrate the computational capability of our coupled model system in predicting the hydrodynamic loads of surge wave at coastal infrastructures the dynamic process of dambreak induced surge wave impinging square cylinder is numerically reproduced the predicted horizontal load is compared with the corresponding experimental data collected by árnason 2005 the computational layout is plotted in fig 7 the computational domain is 16 6 m in length 0 6 m in width and 0 45 m in height the width of the square cylinder is 0 12 m and it locates in the middle with a distance of 11 1 m from the left boundary of the domain the initial water depth is 0 25 m at the left side and 0 02 m at the right side fig 7 as shown in fig 8 the computational mesh of fvcom covers the entire region with 4 000 elements in horizontal plane and 11 σ layers in vertical direction the computational domain of sifum only covers the portion of the region from x 8 47 16 6 m using 361 500 elements and the fine mesh spacing near the surface of square cylinder is 0 01 m the snapshots of the water body at different time instances are plotted in fig 9 a seen in fig 9 the dambreak induced surge bore can smoothly pass the interface between fvcom and sifum and the surge bore will gradually propagate from left side to right side fig 9a and it will impact the square cylinder at about t 3 6s fig 9b once the leading surge wave impacting square cylinder wave reflection is observed fig 9c and the surge bore will continually move forward fig 9d the time series of the predicted horizontal wave load of square cylinder is compared with corresponding measurement as shown in fig 10 overall the predicted wave load is in good agreement with the measurement hence the computational capability of the coupled modeling system sifum fvcom in predicting the wave load is well calibrated 6 result and discussion 6 1 tsunami wave runup as the first application the runup of tsunami wave onto the sloping beach 1 69 has been simulated in this section the elevation recorded at iwate south station as shown in fig 3 has been used to drive the computation the computational layout has been depicted in fig 11 the still water surface intersects with beach plane at x 0 m the still water depth at the inlet of the computational is 204 m the whole computational is covered by fvcom mesh by using 16 704 elements in horizontal plane and 21 layers in vertical direction the sifum solver only resolves a local region 0 x 2 000 m with 199 900 unstructured quadrilateral elements which locates 14 000 m away from inlet of the computational domain the width of the computational is 100 m for both of fvcom and sifum solvers in the all of the following computations 2d mode of sifum is applied with implementing slip boundary conditions at side walls of the computational domain while 3d mode of fvcom is applied with four mesh layers in the lateral direction since the hydrostatic assumption has been applied in the present version of fvcom it cannot predict tsunami wave runup with an acceptable accuracy especially for wave breaking process while its coupled with sifum can overcome such drawback hence this computational case is good example to show the main aspects of coupled modeling system sifum fvcom the snapshots of predicted water contours at different time instances have been plotted in fig 12 where both zoom out and zoom in views are available it shows that the tsunami wave surge doesn t enter the sifum domain until t 20 8 min fig 12b then the tsunami wave surge keeps running up onto the beach with an increasing water level fig 12c meanwhile the slope of surge front gradually becomes more and more steeper at t 29 2 min the wave breaking is going to happen fig 12c after wave breaking the surge bore keeps running up along the beach with a high velocity about 9 m s and nearly vertical surge front fig 12e f and g at t 32 5 min the tsunami surge reaches its maximum runup at about x 1200 m fig 12h later the wave surge receding happens fig 12i snapshots of total velocity contour at different time instances in sifum domain have been plotted in fig 13 it is interesting that the tsunami surge has higher velocity after breaking and a small water jump happens near the water surface fig 12e and f and 13b it is also notice that the water level at the left boundary of sifum has reached 12 5 m during the computation as discussion shown above the coupled modeling system sifum fvcom can capture the tsunami wave runup processes reasonably especially wave breaking process and also the tsunami surge flow can smoothly pass the interfaces between fvcom and sifum 6 2 tsunami wave impact bridge deck in this section the tsunami wave impact coastal highway bridge has been numerically investigated as shown in section 6 1 the predicted maximum runup distance of the observed tsunami wave is about 1200 m and it is also noticed that the tsunami wave breaking in the region 200 x 550 m after x 500 m the breaking tsunami wave surge propagates along the slope beach as shown in fig 12e h hence two basic runs have been designed with 1 bridge deck locating at x 300 m and 2 bridge deck locating at x 600 m fig 14 depicts the computational layout which is similar as that for the tsunami wave runup case in section 6 1 except the full scale bridge deck of that described in qu et al 2018 has been presented inside as shown in fig 15 the clearance height h c of the bridge deck is 4 m which is measured from the beach bed to the bottom of bridge girders the whole computational is covered by fvcom mesh by using 16 704 elements in horizontal plane and 21 layers in vertical direction the sifum solver only resolves a local region 0 x 1 300 m with 209 784 unstructured quadrilateral elements which locates 14 000 m away from inlet of the computational domain 6 2 1 case i tsunami impact bridge at x 300 m since the bridge deck is located in the region of tsunami breaking it takes about 22 92 min before the tsunami surge arriving at bridge site fig 16 a and the water elevation at the bridge deck site gradually increases as shown in fig 16b at some moment the water flow with high flow speed can reach a water level which is higher than the top wall of the bridge deck fig 16c then overtopping flow happens and finally make the whole bridge deck submerged fig 16d e and f meanwhile the overall water level in the bridge region keeps increasing as you can from fig 16b d the main process of tsunami wave impacting bridge deck happens within a temporal period less than 0 5 min which hints the reason for the tremendous power of tsunami fig 17 depicts the temporal evolution of horizontal and vertical components of tsunami hydrodynamic loads at the bridge deck both of the horizontal and vertical forces have a sharp increasing rate at time around t 29 17 min which is in accordance with the water contour shown in fig 16c both of the horizontal and vertical components of the tsunami wave forces have a huge positive peak value and the vertical force also exhibits a high negative peak value the large negative vertical force was mainly caused by the weight of a great amount of water overturning and flowing over the top of the bridge deck in addition the downward slamming force of the surge bore also contribute some portion of the negative vertical force 6 2 2 case ii tsunami impact bridge at x 600 m in this case the bridge deck is located outside of tsunami breaking region before the tsunami flow arrives at the bridge site a tsunami surge bore with a water level approximately 4 5 m has already formed which propagates with a high flow speed at about 10 m s to the bridge deck site as demonstrated in fig 18 b and the tsunami surge bore impacts the bridge deck at about t 29 71 min fig 18c since the bridge deck blocks some portion of the flow the water level at the front of deck increases very fast fig 18c and d later an overtopping flow happens fig 18e and f the temporal evolution of horizontal and vertical components of tsunami wave forces have been plotted in fig 19 which look similar as that in case i while the maximum horizontal force is little bit smaller than that in case i also due to the fluctuations of overtopping flow the vertical force exhibits a more fluctuating pattern compared with vertical force curve for case i besides it is found that some air has been trapped into the water flow as tsunami surge bore rushes on the beach as demonstrated in the water contour figures fig 18 6 3 effects of clearance height on tsunami wave impact bridge deck in this section bridge deck locating at x 600 m has been selected to investigate the clearance height on the tsunami wave loads besides the results for h c 4m another two clearance heights h c 2 and 3m have been selected fig 20 plots the snapshots of water contours at different time instances for bridge deck with h c 2 and 3m it is noticed that tsunami surge bore arrive at the bridge site at nearly same time although there is a little discrepancy in the surge shape and position according to the authors knowledge this could be attributed to the long computational time period mesh resolution and the instability of surge bore as the clearance height increases the tsunami surge impacting intensity is decreased as shown in different size of water jets fig 20b later overtopping flow happens fig 20c and the whole bridge decks are submerged by tsunami surge flow fig 20d similar as the results in previous sections some air has been also trapped into the water flow shown as light blue color in the water body contour figures fig 20 the time series of horizontal and vertical components of the tsunami wave loads have been depicted in fig 21 where the tsunami wave loads force case with h c 4 m is added for comparison purpose interestingly there are five force impulses in the vertical force as shown in the zoom in view of fig 21 which is in accordance with the number of chambers of bridge deck the variation of maximum tsunami wave loads under different clearance heights has been plotted in fig 22 it apparently shows that the maximum forces decrease linearly with the increasing of clearance heights for both horizontal and vertical components of hydrodynamic load this is directly caused by the reduced overtopping water weight as the clearance height increases meanwhile the resultant slamming force is also reduced 6 4 effect of wave height on tsunami wave impact bridge deck to investigate the effects of wave height on the tsunami hydrodynamic loads at the bridge deck three tsunami like wave profiles have been developed by applying eqs 15 18 bridge deck locating at x 600 m has been selected and the clearance height h c of the bridge deck is 4 m fig 23 plots the wave profiles for tsunami wave heights h 7 m 9 m and 11 m respectively as shown in fig 23 the leading depression wave becomes apparent as wave height increases fig 24 depicts the temporal evolution of water profile colored by total velocity magnitude for the tsunami wave with h 11m it is noticed that a huge surge front has been formed in front of bridge deck fig 24b and it directly run onto the bridge deck and huge overtopping water has been generated fig 24c later the bridge deck is submerged completely in a very short time period fig 24d as the flow develops vortices shedding phenomena happens as shown in fig 24e it is also observed that there is thin layer with low water velocity at the top of the surge bore this can be due to large water surface fluctuations formed as tsunami surge bore rushing onto the beach time series of tsunami wave forces have been plotted in fig 25 since a higher wave height will produce a higher wave celerity tsunami wave with h 11m arrives earlier at the bridge site it is also interesting that both maximum horizontal and vertical forces increase linearly with the increasing of wave heights as depicted in fig 26 as wave height increases the intensity of tsunami surge wave is enhanced leading to a higher runup height a stronger wall shape tsunami surge bore with a higher water level after the surge wave breaking can be formed which finally results in an increasing in the hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck 7 conclusion since the propagation of tsunami waves from the open sea to the bridge site and its final impact at coastal highway bridge are typical multiscale coastal flow phenomena and their integral simulation is beyond the reach of most existing numerical models in present paper a well calibrated coupled modeling system sifum fvcom designed for simulation of multiscale coastal flow phenomena has been applied to investigate the tsunami wave impacting coastal highway bridge to overcome the drawbacks of using solitary wave as the paradigm to study hydrodynamic characteristics of tsunami wave and its devastating impact a tsunami wave profile observed during the 2011 japan tsunami has been applied the results presented in this paper has revealed that coastal bridge will undergo tsunami wave forces with different characteristics if they are located at different tsunami surge evolution stages also both clearance height of bridge and the tsunami wave height will have profound influence on the hydrodynamic loads of tsunami surge bore as the clearance height of the bridge deck increases the tsunami hydrodynamic loads will be substantially reduced in a linear mode it is also found that the both horizontal and vertical component of the tsunami wave force are linear function of wave height as wave height increases the intensity of tsunami surge wave is enhanced leading to a higher runup height a stronger wall shape tsunami surge bore with a higher water level after the surge wave breaking can be formed which finally results in an increase in the hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck in view of its performance in the simulaiton of this paper it is believed that coupled modeling system sifum fvcom is a powerful tool to handle different kinds of multiscale coastal flows

22394,a new point absorber equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape is designed to increase the power production of the wec device by properly matching the heave natural period of the floating

energy represents one of the most promising renewable sources for the next future thanks to its availability and large power potential nevertheless as highlighted in the 2016 ocean energy status report jrc 2016 the wave energy sector has slowed down in the last years in contrast with other marine technologies such as tidal and thermal among others provided that it is not mature enough for massive power production on the international market this issue is mainly due to the variety of wave energy converters developed in the last decade that require extensive testing and development activities in order to increase the power production as well as the reliability and survivability of wec devices in harsh weather conditions furthermore the scientific community does not still agree about the most promising key enabling technologies as proved by the variety of wec devices designed in the last decade besides the levelised cost of energy is still higher if compared with other renewable sources such as solar and wind among others nevertheless among the variety of wave energy converters based on different working principles point absorbers represent one of the most mature technology as proved by the deployment of the first prototypes in the marine environment in fact in 2009 the one half scale prototype of the wavestar device was deployed in the north sea at hanstholm off the denmark coastline and was connected to the grid since february 2010 in 2014 two seatricity oceanus 2 devices were deployed and tested at the wave hub offshore research site in the atlantic ocean 16 km off hayle located in the north coast of cornwall in the same years several seabased point absorbers connected to a permanent magnet linear generator lying on the sea bed were tested at the lysekil research site in 2015 the first low voltage marine substation was deployed at kungshamn and connected to the grid under the sotenäs project funded by the swedish energy agency finally the us naval facilities engineering command recently funded the deployment of the bolt lifesaver device at the navy wave energy test site located in the pacific ocean off kaneohe on the oahu island all these experimental campaigns prove the great interest of the research and industry sectors in harnessing wave power nevertheless they also highlight the great amount of work to be further carried out in order to make the marine energy sector competitive on the international market as regards other and more mature renewable technologies this issue is also proved by the variety of research activities carried out in the last years throughout the world in this respect pastor and liu 2014 investigated by frequency domain analysis the incidence of the floating buoy geometry on power production testing two shapes in conjunction with several diameters and draughts piscopo et al 2016 2017 developed a new optimization procedure for the main dimensions of heaving point absorbers in order to increase the power production and reduce the levelised cost of energy based on the wave climate at the deployment site kolios et al 2018 developed a reliability assessment framework combining parametric modelling by finite element analysis with response surface modelling and reliability methods they also optimized the key design components of the wec device in order to achieve the assigned target reliability and concluded that point absorbers may experience fatigue failure before the end of the expected design lifetime do et al 2018 investigate the behaviour of a multi point absorber equipped with a new hydrostatic transmission to convert the wave energy into electricity and a high pressure accumulator to stabilize the power output the mathematical model of the wec device was developed and the numerical results were compared with the experimental tests carried out on a scale model wang et al 2018 developed a flexible multibody dynamic model of the wec device in order to accurately predict its structural dynamic response they applied the proposed procedure to a 10 kw point absorber developed at the national ocean technology centre concluding that this wec device is prone to experience fatigue failure in the floater arm this brief and not exhaustive summary of current resent research activities on point absorbers clearly highlights that there is still need of improving this technology mainly focusing on two basic issues related to the increase of power production and the long term reliability of the wec device and its basic components in this respect as regards the first topic it is necessary to increase the efficiency of point absorbers in order to raise the annualised energy production aep and make this technology more competitive on the international market secondly the reliability of wec devices is one of the key factors to be taken into due consideration provided that no long term experience is available in real environmental conditions nor many rules and guidelines have been provided by the classification societies till now based on previous remarks current research focuses on the design of a new point absorber device equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape and connected by means of a tensioned line to a permanent magnet linear generator pmlg lying on the sea bed particularly the new design is expected to increase the aep of the wec device if compared to the commonly embodied layout by properly matching the heave natural period of the floating buoy with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect a non linear time domain model is developed and applied at two candidate deployment sites located in the mediterranean sea and in the atlantic ocean particularly the aep assessment is performed based on a reference wec device as well as on the new layout in order to carry out a comparative analysis between the two configurations furthermore the strength check of the tensioned line connecting the floating buoy to the power take off pto unit is carefully investigated with reference to both ultimate and fatigue limit state design criteria mainly derived from the offshore industry sector finally current results are fully discussed and investigated and a possible pathway to further increase the power production is suggested 2 design of the new point absorber 2 1 state of art the first pioneering works on wec devices were carried out in the 40s by the navy officer masuda who designed a buoy powered by wave energy and equipped with an air turbine nevertheless the interest of the academic sector in wave power exploitation mainly started after the 1973 crisis following the sudden increase of oil prices on the international market in this respect budal and falnes 1975 introduced for the first time the acronym point absorber to indicate a damped oscillating device with horizontal extent much smaller than the incident wavelength among the variety of wec devices point absorbers represent one of the most promising technology thanks to the relatively easy working principle that is mainly based on the transmission of the heave motion exerted by the incoming waves on a floating buoy to a fixed electric or hydraulic pto unit that in turn converts it into electricity based on the outcomes of past research activities one of the main concerns of point absorbers is related to the low efficiency in a seaway as the heave natural period of the wec device is generally lower than the incident wave one so as it works quite far from the resonance condition this issue was well known since the pioneering works by budal and falnes 1975 who highlighted that maximum power production is attained if the wec device works close to the resonance condition which is gained if the heave natural period of the floating buoy matches the incoming wave one in the last decades several motion control techniques namely latching unclutching and phase shifting were developed to increase the power production of point absorbers particularly latching and unclutching are based on maintaining the heave velocity of the wec device in phase with the incoming wave one by holding and releasing the floating buoy or alternatively by switching on and off the pto unit nevertheless these control techniques exhibit some issues with reference to i the assessment of the latched time interval ii the prediction of the incoming random waves and iii the layout of the pto unit that in turn needs to be equipped with a purposely designed control mechanism falcão 2010 on the other side the phase control method has been widely applied by a variety of researchers in order to increase the power production by shifting the heave natural period of the wec device depending on the met ocean conditions at the deployment site vantorre et al 2004 de backer 2009 engström 2011 miquel et al 2014 2017 piscopo et al 2016 2017 the shifting of the heave natural period is generally obtained by connecting an additional fully submerged mass to the floating buoy nevertheless this layout presents two main issues that need to be properly accounted in the design procedure provided that the fully submerged body is generally connected by means of two tensioned lines upward to the floating buoy and downward to the pto unit lying on the seabed particularly if the dimensions of the submerged mass and the floating buoy are each other comparable the additional inertia forces cause high snap loads in the connection line so yielding to a consistent decrease of the expected fatigue life under cyclic loads and a strong drop off of power production based on previous remarks a new layout is proposed to overcome the main lacks experienced in the preliminary design of wec devices with double body configuration in order to provide a more reliable configuration and properly tune the heave natural period of the floating buoy 2 2 the new layout the new point absorber has a spar type configuration consisting of a floating hemispherical buoy and a deep draught vertical cylinder with variable cross section as depicted in fig 1 1 the cylinder bottom is connected by means of eight bracings having rectangular cross section to a toroidal shape the main dimensions of the submerged volume are properly selected in order to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site so maximizing the power production in this respect it must be pointed out that the heave natural frequency of the wec device depends on the mass of i the floating buoy ii the deep draught vertical cylinder iii the fully submerged toroidal shape and iv the heave added mass at infinite frequency which implies that the proper selection of the toroidal shape dimensions is a key factor to increase the wec device efficiency the sizing of the fully submerged mass needs to be performed depending on the wave period of dominant sea states at the deployment site based on an iterative procedure particularly the main dimensions of the toroidal shape shall be iteratively increased until maximum power production occurs in fact it must be pointed out that apart from the favourable effect of shifting the heave natural frequency of the wec device the toroidal shape and the connection bracings reduce the heave exciting forces and produce additional non linear drag components that need to be properly accounted in the hydrodynamic model the former depends on the vertical separation between the floating buoy and the fully submerged mass and decreases among with the submergence of the toroidal shape the latter instead depend on the drag coefficient and the projected area of the bracings and the submerged volume as well as on the heave velocity of the wec device the floating buoy is also equipped with a ballast tank of proper capacity as depicted in fig 1 2 which is empty when power production occurs in harsh weather conditions a dedicated pump housed in the floating buoy to simplify the scheduled maintenance inspections fills up the tank so causing the submergence of the wec device that switches to the survival mode when power production can be reactivated the ballast water pump fills down the tank so as the wec device returns to the initial floating condition the pump is moved by the remote control station of the wave farm where the operators switch the point absorbers to the survival mode when the nominal cut out sea state of the wec device is exceeded the pump is connected to the electrical grid and allows submerging the point absorber so avoiding possible damages to the floating buoy the tensioned line and the pto unit in this respect the plant is also equipped with remotely controlled solenoid valves for the charge discharge operations of ballast water 2 3 the hydrodynamic model as previously said the floating buoy is connected by means of a tensioned line to a pmlg lying on the seabed so as it exerts the heave motion of the translator mass as depicted in fig 2 in this respect the hydrodynamic model shall account for i linear forces due to inertial damping and heave wave loads ii non linear drag forces iii elastic forces in the tensioned line including possible slack conditions when the translator mass hits the lower end stop spring of the pto unit iv elastic forces exerted by the pto upper lower end stop springs v electromechanical forces due to the overlapping between translator and stator of pmlg furthermore the only heave motion is considered in the hydrodynamic model provided that surge effect has a moderate impact on power production assessment which is generally less than 1 as recently stressed by miquel et al 2017 furthermore a non linear time domain model is currently embodied provided that it represents the most feasible choice for a reliable power production assessment as proved in the last decade by a variety of researchers throughout the world pastor and liu 2014 ulvgård et al 2016 miquel et al 2017 hence denoting by the subscripts b and t all physical quantities of the floating buoy and the translator mass the coupled heave motion equations in the time domain are 1 m b m b ζ b t k r t τ ς b τ d τ f d r a g ϱ g a w l ς b f l i n e m b g ϱ g f e x c m t ζ t a a c t γ ζ t f u s f l s m t g f l i n e reference is made to the list of symbols and acronyms for the meaning of all physical parameters reported in eq 1 and in the following formulations in order to efficiently solve the previous set of equations the cummins 1962 approach is applied in conjunction with the state space modelling method yu and falnes 1995 as concerns the heave drag forces exerted by the floating buoy the horizontal bracings and the toroidal shape they are determined according to the following formula depending on relevant heave drag coefficients 2 f d r a g 1 2 ϱ c d s a s c d b a b c d t a t ς b ς b the force in the tensioned line accounts for the initial pretension exerted by the translator mass as well as for line stretching and possible slack conditions 3 f l i n e m a x m t g e a ℓ ς b ς t 0 the forces due to the compression of the pto upper lower

1 m i n ℓ t ℓ s 1 2 ℓ t ℓ s ς t e l s e in current analysis the previous set of non linear equations is solved by a dedicated programme developed in matlab mathworks 2017 while the frequency dependent added mass radiation damping and heave exciting force per unit wave amplitude are assessed by the open source code nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 after solving the equation system 1 based on a typical 3 h sea state duration the mean electrical power is determined as follows falcão 2010 7 p a b s γ η e l e t 0 t a a c t ζ t 2 d t finally the aep is assessed on the basis of a discrete number of sea states each one characterized by a given probability of occurrence depending on the wave climate at the deployment site 8 a e p 8760 i 1 n s p i p a b s i it is noticed that power production is null when the wec device switches to the survival mode in this respect in the performed calculations the cut out sea state is set equal to 3 m as most of the wave energy lies within this limit value at the candidate deployment sites as discussed in sub section 3 1 finally the wec device efficiency is determined by the following equation 9 η p a b s p a v a while the available wave power at the deployment site is determined as follows 10 p a v a ρ g d 0 c g ω s ς ω d ω reference is made to the list of symbols and acronyms for the meaning of all physical quantities 2 4 the connection line the connection line exerts the heave motion of the translator mass and provides the stationkeeping of the floating buoy in current analysis it is realised by means of a six strand steel wire rope commonly embodied in the offshore industry sector hence its minimum required breaking strength and relevant s n fatigue parameters are determined according to the standards offshore mooring steel wire ropes dnv 2009 and position mooring dnv gl 2015 in this respect it must be pointed out that even if the design of this component is a key point for the reliability and survivability of wec devices no specific rules and guidelines have been developed until now apart from the standard certification of tidal and wave energy converters dnv 2012 where in any case no information are provided for the scantling assessment of the connection line hence in current analysis the offshore standard position mooring dnv gl 2015 is applied to carry out the ultimate uls and fatigue fls strength check as it is commonly performed for typical offshore structures including floating offshore wind turbines benassai et al 2014a b 2015 particularly the uls strength check criterion requires to assess the maximum static and dynamic forces in the connection line corresponding to the worst sea state conditions the wec device will encounter during its lifetime nevertheless as pointed out in sub section 2 2 the new device is equipped with a ballast tank of proper capacity so as it completely submerges when the cut out sea state is reached switching to the survival mode hence the following inequality shall be satisfied with reference to the sea state condition characterized by maximum power production 11 γ m e a n t m e a n γ d y n t m p m t m e a n s c it is noticed that the partial safety factors for the mean and dynamic tension components correspond to the highest consequence class furnished by the offshore standard position mooring provided that any failure of the connection line could lead to unacceptable consequences such as the collision of the unmoored buoy with adjacent wec devices or ships besides the dynamic component is determined after assessing the most probable maximum tension corresponding to the 37th percentile of relevant gumbel distribution particularly in current analysis this parameter is determined by 20 independent simulations each one corresponding to a typical 3 h

year design life of the wec device 13 t d 1 γ f d c t l it is noticed that the fatigue safety factor depends on the type of scheduled maintenance activities and it is equal to 3 0 5 0 if the mooring system is regularly inspected at onshore offshore facilities in current analysis it is set equal to the highest value in order to reduce as far as possible the interruption of power production during the scheduled maintenance activities finally the cumulative fatigue damage is determined by the following equation dnv gl 2015 14 d c γ m 2 1 a d i 1 n s ν i p i 2 2 σ i m 3 main data for hydrodynamic analysis 3 1 wave climate at deployment sites in current analysis two candidate sites are selected for the possible deployment of a wave farm the former is located in the mediterranean sea at alghero off the western coast of sardinia the latter instead is located in the atlantic ocean at silleiro off the north spanish coastline the wave climate at alghero is provided by the italian governmental institution ispra apat 2006 while the one at silleiro is derived by the database provided by the spanish governmental institution puertos del estado hence by the significant wave height marginal distributions reported in fig 3 a b the prevailing sea states correspond to 0 5 and 2 0 m classes at alghero and silleiro respectively in this respect the probability of exceeding the cut out sea state is equal to 7 50 and 23 23 at the two deployment sites similarly fig 4 a b provide the marginal distributions of wave periods at alghero and silleiro from which it is gathered that the prevailing sea states correspond to 5 0 s wave mean period and 10 0 s peak period classes at the two deployment sites in this respect it must be pointed out that the wave scatter diagrams at the candidate deployment sites are not directly comparable provided that they combine the significant wave height with the wave mean and peak periods respectively nevertheless they have not been currently modified in order to not change the input data provided that it is straightforward to transform the mean wave period into the peak wave one or vice versa by the following equation dnv 2010 15 t 1 t p 0 7303 0 04936 γ w 0 006556 γ w 2 0 0003610 γ w 3 in eq 15 γ w denotes the non dimensional peak shape parameter of the jonswap wave spectrum dnv 2010 and it is currently taken equal to 1 86 and 1 00 at alghero and silleiro so resembling partly and fully developed sea state conditions typical of the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean respectively finally fig 5 a b report the wave energy distribution versus the wave period up to the cut out sea state based on current results it is gathered that almost 45 70 of the available wave energy lies between 6 and 7 s at alghero and 10 12 s at silleiro based on previous outcomes the wave climate is strictly site dependent so as the displaced mass of the fully submerged toroidal shape needs to be properly tuned in order to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site 3 2 the wec device a 5 0 m hemispherical buoy whose main data are reported in table 1 is assumed as reference wec device in order to carry out a comparative analysis with the new layout outlined in sub section 2 2 in this respect it must be pointed out that the heave natural period of the floating buoy is equal to 3 1 s so as the wec device operates far from the resonance condition with the prevailing sea states at the deployment sites the new wec device instead consists of a similarly sized hemispherical buoy equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape the new layout is designed to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site by properly tuning the displaced mass of the fully submerged volume in this respect by applying the principle of moment to the yearly energy distribution reported in fig 5 a the heave natural period of the wec device deployed at alghero shall be increased from 3 1 up to 6 5 s similarly by fig 5 b the heave natural period of the wec device deployed at silleiro shall be equal to 8 2 s corresponding to a 10 6 s wave peak period in this respect the main dimensions of the fully submerged toroidal shape are site dependent in order to properly increase the heave natural period of the wec device as it can be gathered by the main data reported in table 2 as concerns the hydrodynamic properties of the reference and new wec devices fig 6 a d report the frequency dependent added mass radiation damping and real imaginary parts of the heave exciting force per unit wave amplitude obtained by the bem code nemoh the continuous line relates to the reference device while dashed and pointed lines refer to the new layouts deployed at alghero and silleiro in this respect the added mass and radiation damping of the reference wec device comply with the theoretical solution for a floating hemisphere hulme 1982 while the real and imaginary parts of the heave exciting force per unit wave amplitude match the numerical solution provided by chen et al 2000 as concerns the new layout a consistent increase of the added mass is reached with negligible variations of the hydrodynamic damping on the contrary an appreciable decrease of the heave exciting force is recognized as regards the reference wec device up to about 2 0 rad s this occurrence causing a partial drop off of power production mainly depends on the submergence of the toroidal shape that is set equal to 15 0 m in current analysis as reported in table 2 in this respect it should be noted that the drop off of the heave exciting force can be mitigated by increasing the vertical separation between the floating buoy and the fully submerged mass nevertheless before increasing the vertical separation a detailed cost benefit analysis needs to be preliminarily performed as the scantling of the deep draught vertical cylinder depends on the submergence of the toroidal shape in fact it mainly behaves as a clamped beam so as any increase of the vertical separation causes a corresponding increase of the maximum bending moment acting on the structure after assessing the main hydrodynamic parameters of the reference and new wec devices fig 7 reports relevant response amplitude operators raos based on current results it is confirmed that the fully submerged toroidal shape produces a strong variation of the floating buoy hydrodynamic behaviour as it increases the rao peak value and allows shifting the device heave natural frequency this outcome is mainly due to the consistent increase of the heave added mass of the wec device provided by the fully submerged toroidal shape in fact while the rao curve of the reference wec device is typical of an overdamped floating buoy the raos of the new wec devices deployed at alghero and silleiro resemble the hydrodynamic behaviour of an underdamped resonant point absorber with a consequent increase of power production and captured efficiency in fact the rao peak values are widely greater than 1 which implies that the point absorber works close to the resonance condition in the frequency range between 0 5 and 1 0 rad s where most of wave power occurs finally table 3 reports the main data of the connection line the partial safety factors for uls and fls strength check as well as the s n curve parameters for six strand steel wire ropes 3 3 the pto unit the basic philosophy of current design procedure envisages that the floating buoy is designed according to the wave climate at the deployment site but it is connected to a baseline pto unit in order to reduce the capital costs of the wave farm in fact the pmlg is certainly the most complex and high added value element of the wec device so as the mass production of this key element is required to reduce the capital expenditures and consequently the levelised cost of energy piscopo et al 2018 on the contrary the floating buoy is a low added value element so as it can be purposely specialized depending on the wave climate at the deployment site in this respect in current analysis a 20 kw pmlg derived by the layout proposed by ulvgård et al 2016 is assumed as reference pto unit and relevant main data are reported in table 4 it is noticed that the free stroke length is increased as regards the reference layout in order to raise the power production of the wec device in harsh weather conditions hong et al 2016 without changing any electrical parameter of the pmlg 4 numerical application 4 1 aep assessment table 5 reports the aep assessment at alghero while fig 8 1 a and b show the power production distribution versus the wave height and period based on current results the new layout allows increasing the aep from 26 up to about 42 mwh so achieving a 60 increase as regards the reference configuration this outcome is mainly due to the shifting of the heave natural period in fact by fig 8 1 a the maximum power production of the reference wec device is located at about 3 5 s so as no matching with the prevailing sea states occurs on the contrary by fig 8 2 b the maximum power production of the new layout corresponds to a 6 0 s mean wave period so as a good matching with the prevailing sea states is gained based on current results the new layout reveals to be effective if compared to the reference wec device as it consistently increases the aep without changing the pto unit nor the diameter of the floating buoy this outcome is confirmed by the wec efficiency plots reported in fig 8 2 a and b for the reference and new wec devices respectively based on current results the maximum absorption of the reference wec device is located at 3 s so as no matching with the prevailing sea states occurs on the contrary the maximum absorption of the new wec device is located between 5 and 6 s mean wave period classes that correspond to the prevailing sea states at the deployment site furthermore the device efficiency is slightly dependent on the significant wave height and it decreases in harsh weather conditions this outcome is mainly related to the free stroke length of the pmlg in fact in harsh weather conditions the translator mass overpasses the pto free stroke length and hits the upper lower end stop springs so causing a sudden drop off of power production that in turn yields to a reduction of power absorption similarly table 6 reports the aep assessment at silleiro while fig 9 1 a and b show the distribution of power production for the reference point absorber and the new layout based on current results the new wec device allows raising the aep from 37 up to about 50 mwh so achieving a 36 increase as regards the reference configuration also in this case the shifting of the heave natural period plays a fundamental role in fact by fig 9 1 a no matching of the heave natural period of the reference wec device is gained on the contrary by fig 9 1 b the maximum power production of the new wec device is located at about 10 0 s so as a good matching with the prevailing sea states is attained finally almost the same outcomes already stressed for the first deployment site can be highlighted at silleiro in fact also in this case the fully submerged toroidal shape allows shifting the wave period corresponding to maximum power absorption from 4 s reference wec device up to 8 10 s new wec device peak period wave classes see fig 9 2 4 2 strength check of connection line table 7 reports the main data required to perform the uls and fls strength check of the connection line in this respect it must be preliminarily pointed out that the mean line tension is always equal to 62 27 kn which is the static force exerted by the suspended translator mass on the contrary the most probable maximum tension and the expected fatigue life depend on both the wave climate at the deployment site and the device configuration in fact the fatigue life of the connection line is higher for the reference wec device as regards the new layout this outcome is mainly due to the shifting of the heave natural period with a consequent increase of the dynamic stress component in the tensioned line nevertheless in all cases the uls strength criterion is widely fulfilled similarly the fls strength check criterion is satisfied even if a consistent decrease of the expected fatigue life is recognized for the new wec device provided that it works closer to the resonance condition if compared with the reference one 5 discussion by the comparative analysis reported in sub section 4 1 the new wec device allows achieving a consistent increase of the aep as regards the reference one ranging from 36 up to 60 at silleiro and alghero respectively as previously said this goal is achieved by properly shifting the device heave natural period depending on the wave climate at the deployment site in this respect fig 10 a and b report the marginal distribution of the delivered energy versus the wave period at alghero and silleiro as concerns the first deployment site the energy delivery of the new layout is slightly lower if compared to the reference one up to the 4 0 s mean wave period class while a consistent increase is attained beyond this value similar outcomes can be stressed for the point absorber deployed at silleiro in fact the energy delivery of the new layout is slightly lower as regards the reference one up to 6 0 s peak wave period class while a consistent increase is attained beyond this value these outcomes suggest that the new wec device represents a viable and effective choice to increase the power production of point absorbers in this respect as previously said a possible pathway to further increase the aep may consist of deepening the toroidal shape in order to mitigate the drop off of the heave exciting force and further increase the power production nevertheless as stated in sub section 3 2 this design change needs to be carefully investigated focusing on the relevant cost benefit analysis and on the scantling assessment of the deep draught vertical cylinder 6 conclusions a new layout for heaving point absorbers was proposed to increase the power production of the wec device the new configuration mainly consists of a spar type floating buoy equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape whose dimensions are properly selected in order to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect a non linear time domain model was developed to assess the power production and to perform the strength check of the tensioned line that in turn connects the floating buoy to the pto unit lying on the seabed particularly the frequency dependent added mass radiation damping and heave exciting force per unit wave amplitude were determined by the bem code nemoh so accounting for possible interferences between the floating buoy and the toroidal shape subsequently two candidate deployment sites were selected to carry out a comparative analysis in terms of aep between a reference wec device and the new layout based on current results the following main outcomes have been achieved i the new layout allows obtaining a consistent increase of the aep that is higher for low medium energy sites such as alghero as regards medium high locations such as silleiro ii the layout of the new wec device is site dependent as the main dimensions of the toroidal shape need to be properly tuned depending on the wave climate at the deployment site in order to match the heave natural period of the floating buoy with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect a 60 and 35 increase of the aep were gained at alghero and silleiro as regards the reference configuration iii the incidence of the fully submerged toroidal shape on the scantling assessment of the tensioned line connecting the floating buoy with the pto unit is appreciable provided that it leads to a drop off of the expected fatigue life that needs to be properly considered in the design procedure in fact while the fatigue life of the reference wec device ranges between 50 and 69 years it decreases up to about 20 years for the new layout this outcome is mainly due to the different hydrodynamic behaviour of the two configurations provided that the reference layout is an overdamped wec device while the new configuration works close to the resonance condition so causing higher stresses in the tensioned line based on previous outcomes the new wec device represents a promising layout to increase the power production and reduce the levelised cost of energy of heaving point absorbers so making the marine energy sector more competitive on the international market if compared with other renewable sources even if these outcomes need to be further investigated and validated by an experimental campaign on a scale model of the new layout current results seem to be very encouraging for further research activities and improvements notes the wec device with the fully submerged toroidal shape is covered by the italian patent demand number 102019000004221 pending at the ministry of economic development 
22394,a new point absorber equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape is designed to increase the power production of the wec device by properly matching the heave natural period of the floating buoy with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site a non linear time domain model is developed and applied to assess the annualised energy production and perform the strength check of the tensioned line connecting the floating buoy to the power take off unit lying on the seabed two candidate deployment sites located in the mediterranean sea and in the atlantic ocean are chosen for the possible deployment of a wave farm and the toroidal shape main dimensions are selected accordingly hence a comparative analysis between a reference point absorber consisting of a floating hemispherical buoy and the new wec device is performed to investigate the incidence of the proposed layout on the annualised energy production finally both ultimate and fatigue limit state criteria are embodied for the strength check of the connection line the new layout allows properly tuning the device heave natural period and increasing up to 60 the annualised energy production as regards the reference configuration so making the marine energy more competitive on the international market keywords point absorber fully submerged toroidal shape permanent magnet linear generator time domain

energy represents one of the most promising renewable sources for the next future thanks to its availability and large power potential nevertheless as highlighted in the 2016 ocean energy status report jrc 2016 the wave energy sector has slowed down in the last years in contrast with other marine technologies such as tidal and thermal among others provided that it is not mature enough for massive power production on the international market this issue is mainly due to the variety of wave energy converters developed in the last decade that require extensive testing and development activities in order to increase the power production as well as the reliability and survivability of wec devices in harsh weather conditions furthermore the scientific community does not still agree about the most promising key enabling technologies as proved by the variety of wec devices designed in the last decade besides the levelised cost of energy is still higher if compared with other renewable sources such as solar and wind among others nevertheless among the variety of wave energy converters based on different working principles point absorbers represent one of the most mature technology as proved by the deployment of the first prototypes in the marine environment in fact in 2009 the one half scale prototype of the wavestar device was deployed in the north sea at hanstholm off the denmark coastline and was connected to the grid since february 2010 in 2014 two seatricity oceanus 2 devices were deployed and tested at the wave hub offshore research site in the atlantic ocean 16 km off hayle located in the north coast of cornwall in the same years several seabased point absorbers connected to a permanent magnet linear generator lying on the sea bed were tested at the lysekil research site in 2015 the first low voltage marine substation was deployed at kungshamn and connected to the grid under the sotenäs project funded by the swedish energy agency finally the us naval facilities engineering command recently funded the deployment of the bolt lifesaver device at the navy wave energy test site located in the pacific ocean off kaneohe on the oahu island all these experimental campaigns prove the great interest of the research and industry sectors in harnessing wave power nevertheless they also highlight the great amount of work to be further carried out in order to make the marine energy sector competitive on the international market as regards other and more mature renewable technologies this issue is also proved by the variety of research activities carried out in the last years throughout the world in this respect pastor and liu 2014 investigated by frequency domain analysis the incidence of the floating buoy geometry on power production testing two shapes in conjunction with several diameters and draughts piscopo et al 2016 2017 developed a new optimization procedure for the main dimensions of heaving point absorbers in order to increase the power production and reduce the levelised cost of energy based on the wave climate at the deployment site kolios et al 2018 developed a reliability assessment framework combining parametric modelling by finite element analysis with response surface modelling and reliability methods they also optimized the key design components of the wec device in order to achieve the assigned target reliability and concluded that point absorbers may experience fatigue failure before the end of the expected design lifetime do et al 2018 investigate the behaviour of a multi point absorber equipped with a new hydrostatic transmission to convert the wave energy into electricity and a high pressure accumulator to stabilize the power output the mathematical model of the wec device was developed and the numerical results were compared with the experimental tests carried out on a scale model wang et al 2018 developed a flexible multibody dynamic model of the wec device in order to accurately predict its structural dynamic response they applied the proposed procedure to a 10 kw point absorber developed at the national ocean technology centre concluding that this wec device is prone to experience fatigue failure in the floater arm this brief and not exhaustive summary of current resent research activities on point absorbers clearly highlights that there is still need of improving this technology mainly focusing on two basic issues related to the increase of power production and the long term reliability of the wec device and its basic components in this respect as regards the first topic it is necessary to increase the efficiency of point absorbers in order to raise the annualised energy production aep and make this technology more competitive on the international market secondly the reliability of wec devices is one of the key factors to be taken into due consideration provided that no long term experience is available in real environmental conditions nor many rules and guidelines have been provided by the classification societies till now based on previous remarks current research focuses on the design of a new point absorber device equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape and connected by means of a tensioned line to a permanent magnet linear generator pmlg lying on the sea bed particularly the new design is expected to increase the aep of the wec device if compared to the commonly embodied layout by properly matching the heave natural period of the floating buoy with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect a non linear time domain model is developed and applied at two candidate deployment sites located in the mediterranean sea and in the atlantic ocean particularly the aep assessment is performed based on a reference wec device as well as on the new layout in order to carry out a comparative analysis between the two configurations furthermore the strength check of the tensioned line connecting the floating buoy to the power take off pto unit is carefully investigated with reference to both ultimate and fatigue limit state design criteria mainly derived from the offshore industry sector finally current results are fully discussed and investigated and a possible pathway to further increase the power production is suggested 2 design of the new point absorber 2 1 state of art the first pioneering works on wec devices were carried out in the 40s by the navy officer masuda who designed a buoy powered by wave energy and equipped with an air turbine nevertheless the interest of the academic sector in wave power exploitation mainly started after the 1973 crisis following the sudden increase of oil prices on the international market in this respect budal and falnes 1975 introduced for the first time the acronym point absorber to indicate a damped oscillating device with horizontal extent much smaller than the incident wavelength among the variety of wec devices point absorbers represent one of the most promising technology thanks to the relatively easy working principle that is mainly based on the transmission of the heave motion exerted by the incoming waves on a floating buoy to a fixed electric or hydraulic pto unit that in turn converts it into electricity based on the outcomes of past research activities one of the main concerns of point absorbers is related to the low efficiency in a seaway as the heave natural period of the wec device is generally lower than the incident wave one so as it works quite far from the resonance condition this issue was well known since the pioneering works by budal and falnes 1975 who highlighted that maximum power production is attained if the wec device works close to the resonance condition which is gained if the heave natural period of the floating buoy matches the incoming wave one in the last decades several motion control techniques namely latching unclutching and phase shifting were developed to increase the power production of point absorbers particularly latching and unclutching are based on maintaining the heave velocity of the wec device in phase with the incoming wave one by holding and releasing the floating buoy or alternatively by switching on and off the pto unit nevertheless these control techniques exhibit some issues with reference to i the assessment of the latched time interval ii the prediction of the incoming random waves and iii the layout of the pto unit that in turn needs to be equipped with a purposely designed control mechanism falcão 2010 on the other side the phase control method has been widely applied by a variety of researchers in order to increase the power production by shifting the heave natural period of the wec device depending on the met ocean conditions at the deployment site vantorre et al 2004 de backer 2009 engström 2011 miquel et al 2014 2017 piscopo et al 2016 2017 the shifting of the heave natural period is generally obtained by connecting an additional fully submerged mass to the floating buoy nevertheless this layout presents two main issues that need to be properly accounted in the design procedure provided that the fully submerged body is generally connected by means of two tensioned lines upward to the floating buoy and downward to the pto unit lying on the seabed particularly if the dimensions of the submerged mass and the floating buoy are each other comparable the additional inertia forces cause high snap loads in the connection line so yielding to a consistent decrease of the expected fatigue life under cyclic loads and a strong drop off of power production based on previous remarks a new layout is proposed to overcome the main lacks experienced in the preliminary design of wec devices with double body configuration in order to provide a more reliable configuration and properly tune the heave natural period of the floating buoy 2 2 the new layout the new point absorber has a spar type configuration consisting of a floating hemispherical buoy and a deep draught vertical cylinder with variable cross section as depicted in fig 1 1 the cylinder bottom is connected by means of eight bracings having rectangular cross section to a toroidal shape the main dimensions of the submerged volume are properly selected in order to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site so maximizing the power production in this respect it must be pointed out that the heave natural frequency of the wec device depends on the mass of i the floating buoy ii the deep draught vertical cylinder iii the fully submerged toroidal shape and iv the heave added mass at infinite frequency which implies that the proper selection of the toroidal shape dimensions is a key factor to increase the wec device efficiency the sizing of the fully submerged mass needs to be performed depending on the wave period of dominant sea states at the deployment site based on an iterative procedure particularly the main dimensions of the toroidal shape shall be iteratively increased until maximum power production occurs in fact it must be pointed out that apart from the favourable effect of shifting the heave natural frequency of the wec device the toroidal shape and the connection bracings reduce the heave exciting forces and produce additional non linear drag components that need to be properly accounted in the hydrodynamic model the former depends on the vertical separation between the floating buoy and the fully submerged mass and decreases among with the submergence of the toroidal shape the latter instead depend on the drag coefficient and the projected area of the bracings and the submerged volume as well as on the heave velocity of the wec device the floating buoy is also equipped with a ballast tank of proper capacity as depicted in fig 1 2 which is empty when power production occurs in harsh weather conditions a dedicated pump housed in the floating buoy to simplify the scheduled maintenance inspections fills up the tank so causing the submergence of the wec device that switches to the survival mode when power production can be reactivated the ballast water pump fills down the tank so as the wec device returns to the initial floating condition the pump is moved by the remote control station of the wave farm where the operators switch the point absorbers to the survival mode when the nominal cut out sea state of the wec device is exceeded the pump is connected to the electrical grid and allows submerging the point absorber so avoiding possible damages to the floating buoy the tensioned line and the pto unit in this respect the plant is also equipped with remotely controlled solenoid valves for the charge discharge operations of ballast water 2 3 the hydrodynamic model as previously said the floating buoy is connected by means of a tensioned line to a pmlg lying on the seabed so as it exerts the heave motion of the translator mass as depicted in fig 2 in this respect the hydrodynamic model shall account for i linear forces due to inertial damping and heave wave loads ii non linear drag forces iii elastic forces in the tensioned line including possible slack conditions when the translator mass hits the lower end stop spring of the pto unit iv elastic forces exerted by the pto upper lower end stop springs v electromechanical forces due to the overlapping between translator and stator of pmlg furthermore the only heave motion is considered in the hydrodynamic model provided that surge effect has a moderate impact on power production assessment which is generally less than 1 as recently stressed by miquel et al 2017 furthermore a non linear time domain model is currently embodied provided that it represents the most feasible choice for a reliable power production assessment as proved in the last decade by a variety of researchers throughout the world pastor and liu 2014 ulvgård et al 2016 miquel et al 2017 hence denoting by the subscripts b and t all physical quantities of the floating buoy and the translator mass the coupled heave motion equations in the time domain

conjunction with the state space modelling method yu and falnes 1995 as concerns the heave drag forces exerted by the floating buoy the horizontal bracings and the toroidal shape they are determined

null when the wec device switches to the survival mode in this respect in the performed calculations the cut out sea state is set equal to 3 m as most of the wave energy lies within this limit value at the candidate deployment sites as discussed in sub section 3 1 finally the wec device efficiency is determined by the following equation 9 η p a b s p a v a while the available wave power at the deployment site is determined as follows 10 p a v a ρ g d 0 c g ω s ς ω d ω reference is made to the list of symbols and acronyms for the meaning of all physical quantities 2 4 the connection line the connection line exerts the heave motion of the translator mass and provides the stationkeeping of the floating buoy in current analysis it is realised by means of a six strand steel wire rope commonly embodied in the offshore industry sector hence its minimum required breaking strength and relevant s n fatigue parameters are determined according to the standards offshore mooring steel wire ropes dnv 2009 and position mooring dnv gl 2015 in this respect it must be pointed out that even if the design of this component is a key point for the reliability and survivability of wec devices no specific rules and guidelines have been developed until now apart from the standard certification of tidal and wave energy converters dnv 2012 where in any case no information are provided for the scantling assessment of the connection line hence in current analysis the offshore standard position mooring dnv gl 2015 is applied to carry out the ultimate uls and fatigue fls strength check as it is commonly performed for typical offshore structures including floating offshore wind turbines benassai et al 2014a b 2015 particularly the uls strength check criterion requires to assess the maximum static and dynamic forces in the connection line corresponding to the worst sea state conditions the wec device will encounter during its lifetime nevertheless as pointed out in sub section 2 2 the new device is equipped with a ballast tank of proper capacity so as it completely submerges when the cut out sea state is reached switching to the survival mode hence the following inequality shall be satisfied with reference to the sea state condition characterized by maximum power production 11 γ m e a n t m e a n γ d y n t m p m t m e a n s c it is noticed that the partial safety factors for the mean and dynamic tension components correspond to the highest consequence class furnished by the offshore standard position mooring provided that any failure of the connection line could lead to unacceptable consequences such as the collision of the unmoored buoy with adjacent wec devices or ships besides the dynamic component is determined after assessing the most probable maximum tension corresponding to the 37th percentile of relevant gumbel distribution particularly in current analysis this parameter is determined by 20 independent simulations each one corresponding to a typical 3 h storm duration chakrabarti 2002 dnv gl 2015 12 t m p m μ p e a k s 6 π γ e u l e r log log p σ p e a k s as concerns the fls strength check the following inequality shall be satisfied based on a 20 year design life of the wec device 13 t d 1 γ f d c t l it is noticed that the fatigue safety factor depends on the type of scheduled maintenance activities and it is equal to 3 0 5 0 if the mooring system is regularly inspected at onshore offshore facilities in current analysis it is set equal to the highest value in order to reduce as far as possible the interruption of power production during the scheduled maintenance activities finally the cumulative fatigue damage is determined by the following equation dnv gl 2015 14 d c γ m 2 1 a d i 1 n s ν i p i 2 2 σ i m 3 main data for hydrodynamic analysis 3 1 wave climate at deployment sites in current analysis two candidate sites are selected for the possible deployment of a wave farm the former is located in the mediterranean sea at alghero off the western coast of sardinia the latter instead is located in the atlantic ocean at silleiro off the north spanish coastline the wave climate at alghero is provided by the italian governmental institution ispra apat 2006 while the one at silleiro is derived by the database provided by the spanish governmental institution puertos del estado hence by the significant wave height marginal distributions reported in fig 3 a b the prevailing sea states correspond to 0 5 and 2 0 m classes at alghero and silleiro respectively in this respect the probability of exceeding the cut out sea state is equal to 7 50 and 23 23 at the two deployment sites similarly fig 4 a b provide the marginal distributions of wave periods at alghero and silleiro from which it is gathered that the prevailing sea states correspond to 5 0 s wave mean period and 10 0 s peak period classes at the two deployment sites in this respect it must be pointed out that the wave scatter diagrams at the candidate deployment sites are not directly comparable provided that they combine the significant wave height with the wave mean and peak periods respectively nevertheless they have not been currently modified in order to not change the input data provided that it is straightforward to transform the mean wave period into the peak wave one or vice versa by the following equation dnv 2010 15 t 1 t p 0 7303 0 04936 γ w 0 006556 γ w 2 0 0003610 γ w 3 in eq 15 γ w denotes the non dimensional peak shape parameter of the jonswap wave spectrum dnv 2010 and it is currently taken equal to 1 86 and 1 00 at alghero and silleiro so resembling partly and fully developed sea state conditions typical of the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean respectively finally fig 5 a b report the wave energy distribution versus the wave period up to the cut out sea state based on current results it is gathered that almost 45 70 of the available wave energy lies between 6 and 7 s at alghero and 10 12 s at silleiro based on previous outcomes the wave climate is strictly site dependent so as the displaced mass of the fully submerged toroidal shape needs to be properly tuned in order to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site 3 2 the wec device a 5 0 m hemispherical buoy whose main data are reported in table 1 is assumed as reference wec device in order to carry out a comparative analysis with the new layout outlined in sub section 2 2 in this respect it must be pointed out that the heave natural period of the floating buoy is equal to 3 1 s so as the wec device operates far from the resonance condition with the prevailing sea states at the deployment sites the new wec device instead consists of a similarly sized hemispherical buoy equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape the new layout is designed to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site by properly tuning the displaced mass of the fully submerged volume in this respect by applying the principle of moment to the yearly energy distribution reported in fig 5 a the heave natural period of the wec device deployed at alghero shall be increased from 3 1 up to 6 5 s similarly by fig 5 b the heave natural period of the wec device deployed at silleiro shall be equal to 8 2 s corresponding to a 10 6 s wave peak period in this respect the main dimensions of the fully submerged toroidal shape are site dependent in order to properly increase the heave natural period of the wec device as it can be gathered by the main data reported in table 2 as concerns the hydrodynamic properties of the reference and new wec devices fig 6 a d report the frequency dependent added mass radiation damping and real imaginary parts of the heave exciting force per unit wave amplitude obtained by the bem code nemoh the continuous line relates to the reference device while dashed and pointed lines refer to the new layouts deployed at alghero and silleiro in this respect the added mass and radiation damping of the reference wec device comply with the theoretical solution for a floating hemisphere hulme 1982 while the real and imaginary parts of the heave exciting force per unit wave amplitude match the numerical solution provided by chen et al 2000 as concerns the new layout a consistent increase of the added mass is reached with negligible variations of the hydrodynamic damping on the contrary an appreciable decrease of the heave exciting force is recognized as regards the reference wec device up to about 2 0 rad s this occurrence causing a partial drop off of power production mainly depends on the submergence of the toroidal shape that is set equal to 15 0 m in current analysis as reported in table 2 in this respect it should be noted that the drop off of the heave exciting force can be mitigated by increasing the vertical separation between the floating buoy and the fully submerged mass nevertheless before increasing the vertical separation a detailed cost benefit analysis needs to be preliminarily performed as the scantling of the deep draught vertical cylinder depends on the submergence of the toroidal shape in fact it mainly behaves as a clamped beam so as any increase of the vertical separation causes a corresponding increase of the maximum bending moment acting on the structure after assessing the main hydrodynamic parameters of the reference and new wec devices fig 7 reports relevant response amplitude operators raos based on current results it is confirmed that the fully submerged toroidal shape produces a strong variation of the floating buoy hydrodynamic behaviour as it increases the rao peak value and allows shifting the device heave natural frequency this outcome is mainly due to the consistent increase of the heave added mass of the wec device provided by the fully submerged toroidal shape in fact while the rao curve of the reference wec device is typical of an overdamped floating buoy the raos of the new wec devices deployed at alghero and silleiro resemble the hydrodynamic behaviour of an underdamped resonant point absorber with a consequent increase of power production and captured efficiency in fact the rao peak values are widely greater than 1 which implies that the point absorber works close to the resonance condition in the frequency range between 0 5 and 1 0 rad s where most of wave power occurs finally table 3 reports the main data of the connection line the partial safety factors for uls and fls strength check as well as the s n curve parameters for six strand steel wire ropes 3 3 the pto unit the basic philosophy of current design procedure envisages that the floating buoy is designed according to the wave climate at the deployment site but it is connected to a baseline pto unit in order to reduce the capital costs of the wave farm in fact the pmlg is certainly the most complex and high added value element of the wec device so as the mass production of this key element is required to reduce the capital expenditures and consequently the levelised cost of energy piscopo et al 2018 on the contrary the floating buoy is a low added value element so as it can be purposely specialized depending on the wave climate at the deployment site in this respect in current analysis a 20 kw pmlg derived by the layout proposed by ulvgård et al 2016 is assumed as reference pto unit and relevant main data are reported in table 4 it is noticed that the free stroke length is increased as regards the reference layout in order to raise the power production of the wec device in harsh weather conditions hong et al 2016 without changing any electrical parameter of the pmlg 4 numerical application 4 1 aep assessment table 5 reports the aep assessment at alghero while fig 8 1 a and b show the power production distribution versus the wave height and period based on current results the new layout allows increasing the aep from 26 up to about 42 mwh so achieving a 60 increase as regards the reference configuration this outcome is mainly due to the shifting of the heave natural period in fact by fig 8 1 a the maximum power production of the reference wec device is located at about 3 5 s so as no matching with the prevailing sea states occurs on the contrary by fig 8 2 b the maximum power production of the new layout corresponds to a 6 0 s mean wave period so as a good matching with the prevailing sea states is gained based on current results the new layout reveals to be effective if compared to the reference wec device as it consistently increases the aep without changing the pto unit nor the diameter of the floating buoy this outcome is confirmed by the wec efficiency plots reported in fig 8 2 a and b for the reference and new wec devices respectively based on current results the maximum absorption of the reference wec device is located at 3 s so as no matching with the prevailing sea states occurs on the contrary the maximum absorption of the new wec device is located between 5 and 6 s mean wave period classes that correspond to the prevailing sea states at the deployment site furthermore the device efficiency is slightly dependent on the significant wave height and it decreases in harsh weather conditions this outcome is mainly related to the free stroke length of the pmlg in fact in harsh weather conditions the translator mass overpasses the pto free stroke length and hits the upper lower end stop springs so causing a sudden drop off of power production that in turn yields to a reduction of power absorption similarly table 6 reports the aep assessment at silleiro while fig 9 1 a and b show the distribution of power production for the reference point absorber and the new layout based on current results the new wec device allows raising the aep from 37 up to about 50 mwh so achieving a 36 increase as regards the reference configuration also in this case the shifting of the heave natural period plays a fundamental role in fact by fig 9 1 a no matching of the heave natural period of the reference wec device is gained on the contrary by fig 9 1 b the maximum power production of the new wec device is located at about 10 0 s so as a good matching with the prevailing sea states is attained finally almost the same outcomes already stressed for the first deployment site can be highlighted at silleiro in fact also in this case the fully submerged toroidal shape allows shifting the wave period corresponding to maximum power absorption from 4 s reference wec device up to 8 10 s new wec device peak period wave classes see fig 9 2 4 2 strength check of connection line table 7 reports the main data required to perform the uls and fls strength check of the connection line in this respect it must be preliminarily pointed out that the mean line tension is always equal to 62 27 kn which is the static force exerted by the suspended translator mass on the contrary the most probable maximum tension and the expected fatigue life depend on both the wave climate at the deployment site and the device configuration in fact the fatigue life of the connection line is higher for the reference wec device as regards the new layout this outcome is mainly due to the shifting of the heave natural period with a consequent increase of the dynamic stress component in the tensioned line nevertheless in all cases the uls strength criterion is widely fulfilled similarly the fls strength check criterion is satisfied even if a consistent decrease of the expected fatigue life is recognized for the new wec device provided that it works closer to the resonance condition if compared with the reference one 5 discussion by the comparative analysis reported in sub section 4 1 the new wec device allows achieving a consistent increase of the aep as regards the reference one ranging from 36 up to 60 at silleiro and alghero respectively as previously said this goal is achieved by properly shifting the device heave natural period depending on the wave climate at the deployment site in this respect fig 10 a and b report the marginal distribution of the delivered energy versus the wave period at alghero and silleiro as concerns the first deployment site the energy delivery of the new layout is slightly lower if compared to the reference one up to the 4 0 s mean wave period class while a consistent increase is attained beyond this value similar outcomes can be stressed for the point absorber deployed at silleiro in fact the energy delivery of the new layout is slightly lower as regards the reference one up to 6 0 s peak wave period class while a consistent increase is attained beyond this value these outcomes suggest that the new wec device represents a viable and effective choice to increase the power production of point absorbers in this respect as previously said a possible pathway to further increase the aep may consist of deepening the toroidal shape in order to mitigate the drop off of the heave exciting force and further increase the power production nevertheless as stated in sub section 3 2 this design change needs to be carefully investigated focusing on the relevant cost benefit analysis and on the scantling assessment of the deep draught vertical cylinder 6 conclusions a new layout for heaving point absorbers was proposed to increase the power production of the wec device the new configuration mainly consists of a spar type floating buoy equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape whose dimensions are properly selected in order to match the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect a non linear time domain model was developed to assess the power production and to perform the strength check of the tensioned line that in turn connects the floating buoy to the pto unit lying on the seabed particularly the frequency dependent added mass radiation damping and heave exciting force per unit wave amplitude were determined by the bem code nemoh so accounting for possible interferences between the floating buoy and the toroidal shape subsequently two candidate deployment sites were selected to carry out a comparative analysis in terms of aep between a reference wec device and the new layout based on current results the following main outcomes have been achieved i the new layout allows obtaining a consistent increase of the aep that is higher for low medium energy sites such as alghero as regards medium high locations such as silleiro ii the layout of the new wec device is site dependent as the main dimensions of the toroidal shape need to be properly tuned depending on the wave climate at the deployment site in order to match the heave natural period of the floating buoy with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect a 60 and 35 increase of the aep were gained at alghero and silleiro as regards the reference configuration iii the incidence of the fully submerged toroidal shape on the scantling assessment of the tensioned line connecting the floating buoy with the pto unit is appreciable provided that it leads to a drop off of the expected fatigue life that needs to be properly considered in the design procedure in fact while the fatigue life of the reference wec device ranges between 50 and 69 years it decreases up to about 20 years for the new layout this outcome is mainly due to the different hydrodynamic behaviour of the two configurations provided that the reference layout is an overdamped wec device while the new configuration works close to the resonance condition so causing higher stresses in the tensioned line based on previous outcomes the new wec device represents a promising layout to increase the power production and reduce the levelised cost of energy of heaving point absorbers so making the marine energy sector more competitive on the international market if compared with other renewable sources even if these outcomes need to be further investigated and validated by an experimental campaign on a scale model of the new layout current results seem to be very encouraging for further research activities and improvements notes the wec device with the fully submerged toroidal shape is covered by the italian patent demand number 102019000004221 pending at the ministry of economic development
