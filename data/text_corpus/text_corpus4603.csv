23015,an aircraft carrier is characterized by a combination of bluff bodies with sharp edges the most notable effect of a three dimensional bluff body flow is the usual presence of a complex vortex system in the wake that could affect the aircraft operation conical vortex with high intensity is expected to appear at wind over deck different to 0 wod 0 hence experimental tests at wod 15 have been developed to study these adverse effects which might influence the aircraft performances during landing and take off operations columnar vortex generators cvg have been installed in the ski jump ramp with the aim to mitigate the vortices generated this device is an appropriate choice considering earlier investigation reported by different authors landman et al 2005 nangia and lumsden 2004 interesting results were obtained with a cvg 15 mm spiral parameter and reduced angle between the cvg and the ski jump ramp floor where all three cvg s were of different lengths depending on their positions wind tunnel tests measurements by means of particle image velocimetry has been performed to study each configuration encouraging results were obtained to mitigate the conical vortices generated at this condition keywords conical vortex columnar vortex generator wind tunnel particle image velocimetry flow visualization ski jump ramp 1 introduction modern naval operations are led by aircraft carriers which provide maritime support to aircraft operations all over the world however aircraft carriers are affected by a combination of factors such as weather ship s motion ship configuration and sea conditions platt 1998 which result in complex flow structures and rolling pitching and heaving movements maslov et al 1999 a correct modelling of these effects is difficult in a wind tunnel maslov et al 1999 so the investigations are commonly restricted to yawing condition analysis considering the ship configuration the superstructure could be defined as a bluff body with sharp edges where a massive flow separation appears in its wake maslov et al 1999 rhoades and healey 1992 considering the short runway available a ski jump ramp system is used to increment the angle of attack aoa of the aircraft which results in extra lift at low speed furthermore this system provides safer operational conditions hernando and martínez val 2012 however the sharp edge at the end of the runway generates adverse aerodynamic effects at typically airplanes taking off performances bardera mora et al 2016 the most notable effect of a three dimensional bluff body flow is the usual presence of a complex vortex system in the wake that could affect the aircraft operation platt 1998 this vortex system is generated by the island and the edge of deck maslov et al 1999 the vortices generated on edges of foredeck are called bow vortices see fig 1 at ahead wind conditions the vortices have low intensity and they are quickly destroyed this condition is obtained when the ship speed and the atmospheric wind result in a relative wind velocity with an incident angle different to 0 for ship studies the resulted wind is called wind over deck wod at different wind over deck conditions the flow structure changes dramatically platt 1998 maslov et al 1999 kang et al 2016 polsky 2002 resulting in a conical vortex structure that emanates from the ski jump corners that vortex produces high turbulence levels along the final step of take off before the aircrafts are launched to flight over sea increasing the risk of these operations notice that the vortex system undergoes some changes quantitatively in dependence on absolute value of angle and also on features of ship architecture but qualitatively it remains practically unchanged from 25 to 25 maslov et al 1999 giving higher turbulence levels around of 15 flow control devices present useful results to counteract those adverse aerodynamic effects gad el hak 2000 greenwell and barrett 2006 several researches on aerodynamic flow control were conducted over frigates greenwell and barrett 2006 shafer 2005 shafer and ghee 2005 findlay and ghee 2006 and flat decked carriers landman et al 2005 nangia and lumsden 2004 findlay and ghee 2006 czerwiec and polsky 2004 cherry and constantino 2010 with different passive and active flow control devices an earlier investigation by using different passive flow control devices installed over the ski jump ramp was also developed by the authors bardera mora et al 2016 2018 the aim of this paper is to study the flow structure around the ski jump ramp and find solutions to mitigate the adverse aerodynamic effects generated considering that the vortex system qualitatively remains independent of the wod maslov et al 1999 wind tunnel test at wod 15 conditions were investigated those wind over deck angles have been selected as more problematic in the sense of production of turbulent flow above the flight deck smoke visualization were carried out to obtain qualitative information about the flow structure particle image velocimetry piv technique was used to present quantitative information columnar vortex generator device was shown to be highly effective in mitigating the adverse aerodynamic effects bardera mora et al 2016 kähler et al 2002 so three cvgs have been manufactured with different length depending on the location in the ski jump ramp regarding the interesting results obtained with a spiral parameter of 15 mm and the reduced intersection angle between the cvg and the ski jump ramp floor encouraging results are also observed in the present paper to mitigate the turbulent region and the conical vortices which appear over the ski jump ramp at wod 15 2 experimental setup 2 1 aircraft carrier model the aircraft carrier studied has a similar configuration to an american lhd landing helicopter dock this ship is characterized by a flight deck ended in a ski jump ramp to facilitate take off operations and a superstructure where radomes antennas stacks and communication systems are installed the model ship was made in wood and has a scale of 1 100 to avoid wind tunnel blockage effects barlow et al 1999 the main ship model dimensions are indicated in fig 2 in millimetres as it can be observed the model ship only represents the structure above the waterline which is subjected to aerodynamic interferences the passive flow control devices are also represented in fig 2 notice that the lateral cvgs change in length with respect to the central one cvg1 which is in the starboard is reduced up to 120 mm due to the aircraft carrier geometry cvg3 is installed in the port of the aircraft carrier and limited by the maximum height of the manufacturing machine 2 2 wind tunnel the experimental tests were carried out in the facilities of instituto nacional de técnica aeroespacial inta spain the low speed wind tunnel has a maximum speed of 60 m s and a turbulence intensity lower than 0 5 of the free stream this tunnel has a closed circuit and an open test section with a nozzle of 2 3 m2 the model studied was located over a platform see fig 3 which simulates the sea surface in addition a streamlined leading and trailing edges minimize the interference between the platform and the free stream however the sea boundary layer was not simulated following other investigators polsky 2003 instead a uniform free stream was reproduced in the wind tunnel the tests were conducted at 10 m s which implies that the reynolds number of the experiments 1 3 105 based on the height of the flight deck is higher than the critical one for structures with sharp edges healey 1992 this condition allows to ensure the similarity white 2003 between the results obtained with the ship model and the full scaled aircraft carrier healey 1992 with the aim to study conical vortex structures around aircraft carrier structure wod 0 condition is needed platt 1998 maslov et al 1999 during wind tunnel tests the relative velocity is simulated by the wind tunnel speed hence for a wod 15 the model ship is located at 15 with respect to the free stream velocity of the wind tunnel as fig 3 shows 2 3 particle image velocimetry particle image velocimetry piv is the technique used to measure the flow characteristics this technique provides instantaneous flow field information by measuring the velocity of olive oil tracers transported by the flow these tracers are generated by means of a laskin nozzle atomizers which produce particles with a diameter of 1 μm approximately echols and young 1963 kähler et al 2002 the particles are illuminated with two neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet nd yag lasers with a maximum energy of 190 mj per pulse and a pulse separation of 25 μs hence the velocity vectors are computed based on the particle displacement and the pulse separation time the light scattered by tracer particles is recorded by a charged coupled device ccd camera with a resolution of 2048 2048 pixels the camera field of view fov was 260 260 mm2 the data rate acquisition between each pair of images was 10 hz the average flow field was computed using 200 instantaneous velocity maps the particle displacement was computed implementing a cross correlation analysis via fast fourier transform fft in order to reduce the computational time each digital picture of the flow was divided into small interrogation windows of 32 32 pixels with an electronic overlapping of 50 between each window following the nyquist sampling criteria raffel et al 2007 adrian 1991 adrian and westerweel 2011 the correlation peak location was improved by fitting a gaussian function prasad 2000 the spurious vectors were eliminated using a post processing analysis with a local mean filter of 3 3 vectors in size 2 4 columnar vortex generator a columnar vortex generator cvg is a passive flow control device studied by different researches landman et al 2005 bardera mora et al 2016 2018 which reduces the adverse aerodynamic effects generated due to sharp edges presence the columnar vortex generator is based on the spiral geometry and works capturing the incoming flow and turning it as a vortex the main advantage of cvg versus other passive flow control devices as bull nose is when wind enters the cvg interior it produces a fast rotation of the flow and simultaneously induces an axial velocity along the cylinder transforming this motion into a swirling vortex motion an in depth analysis of the cvg effectiveness was developed at inta bardera mora et al 2018 the geometrical configuration of the devices was built following the archimedean spiral which can be described in polar coordinates by equation 1 1 r p 2 π θ where r is the radius of curvature in mm p is the spiral parameter in mm and θ is the angle of the turned arc in radians the spiral devices were formed using a turning angle of θ 5π 2 rad and adapting smoothly the rest of the curve to the edge of the ramp see fig 4 the results obtained by bardera et al bardera mora et al 2018 showed that a cvg with a spiral parameter p 15 mm highly mitigates the recirculation bubble generated above the ski jump ramp furthermore a reduction of the intersection angle α between the horizontal plane and the cvg bardera mora et al 2018 showed an improvement of the cvg performances with a spiral parameter of 7 mm with the aim to mitigate the adverse aerodynamic effects generated at a wod 15 a set of columnar vortex generators have been installed in the edges of the ski jump ramp a combination of the α angle reduction bardera mora et al 2017 and the passive flow control device with the best performance obtained by bardera et al bardera mora et al 2018 has been implemented in this paper fig 5 shows the initial test carried out at wod 0 to study the effectiveness of the cvg configuration selected for the present paper the sharp edge of the ramp generates a recirculation bubble above the flight deck with high values of turbulence and low velocity bardera mora et al 2016 consequently the aerodynamic performances of the aircraft would be drastically reduced notice that α angle reduction presents better results than a cvg with a spiral parameter of 15 mm and α 12 bardera mora et al 2017 2018 in contrast to the turbulence intensity ti maps obtained with a cvg of α 0 and p 7 5 mm bardera mora et al 2017 a cvg with p 15 mm and α 0 eliminates the turbulence region above the ski jump ramp as fig 5 shows the flow control devices were produced using additive manufacturing commonly known as 3d printing springer 1998 tyler et al 2005 this kind of technique was selected due to its properties accuracy low cost production and rapid prototyping among others a zortrax m200 machine was used with black tinted high impact polystyrene hips as build up material lateral cvgs were also installed to reduce the adverse aerodynamic effects generated above the ski jump ramp as fig 6 shows the lateral cvgs are installed with the same intersection angle 12 between the floor of the ski jump ramp and the cvg smooth surface as cvg2 then the lateral passive control devices have a negative angle with respect to the horizontal plane the reduction of the intersection angle results in a smooth incoming flow over the ski jump ramp 2 5 flow visualization once the cvg configuration was selected a flow visualization was carried out with the aim to obtain a qualitative information of the device effectiveness an oil smoke wand was used to focus the flow in the region of interest both configurations reference case and cvg devices installed at two different conditions wod 15 was studied fig 7 a shows the flow structure at the reference case and wod 15 where no device is installed a turbulent structure is observed at the end of the ski jump ramp fig 7a which is deviated laterally by the cvg2 as can be observed in fig 7 b a conical vortex can be also seen at the starboard which is generated by the incoming flow from the lateral edge fig 7a the cvg1 configuration delays the vortex structure location by ejecting the flow throw the end of the device the detached flow which appears at the ski jump ramp corner does not show any reduction when passive devices are installed in fig 8 flow visualization at wod 15 can be observed at this condition a turbulent region appears in the starboard of the ski jump ramp which is again mitigated by cvg2 the sponson presence does not show any flow structure modification so quantitative studies are needed to determine its influence in the port of the ski jump ramp a conical vortex can be observed and is moved backward by cvg3 equivalent results are observed in the ski jump ramp corner where no reduction is appreciable 3 results fig 9 shows the non dimensional velocity and turbulence intensity maps at wod 15 the sections studied by means of piv have changed with respect to wod 15 case at a wod 15 four sections have been selected ramp mid point ramp corner middle point of cvg1 and the symmetrical plane of the middle point of cvg3 the latter section was selected to be compared with the results obtained at wod 15 notice that the left side of the piv maps shows information outside the ski jump ramp which will not affect to the aircraft operations the starboard of the ski jump ramp s1 and s2 shows a uniform flow and a reduction of the turbulence intensity above the ski jump ramp when the passive flow control devices are installed the turbulence intensity increases close to the corner s3 which might be due to the cvg devices presence the central map s4 shows that these passive flow control devices eliminate completely the recirculation bubble and the turbulence above the ski jump ramp regarding that the flow structure in that section highly interacts with aircraft performances the adverse effects mitigation is the most remarkable point at this condition similar procedure has been followed to study wod 15 fig 10 at this condition one piv plane has been studied at the port of the ski jump ramp middle point of the cvg1 the central plane 15 s1 shows a complete mitigation of the recirculation bubble generated above the ramp as in the previous velocity condition the corner section 15 s2 shows lower turbulent region than at wod 15 which could be associated to the non symmetric configuration however the turbulent area is bigger than in the reference case but the region affected is far from the flight path of the aircraft hence it can be assumed negligible with respect to the turbulent region which appears at the reference case in the central section 15 s1 finally section 15 s3 shows that the cvg installation generates a recirculation bubble above the cvg3 which did not appear at the reference condition as in the previous case it can be associated to the cvg sharp edge however the flow structure above the ski jump ramp which appears at the reference case related to the lateral incoming flow is reduced up to a uniform flow when the passive flow control devices are installed comparing the symmetric maps of the lateral sides 15 s1 and 15 s3 a similar flow structure and turbulence intensity values can be observed when the lateral incoming flow curves downward the ski jump ramp the cvg presence eliminates any disturbance generated by the edges of the ski jump ramp 4 conclusions an aircraft carrier is characterized by a combination of bluff bodies with sharp edges conical vortex with high intensity is expected to appear at wod 0 hence an experimental wind tunnel investigation to study and mitigate these adverse aerodynamic effects has been developed two wod conditions 15 were selected based on previous investigations and the usual aircraft performances envelope smoke visualization was carried out to determine the region affected by the vortices at each wod condition apart from those structures turbulent region was also observed over the ski jump ramp particle image velocimetry technique was used to obtain quantitative information about the flow structure a recirculation bubble characterized by low speed was observed over the ski jump ramp surface previous investigation showed that columnar vortex generator which is a passive flow control device highly mitigates the recirculation bubble at wod 0 regarding the encouraging results obtained with a spiral parameter of 15 mm and a reduction of the intersection angle with respect to the ski jump ramp surface three cvgs have been manufactured with different length depending on the location in the ski jump ramp encouraging results were obtained to mitigate the adverse aerodynamic effects generated due to the ski jump ramp configuration the sharp edges of the cvg lateral sides detach the incoming flow and generate small recirculation bubbles over the passive flow control devices finally we can conclude that the main finding is that the cvg system is extremely effective in mitigating the adverse effects of conical vortex systems in the areas of the aircraft carrier where aircraft operations are most significant future investigation might be related to the reduction of the turbulent region generated over them and near the corners of the ski jump ramp by means of passive flow control devices

and analysed using a physics based vulnerability assessment model and integrated into a dynamic system supply and demand model the output is then analysed through a machine learning algorithm to identify functional relationships between systems and the vessel s operational capabilities to then build a bayesian network for further analysis the bayesian network model is used to identify single point failures and analyse the opv s equipment on board systems for sensitivity to the survivability of the platform the results demonstrate the ability of the machine learning algorithm to build a bayesian network that can effectively improve the naval design process and subsequently contribute to enhancing the survivability of opvs keywords vulnerability bayesian network survivability assessment 1 introduction offshore patrol vessels are relatively small compared to other naval combat vessels but requirements to their capabilities are growing as more systems and technologies become commercially available a major challenge in integrating new systems and functionalities lies within identifying single point of failures that make a system vulnerable survivability in the context of defence is defined as the capability of a vessel to survive a damaging event such as an engine fire or a weapon threat and maintain its mission capability it is usually divided into three categories ball and calvano 1994 navy 2012 which are susceptibility the ability to defeat an attack vulnerability the ability to withstand an attack structurally and operationally and recoverability the ability to recover mission capability though susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability are interdependent this paper focuses upon the vulnerability aspects of survivability only currently vulnerability assessments of naval combat vessels are performed at the detailed design stage when comprehensive information of the systems and associated equipment first become available often design changes at this late design stage are costly and design errors are hard to resolve doe 2006 haskins et al 2006 it would thus be beneficial to know the critical relationships between a vessel s systems and their contribution to a vessel s operational capabilities at the early design stage waltham sajdak 2012 these relationships can vary depending of the role and function of the vessel but generally are similar with vessels of similar size brown and salcedo 2003 current vulnerability assessment tools for early stage design work with existing designs and are predisposed to erroneous results due to the assumptive nature of the design work ball and calvano 1994 friebe and waltham sajdak 2017 goodfriend 2015 thus it would be beneficial to know statistically significant dependencies between naval systems events onboard the vessel and their effect onto the vessel s operational capabilities furthermore this research is based on a previously discussed methodology friebe and waltham sajdak 2017 using bayesian networks bns to represent the failure relationships between systems and their effect onto the operational capability to assess the effect of parameters of uncertainty to the survivability performance the parameters of uncertainty describe the scenarios of the naval vessel in combat and can vary from environmental effects crew states and mission states and can be extracted from historical databases friis hansen 2000 khakzad et al 2013 liwång 2015 this study provides a framework to identify complex failure relationships from an early design between platform systems sub systems and components to then link the various parameters of uncertainty through a machine learnt bn that is not prone to subjective human input it also demonstrates how that framework can be utilized to improve the vulnerability performance of an existing vessel through possible design modifications as part of this research a case study has been performed which demonstrates that the survivability performance through the application of the developed process has improved as shown in section 5 furthermore this research will enable naval architects to use the learnt critical relationships describing the functional state between the systems to study the change in the uncertainty of parameter values and evaluate their effect on vulnerability performance holistically 2 theory and methodology 2 1 background at the early design stage of a vessel where little information is available the uncertainty of the critical relationships between onboard systems may be large giachetti 2016 this uncertainty with the associated simplifications and assumptions made in the vessel and system models consequently decreases the confidence level of overall risk or survivability assessments abrahamsson 2002 previous research liwång 2015 highlighted the applicability of bayesian networks bns for maritime platform survivability assessments and its capability to evaluate design choices and perform risk assessments effectively bns are particularly useful as they allow historical information to be included into the uncertainty treatment of risk assessments however so far there is no probabilistic causal relationship model that is not subject to erroneous human input liwång 2015 this paper demonstrates that the use of bn theory can mitigate model uncertainty in survivability predictions by deriving probabilistic causal relationships between a vessel s functional systems from simulation results the probabilistic causal relationships in the resultant bn model are then assessed using bayes theorem and influence diagrams to study cause and effect relationships on the design of a vessel bns and influence diagrams are especially useful when there is no empirical data and there is a need to identify the underlying causal relationships imo 2013 these causal relationships are then used to predict the expected cause of failures of systems or operational capabilities additionally the strength of a bn is its capability to present probabilistic relationships and causal dependencies graphically and to facilitate the study of those dependencies liwång et al 2013 musharraf et al 2013 these probabilistic relationships can be either derived from simulation or historical data konovessis et al 2013 liwång et al 2013 but are learned through bayesian machine learning algorithm in this study 2 2 bayesian network a bn is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph dag khakzad et al 2013 for example a bn could represent the probabilistic relationship between damage imparted to a vessel by a weapon and the vessel s survivability for a specific vessel s system configuration a bn can be used to predict the probability of the functional state of each modelled capability when subjected to a weapon threat liwång 2015 bns are helpful in assessing the probability of each on board system s functional state and consequently analyzing functional inter system relationships where 1 uncertainty of input is high for example a weapon strike location 2 historical data is too limited to enable effective regression 3 and or where physical dependencies such as overly complex detailed engineering systems design liwång 2015 the bn was chosen due to its reverse reasoning capability enabling the identification of those systems and design parameters that are critical to the survivability performance of the vessel and also its ability to create the bn structure which builds conditional probabilistic relationships between them it is then possible to assess the performance of multiple systems for a single threat size simulation with varying hit locations and also to assess the effect of variables such as type of threat or crew also bns are graphical models and thus capable of clearly displaying causal relationships 2 2 1 bayes rule and inference a generic bn model comprises a set of variables representing nodes in the network for example in fig 1 the nodes are rain grass wet and sprinkler links between the nodes represent the probabilistic relationships between them also shown in fig 1 nodes that are not connected represent variables that are causally unrelated whereas arrows that proceed from one node to another represent a causal parent child relationship for example in fig 1 the relationships between rain and grass wet sprinkler and grass wet and rain and sprinkler are shown in the computational probability tables cpts next to their respective nodes with t representing true and f false as logical states of that node the bn algorithm then performs backwards reasoning to identify the causes that led to the logical state of the node for example if grass wet is showing wet then the probability that rain is true can be determined but it will be updated with the observation from the node sprinkler the key feature of a bn is its capability to form a risk knowledge model enabling reasoning about the uncertainty of each variable each node is associated with a probability function that uses as input a particular set of values and returns the probability of the variable represented by the node furthermore bns represent the joint probability distribution p u of each variable in the network friis hansen 2000 as shown in equation 1 1 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where pa a i are the parents of a i bn s are also used as inference engines in accident analysis friis hansen 2000 khakzad et al 2013 for updating the prior occurrence probability of events given new information called evidence e as shown in equation 2 for any two events u and e where p e reads as the probability of e and p u e as the probability of u given that b has been observed the joint probability distribution p u e can then be computed as in equation 2 2 p u e p e u p u p e p u e p u e 2 2 2 structure learning algorithm genie a software tool developed for bn applications is used to create and analyse the structure of the bn because it contains a suite of analysis algorithms to choose from one of these algorithms is the bayesian search structure algorithm which is commonly used and was developed in 1992 cooper and herskovits 1992 to find relationships between the variables and visualize them the bayesian search algorithm learns the bn structure using set of a training data and a hill climbing procedure with random starts lestina et al 1999 the bayesian search algorithm also requires a scoring function and a set of possible structures to determine a bn having a maximized scoring function koller and friedman 2009 the algorithm creates the bn by testing different network operations such as edge additions edge removals and edge reversals to maximize the scoring function a shortcoming of this algorithm is that it will find local maxima rather than a global maximum thus the learning algorithm must be restarted using different seeds to find numerous bn s which are then evaluated by a scoring function to find the best fitting bn 2 2 3 cross entropy one measure that is commonly used to evaluate bns is the cross entropy this is a method used to quantify the difference between two probability distributions these are the actual probability distribution q x and the one that is created by the learning algorithm p x the cross entropy h p q measures the summed difference between both as shown in equation 3 the cross entropy in this study is used to evaluate the relative significance of parent nodes to their child nodes koller and friedman 2009 lestina et al 1999 this is done through individual selective choice of observation nodes and estimation of the change in entropy of the questioned node in the bn 3 h p q x p x log q x 3 framework as discussed in section 1 a novel framework of assessing and improving a survivability of a vessel has been developed and is shown in fig 2 this framework uses a novel combination of well established tools for vessel structure and equipment modelling threat simulation and system behaviour assessment and a machine learning algorithm to derive a bn this bn allows the assessment of the critical system relationships of the vessel furthermore this process can be applied to a notional initial design which complies with the minimal survivability requirements goodfriend 2015 from traditional analyses foos and skahen 2008 simulation outputs from this process are then used to derive the critical causal system relationships within the vessel the machine bayesian learning algorithm is used to derive the critical causal system relationships between the systems and the operational requirements this bn is then used as a basis for bayesian sensitivity testing to identify sections of the bn that possess a relatively strong contribution to the survivability performance of the vessel and might be a single point of failure if the survivability performance of the vessel does not meet its requirements the supposedly single point failures are investigated and the design is adjusted if deemed necessary the process is then reiterated until the vessel s design passes the survivability requirement 3 1 equipment modelling the framework begins with an initial vessel design at the basic design stage when key system information first becomes available the structure is modelled in the integrated recoverability model irm tool foos and skahen 2008 and then populated with the equipment and its onboard location and behavioural characteristics furthermore the operational requirements are expressed through fault trees fts as availability monitors of necessary equipment the structure and equipment data are then transferred into the measure of total integrated system survivability motiss tool stark 2016 both software packages irm and motiss are tested and validated by the us navy and are frequently utilised for survivability assessments of ships of the us navy appendix a contains a detailed description of irm and appendix b contains a detailed description of motiss 3 2 apply threat and simulate blast and fragmentation within the motiss tool a realistic threat scenario is applied to the vessel this threat is assumed to be a weapon hit from a missile which will be matched to an appropriate warhead size such that the vessel could remain afloat then motiss simulates the blast and fragmentation damage resulting from the threat motiss then evaluates the probability of a fire ignition and provides the damage results in the form of damage specifications 3 3 assess dynamic system behaviour the motiss damage specifications are then transferred back into the irm tool which then continuously interacts with the fire and smoke spread fssim tool floyd 2004 this network fire model dynamically computes the fire spread throughout the vessel s compartments and takes into account the firefighting measures from the vessel modelled within the irm irm then records the equipment s state and survivability requirement performance and then processes them into binary values as shown in the example in table 1 these binary values represent the availability of operational capabilities and are recorded as 1 if the requirement is met and 0 if the requirement fails appendix a contains a detailed description of irm 3 4 bn structure and parameter learning the binary data in each column in table 1 are then compared with every other column by genie initially a null hypothesis between all columns assumes that the columns are unrelated to each other to determine the existence of a probabilistic relationship between the individual columns the statistical significance of the null hypothesis rejections are tested lestina et al 1999 each column of data becomes an individual bn node in the bn structure and whenever a null hypothesis is rejected by a statistically significant test result a link is formed between the two nodes tested otherwise there is no link next genie is used to determine the bns probabilistic values of the relationship between each node i e each column in table 1 and all others using causal dependencies and correlations these probabilistic values form the basis of the cpts for each node see section 2 2 to fill the cpt tables the nodes that have a probabilistic relationship are compared row by row to determine the parameters of conditional distributions between the nodes the distributions within each cpt are then automatically optimized with a maximum likelihood estimation mle algorithm to fit the data holistically for the whole bn lestina et al 1999 3 5 analyse bayesian networks analysis of the bn s sensitivity to critical systems and components enables single point of failures and design issues to be identified if they are identified as significant the design could be modified and the improvement process repeated until the performance of the systems or the overall survivability performance of the vessel s single points of failure are removed 4 case study the goal of this case study is to demonstrate the viability of the proposed novel framework combining the capabilities of three well established software tools a bn model describing the association between mission outcomes i e functional survivability and vulnerability of on board systems components of a typical vessel is derived this bn is tested on its cross entropy which makes it possible to identify critical equipment that has a significant contribution to the mission capability of the vessel the outcome of this case study is considered successful if the vessel s survivability can be improved by the process outlined in the framework 4 1 vessel design and systems specifications and configuration the framework was applied to a notional design of a high speed opv equipped with rockets for fast counter attacks the vessel has an overall length of 50 m and has a combined structure of steel hull and aluminum superstructure the vessel is fitted with a propulsion system that is comprised of two waterjet propulsion systems and a combat system with a forward and aft gun the power is generated by two generator sets and supplied to the corresponding switchboards to distribute the power throughout the vessel necessary support systems for power generation distribution and combat functions and the crew system interactions were modelled at the basic design stage level this vessel has both internal and external communication systems the internal communication system consists of three individually operating communication sub systems which are 1 main circuit 1 mc wireless calling system wics and sound powered telephone spt the external communication system is a radio system in this case study damage control is composed of a fire main and fire plugs 4 2 vulnerability performance measures in this case study it was assumed that for a minimal level of survivability of the vessel the performance depends on the survivability of at least seven operational capabilities power propulsion internal communications external communications damage control combat and the crew survivability requirements of each operational capability and crew were also assumed based on common knowledge and expert opinions skahen and foos 2017 expert opinions were gathered through interviews with seven survivability engineers from test evaluation solutions over a period of nine months who then also verified the accurate representation of the system and the operational capabilities the assumptions and scenario parameters for the performance requirements of the operational capabilities and the crew include 1 power performance this requires at least 50 of the generator systems and corresponding support systems to be functional 2 propulsion performance this requires 50 of the propulsion generating systems steering and propulsion equipment to be functional 3 internal communications this requires either wireless calling system wics or sound powered telephone spt or 1 main circuit 1 mc to be functional a wics system is assumed operational if 50 of the wics antennas are functional the spt is assumed to be working if it is possible to communicate at least between two out of the three spts 4 external communications this requires either the radio equipment rack or the radio operator console to be functional this system has two components that can be used to perform emergency calls a radio equipment rack and a radio operator console 5 damage control this requires a minimum of 50 availability of the fire pumps and 50 availability of the fire plugs in both forward and aft of the vessel 6 combat the vessel has a 71 mm forward gun and an aft rocket launcher and requires both of them to be a 100 functional for combat missions these system s inputs such as cooling power and operator input is recorded temporally to be operationally functional also requires the combat information centre control console which needs to be manned and supplied with power and the sensory inputs from the gyro wind gauge and radar 7 crew fatality limit fatalities are grouped into instant fatalities and from secondary weapon damage effects such as fire and smoke the total number of fatalities should not exceed 80 which are 18 out of the 22 crew members for this type of vessel opv 4 3 modelling in irm the model constructed in irm is comprised of the vessel s structure and the main systems those that are considered essential for vessel survivability and the support systems that enable the main systems to function the conceptual layout of the power system and the seawater system are shown in detail in fig 3 and fig 4 to demonstrate the depth of modelling however the remaining systems were modelled in similar detail the system shown in fig 3 is a power system that consists of two generators gen i and gen ii providing power to the switchboards swbd i and swbd ii from the switchboards the power is distributed to either an abt automatic bus tie breaker or mbt manual bus tie breaker these bus tie breakers operate as switches and switch between a normal power source and an alternate power source when the former is not available furthermore irm allows the user to assign crew to specific systems if that system needs a trained crew member to operate the system i e change state between off and on in total 22 crew members were modelled with specific skills such as the capabilities of a mechanic electrician or a damage control personal and also incorporates how long it takes for the crew to perform recovery actions on the system from the bus tie breakers power is further distributed to the power panels power panel i and power panel ii which are usually situated throughout the vessel to provide electrical supply to closely located equipment the seawater system shown in fig 4 is modelled in such that it always has a source a pump and a sink in this model there are six sea chests each providing access to sea water there are 2 fire main pumps that provide flow from the sea chests then merge on a major fire main system through valves this fire main can branch out into a sea water cooling system providing cooling to various equipment this is shown as the branch at fitting iii this equipment is modelled to also have other necessary fluids set up to operate for example lubricate oil or fuel which are operated similarly to the sea water system at fitting iv the fire main system also branches off into an installed firefighting system not shown in fig 4 this firefighting system is comprised of sprinklers that are modelled with heat sensors and a water discharge rate if the sensor detects a rise in temperature it will release water and attempt to extinguish or suppress the fire the irm enables modelling of survivability requirements of the vessel by utilizing a fault tree approach foos and skahen 2008 the ft structure shows the required availability of equipment necessary for successful operation the top level ft structure for the survivability of the opv vessel is shown in fig 5 4 4 motiss model imported from irm to simulate weapon attacks and damage scenarios the probabilistic vulnerability assessment tool called motiss was utilised because model data can be transferred directly from irm this data includes vessel structure and corresponding system s dimensions and locations for weapon attack simulations the motiss requires the size of the threat to be defined in this case study a threat was selected such that it could cause structural damage and also be small enough to allow the vessel to float and be stable survivability of a vessel from a weapon attack is defined as a function of warhead charge weight combined with the floodable length of the vessel as illustrated in fig 6 waltham sajdak 2012 the correlation between the charge weight floodable length related to the warhead damage can be described through the empirical formula 4 wd 0 0135 fl allowable 3 where wd is the tnt equivalent warhead charge weight in kg and fl allowable is the floodable allowable length which is assumed to be 12 5 of the length between the aft and forward perpendicular of the vessel waltham sajdak 2012 the vessel s length is about 50 m and thus the threat size for this vessel was selected with a warhead size of 3 1 kg tnt the motiss tool also requires the user to input a weapon hit grid these are uniformly and evenly distributed across the vessel as shown in fig 7 the hit grid in this study consists of 11 locations in the longitudinal direction 4 locations in the vertical and 5 locations in the transverse direction that is 220 locations most port and starboard locations were chosen to be in very close proximity to the hull not further away than 30 cm each of the 220 hit locations is simulated and an output file is created that contains the damage information for each damaged piece of equipment and the location of potential fires 4 5 re importing into irm and measurement states on completion of the assessment of the effect of threats on the vessel s systems using motiss the damage files are re entered into irm this enables irm to model the systems performance for each hit simulation the systems and their functioning performance are modelled from the moment of impact and for 30 min onward experts skahen and foos 2017 advised that simulating the vessel for 30 min after the weapon hit is reasonable anything longer would be irrelevant as the combat scenario is not expected to last that long a total of 220 hits were simulated once with each simulation measuring the on off state of 750 single pieces of equipment additionally 7 top performance levels and 12 sub performance requirements from fig 5 were tracked which totaled 769 columns of data with each them having 220 rows of binary data for each weapon hit this data can now be imported into genie 4 6 bayesian network settings genie contains learning algorithms that consist of two analytical methods the first is a heuristic search and scoring function and the second is an independence test the bayesian search algorithm was used in this study lestina et al 1999 this algorithm uses a hill climbing scoring procedure with random restarts as the required data storage for the probability table increases with the number of variables and states it was found to be useful to limit the maximum number of parent nodes to five the decision to limit the parent nodes does not have a significant negative impact because the relative difference between the parent nodes to the child node diminishes as parent nodes are increased koller and friedman 2009 the link probability was reduced to 10 6 in order to eliminate the accidental probabilistic relationships and build a lean bn which in turn helped to keep the number of parent relationships low 5 results 5 1 initial results the results are twofold firstly the irm simulation results show a detailed crew and system interaction for the first 30 min after the weapon hit secondly a bn is derived from the crew and system states at the 30 min time interval one of the major findings of this analysis is shown in fig 8 the screenshot in fig 8 a shows decks of the vessel from the hold up to the mast the orange circles in the aft area on the decks platform main deck and 01 level indicate damage to the structure due to a hit aft on the deckhouse the screenshot in fig 8b shows that in this scenario the aft and forward guns are disabled 1 s after the weapon hit a fire has also been caused by the weapon hit and is indicated by the red colour both guns are connected to the same power panel on the 01 level and are lacking power because the power supply to the power panel has been interrupted at 25 s the power panel regains power after a crew member has operated the mbt on the 01 level at 75 s the forward gun becomes non functional again due to overheating because the cooling circuit is non functioning and without coolant the gun will not function both guns are dependent on the same power panel which is a single point of failure existence of a single point of failure in a design is a critical design weakness that should be resolved a viable solution to the problem could be to power each gun from a separate power panel after the irm simulation was completed two bns shown in fig 9 were developed using the learning algorithm koller and friedman 2009 fig 9 shows a sensitivity analysis of the aft gun sensitivity testing can be used to determine the relative influence of a system to another system or the vessel s operational capabilities sensitivity is characterised as the expected shift in variation of a selected target node due to the structure and the computational probability tables of the bn as an example in fig 9 all nodes in red with arrows pointing towards the aft gun indicate a high sensitivity and contribution with respect to the failure of the aft gun the target node is indicated by a crosshair at the bottom right of the node nodes with lighter colouring up to grey have less or zero sensitivity to the target node it can be seen that the learning algorithm detected correctly that the aft gun is sensitive to failure of the main switchboard 1 mswbd1 as it supplies power directly and indirectly at the fire control console and display console furthermore although both bns are identical in fig 9 the bn on the right shows the sensitivity analysis on the forward gun which is the target node now again the main switchboard is a sensitive component by powering the gun control console it can be concluded that the learning algorithm with the help of a sensitivity analysis model correctly identified the single point of failure that was found in the irm model both these cases indicated that the operational state of the main switchboard was necessary for the guns to be operational investigation of the power system design showed that critical gun components for the forward gun and aft gun systems were powered from the same power panel 5 2 model reiteration the power network then was reconfigured so that the forward gun is provided power from main switchboard 2 mswbd 2 which is not in the pilot house but from in compartment next to the main engine room the motiss and irm model was adjusted accordingly and re run as predicted reconfiguring the power network and supplying the forward gun with power from mswbd2 separated the critical equipment from the forward and aft gun the red coloured equipment shown in fig 10 on the left and right are clearly non identical and therefore shows that both systems are independently powered it can also be inferred from comparing the bns on the right side in figs 9 and 10 that the main power source for the forward gun changed from mswbd1 before the network reconfiguration these are surrounded by a green dotted line on the both figures to mswbd2 surrounded by a green dotted line on the right figure after the reconfiguration the different colours in fig 10 represent a graphical interpretation of the quantified sensitivity of the critical equipment sensitivity analysis helps to identify critical systems that lead to the failure of other systems or the vessel s operational capability as an example table 2 shows the cross entropy values of the critical systems ranked in order of their sensitivity with respect to the forward gun capability the sensitivity values show a drop for the mswbd1 and a rise for mswbd2 which is beneficial as the mswbd1 is supposed to supply power only to the aft gun as it would be otherwise a single point of failure 1 1 entropy is defined as the variation i of a query variable q due to a finding f and is computed as i q f p q f log p q f p f where q is a state of q f a state of f and the summations are the total sum of all states f or q of variables f or q the design issues identified by the bn of the vessel were confirmed by naval experts and the combat requirement performance improved after the power system reconfiguration as shown in fig 11 the combat system s availability improved by 0 9 from 173 220 to 175 220 the improvement of the combat system performance is attributed to the higher survivability rate of the display console and the rocket 130 mm component this improvement appears small at first sight but it is important to note that this improvement can be achieved through connecting the power differently and does not add any cost or weight to the vessel the demonstrated design error was not found by naval architects as the model of vessel is very complex and comprised of many systems interacting also it must be noted that the magnitude of the improvement probably would change with a different hit grid resolution which has not been investigated yet also the machine learning algorithm was tested for variability and its performance to successfully build a bn that can identify the same single point of failure from the preceding sections the machine learning algorithm was trained 20 times with the same result database and was then reduced by the least sensitive nodes to contain only the critical systems in the bn the results in fig 12 show that the highest success rate of identifying the design issue is if the size of bn in the range between 15 and 30 nodes when the size of the bn is reduced to less than 15 nodes too much valuable information is cut out and thus identifying the design issue becomes impossible on the contrary when bn contains too many nodes and too much information the relative sensitive of each node diminishes and the chance of successfully identifying the design error reduces it was found that the highest possible chance of machine learning a bn that successfully identifies the error is if the size of the bn is at 20 nodes which corresponds to a chance of 90 success as shown in fig 12 6 discussion and future work the presented study links data from different parts of survivability assessments and combined them in a naval assembly without requiring further human input analysed a design of an actual vessel and provided insights into design issues and consequently suggestions to improve the design the tool to perform this analysis is the bn theory that enables naval architects not only to study the consequences of a failing system to the operational capability but also to reason backwards as in which system caused the operational capability to fail the case study is a model of a patrol boat the model was chosen to be complex enough to demonstrate that the proposed process is capable of identifying human design errors and the same time allow verification by a human expert the beneficial effects of this process are believed to grow with the complexity of models as the developed process can be automated and should outperform any human expert in the search for single point of failures the damage predictions from motiss vary with each simulation as the physical nature of fragmentation is probabilistic however in this study each hit location was simulated once only which rendered the output deterministic thus the next steps in this research are to produce more simulation runs for each hit location and produce a probabilistic damage output from motiss for input into irm and to introduce a probability distribution at some nodes of the bn and analyse parameters of uncertainty to the systems 7 conclusion the goal of this study was to create a framework that could improve the design of vessels through the probabilistic quantification of the failure relationships between its systems and the performance of the vessel this resulted in the development of a framework that used a novel combination of three well established software tools in the fields of survivability and risk assessment initially the irm and motiss tools were used to model an actual vessel s structure and systems and assess its operational capabilities against the effect of a weapon strike then a bayesian network model describing the association between functional survivability and vulnerability of the vessel s systems and components was derived this bn was able to successfully produce a recommendation for design change based on the identification of a single point of failure of the vessel the framework was found to perform best when the bn was reduced to 20 nodes and to successfully identify the design issue in 90 of the tested cases the design change was then used as the basis for the next design iteration and consequently resulted in an improved survivability performance of that vessel thus the proposed framework was validated and has shown to be capable of improving an existing vessel s survivability

garaniya from the australian maritime college and tim speer from austal appendix a integrated recoverability model the irm includes graphical database editing tools simulator fire module flooding module crew module output visualization and statistical analysis tools it was initially developed to evaluate temporal shipboard vulnerability considering the effects of secondary damage fire smoke and flooding system interaction and damage control and recovery efforts designing vessels for survivability requires an understanding of the dynamic behaviour of threat hazard events such as fire spread and the dynamic interdependencies of critical systems design studies can be conducted using weapon specific battle damage predictions imported from various weapon effects models for example asap freitas may 2012 surma durkin et al 2000 motiss morrisseau 2008 and cvam buckland 2008 after a scenario has been initialized the irm emulates the system response to varying damage conditions such as pipe rupture severed cables damaged components and injured personnel damage control efforts including manual fire fighting and de watering are also modelled and interact with the fire and flooding modules to determine the capability of the vessel and ability of the crew to contain damage the irm tracks the supply and demand across all the modelled interconnected systems but measures operational performance for each capability through a ft this ft is usually set up by subject matter experts who determine which systems are required to perform an operational task irm also uses a unique modelling approach to model network behaviour that eliminates the need for traditional fts at the equipment level and it allows the impact of different system layouts and redundancy to be analyzed to determine their impact on the vessel s survivability foos and skahen 2008 this modelling approach uses the terms nodes edges and hive to define a vessel s systems structure components are nodes pipes and cables are edges and combined they are a hive each node is assigned behaviors that model the operational characteristics of the corresponding component such as a power panel having a power output capacity and a pump that has a flow capacity as shown in fig 13 these behaviors include requirements for services such as cooling fuel data and power and the capability to generate these services in addition to creating hives the model can track supply and demand for each of these components and determine when a shortage exists resulting in cascading failures and degradation in system performance r gregg fresa zackary r stull and waltham sajdak 2017 the compartment structure that the irm system model shares with the fire and flooding models allows the irm to determine exposure to the effects of fire and flooding thus allowing secondary damage to be considered in the analysis fig 13 irm conceptual supply and demand model fig 13 appendix b measure of total integrated system survivability motiss integrates fragment and blast effects into a single vessel and equipment assessment it uses axis aligned bounding blocks to model a vessel which decreases the runtime to perform damage assessments using basic physics principles coupled with empirical data motiss provides a rapid damage prediction to an event using monte carlo simulation by varying each test threat parameter such as fragment size and flight direction waltham sajdak 2011 damage simulations are repeated hundreds of times with each simulation having different combinations of charge and detonation parameters such as fragment sizes speeds and trajectories this provides a set of results that captures the chaotic nature of the of the damage event motiss stores the model information and performs damage assessments to evaluate the survivability this process creates a damage specification sheets that contains information relating to hull breaches and damaged equipment currently motiss is capable of simulating and

23016,offshore patrol vessels opvs are a relatively small type of vessel designed for quick naval defence response in littoral zone opvs also have a complex system layout because they are constructed to include both commercial and naval aspects with functionality to facilitate its operational defence duties and capability furthermore this complex system layout may not be optimised for survivability this study presents a novel framework to examine survivability related system and functional dependencies of an actual opv combining different modelling techniques the opv is modelled and analysed using a physics based vulnerability assessment model and integrated into a dynamic system supply and demand model the output is then analysed through a machine learning algorithm to identify functional relationships between systems and the vessel s operational capabilities to then build a bayesian network for further analysis the bayesian network model is used to identify single point failures and analyse the opv s equipment on board systems for sensitivity to the survivability of the platform the results demonstrate the ability of the machine learning algorithm to build a bayesian network that can effectively improve the naval design process and subsequently contribute to enhancing the survivability of opvs keywords vulnerability bayesian network survivability assessment 1 introduction offshore patrol vessels are relatively small compared to other naval combat vessels but requirements to their capabilities are growing as more systems and technologies become commercially available a major challenge in integrating new systems and functionalities lies within identifying single point of failures that make a system vulnerable survivability in the context of defence is defined as the capability of a vessel to survive a damaging event such as an engine fire or a weapon threat and maintain its mission capability it is usually divided into three categories ball and calvano 1994 navy 2012 which are susceptibility the ability to defeat an attack vulnerability the ability to withstand an attack structurally and operationally and recoverability the ability to recover mission capability though susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability are interdependent this paper focuses upon the vulnerability aspects of survivability only currently vulnerability assessments of naval combat vessels are performed at the detailed design stage when comprehensive information of the systems and associated equipment first become available often design changes at this late design stage are costly and design errors are hard to resolve doe 2006 haskins et al 2006 it would thus be beneficial to know the critical relationships between a vessel s systems and their contribution to a vessel s operational capabilities at the early design stage waltham sajdak 2012 these relationships can vary depending of the role and function of the vessel but generally are similar with vessels of similar size brown and salcedo 2003 current vulnerability assessment tools for early stage design work with existing designs and are predisposed to erroneous results due to the assumptive nature of the design work ball and calvano 1994 friebe and waltham sajdak 2017 goodfriend 2015 thus it would be beneficial to know statistically significant dependencies between naval systems events onboard the vessel and their effect onto the vessel s operational capabilities furthermore this research is based on a previously discussed methodology friebe and waltham sajdak 2017 using bayesian networks bns to represent the failure relationships between systems and their effect onto the operational capability to assess the effect of parameters of uncertainty to the survivability performance the parameters of uncertainty describe the scenarios of the naval vessel in combat and can vary from environmental effects crew states and mission states and can be extracted from historical databases friis hansen 2000 khakzad et al 2013 liwång 2015 this study provides a framework to identify complex failure relationships from an early design between platform systems sub systems and components to then link the various parameters of uncertainty through a machine learnt bn that is not prone to subjective human input it also demonstrates how that framework can be utilized to improve the vulnerability performance of an existing vessel through possible design modifications as part of this research a case study has been performed which demonstrates that the survivability performance through the application of the developed process has improved as shown in section 5 furthermore this research will enable naval architects to use the learnt critical relationships describing the functional state between the systems to study the change in the uncertainty of parameter values and evaluate their effect on vulnerability performance holistically 2 theory and methodology 2 1 background at the early design stage of a vessel where little information is available the uncertainty of the critical relationships between onboard systems may be large giachetti 2016 this uncertainty with the associated simplifications and assumptions made in the vessel and system models consequently decreases the confidence level of overall risk or survivability assessments abrahamsson 2002 previous research liwång 2015 highlighted the applicability of bayesian networks bns for maritime platform survivability assessments and its capability to evaluate design choices and perform risk assessments effectively bns are particularly useful as they allow historical information to be included into the uncertainty treatment of risk assessments however so far there is no probabilistic causal relationship model that is not subject to erroneous human input liwång 2015 this paper demonstrates that the use of bn theory can mitigate model uncertainty in survivability predictions by deriving probabilistic causal relationships between a vessel s functional systems from simulation results the probabilistic causal relationships in the resultant bn model are then assessed using bayes theorem and influence diagrams to study cause and effect relationships on the design of a vessel bns and influence diagrams are especially useful when there is no empirical data and there is a need to identify the underlying causal relationships imo 2013 these causal relationships are then used to predict the expected cause of failures of systems or operational capabilities additionally the strength of a bn is its capability to present probabilistic relationships and causal dependencies graphically and to facilitate the study of those dependencies liwång et al 2013 musharraf et al 2013 these probabilistic relationships can be either derived from simulation or historical data konovessis et al 2013 liwång et al 2013 but are learned through bayesian machine learning algorithm in this study 2 2 bayesian network a bn is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph dag khakzad et al 2013 for example a bn could represent the probabilistic relationship between damage imparted to a vessel by a weapon and the vessel s survivability for a specific vessel s system configuration a bn can be used to predict the probability of the functional state of each modelled capability when subjected to a weapon threat liwång 2015 bns are helpful in assessing the probability of each on board system s functional state and consequently analyzing functional inter system relationships where 1 uncertainty of input is high for example a weapon strike location 2 historical data is too limited to enable effective regression 3 and or where physical dependencies such as overly complex detailed engineering systems design liwång 2015 the bn was chosen due to its reverse reasoning capability enabling the identification of those systems and design parameters that are critical to the survivability performance of the vessel and also its ability to create the bn structure which builds conditional probabilistic relationships between them it is then possible to assess the performance of multiple systems for a single threat size simulation with varying hit locations and also to assess the effect of variables such as type of threat or crew also bns are graphical models and thus capable of clearly displaying causal relationships 2 2 1 bayes rule and inference a generic bn model comprises a set of variables representing nodes in the network for example in fig 1 the nodes are rain grass wet and sprinkler links between the nodes represent the probabilistic relationships between them also shown in fig 1 nodes that are not connected represent variables that are causally unrelated whereas arrows that proceed from one node to another represent a causal parent child relationship for example in fig 1 the relationships between rain and grass wet sprinkler and grass wet and rain and sprinkler are shown in the computational probability tables cpts next to their respective nodes with t representing true and f false as logical states of that node the bn algorithm then performs backwards reasoning to identify the causes that led to the logical state of the node for example if grass wet is showing wet then the probability that rain is true can be determined but it will be updated with the observation from the node sprinkler the key feature of a bn is its capability to form a risk knowledge model enabling reasoning about the uncertainty of each variable each node is associated with a probability function that uses as input a particular set of values and returns the probability of the variable represented by the node furthermore bns represent the joint probability distribution p u of each variable in the network friis hansen 2000 as shown in equation 1 1 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where pa a i are the parents of a i bn s are also used as inference engines in accident analysis friis hansen 2000 khakzad et al 2013 for updating the prior occurrence probability of events given new information called evidence e as shown in equation 2 for any two events u and e where p e reads as the probability of e and p u e as the probability of u given that b has been observed the joint probability distribution p u e can then be computed as in equation 2 2 p u e p e u p u p e p u e p u e 2 2 2 structure learning algorithm genie a software tool developed for bn applications is used to create and analyse the structure of the bn because it contains a suite of analysis algorithms to choose from one of these algorithms is the bayesian search structure algorithm which is commonly used and was developed in 1992 cooper and herskovits 1992 to find relationships between the variables and visualize them the bayesian search algorithm learns the bn structure using set of a training data and a hill climbing procedure with random starts lestina et al 1999 the bayesian search algorithm also requires a scoring function and a set of possible structures to determine a bn having a maximized scoring function koller and friedman 2009 the algorithm creates the bn by testing different network operations such as edge additions edge removals and edge reversals to maximize the scoring function a shortcoming of this algorithm is that it will find local maxima rather than a global maximum thus the learning algorithm must be restarted using different seeds to find numerous bn s which are then evaluated by a scoring function to find the best fitting bn 2 2 3 cross entropy one measure that is commonly used to evaluate bns is the cross entropy this is a method used to quantify the difference between two probability distributions these are the actual probability distribution q x and the one that is created by the learning algorithm p x the cross entropy h p q measures the summed difference between both as shown in equation 3 the cross entropy in this study is used to evaluate the relative significance of parent nodes to their child nodes koller and friedman 2009 lestina et al 1999 this is done through individual selective choice of observation nodes and estimation of the change in entropy of the questioned node in the bn 3 h p q x p x log q x 3 framework as discussed in section 1 a novel framework of assessing and improving a survivability of a vessel has been developed and is shown in fig 2 this framework uses a novel combination of well established tools for vessel structure and equipment modelling threat simulation and system behaviour assessment and a machine learning algorithm to derive a bn this bn allows the assessment of the critical system relationships of the vessel furthermore this process can be applied to a notional initial design which complies with the minimal survivability requirements goodfriend 2015 from traditional analyses foos and skahen 2008 simulation outputs from this process are then used to derive the critical causal system relationships within the vessel the machine bayesian learning algorithm is used to derive the critical causal system relationships between the systems and the operational requirements this bn is then used as a basis for bayesian sensitivity testing to identify sections of the bn that possess a relatively strong contribution to the survivability performance of the vessel and might be a single point of failure if the survivability performance of the vessel does not meet its requirements the supposedly single point failures are investigated and the design is adjusted if deemed necessary the process is then reiterated until the vessel s design passes the survivability requirement 3 1 equipment modelling the framework begins with an initial vessel design at the basic design stage when key system information first becomes available the structure is modelled in the integrated recoverability model irm tool foos and skahen 2008 and then populated with the equipment and its onboard location and behavioural characteristics furthermore the operational requirements are expressed through fault trees fts as availability monitors of necessary equipment the structure and equipment data are then transferred into the measure of total integrated system survivability motiss tool stark 2016 both software packages irm and motiss are tested and validated by the us navy and are frequently utilised for survivability assessments of ships of the us navy appendix a contains a detailed description of irm and appendix b contains a detailed description of motiss 3 2 apply threat and simulate blast and fragmentation within the motiss tool a realistic threat scenario is applied to the vessel this threat is assumed to be a weapon hit from a missile which will be matched to an appropriate warhead size such that the vessel could remain afloat then motiss simulates the blast and fragmentation damage resulting from the threat motiss then evaluates the probability of a fire ignition and provides the damage results in the form of damage specifications 3 3 assess dynamic system behaviour the motiss damage specifications are then transferred back into the irm tool which then continuously interacts with the fire and smoke spread fssim tool floyd 2004 this network fire model dynamically computes the fire spread throughout the vessel s compartments and takes into account the firefighting measures from the vessel modelled within the irm irm then records the equipment s state and survivability requirement performance and then processes them into binary values as shown in the example in table 1 these binary values represent the availability of operational capabilities and are recorded as 1 if the requirement is met and 0 if the requirement fails appendix a contains a detailed description of irm 3 4 bn structure and parameter learning the binary data in each column in table 1 are then compared with every other column by genie initially a null hypothesis between all columns assumes that the columns are unrelated to each other to determine the existence of a probabilistic relationship between the individual columns the statistical significance of the null hypothesis rejections are tested lestina et al 1999 each column of data becomes an individual bn node in the bn structure and whenever a null hypothesis is rejected by a statistically significant test result a link is formed between the two nodes tested otherwise there is no link next genie is used to determine the bns probabilistic values of the relationship between each node i e each column in table 1 and all others using causal dependencies and correlations these probabilistic values form the basis of the cpts for each node see section 2 2 to fill the cpt tables the nodes that have a probabilistic relationship are compared row by row to determine the parameters of conditional distributions between the nodes the distributions within each cpt are then automatically optimized with a maximum likelihood estimation mle algorithm to fit the data holistically for the whole bn lestina et al 1999 3 5 analyse bayesian networks analysis of the bn s sensitivity to critical systems and components enables single point of failures and design issues to be identified if they are identified as significant the design could be modified and the improvement process repeated until the performance of the systems or the overall survivability performance of the vessel s single points of failure are removed 4 case study the goal of this case study is to demonstrate the viability of the proposed novel framework combining the capabilities of three well established software tools a bn model describing the association between mission outcomes i e functional survivability and vulnerability of on board systems components of a typical vessel is derived this bn is tested on its cross entropy which makes it possible to identify critical equipment that has a significant contribution to the mission capability of the vessel the outcome of this case study is considered successful if the vessel s survivability can be improved by the process outlined in the framework 4 1 vessel design and systems specifications and configuration the framework was applied to a notional design of a high speed opv equipped with rockets for fast counter attacks the vessel has an overall length of 50 m and has a combined structure of steel hull and aluminum superstructure the vessel is fitted with a propulsion system that is comprised of two waterjet propulsion systems and a combat system with a forward and aft gun the power is generated by two generator sets and supplied to the corresponding switchboards to distribute the power throughout the vessel necessary support systems for power generation distribution and combat functions and the crew system interactions were modelled at the basic design stage level this vessel has both internal and external communication systems the internal communication system consists of three individually operating communication sub systems which are 1 main circuit 1 mc wireless calling system wics and sound powered telephone spt the external communication system is a radio system in this case study damage control is composed of a fire main and fire plugs 4 2 vulnerability performance measures in this case study it was assumed that for a minimal level of survivability of the vessel the performance depends on the survivability of at least seven operational capabilities power propulsion internal communications external communications damage control combat and the crew survivability requirements of each operational capability and crew were also assumed based on common knowledge and expert opinions skahen and foos 2017 expert opinions were gathered through interviews with seven survivability engineers from test evaluation solutions over a period of nine months who then also verified the accurate representation of the system and the operational capabilities the assumptions and scenario parameters for the performance requirements of the operational capabilities and the crew include 1 power performance this requires at least 50 of the generator systems and corresponding support systems to be functional 2 propulsion performance this requires 50 of the propulsion generating systems steering and propulsion equipment to be functional 3 internal communications this requires either wireless calling system wics or sound powered telephone spt or 1 main circuit 1 mc to be functional a wics system is assumed operational if 50 of the wics antennas are functional the spt is assumed to be working if it is possible to communicate at least between two out of the three spts 4 external communications this requires either the radio equipment rack or the radio operator console to be functional this system has two components that can be used to perform emergency calls a radio equipment rack and a radio operator console 5 damage control this requires a minimum of 50 availability of the fire pumps and 50 availability of the fire plugs in both forward and aft of the vessel 6 combat the vessel has a 71 mm forward gun and an aft rocket launcher and requires both of them to be a 100 functional for combat missions these system s inputs such as cooling power and operator input is recorded temporally to be operationally functional also requires the combat information centre control console which needs to be manned and supplied with power and the sensory inputs from the gyro wind gauge and radar 7 crew fatality limit fatalities are grouped into instant fatalities and from secondary weapon damage effects such as fire and smoke the total number of fatalities should not exceed 80 which are 18 out of the 22 crew members for this type of vessel opv 4 3 modelling in irm the model constructed in irm is comprised of the vessel s structure and the main systems those that are considered essential for vessel survivability and the support systems that enable the main systems to function the conceptual layout of the power system and the seawater system are shown in detail in fig 3 and fig 4 to demonstrate the depth of modelling however the remaining systems were modelled in similar detail the system shown in fig 3 is a power system that consists of two generators gen i and gen ii providing power to the switchboards swbd i and swbd ii from the switchboards the power is distributed to either an abt automatic bus tie breaker or mbt manual bus tie breaker these bus tie breakers operate as switches and switch between a normal power source and an alternate power source when the former is not available furthermore irm allows the user to assign crew to specific systems if that system needs a trained crew member to operate the system i e change state between off and on in total 22 crew members were modelled with specific skills such as the capabilities of a mechanic electrician or a damage control personal and also incorporates how long it takes for the crew to perform recovery actions on the system from the bus tie breakers power is further distributed to the power panels power panel i and power panel ii which are usually situated throughout the vessel to provide electrical supply to closely located equipment the seawater system shown in fig 4 is modelled in such that it always has a source a pump and a sink in this model there are six sea chests each providing access to sea water there are 2 fire main pumps that provide flow from the sea chests then merge on a major fire main system through valves this fire main can branch out into a sea water cooling system providing cooling to various equipment this is shown as the branch at fitting iii this equipment is modelled to also have other necessary fluids set up to operate for example lubricate oil or fuel which are operated similarly to the sea water system at fitting iv the fire main system also branches off into an installed firefighting system not shown in fig 4 this firefighting system is comprised of sprinklers that are modelled with heat sensors and a water discharge rate if the sensor detects a rise in temperature it will release water and attempt to extinguish or suppress the fire the irm enables modelling of survivability requirements of the vessel by utilizing a fault tree approach foos and skahen 2008 the ft structure shows the required availability of equipment necessary for successful operation the top level ft structure for the survivability of the opv vessel is shown in fig 5 4 4 motiss model imported from irm to simulate weapon attacks and damage scenarios the probabilistic vulnerability assessment tool called motiss was utilised because model data can be transferred directly from irm this data includes vessel structure and corresponding system s dimensions and locations for weapon attack simulations the motiss requires the size of the threat to be defined in this case study a threat was selected such that it could cause structural damage and also be small enough to allow the vessel to float and be stable survivability of a vessel from a weapon attack is defined as a function of warhead charge weight combined with the floodable length of the vessel as illustrated in fig 6 waltham sajdak 2012 the correlation between the charge weight floodable length related to the warhead damage can be described through the empirical formula 4 wd 0 0135 fl allowable 3 where wd is the tnt equivalent warhead charge weight in kg and fl allowable is the floodable allowable length which is assumed to be 12 5 of the length between the aft and forward perpendicular of the vessel waltham sajdak 2012 the vessel s length is about 50 m and thus the threat size for this vessel was selected with a warhead size of 3 1 kg tnt the motiss tool also requires the user to input a weapon hit grid these are uniformly and evenly distributed across the vessel as shown in fig 7 the hit grid in this study consists of 11 locations in the longitudinal direction 4 locations in the vertical and 5 locations in the transverse direction that is 220 locations most port and starboard locations were chosen to be in very close proximity to the hull not further away than 30 cm each of the 220 hit locations is simulated and an output file is created that contains the damage information for each damaged piece of equipment and the location of potential fires 4 5 re importing into irm and measurement states on completion of the assessment of the effect of threats on the vessel s systems using motiss the damage files are re entered into irm this enables irm to model the systems performance for each hit simulation the systems and their functioning performance are modelled from the moment of impact and for 30 min onward experts skahen and foos 2017 advised that simulating the vessel for 30 min after the weapon hit is reasonable anything longer would be irrelevant as the combat scenario is not expected to last that long a total of 220 hits were simulated once with each simulation measuring the on off state of 750 single pieces of equipment additionally 7 top performance levels and 12 sub performance requirements from fig 5 were tracked which totaled 769 columns of data with each them having 220 rows of binary data for each weapon hit this data can now be imported into genie 4 6 bayesian network settings genie contains learning algorithms that consist of two analytical methods the first is a heuristic search and scoring function and the second is an independence test the bayesian search algorithm was used in this study lestina et al 1999 this algorithm uses a hill climbing scoring procedure with random restarts as the required data storage for the probability table increases with the number of variables and states it was found to be useful to limit the maximum number of parent nodes to five the decision to limit the parent nodes does not have a significant negative impact because the relative difference between the parent nodes to the child node diminishes as parent nodes are increased koller and friedman 2009 the link probability was reduced to 10 6 in order to eliminate the accidental probabilistic relationships and build a lean bn which in turn helped to keep the number of parent relationships low 5 results 5 1 initial results the results are twofold firstly the irm simulation results show a detailed crew and system interaction for the first 30 min after the weapon hit secondly a bn is derived from the crew and system states at the 30 min time interval one of the major findings of this analysis is shown in fig 8 the screenshot in fig 8 a shows decks of the vessel from the hold up to the mast the orange circles in the aft area on the decks platform main deck and 01 level indicate damage to the structure due to a hit aft on the deckhouse the screenshot in fig 8b shows that in this scenario the aft and forward guns are disabled 1 s after the weapon hit a fire has also been caused by the weapon hit and is indicated by the red colour both guns are connected to the same power panel on the 01 level and are lacking power because the power supply to the power panel has been interrupted at 25 s the power panel regains power after a crew member has operated the mbt on the 01 level at 75 s the forward gun becomes non functional again due to overheating because the cooling circuit is non functioning and without coolant the gun will not function both guns are dependent on the same power panel which is a single point of failure existence of a single point of failure in a design is a critical design weakness that should be resolved a viable solution to the problem could be to power each gun from a separate power panel after the irm simulation was completed two bns shown in fig 9 were developed using the learning algorithm koller and friedman 2009 fig 9 shows a sensitivity analysis of the aft gun sensitivity testing can be used to determine the relative influence of a system to another system or the vessel s operational capabilities sensitivity is characterised as the expected shift in variation of a selected target node due to the structure and the computational probability tables of the bn as an example in fig 9 all nodes in red with arrows pointing towards the aft gun indicate a high sensitivity and contribution with respect to the failure of the aft gun the target node is indicated by a crosshair at the bottom right of the node nodes with lighter colouring up to grey have less or zero sensitivity to the target node it can be seen that the learning algorithm detected correctly that the aft gun is sensitive to failure of the main switchboard 1 mswbd1 as it supplies power directly and indirectly at the fire control console and display console furthermore although both bns are identical in fig 9 the bn on the right shows the sensitivity analysis on the forward gun which is the target node now again the main switchboard is a sensitive component by powering the gun control console it can be concluded that the learning algorithm with the help of a sensitivity analysis model correctly identified the single point of failure that was found in the irm model both these cases indicated that the operational state of the main switchboard was necessary for the guns to be operational investigation of the power system design showed that critical gun components for the forward gun and aft gun systems were powered from the same power panel 5 2 model reiteration the power network then was reconfigured so that the forward gun is provided power from main switchboard 2 mswbd 2 which is not in the pilot house but from in compartment next to the main engine room the motiss and irm model was adjusted accordingly and re run as predicted reconfiguring the power network and supplying the forward gun with power from mswbd2 separated the critical equipment from the forward and aft gun the red coloured equipment shown in fig 10 on the left and right are clearly non identical and therefore shows that both systems are independently powered it can also be inferred from comparing the bns on the right side in figs 9 and 10 that the main power source for the forward gun changed from mswbd1 before the network reconfiguration these are surrounded by a green dotted line on the both figures to mswbd2 surrounded by a green dotted line on the right figure after the reconfiguration the different colours in fig 10 represent a graphical interpretation of the quantified sensitivity of the critical equipment sensitivity analysis helps to identify critical systems that lead to the failure of other systems or the vessel s operational capability as an example table 2 shows the cross entropy values of the critical systems ranked in order of their sensitivity with respect to the forward gun capability the sensitivity values show a drop for the mswbd1 and a rise for mswbd2 which is beneficial as the mswbd1 is supposed to supply power only to the aft gun as it would be otherwise a single point of failure 1 1 entropy is defined as the variation i of a query variable q due to a finding f and is computed as i q f p q f log p q f p f where q is a state of q f a state of f and the summations are the total sum of all states f or q of variables f or q the design issues identified by the bn of the vessel were confirmed by naval experts and the combat requirement performance improved after the power system reconfiguration as shown in fig 11 the combat system s availability improved by 0 9 from 173 220 to 175 220 the improvement of the combat system performance is attributed to the higher survivability rate of the display console and the rocket 130 mm component this improvement appears small at first sight but it is important to note that this improvement can be achieved through connecting the power differently and does not add any cost or weight to the vessel the demonstrated design error was not found by naval architects as the model of vessel is very complex and comprised of many systems interacting also it must be noted that the magnitude of the improvement probably would change with a different hit grid resolution which has not been investigated yet also the machine learning algorithm was tested for variability and its performance to successfully build a bn that can identify the same single point of failure from the preceding sections the machine learning algorithm was trained 20 times with the same result database and was then reduced by the least sensitive nodes to contain only the critical systems in the bn the results in fig 12 show that the highest success rate of identifying the design issue is if the size of bn in the range between 15 and 30 nodes when the size of the bn is reduced to less than 15 nodes too much valuable information is cut out and thus identifying the design issue becomes impossible on the contrary when bn contains too many nodes and too much information the relative sensitive of each node diminishes and the chance of successfully identifying the design error reduces it was found that the highest possible chance of machine learning a bn that successfully identifies the error is if the size of the bn is at 20 nodes which corresponds to a chance of 90 success as shown in fig 12 6 discussion and future work the presented study links data from different parts of survivability assessments and combined them in a naval assembly without requiring further human input analysed a design of an actual vessel and provided insights into design issues and consequently suggestions to improve the design the tool to perform this analysis is the bn theory that enables naval architects not only to study the consequences of a failing system to the operational capability but also to reason backwards as in which system caused the operational capability to fail the case study is a model of a patrol boat the model was chosen to be complex enough to demonstrate that the proposed process is capable of identifying human design errors and the same time allow verification by a human expert the beneficial effects of this process are believed to grow with the complexity of models as the developed process can be automated and should outperform any human expert in the search for single point of failures the damage predictions from motiss vary with each simulation as the physical nature of fragmentation is probabilistic however in this study each hit location was simulated once only which rendered the output deterministic thus the next steps in this research are to produce more simulation runs for each hit location and produce a probabilistic damage output from motiss for input into irm and to introduce a probability distribution at some nodes of the bn and analyse parameters of uncertainty to the systems 7 conclusion the goal of this study was to create a framework that could improve the design of vessels through the probabilistic quantification of the failure relationships between its systems and the performance of the vessel this resulted in the development of a framework that used a novel combination of three well established software tools in the fields of survivability and risk assessment initially the irm and motiss tools were used to model an actual vessel s structure and systems and assess its operational capabilities against the effect of a weapon strike then a bayesian network model describing the association between functional survivability and vulnerability of the vessel s systems and components was derived this bn was able to successfully produce a recommendation for design change based on the identification of a single point of failure of the vessel the framework was found to perform best when the bn was reduced to 20 nodes and to successfully identify the design issue in 90 of the tested cases the design change was then used as the basis for the next design iteration and consequently resulted in an improved survivability performance of that vessel thus the proposed framework was validated and has shown to be capable of improving an existing vessel s survivability

garaniya from the australian maritime college and tim speer from austal appendix a integrated recoverability model the irm includes graphical database editing tools simulator fire module flooding module crew module output visualization and statistical analysis tools it was initially developed to evaluate temporal shipboard vulnerability considering the effects of secondary damage fire smoke and flooding system interaction and damage control and recovery efforts designing vessels for survivability requires an understanding of the dynamic behaviour of threat hazard events such as fire spread and the dynamic interdependencies of critical systems design studies can be conducted using weapon specific battle damage predictions imported from various weapon effects models for example asap freitas may 2012 surma durkin et al 2000 motiss morrisseau 2008 and cvam buckland 2008 after a scenario has been initialized the irm emulates the system response to varying damage conditions such as pipe rupture severed cables damaged components and injured personnel damage control efforts including manual fire fighting and de watering are also modelled and interact with the fire and flooding modules to determine the capability of the vessel and ability of the crew to contain damage the irm tracks the supply and demand across all the modelled interconnected systems but measures operational performance for each capability through a ft this ft is usually set up by subject matter experts who determine which systems are required to perform an operational task irm also uses a unique modelling approach to model network behaviour that eliminates the need for traditional fts at the equipment level and it allows the impact of different system layouts and redundancy to be analyzed to determine their impact on the vessel s survivability foos and skahen 2008 this modelling approach uses the terms nodes edges and hive to define a vessel s systems structure components are nodes pipes and cables are edges and combined they are a hive each node is assigned behaviors that model the operational characteristics of the corresponding component such as a power panel having a power output capacity and a pump that has a flow capacity as shown in fig 13 these behaviors include requirements for services such as cooling fuel data and power and the capability to generate these services in addition to creating hives the model can track supply and demand for each of these components and determine when a shortage exists resulting in cascading failures and degradation in system performance r gregg fresa zackary r stull and waltham sajdak 2017 the compartment structure that the irm system model shares with the fire and flooding models allows the irm to determine exposure to the effects

according to generous reports concerning shipping costs fuel consumption accounts for 30 55 of the total vessel managing capital depending on the types of vessel brouer et al 2013 jang and choi 2016 like many other industries geertsma et al 2017 the shipping industry faces an enormous challenge in the last few years taking into account the rise of fuel prices and the great pressure to reduce its environmental impact yuan and ng 2017 lan et al 2015 zhang and wang 2013 therefore green vessels that partially or entirely use clean energy such as solar and wind power are needed but missing li et al 2015 essia et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 li et al 2012 sail assisted research has been a hot topic in the shipping industry due to the advantages of energy saving and being environmental friendly he et al 2015 in this paper we focus on improving the performance of hard sails and enhancing the energy efficiency of sail assisted vessels which are major problems to be solved in sail assisted navigation technology to improve energy conservation and reduce emissions sail assisted technologies have been rapidly developed recently he et al 2015 the existing mainstream sail can be divided into more than ten categories in terms of the sail shape and aerodynamic performance fujiwara et al 2005a there are several typical sails including square sails skysails magnus roll sails and wingsails skysails are limited in a very narrow wind direction range mainly relying on drag force he et al 2015 ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 dadd et al 2011 wind energy utilization efficiency of square sails is low magnus roll sails have high reliability and high costs and require additional power to rotate during navigation luyu et al 2010 sedaghat 2014 a wingsail is a variable camber aerodynamic structure that is fitted to a vessel in place of conventional sails in recent years the aerodynamic performance and stability of the wingsail are better than the conventional sails li et al 2015 he et al 2015 rynne and von ellenrieder 2010 referring to the multi wingsail ouchi et al 2013 viola et al 2015 lee et al 2016 ouchi et al 2013 employed numerical methods for examining its validity of the geometry structure and the aerodynamic performance to find the optimum solution for multi wingsail lee et al 2016 developed a design optimization framework by utilizing an evolutionary algorithm and the kriging surrogate model and its design results were validated through a three dimensional cfd analysis viola et al 2015 investigated the multi element rigid wingsails and found that those wingsails can generate higher lift force than curved plates now the most widely used wingsail is naca airfoil series designed by the national advisory committee for aeronautics cao et al 2016 referring to naca airfoil its aerodynamic performance precedes other sails and it has been applied in the fields of aviation and navigation for many years therefore we choose naca0018 as the original type of winger taking into account the wind from both sides of the vessel the arc shaped rigid sails are used as the base type which has a symmetrical shape nowadays sail assisted research has mostly concentrated on the study of the basic shape of the sails and their aerodynamic performance validation representative real example which arc shaped sail was used is the famous japanese eco ship shin aitoku maru fujiwara et al 2005b it demonstrates that the arc type sail can save fuel of 10 15 fujiwara et al 2005a however since the modern sailing study there is little optimization for the arc shaped rigid wingsail arc shaped sails are often used as the object of study but its applications are quite narrow the ultimate goal of wingsail optimization is to achieve maximum navigational efficiency and to minimize gas emissions the problem of wingsail optimization is rather challenging due to numerous geometrical parameters including trailing edge camber ratio and aspect ratio li et al 2015 presented a type of cascade sails by utilizing the sails considerable thrust force can be generated and investigated the aerodynamic performance using wind tunnel experiments generous studies including li et al 2015 focused on the multi sail performance optimization but omitted the single sail performance optimization problem jang and choi 2016 proposed a telescopic structure for hard sails and utilized wind power by employing multiple hard sails however jang and choi 2016 detailed little about the performance optimization of the hard sails della vecchia et al 2014 presented an optimization technique that composed of parsec parameterizations method and nash equilibrium genetic algorithm ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 employed adaptive parameterizations and genetic algorithm to resolve aerodynamic optimization of airfoils there are several problems with the sails in current studies for instance many studies have concentrated on the soft sail structures wherein their performance is not competent to fulfill the requirements of modern ocean going vessels furthermore when the sail assisted technologies are introduced into vessels the applications are mainly subject to several critical economic constraints including the manufacturing costs of the hard wingsails vessel maintenance costs and crew training costs consequently featured by low modification fee and flexible manipulation various hard wingsails are employed to achieve sail assisted driving for vessels it is imperative that much attention should be paid to wingsail optimization problem for the considerations of production cost and operational convenience we choose arc shaped sails as the basic form meanwhile we choose the airfoil as the edge to enhance the aerodynamic performance of hard sails following that we focus on the optimization of the wingsail from the perspective of coupling two different wingsails and then to examine our work by utilizing the actual shipping routing of sail assisted vessels some highlights of this paper are presented as below a new type of sail named coupled wingsail is designed for sail assisted vessels referring to our coupled wingsail its optimization is achieved by employing the parsec parametrization method and particle swarm optimization pso simulation results indicate that the maximum lift to drag ration of our wingsails has superiority over that of the arc shaped sail at least 10 furthermore to validate the validity of our coupled wingsails we scrutinize the economic benefits and the energy efficiency design index eedi of the sail assisted vessels intensively it can be found that the vessel equipped with coupled wingsails can significantly reduce eedi by 18 2 when compared with non sail vessels the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a parametrization for coupled wingsail and formulates the new designed wingsail model section 3 provides the model of coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization following that section 4 illustrates the sails performance verification section 5 calculates economic benefits and eedi of sail assisted vessel equipped with coupled airfoil sails finally section 6 concludes this paper 2 wingsail parametrization the aerodynamic characteristics of hard sails were investigated in many previous studies li et al 2015 as a representative of the early hard sails the traditional arc shaped sail is a symmetrical sail its profile is similar to streamline with good aerodynamic performance fujiwara et al 2005b the shape of the arc shaped sail determines its excellent maneuverability however its aerodynamic performance needs to be improved resulting from its lack of detailed streamlined contours to improve the aerodynamic performance airfoil theory is employed to

airfoil parametrization is critical for optimizing the airfoil which affects the camber of the final airfoil and the leading edge radius etc and determines the airfoil performance as stated in jamshid et al 1999 qian 2010 the parametrization techniques of airfoils can be separated into eight categories analytical basis vector mccart et al 1973 free form deformation ffd watt and watt 1992 domain element allen and rendall 2011 discrete partial differential equation pde polynomial spline and cad based representations xu et al 2014 naumann et al 2017 different from these methods sobieczky developed the parametric section airfoil parametrization parsec mukesh et al 2014 which is characterized by strict control over important aerodynamic features bedon et al 2016 chen et al 2013 its key idea is formulating the airfoil shape as an unknown linear combination of suitable base functions and selecting 12 important geometric characteristics of the airfoil as control variables following that the airfoil shape can be determined from these control variables by solving a linear system ahmed et al 2013 della vecchia et al 2014 fig 2 demonstrates the modified parsec variables definition taking into account the possibility of wind and sail from the left and right angles of the vessel we combine the traditional arc shaped sail with the naca 0018 airfoil to design a new type of wingsail it combines the geometric characteristics of airfoil and wingsail and also has a symmetrical characteristic of arc shaped sail therefore the vessel does not need to make a bigger structural change to install the sail the airfoil thickness changes in the chord length direction and the camber is adjusted so that the new airfoil has a maximum camber at 1 2 chord and keeps smooth della vecchia et al 2014 referring to the coupled wingsail there are 14 parameters adopted to depict its pattern by using modified parsec method as illustrated in fig 2 there are 14 parameters employed to completely define the profile geometry including the leading edge radius the upper lower crest locations curvatures trailing edge coordinate thickness trailing edge direction and wedge angle chord length c and camber f are also involved in the parametrization of the wingsail parsec analytical formulation is given in eq 4 4 z k i 1 6 a k i x k i 1 2 where x z are the shape coordinates and k denotes either the upper suction or lower pressure airfoil surface suppose a i represents the coefficient that can define the shape of the wingsail and it can be calculated by utilizing the 14 parameters listed in nomenclature related to performance of sails the equations are simple to be implemented to produce airfoil shapes through the issue with parsec generally the lift coefficient c l is mainly dependent on upper crest curvature the lower crest curvature the trailing edge offset in vertical sense and the trailing edge direction while the drag coefficient c d is mainly dependent on leading edge radius the trailing edge thickness and trailing edge wedge angle della vecchia et al 2014 to strengthen efficiency of wingsail architecture it is vital that the feasible boundaries of the parsec parameters should be provided ahmed et al 2013 della vecchia et al 2014 the upper and lower values for the parameters boundaries are shown in table 1 these boundaries have been selected based on a thorough screening study involving a statistical sample of a number of benchmark airfoils carrese and li 2015 3 coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization 3 1 model of coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization referring to the aerodynamic shape optimization problem poole et al 2015 an effective parametrization method should be proposed and the reasonable numerical aerodynamic model should be formulated many advanced technologies have been proposed for the airfoil and sail optimization problems a new type of ship propulsion assisted wing sail was proposed by li et al 2017 which tended to increase the propulsion efficiency by enlarging the wing sail area in the transverse and vertical directions when it comes to the optimization of the sail as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 parameters including the front wing angle a 1 the back wing angle a 2 the gap g 1 between main wing and front wing and the gap g 2 between front wing and back wing are set to represent the frame structure of the wingsail as shown in fig 4 in li et al 2017 the control variable method is adopted to solve the sail optimization problem since different combinations of the parameters for the double flap wingsails would significantly affect the aerodynamic performance of the sail and then the control variable method is utilized to solve the multi parameter optimization problem within the control variable method there is more than one parameter and parameters are varied one by one while all the other parameters would maintain unchanged following that generous results can be achieved under the variation of one certain parameter details can be referred to li et al 2017 however their optimized airfoils were generated from a certain number of parameter combinations and the number of combinations cannot guarantee the achievement of the optimal performance of the airfoils consequently to ensure that the sample size is enough to obtain the optimal solution we employ a method that combining parsec carrese and li 2015 with pso for the wingsail optimization the objective function of ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 was c l c d whereas in our research to converge faster in the wingsail optimization we set the power factor as our goal function and then to fulfill substantial reduction in energy consumption for the sail assisted vessels following that when it comes to the parsec method in the light of its flexible robust and efficient enough to cover the design space with a small number of design parameters section 2 utilizes the parsec method for the geometry parametrization of wingsails furthermore for coupling the aerodynamic shape optimization process we introduce a model that can derive efficient sets of airfoil design parameters the main research object of traditional airfoil optimization is the reynolds number r e in the order of magnitude 10 7 sub transonic aircraft airfoil within traditional airfoil optimization it generally tends to achieve large lift or large lift resistance ratio referring to the simulation and experimental issues for the vessels with wingsails the value of its r e is assessed based on the wind speed and the chord length it can be found in the experiment of li et al 2015 its wind speed was set to 8 m s and its r e was in 10 4 10 5 order similar to li et al 2015 we set the wind speed mainly around 8 m s as shown in eq 8 and then the r e can be in 10 4 10 5 order consequently it is practical to set power factor as the optimization target which is conducive to fulfill substantial reduction in energy consumption gopalarathnam et al 2003 suppose p and w represent the power and the quality of the object driven by the sail respectively then p can be 5 p w c d c l 3 2 2 ρ w s and p f can be 6 p f c l 3 2 c d following that when comes to multi point optimization of our coupled wingsails we aim to maximize the power factor p f the constraints including the performance constraints and the geometric performance are employed to determine the range of design variables referring to the performance constraints c l c d and c m are introduced to optimize the airfoil actively and fully the model with restrictions of coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization is shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 m a x p f α i v i 8 s t c l 3 2 0 93 c l α i v c l 0 c d α i v c d 0 c m m i n c m α i v c m m a x 15 α

airfoil distortion can be avoided 3 2 algorithm nomenclature related to pso algorithm j particle s index j t iteration number x j position of particle j v j velocity of particle j w inertia factor c p

with the global best fitness taking into account the large number of variables in the airfoil design the effectiveness of the algorithm can be measured as following conditions the potential algorithm should be qualified for dealing with problems with a large number of variables meanwhile the candidate algorithm excels in finding the global optimum for complex functions and processes properly with numerically generated data and then with the selected algorithm we can determine iteratively the shape modifications robustly the particle swarm optimization algorithm pso is employed to optimize the airfoil due to its simple and straightforward implementation and its efficient and accurate convergence rates it has a strong global optimal solution search ability and has strong adaptability to airfoil optimization research chehouri et al 2015 while the parsec method has the capability of relate airfoil definition in terms of design variables to aerodynamic performance on the other hand pso is well suited to solve airfoils design problem which consists of large number of variables the particles are represented by n dimensional vectors x j and v j which are the particle position and velocity respectively particles share experiences and follow the most successful particles to explore and exploit promising areas of the design space the jth particle of the swarm is accelerated towards its personal best position p b and the global best position g b of the swarm the updated position and velocity vectors at iteration number j t 1 are a resultant of these two components candon

solution by xfoil can be referred to sharafi and elmekkawy 2014 antunes et al 2009 firstly enter the calculation environment and introduce the airfoil coordinate data in the order of trailing edge leading edge trailing edge then enter the instructions into the viscous analysis and non sticky analysis the mach number m a reynolds number r e are given in the viscous analysis the angle of attack and the step size are given in the non viscous analysis finally lift resistance and other airfoil aerodynamic performance parameters can be obtained once the calculation is completed fig 5 presents the scheme of the optimization process 3 3 multi point optimization of coupled wingsail referring to wingsail optimization there are two types of methods one is single point optimization and another is multi point optimization single point optimization generally demonstrates a single aspect of the characteristics such as the speed optimum or the wind direction optimum poole et al 2015 there is no denying that by employing the single point of optimization performance of the airfoil can be enhanced in essence however when undergoing generous of uncertain sea conditions the sails would deviate from the design conditions and then its aerodynamic performance would be deteriorated dramatically multi point optimization refers to selecting a number of single points in a continuous design area and each point is assigned with corresponding weight to optimize the sails more comprehensively to fulfill the requirements of sailing of the sail assisted vehicles we employ the multi point optimization generally there is no standard for the selection of weight factors w e i g h t and their values are based on the researcher s requirements when comes to w e i g h t it depends on the wind environment applicable to sailing and the consideration of general sea conditions suppose o p t a and o p t b represent two multi point optimization schemes with different wind speeds v and weights w e i g h t then each multi point optimization scheme with 4 different wind speeds and weights are shown in table 2 the unit of v is m s suppose o p t n o and o p t s i n g l e represent the wingsail without optimization and with single point optimization respectively consequently by employing pso algorithm table 3 shows the optimized wingsails with single point optimization and multi point optimization methods results in table 3 illustrate that both the single point optimization and the multi point optimization have improved the airfoil power factor p f evidently p f of o p t s i n g l e increases by 17 meanwhile p f of the multi point optimized coupled wingsail o p t b is 106 increased by 25 04 related to the value of original coupled wingsail referring to the multi point optimization o p t b the values of its parameters r l e λ h α t e β t e z u p and z l o are 0 0049 1 4 0 15 0 19 0 15 0 054 and 0 05 respectively meanwhile compared with the initial wingsail o p t n o the sectional views of o p t n o and o p t b are illustrated in fig 6 a and fig 6 b respectively and the part drawings of o p t n o and o p t b are illustrated in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively within fig 6 it can be seen from the sectional view that the naca0018 which forms the coupling airfoil has a better extension and results in an increase of about 18 of the area affected by wind force as shown in fig 7 a and b the changes in the trailing edge are more favorable for the formation of the large lift and the middle of the coupled wingsail is thinner referring to the strength requirements of the sails modern wingsails are often made of carbon fiber for lightness and strength according to the pressure simulation of the carbon fiber material used in the wingsails by solidworks the optimized coupled wingsail fulfills the strength requirements quite well 4 performance verification of the optimized coupled wingsail to compare the aerodynamics of different sails in this section we calculate the lift and drag for arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail roundly 4 1 governing equations suppose t k and r represent thermodynamic temperature gas adiabatic index and gas constant respectively and the mach number m a can be 10 m a v k t r generally the wind velocity v of the vessel general sailing condition is less than 20 m s after calculating then reached m a 0 3 which can be treated as a low value consequently with low m a the simulation should employ ns equation navier stokes equations chong et al 2013 11 μ i x i 0 12 ρ μ i t ρ μ i μ j x j p x i x j μ μ i x j ρ μ i μ j where ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure mean μ is the dynamic viscosity μ i and μ j represent the rate of changes of the fluid flow rate μ i and μ j are the velocity fluctuations since the sst shear stress transport k ω turbulence model can achieve more accurate and reliable results it has been widely exploited in computational fluid dynamic simulations chong et al 2013 menter et al 1994 mao et al 2017 within sst k ω model wilcox et al 1998 its continuity equation is 13 ρ t ρ v 0 and momentum equation is 14 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g details of the model can be referred to menter et al 1994 wilcox et al 1998 mao et al 2017 therefore sst k ω model is employed as governing equations of the numerical simulation approach then the aerodynamic performance of two sail types can be obtained by employing cfd method 4 2 result of the performance verification considering the concrete situation of windsurfing applications numerical simulations under generous wind conditions are carried out to verify the aerodynamic performance the angle of attack ranges from 10 to 40 with a step 5 based on the wind directions available for sailing furthermore the setting process of the wingsails in the simulation has been presented as below setting process of the coupled wingsails in the simulation 1 import the wingsail model into flow simulation module that belongs to solidworks 2 suppose the flow field is the external flow field of the wingsails 3 air is selected as the external flow field of the wingsails 4 set the corresponding velocity and turbulence intensity of the airflow field 5 select the 2d computational domain for wingsails wherein the domain a cover the airfoils 6 present values of the global variables and set expressions for the local variables c l and c d 7 obtain the results by employing the embedded solver of the software tables 4 and 5 show the lift and drag forces of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail under generous angles of attack α with relative wind velocity v 10 m s fig 8 demonstrates the lift force f l versus the angle of attack α and the drag force f d versus α of the two types of sails under v 10 m s respectively in table 4 when α 10 the minimum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 24 37 and 25 14 respectively the maximum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 122 50 when α 15 and 147 8 when α 20 respectively in table 5 the minimum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 2 12 when α 10 and 4 25 when α 0 respectively when α 40 the maximum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 126 29 29 36 respectively as shown in fig 8 a the relationship between f l and α is positive if α is less than 0 and negative when α 20 the force f d is positively correlated with α as depicted in fig 8 b meanwhile table 6 and table 7 list the lift force and drag forces of the two types of sails under generous angles of attack α with v 15 m s respectively fig 9 demonstrate the lift force f l versus the angle of attack α and the drag force f d versus α of the two types of sails under v 15 m s respectively whereas in table 6 when α 10 the minimum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 26 93 27 06 respectively the maximum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 127 31 when α 20 and 130 when α 15 respectively in table 7 the minimum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 2 09 when α 5 and 2 80 when α 10 respectively the maximum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 176 when α 40 and 45 63 when α 35 respectively as shown in fig 9 a the relationship between f l and α is positive if α is less than 15 and negative when α 15 and in fig 9 b the drag force f d is positively correlated with α when α 10 fig 10 demonstrates f l f d of two types of sails under v 10 m s and v 15 m s respectively according to tables 4 and 6 when the relative wind speed v 10 m s switching to v 15 m s referring to the value variation of the wingsails lift force it can be found that there exist slight augment if the angle of attack α falls in 10 0 whereas exist sharp augment if 0 α 15 and exist slight decrease if 15 α 40 it can be found that the variation of the wind speed affects the fluctuation of the lift force of the coupled wingsail remarkably in general in tables 4 and 6 when v increasing the wingsail s lift force has a stable increasing while 0 α 15 the lift force has increased by 9 16 16 81 and 32 73 when α 5 α 10 and α 15 respectively when v 10 m s as α increasing the windward area of the naca0018 airfoil which is far from the wind has increased following that the area of the tail facing the wind becomes larger this phenomenon results in the loss of lift force f l and f l decreasing from 125 2 at α 0 to 97 94 at α 15 observably whereas when the wind speed evidently increasing from v 10 m s to v 15 m s this transformation achieves significant lift force gains to the entire coupled wingsail and then offsetting the force loss when v 10 m s consequently when the wind speed v 10 m s and 0 α 15 the value of the coupled wingsail s lift force is decreasing gradually and then reaching the minimum value 97 94 when α 15 whereas when v 15 m s and 0 α 20 all of the coupled wingsail s corresponding lift forces are larger than 124 and showing a rising tendency and the maximum value of the lift force is 130 at α 15 there is no denying that the above two aspects can contribute to the interpretation of the sharp value difference of the lift force when the relative wind speed v 10 m s switching to v 15 m s with the angle of attack α 15 as shown in fig 10 a when α 0 and v 10 m s the maximum f l f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 22 and 27 28 respectively and in fig 10 b the maximum f l f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 18 75 and 27 45 respectively consequently as illustrated in figs 8 a 9 a and 10 f l and f l f d of the coupled wingsails are larger than the values of the arc shaped sails observably in most situations when α 0 referring to the drag forces of the arc sail and the coupled sail it can be seen that their tendencies are close to each other however the f d of arc shaped sails has mutations when v 10 m s and v 15 m s as demonstrated in figs 8 b and fig 9 b when comes to the drag force f d compared with the arc shaped sails the coupled wingsails have a better aerodynamic performance and are more stable fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 demonstrate the pressure contours of coupled wingsail when α 10 α 20 and α 40 respectively referring to the details of the above three figures the red part represents the wind pressure in this region that is greater than the standard atmospheric pressure the blue part signifies its pressure in this region that is lower than the standard atmospheric pressure and the green part represents the pressure in this region that is approximate to the standard atmospheric pressure and the sail receives a smaller pressure the blue part indicates that the sail is less pressurized and has low navigational efficiency then the sail would not be applicable when α less than 10 or more than 40 as shown in fig 12 referring to the direction of the lift force with α 20 the coupled wingsail s corresponding pressure is greater than those of the other two cases with α 10 and α 40 through the aerodynamic optimization of the coupled wingsail the wind brings greater lift force to the airfoil as shown in fig 13 to ensure the performance of the airfoil hard sails in wind field it is sane to enhance the structural strength of the sails especially at the part of its middle 5 calculation of economic benefits and eedi of sail assisted vessel equipped with coupled wingsails the propulsion of the sail assisted vessel mainly consists of the propulsion power generated by the wingsails and the main engine power when sail assisted vessel is in the state of rated speed the sailing control system calculates the propulsion power generated by the wingsails to determine the main engine output power as shown in fig 14 with the increase in thrust provided by wingsails the main engine effective power p h is reduced correspondingly where v r is vessel speed v is wind speed p v is the total output power p s a i l is the power provided by sails as the wingsails thrust exceeds upper limit the main engine will enter the fixed load state since the main engine effective power has a lower limit p l as indicated by fig 14 if the main engine load is maintained at a high level the time of ventilation and gas mixing will be reduced in diesel engine increasing the exhaust gas within the cylinder leading to a poor combustion quality at this point co2 emissions of the main engine will increase as the sail assisted system is involved the propulsion power provided by the sail can effectively reduce the load on the main engine to enhance its effectiveness following that sail assisted system would reduce ship co2 emissions codan and huber 2012 to make the sail assisted system bear more loads from the main engine we optimize the aerodynamic performance of the wingsails in the above sections the effect of the energy saving and emission reduction of the sail assisted vessel equipped with coupled wingsails is calculated as follows 5 1 economic benefits to investigate the energy saving and emission reduction effect of the sail assisted vessels we propose 3 vessels equipped with 3 different wingsails assuming each vessel is equipped with the original coupled wingsail our optimized coupled wingsail and the sail proposed by li

23017,the shipping industry has valued wind energy in the last decades due to the global increasingly severe environmental situation the sail assisted vessels have employed generous types of sails to exploit wind energy and reduce the energy consumption to meet the ever increasing energy saving requirements of sail assisted vessels this paper investigates the hard sail design optimization and

according to generous reports concerning shipping costs fuel consumption accounts for 30 55 of the total vessel managing capital depending on the types of vessel brouer et al 2013 jang and choi 2016 like many other industries geertsma et al 2017 the shipping industry faces an enormous challenge in the last few years taking into account the rise of fuel prices and the great pressure to reduce its environmental impact yuan and ng 2017 lan et al 2015 zhang and wang 2013 therefore green vessels that partially or entirely use clean energy such as solar and wind power are needed but missing li et al 2015 essia et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 li et al 2012 sail assisted research has been a hot topic in the shipping industry due to the advantages of energy saving and being environmental friendly he et al 2015 in this paper we focus on improving the performance of hard sails and enhancing the energy efficiency of sail assisted vessels which are major problems to be solved in sail assisted navigation technology to improve energy conservation and reduce emissions sail assisted technologies have been rapidly developed recently he et al 2015 the existing mainstream sail can be divided into more than ten categories in terms of the sail shape and aerodynamic performance fujiwara et al 2005a there are several typical sails including square sails skysails magnus roll sails and wingsails skysails are limited in a very narrow wind direction range mainly relying on drag force he et al 2015 ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 dadd et al 2011 wind energy utilization efficiency of square sails is low magnus roll sails have high reliability and high costs and require additional power to rotate during navigation luyu et al 2010 sedaghat 2014 a wingsail is a variable camber aerodynamic structure that is fitted to a vessel in place of conventional sails in recent years the aerodynamic performance and stability of the wingsail are better than the conventional sails li et al 2015 he et al 2015 rynne and von ellenrieder 2010 referring to the multi wingsail ouchi et al 2013 viola et al 2015 lee et al 2016 ouchi et al 2013 employed numerical methods for examining its validity of the geometry structure and the aerodynamic performance to find the optimum solution for multi wingsail lee et al 2016 developed a design optimization framework by utilizing an evolutionary algorithm and the kriging surrogate model and its design results were validated through a three dimensional cfd analysis viola et al 2015 investigated the multi element rigid wingsails and found that those wingsails can generate higher lift force than curved plates now the most widely used wingsail is naca airfoil series designed by the national advisory committee for aeronautics cao et al 2016 referring to naca airfoil its aerodynamic performance precedes other sails and it has been applied in the fields of aviation and navigation for many years therefore we choose naca0018 as the original type of winger taking into account the wind from both sides of the vessel the arc shaped rigid sails are used as the base type which has a symmetrical shape nowadays sail assisted research has mostly concentrated on the study of the basic shape of the sails and their aerodynamic performance validation representative real example which arc shaped sail was used is the famous japanese eco ship shin aitoku maru fujiwara et al 2005b it demonstrates that the arc type sail can save fuel of 10 15 fujiwara et al 2005a however since the modern sailing study there is little optimization for the arc shaped rigid wingsail arc shaped sails are often used as the object of study but its applications are quite narrow the ultimate goal of wingsail optimization is to achieve maximum navigational efficiency and to minimize gas emissions the problem of wingsail optimization is rather challenging due to numerous geometrical parameters including trailing edge camber ratio and aspect ratio li et al 2015 presented a type of cascade sails by utilizing the sails considerable thrust force can be generated and investigated the aerodynamic performance using wind tunnel experiments generous studies including li et al 2015 focused on the multi sail performance optimization but omitted the single sail performance optimization problem jang and choi 2016 proposed a telescopic structure for hard sails and utilized wind power by employing multiple hard sails however jang and choi 2016 detailed little about the performance optimization of the hard sails della vecchia et al 2014 presented an optimization technique that composed of parsec parameterizations method and nash equilibrium genetic algorithm ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 employed adaptive parameterizations and genetic algorithm to resolve aerodynamic optimization of airfoils there are several problems with the sails in current studies for instance many studies have concentrated on the soft sail structures wherein their performance is not competent to fulfill the requirements of modern ocean going vessels furthermore when the sail assisted technologies are introduced into vessels the applications are mainly subject to several critical economic constraints including the manufacturing costs of the hard wingsails vessel maintenance costs and crew training costs consequently featured by low modification fee and flexible manipulation various hard wingsails are employed to achieve sail assisted driving for vessels it is imperative that much attention should be paid to wingsail optimization problem for the considerations of production cost and operational convenience we choose arc shaped sails as the basic form meanwhile we choose the airfoil as the edge to enhance the aerodynamic performance of hard sails following that we focus on the optimization of the wingsail from the perspective of coupling two different wingsails and then to examine our work by utilizing the actual shipping routing of sail assisted vessels some highlights of this paper are presented as below a new type of sail named coupled wingsail is designed for sail assisted vessels referring to our coupled wingsail its optimization is achieved by employing the parsec parametrization method and particle swarm optimization pso simulation results indicate that the maximum lift to drag ration of our wingsails has superiority over that of the arc shaped sail at least 10 furthermore to validate the validity of our coupled wingsails we scrutinize the economic benefits and the energy efficiency design index eedi of the sail assisted vessels intensively it can be found that the vessel equipped with coupled wingsails can significantly reduce eedi by 18 2 when compared with non sail vessels the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a parametrization for coupled wingsail and formulates the new designed wingsail model section 3 provides the model of coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization following that section 4 illustrates the sails performance verification section 5 calculates economic benefits and eedi of sail assisted vessel equipped with coupled airfoil sails finally section 6 concludes this paper 2 wingsail parametrization the aerodynamic characteristics of hard sails were investigated in many previous studies li et al 2015 as a representative of the early hard sails the traditional arc shaped sail is a symmetrical sail its profile is similar to streamline with good aerodynamic performance fujiwara et al 2005b the shape of the arc shaped sail determines its excellent maneuverability however its aerodynamic performance needs to be improved resulting from its lack of detailed streamlined contours to improve the aerodynamic performance airfoil theory is employed to

airfoil parametrization is critical for optimizing the airfoil which affects the camber of the final airfoil and the leading edge radius etc and determines the airfoil performance as stated in jamshid et al 1999 qian 2010 the parametrization techniques of airfoils can be separated into eight categories analytical basis vector mccart et al 1973 free form deformation ffd watt and watt 1992 domain element allen and rendall 2011 discrete partial differential equation pde polynomial spline and cad based representations xu et al 2014 naumann et al 2017 different from these methods sobieczky developed the parametric section airfoil parametrization parsec mukesh et al 2014 which is characterized by strict control over important aerodynamic features bedon et al 2016 chen et al 2013 its key idea is formulating the airfoil shape as an unknown linear combination of suitable base functions and selecting 12 important geometric characteristics of the airfoil as control variables following that the airfoil shape can be determined from these control variables by solving a linear system ahmed et al 2013 della vecchia et al 2014 fig 2 demonstrates the modified parsec variables definition taking into account the possibility of wind and sail from the left and right angles of the vessel we combine the traditional arc shaped sail with the naca 0018 airfoil to design a new type of wingsail it combines the geometric characteristics of airfoil and wingsail and also has a symmetrical characteristic of arc shaped sail therefore the vessel does not need to make a bigger structural change to install the sail the airfoil thickness changes in the chord length direction and the camber is adjusted so that the new airfoil has a maximum camber at 1 2 chord and keeps smooth della vecchia et al 2014 referring to the coupled wingsail there are 14 parameters adopted to depict its pattern by using modified parsec method as illustrated in fig 2 there are 14 parameters employed to completely define the profile geometry including the leading edge radius the upper lower crest locations curvatures trailing edge coordinate thickness trailing edge direction and wedge angle chord length c and camber f are also involved in the parametrization of the wingsail parsec analytical formulation is given in eq 4 4 z k i 1 6 a k i x k i 1 2 where x z are the shape coordinates and k denotes either the upper suction or lower pressure airfoil surface suppose a i represents the coefficient that can define the shape of the wingsail and it can be calculated by utilizing the 14 parameters listed in nomenclature related to performance of sails the equations are simple to be implemented to produce airfoil shapes through the issue with parsec generally the lift coefficient c l is mainly dependent on upper crest curvature the lower crest curvature the trailing edge offset in vertical sense and the trailing edge direction while the drag coefficient c d is mainly dependent on leading edge radius the trailing edge thickness and trailing edge wedge angle della vecchia et al 2014 to strengthen efficiency of wingsail architecture it is vital that the feasible boundaries of the parsec parameters should be provided ahmed et al 2013 della vecchia et al 2014 the upper and lower values for the parameters boundaries are shown in table 1 these boundaries have been selected based on a thorough screening study involving a statistical sample of a number of benchmark airfoils carrese and li 2015 3 coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization 3 1 model of coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization referring to the aerodynamic shape optimization problem poole et al 2015 an effective parametrization method should be proposed and the reasonable numerical aerodynamic model should be formulated many advanced technologies have been proposed for the airfoil and sail optimization problems a new type of ship propulsion assisted wing sail was proposed by li et al 2017 which tended to increase the propulsion efficiency by enlarging the wing sail area in the transverse and vertical directions when it comes to the optimization of the sail as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 parameters including the front wing angle a 1 the back wing angle a 2 the gap g 1 between main wing and front wing and the gap g 2 between front wing and back wing are set to represent the frame structure of the wingsail as shown in fig 4 in li et al 2017 the control variable method is adopted to solve the sail optimization problem since different combinations of the parameters for the double flap wingsails would significantly affect the aerodynamic performance of the sail and then the control variable method is utilized to solve the multi parameter optimization problem within the control variable method there is more than one parameter and parameters are varied one by one while all the other parameters would maintain unchanged following that generous results can be achieved under the variation of one certain parameter details can be referred to li et al 2017 however their optimized airfoils were generated from a certain number of parameter combinations and the number of combinations cannot guarantee the achievement of the optimal performance of the airfoils consequently to ensure that the sample size is enough to obtain the optimal solution we employ a method that combining parsec carrese and li 2015 with pso for the wingsail optimization the objective function of ebrahimi and jahangirian 2014 was c l c d whereas in our research to converge faster in the wingsail optimization we set the power factor as our goal function and then to fulfill substantial reduction in energy consumption for the sail assisted vessels following that when it comes to the parsec method in the light of its flexible robust and efficient enough to cover the design space with a small number of design parameters section 2 utilizes the parsec method for the geometry parametrization of wingsails furthermore for coupling the aerodynamic shape optimization process we introduce a model that can derive efficient sets of airfoil design parameters the main research object of traditional airfoil optimization is the reynolds number r e in the order of magnitude 10 7 sub transonic aircraft airfoil within traditional airfoil optimization it generally tends to achieve large lift or large lift resistance ratio referring to the simulation and experimental issues for the vessels with wingsails the value of its r e is assessed based on the wind speed and the chord length it can be found in the experiment of li et al 2015 its wind speed was set to 8 m s and its r e was in 10 4 10 5 order similar to li et al 2015 we set the wind speed mainly around 8 m s as shown in eq 8 and then the r e can be in 10 4 10 5 order consequently it is practical to set power factor as the optimization target which is conducive to fulfill substantial reduction in energy consumption gopalarathnam et al 2003 suppose p and w represent the power and the quality of the object driven by the sail respectively then p can be 5 p w c d c l 3 2 2 ρ w s and p f can be 6 p f c l 3 2 c d following that when comes to multi point optimization of our coupled wingsails we aim to maximize the power factor p f the constraints including the performance constraints and the geometric performance are employed to determine the range of design variables referring to the performance constraints c l c d and c m are introduced to optimize the airfoil actively and fully the model with restrictions of coupled wingsail aerodynamic performance optimization is shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 m a x p f α i v i 8 s t c l 3 2 0 93 c l α i v c l 0 c d α i v c d 0 c m m i n c m α i v c m m a x 15 α

airfoil distortion can be avoided 3 2 algorithm nomenclature related to pso algorithm j particle s index j t iteration number x j position of particle j v j velocity of particle j w inertia factor c p

should be qualified for dealing with problems with a large number of variables meanwhile the candidate algorithm excels in finding the global optimum for complex functions and processes properly with numerically generated data and then with the selected algorithm we can determine iteratively the shape modifications robustly the particle swarm optimization algorithm pso is employed to optimize the airfoil due to its simple and straightforward implementation and its efficient and accurate convergence rates it has a strong global optimal solution search ability and has strong adaptability to airfoil optimization research chehouri et al 2015 while the parsec method has the capability of relate airfoil definition in terms of design variables to aerodynamic performance on the other hand pso is well suited to solve airfoils design problem which consists of large number of variables the particles are represented by n dimensional vectors x j and v j which are the particle position and velocity respectively particles share experiences and follow the most successful particles to explore and exploit promising areas of the design space the jth particle of the swarm is accelerated

leading edge trailing edge then enter the instructions into the viscous analysis and non sticky analysis the mach number m a reynolds number r e are given in the viscous analysis the angle of attack and the step size are given in the non viscous analysis finally lift resistance and other airfoil aerodynamic performance parameters can be obtained once the calculation is completed fig 5 presents the scheme of the optimization process 3 3 multi point optimization of coupled wingsail referring to wingsail optimization there are two types of methods one is single point optimization and another is multi point optimization single point optimization generally demonstrates a single aspect of the characteristics such as the speed optimum or the wind direction optimum poole et al 2015 there is no denying that by employing the single point of optimization performance of the airfoil can be enhanced in essence however when undergoing generous of uncertain sea conditions the sails would deviate from the design conditions and then its aerodynamic performance would be deteriorated dramatically multi point optimization refers to selecting a number of single points in a continuous design area and each point is assigned with corresponding weight to optimize the sails more comprehensively to fulfill the requirements of sailing of the sail assisted vehicles we employ the multi point optimization generally there is no standard for the selection of weight factors w e i g h t and their values are based on the researcher s requirements when comes to w e i g h t it depends on the wind environment applicable to sailing and the consideration of general sea conditions suppose o p t a and o p t b represent two multi point optimization schemes with different wind speeds v and weights w e i g h t then each multi point optimization scheme with 4 different wind speeds and weights are shown in table 2 the unit of v is m s suppose o p t n o and o p t s i n g l e represent the wingsail without optimization and with single point optimization respectively consequently by employing pso algorithm table 3 shows the optimized wingsails with single point optimization and multi point optimization methods results in table 3 illustrate that both the single point optimization and the multi point optimization have improved the airfoil power factor p f evidently p f of o p t s i n g l e increases by 17 meanwhile p f of the multi point optimized coupled wingsail o p t b is 106 increased by 25 04 related to the value of original coupled wingsail referring to the multi point optimization o p t b the values of its parameters r l e λ h α t e β t e z u p and z l o are 0 0049 1 4 0 15 0 19 0 15 0 054 and 0 05 respectively meanwhile compared with the initial wingsail o p t n o the sectional views of o p t n o and o p t b are illustrated in fig 6 a and fig 6 b respectively and the part drawings of o p t n o and o p t b are illustrated in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively within fig 6 it can be seen from the sectional view that the naca0018 which forms the coupling airfoil has a better extension and results in an increase of about 18 of the area affected by wind force as shown in fig 7 a and b the changes in the trailing edge are more favorable for the formation of the large lift and the middle of the coupled wingsail is thinner referring to the strength requirements of the sails modern wingsails are often made of carbon fiber for lightness and strength according to the pressure simulation of the carbon fiber material used in the wingsails by solidworks the optimized coupled wingsail fulfills the strength requirements quite well 4 performance verification of the optimized coupled wingsail to compare the aerodynamics of different sails in this section we calculate the lift and drag for arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail roundly 4 1 governing equations suppose t k and r represent thermodynamic temperature gas adiabatic index and gas constant respectively and the mach number m a can be 10 m a v k t r generally the wind velocity v of the vessel general sailing condition is less than 20 m s after calculating then reached m a 0 3 which can be treated as a low value consequently with low m a the simulation should employ ns equation navier stokes equations chong et al 2013 11 μ i x i 0 12 ρ μ i t ρ μ i μ j x j p x i x j μ μ i x j ρ μ i μ j where ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure mean μ is the dynamic viscosity μ i and μ j represent the rate of changes of the fluid flow rate μ i and μ j are the velocity fluctuations since the sst shear stress transport k ω turbulence model can achieve more accurate and reliable results it has been widely exploited in computational fluid dynamic simulations chong et al 2013 menter et al 1994 mao et al 2017 within sst k ω model wilcox et al 1998 its continuity equation is 13 ρ t ρ v 0 and momentum equation is 14 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g details of the model can be referred to menter et al 1994 wilcox et al 1998 mao et al 2017 therefore sst k ω model is employed as governing equations of the numerical simulation approach then the aerodynamic performance of two sail types can be obtained by employing cfd method 4 2 result of the performance verification considering the concrete situation of windsurfing applications numerical simulations under generous wind conditions are carried out to verify the aerodynamic performance the angle of attack ranges from 10 to 40 with a step 5 based on the wind directions available for sailing furthermore the setting process of the wingsails in the simulation has been presented as below setting process of the coupled wingsails in the simulation 1 import the wingsail model into flow simulation module that belongs to solidworks 2 suppose the flow field is the external flow field of the wingsails 3 air is selected as the external flow field of the wingsails 4 set the corresponding velocity and turbulence intensity of the airflow field 5 select the 2d computational domain for wingsails wherein the domain a cover the airfoils 6 present values of the global variables and set expressions for the local variables c l and c

relative wind velocity v 10 m s fig 8 demonstrates the lift force f l versus the angle of attack α and the drag force f d versus α of the two types of sails under v 10 m s respectively in table 4 when α 10 the minimum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 24 37 and 25 14 respectively the maximum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 122 50 when α 15 and 147 8 when α 20 respectively in table 5 the minimum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 2 12 when α 10 and 4 25 when α 0 respectively when α 40 the maximum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 126 29 29 36 respectively as shown in fig 8 a the relationship between f l and α is positive if α is less than 0 and negative when α 20 the force f d is positively correlated with α as depicted in fig 8 b meanwhile table 6 and table 7 list the lift force and drag forces of the two types of sails under generous angles of attack α with v 15 m s respectively fig 9 demonstrate the lift force f l versus the angle of attack α and the drag force f d versus α of the two types of sails under v 15 m s respectively whereas in table 6 when α 10 the minimum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 26 93 27 06 respectively the maximum f l of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 127 31 when α 20 and 130 when α 15 respectively in table 7 the minimum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 2 09 when α 5 and 2 80 when α 10 respectively the maximum f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 176 when α 40 and 45 63 when α 35 respectively as shown in fig 9 a the relationship between f l and α is positive if α is less than 15 and negative when α 15 and in fig 9 b the drag force f d is positively correlated with α when α 10 fig 10 demonstrates f l f d of two types of sails under v 10 m s and v 15 m s respectively according to tables 4 and 6 when the relative wind speed v 10 m s switching to v 15 m s referring to the value variation of the wingsails lift force it can be found that there exist slight augment if the angle of attack α falls in 10 0 whereas exist sharp augment if 0 α 15 and exist slight decrease if 15 α 40 it can be found that the variation of the wind speed affects the fluctuation of the lift force of the coupled wingsail remarkably in general in tables 4 and 6 when v increasing the wingsail s lift force has a stable increasing while 0 α 15 the lift force has increased by 9 16 16 81 and 32 73 when α 5 α 10 and α 15 respectively when v 10 m s as α increasing the windward area of the naca0018 airfoil which is far from the wind has increased following that the area of the tail facing the wind becomes larger this phenomenon results in the loss of lift force f l and f l decreasing from 125 2 at α 0 to 97 94 at α 15 observably whereas when the wind speed evidently increasing from v 10 m s to v 15 m s this transformation achieves significant lift force gains to the entire coupled wingsail and then offsetting the force loss when v 10 m s consequently when the wind speed v 10 m s and 0 α 15 the value of the coupled wingsail s lift force is decreasing gradually and then reaching the minimum value 97 94 when α 15 whereas when v 15 m s and 0 α 20 all of the coupled wingsail s corresponding lift forces are larger than 124 and showing a rising tendency and the maximum value of the lift force is 130 at α 15 there is no denying that the above two aspects can contribute to the interpretation of the sharp value difference of the lift force when the relative wind speed v 10 m s switching to v 15 m s with the angle of attack α 15 as shown in fig 10 a when α 0 and v 10 m s the maximum f l f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 22 and 27 28 respectively and in fig 10 b the maximum f l f d of arc shaped sail and coupled wingsail are 18 75 and 27 45 respectively consequently as illustrated in figs 8 a 9 a and 10 f l and f l f d of the coupled wingsails are larger than the values of the arc shaped sails observably in most situations when α 0 referring to the drag forces of the arc sail and the coupled sail it can be seen that their tendencies are close to each other however the f d of arc shaped sails has mutations when v 10 m s and v 15 m s as demonstrated in figs 8 b and fig 9 b when comes to the drag force f d compared with the arc shaped sails the coupled wingsails have a better aerodynamic performance and are more stable fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 demonstrate the pressure contours of coupled wingsail when α 10 α 20 and α 40 respectively referring to the details of the above three figures the red part represents the wind pressure in this region that is greater than the standard atmospheric pressure the blue part signifies its pressure in this region that is lower than the standard atmospheric pressure and the green part represents the pressure in this region that is approximate to the standard atmospheric pressure and the sail receives a smaller pressure the blue part indicates that the sail is less pressurized and has low navigational efficiency then the sail would not be applicable when α less than 10 or more than 40 as shown in fig 12 referring to the direction of the lift force with α 20 the coupled wingsail s corresponding pressure is greater than those of the other two cases with α 10 and α 40 through the aerodynamic optimization of the coupled wingsail the wind brings greater lift force to the airfoil as shown in fig 13 to ensure the performance of the airfoil hard sails in wind field it is sane to enhance the structural strength of the sails especially at the part of its middle 5 calculation of economic benefits and eedi of sail assisted vessel equipped with coupled wingsails the propulsion of the sail assisted vessel mainly consists of the propulsion power generated by the wingsails and the main engine power when sail assisted vessel is in the state of rated speed the sailing control system calculates the propulsion power generated by the wingsails to determine the main engine output power as shown in fig 14 with the increase in thrust provided by wingsails the main engine effective power p h is reduced correspondingly where v r is vessel speed v is wind speed p v is the total output power p s a i l is the power provided by sails as the wingsails thrust exceeds upper limit the main engine will enter the fixed load state since the main engine effective power has a lower limit p l as indicated by fig 14 if the main engine load is maintained at a high level the time of ventilation and gas mixing will be reduced in diesel engine increasing the exhaust gas within the cylinder leading to a poor combustion quality at this point co2 emissions of the main engine will increase as the sail assisted system is involved the propulsion power provided by the sail can effectively reduce the load on the main engine to enhance its effectiveness following that sail assisted system would reduce ship co2 emissions codan and huber 2012 to make the sail assisted system bear more loads from the main engine we optimize the aerodynamic performance of the wingsails in the above sections the effect of the energy saving and emission reduction of the sail assisted vessel equipped with coupled wingsails is calculated as follows 5 1 economic benefits to investigate the energy saving and emission reduction effect of the sail assisted vessels we propose 3 vessels equipped with 3 different wingsails assuming each vessel is equipped with the original coupled wingsail our optimized coupled wingsail and the sail proposed by li et al 2015 respectively sail in li et al 2015 is a variable camber sail vcs which has a symmetrical shape to accommodate all wind directions without a slat the main parameters of the vessel are demonstrated in table 8 nomenclature related to sail assisted vessels l o a ship length l p p length between perpendiculars b molded breadth d molded depth t design draft c b block coefficient b t beam draft ratio p r rated power p a auxiliary power n t net tonnage d w t deadweight tonnage as shown in fig 15 we select 3 sailing routes as the object of energy saving calculations the first sailing route is from the strait of malacca to gaoxiong taiwan as denoted in fig 15 a from a to d the second sailing route is from tianjin china to dalian china as denoted in fig 15 b from a to b and the last sailing route is from wenzhou china to shanghai china as denoted in fig 15 c from a to b since the strait of malacca taiwan route has a longer distance l s of 1600 nmile 1 nmile 1 852 km the route is divided into 3 sections and the wind filed data of each section is also presented in table 9 according to the statistical data of climate atlas of chinese coastal waters and the western north pacific domrös and peng 2012 and quikscat scatterometer data in scow the scatterometer climatology of ocean winds risien and chelton 2008 table 10 presents the annual average wind direction frequency distribution of the last two routes table 11 lists the annual average wind scale frequency distribution of the last two routes in the last 30 years in table 9 wind direction β of the strait of malacca taiwan route is around 160 and wind velocity v increases from a to d as shown in tables 10 and 11 the distribution of wind power is similar to the normal distribution referring to the last two sailing routes its wind direction belongs to the region of chinese coastal within this region the northern wind and southern wind accounted for the majority suppose p w is the wind pressure a r e a is the sail area then the thrust provided by the sails can be 15 f p w a r e a the wind pressure data are obtained by cfd as shown in table 12 and the power provided by the sails for the vessel can be 16 w f v suppose the sail equipped vessel sailing at v r 13 kn 1 kn 1 852 km h then the propeller power and fuel consumption are varied with the thrust generated by the sail the main engine effective power p h and the main engine fuel consumption c s are shown in table 13 to facilitate the calculation of gained power brought by wingsails suppose p g is the power gained by the wingsails δ w v φ is the sails power with the wind speed v and wind direction φ q v φ is the wind frequency distribution function then p g can be 17 p g δ w v φ q v φ d v d φ suppose p v is the total output power ω is the energy saving effect and ω is the correction of ω respectively and ω can be 18 ω p g p v 100 the wingsail can generate large thrust for the sail assisted vessels however there is no denying that during the voyage the accompanying sideways force would generate the angle of heel and the angle of yaw toward the sail assisted vessels and then increasing the hull resistance δ r wherein δ r q ψ 2 r r 0 cos 2 σ and q is the effect coefficient of angle of yaw ψ is the angle of yaw σ is the angle of heel r r 0 represent the hull resistance without ψ and σ furthermore referring to the sail assisted vessels when equipped with the sail to offset effects brought by the yaw moment it is necessary to increase its rudder angle to maintain the original heading meanwhile the generated additional rudder resistance δ p can be 0 5 ρ ω v 2 a r 1 τ 2 1 3 6 γ 1 5 sin 2 δ 6 13 a 0 a 0 2 25 wherein ρ ω is the density of the seawater τ is the wake fraction γ is the slip ratio δ is the rudder angle and a 0 is the rudder area it can be identified from eq 15 and eq 16 when taking into account the correction of ω the power provided by the sails for the vessel can be 19 w p w a r e a δ r δ p v and after the correction p g can be 20 p g δ w v φ q v φ d v d φ consequently ω after the correction can be 21 ω p g p v 100 following that table 14 shows the resultant corresponding power saving rate ω of o p t n o table 15 shows the ω of optimized coupled wingsail and table 16 shows the ω of vcs respectively in table 14 the original coupled wingsails system can reduce the fuel consumption by 20 00 at the strait malacca taiwan route 18 75 at tianjin dalian route and 16 1 at wenzhou shanghai route respectively whereras in table 15 the optimized coupled wingsails system can reduce the fuel consumption by 21 16 at the strait malacca taiwan route 20 13 at tianjin dalian route and 17 6 at wenzhou shanghai route respectively in table 16 when sailing at the strait malacca taiwan route the ω of vcs is 17 71 18 30 at tianjin dalian route and 15 67 at wenzhou shanghai route respectively ω of the optimized coupled wingsail increased by at least 10 when compared to vcs the optimized coupled wingsails system has more economic benefits than that of original coupled wingsails and vcs the analysis and calculation results show that the wind resource on the tianjin dalian route and the strait of malacca taiwan route are more stability than that on the wenzhou shanghai route the energy saving benefits may be furthermore improved in a stable wind condition 5 2 eedi for sailing system nomenclature related to

different ship types vary in their co 2 emissions in table 17 it indicates that the values of eedi are 3 80 before sail optimization and 3 10 after coupled sail optimization and 3 22 with vcs respectively as listed in table 15 the eedi of the vessel equipped with the coupled wingsails decreased by 18 2 when compared to a non sails vessel 6 conclusions and future work in this paper a new coupled wingsail based on naca airfoil and arc shaped sail is proposed the modified parsec method is employed to define the shape of a wingsail using 14 decision variables considering the practical application of sail equipped vessels we employ the power factor as the objective function and the aerodynamic performance of the designed coupled wingsail is optimized by pso and the following conclusions can be reached firstly according to cfd simulation the power factor of the optimized coupled wingsail is 25 04 higher than that of the initial coupled wingsail after the multi point optimization furthermore the optimized coupled wingsail has around 30 aerodynamic performance improvement than that of the arc shaped sail finally to validate the contribution of coupled wingsail in reducing greenhouse gas emissions we calculate the eedi of the two kinds of sails and results demonstrate that the vessel equipped with coupled wingsails can reduce eedi by 18 2 when compared to non sails vessel the above studies validate the effectiveness of our coupled wingsail and in the future we would construct the coupled wingsail system to put it into operation furthermore the environmental uncertainty and the sailing routes selection would be modeled in our sail assisted vessel a stochastic optimization model would be formulated to resolve above proposed issues reasonably

23018,offshore wind turbines are of special interest due to their growing importance and hence comprehensively discussed in this research three popular offshore wind turbine airfoil geometries s822 s825 and sd7062 are studied in this research considering entropy generation there is no similar work in literature considering entropy generation around these offshore wind turbine airfoils computations performed for five different angles of attack 0 5 10 15 and 20 at re 106 viscous entropy generation rate is reported as contour plots and the effect of flow separation on entropy generation is studied it is shown that flow separation has a dramatic effect on viscous entropy generation rate the grows of separation area in the higher angle of attack produces more entropy due to larger shear layer region moreover it is observed that there is a close relation between entropy generation integral irreversibilities and drag coefficient finally second low efficiency is also computed for examined airfoils at the mentioned angle of attack range to compare their effectiveness focusing on the entropy generation in offshore wind turbine blades is essential and useful for designing and achieving a good aerodynamic performance at the offshore wind turbine airfoil the results of simulation revealed that there are no significant differences between the entropy generation rates of the investigated airfoils for the angles of attack of less than 10 but the sd7062 airfoil has the lowest entropy generation rate at larger angles of attack due to the delay in the flow separation also the results of the second law efficiency indicated that the s825 airfoil has the best performance at the angles of attack of less than 10 whilst the sd7062 airfoil has the best performance at the angles of attack of greater than 10 graphical abstract contours of local entropy generation rate for the s825 s822 and sd7062 offshore wind turbine airfoils at angle of attack 20

force us to use renewable energy sources among all renewable energy sources solar and wind have attracted more attention our country is so wealthy with respect to wind energy resources novosel et al 2015 investigated the feasibility of the wind energy to produce fresh water address for the jordanian climate hameed and afaq 2013 investigated to design and optimize the blade of darrieus vertical axis wind turbine they used analytical and numerical techniques blade design parameter and dimensions determined and aerodynamic forces on blade in complete rotation calculated oguz et al 2018 described an experimental and numerical investigation using the software tests included free oscillation tests tests in regular and irregular waves and simulated wind conditions the results of free oscillation tests are provided with a comparison of the numerical predictions and experimental measurements of the natural periods for surge and pitch zhao et al 2018 developed a simulation tool for single blade installation for the onshore wind turbine they studied the effect of wind turbulence and dynamic stall the characteristics of responses prior to mating the blade onto the hub are studied they are shown that the blade motions are dominated by the pendulum motion ren et al 2018 developed an open source object oriented simulation verification blade installation modeling toolbox targeting the design and analysis of automation and control functions marčiukaitis et al 2017 studied wind turbine power curve modeling with a non linear regression model d alessandro et al d alessandro et al 2017 used openfoam software to investigate aerodynamics performance of some airfoils used in wind turbines including e387 and s827 and wt2 and ffa w3 211 and recommended coupled approach of γ reθ t technique and spalart allmaras turbulent model for laminar to turbulent transition model wang et al 2017a studied the aerodynamic performance of the nrel s809 airfoils which are used in large wind turbines using ansys fluent software they used vortex generators in this airfoil and demonstrated that the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil and control of flow separation enhance koca et al 2018 performed smoke wire experiment to visualize the laminar separation bubble lsb over the naca4412 airfoil at low reynolds numbers the results of this group indicated that reynolds number and angle of attack affect the location and formation of lsb in addition mean and rms velocities revealed that lsb and trailing edge separation affects the flow characteristics near wake region here some major scientific reviews based on optimization of the engineering equipment are presented focusing on the effects of viscosity on the entropy generation the current knowledge related to entropy generation in engineering systems goes back to clausius and kelvin research on the second law of thermodynamics since then this knowledge has been developed a lot and now entropy analysis is used in most engineering productions mahmud and fraser 2003 in different problems the processes associated with heat transfer fluid viscosity flow turbulence mass transfer and combustion are sources that generate entropy bejan was the first scholar who studied entropy generation sources in engineering systems and quantified entropy generation bejan 1979 1980 since the entropy generation is equivalent to the loss of work its accurate measurement in engineering systems can be a more appropriate criterion for studying their performance indeed the first pioneering research in optimization based on the second law of thermodynamics known as the entropy generation minimization egm was carried out by bejan himself on pipe and duct flows which is one of the most applicable method used in engineering equipment bejan 1979 the entropy generation analysis on the gas turbine blades carried out by zeinalpour and mazaheri 2015 they presented a complete continuous adjoint formulation to optimize the turbulent flow entropy generation rate through a turbine cascade they redesigned the shape of a turbine cascade blade and made some schemes to enhance the blade performance sousa and paniagua 2015 introduced a design methodology for supersonic turbine blades based on direct evaluations of the velocity field using the method of characteristics and computation of entropy generation across shock waves regarding the fact that the shock wave is the most important factor in entropy generation of the supersonic turbines hence they designed the blade profile for the lowest entropy generation case they coupled their method with an optimization scenario to minimize the entropy generation across the supersonic passage generally the entropy or irreversibility sources in most engineering equipment are divided into two parts the first part is related to heat transfer while the second part is related to the viscosity bejan 1979 1980 it is noteworthy to mention that the effects of mass transfer and chemical reactions are also of high interest in their related matters investigations reported in the previous paragraphs focused on the entropy generation due to the heat transfer and often ignored the effects of viscosity however the role of heat transfer can be discarded in many engineering equipment in comparison with viscosity effects among these items of equipment wing and fuselage of the airplanes fans and wind turbines can be exemplified li et al li and figliola 2004 li et al 2006 designed and optimized shapes of a two dimensional airfoil and various three dimensional wing planforms to minimize the viscous entropy generation number their exergy based optimization was conducted on the laminar flow li and figliola 2004 and turbulent flow li et al 2006 they studied the viscous entropy generation and its relationship with total and induced drag for different twisted shapes using computational fluid dynamics then the geometry was modified to minimize entropy generated in the flow field and maximize lift drag ratio under laminar and turbulent flow conditions the results of this group determined a relationship between the generated entropy with drag lift ratio for the two dimensional airfoil and the total and induced drag coefficients for the three dimensional wings sun et al 2005 implicitly calculated the entropy generated through a three dimensional wind turbine blade cross section by calculating the useful work difference applied on the blade and integrating the fluid energy loss through this selected control volume it should be noted that their method is based on the integral method and can only calculate integral of the generated entropy through the blade therefore unlike the method introduced by bejan used in this study they only calculated the integral of entropy and its distribution was unknown based on this method they corrected profile of the blade by the non uniform rational b splines nurbs curve and calculated the optimal shape for the lowest entropy generation rate sahin et al 2006 introduced a new efficiency formula to define the performance of wind turbines based on the concept of exergy exergy can be interpreted as the maximum theoretical work that can be achieved from a system stream or substance in order to reach a state of equilibrium with the environment in exergy analysis the mass and energy balance equations and second law of thermodynamics are used to design or improve the performance of energy systems unlike energy exergy is not conserved and is destructed through a control volume depending on the amount of irreversibility in the system therefore the amount of exergy destroyed in a system is proportional to its entropy generation rate they demonstrated that the average differences between energy and exergy efficiencies in a typical wind turbine are approximately 40 at low wind speeds and up to 55 at high wind speeds monsch et al 2007 optimized the wing shapes and wing lift distribution for different aircraft flight mission segments within a design framework to have an optimal distribution using the egm and their previous geometry correction method they determined the relationship between the entropy generation with total and induced drag for several twisted wing geometries in both inviscid euler and viscous flow regimes their results showed that the viscous drag can be predicted with great accuracy when the entropy generation is used behzadmehr and mercadier 2009 numerically studied the flow field and viscous entropy generation on a backward inclined centrifugal fan using 3 d elliptic governing equations they simulated the entire geometry of the fan by considering fixed and moving blades using fluent ansys their results indicated that the viscous entropy generation contours contain very useful information for specifying regions with the highest contribution to hydrodynamic losses regarding this fact they found that the distance between the entrance region and the blade passage has a great influence on the hydrodynamic losses they found that using gap with radial clearance creates less entropy than one without the radial clearance therefore the irreversibilities can be properly reduced by using a logarithmic shape for the blade profile at the blade passage cross section ahmadi and ehyaei 2009 carried out exergy analysis of a typical wind turbine model installed in tehran they concluded that by decreasing the cut in rated and furling speeds from 3 1 m s 13 8 m s and 15 6 m s to 2 53 m s 11 m s and 12 43 m s with regard to the annual average wind data for tehran respectively the annual average output electricity will be increased by approximately 20 while the entropy generation will be reduced by approximately 76 9 pope et al 2010 studied two types of horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines using relations of energy and exergy analysis introduced by sahin et al 2006 their results showed that the exergy analysis provides much more unique insight than the energy analysis and is far more efficient design tool than energy analysis for wind power development shehata et al 2014 compared performance of four symmetric airfoils of naca0015 naca0012 naca0020 and naca0021 through a rigorous numerical study using entropy generation analysis it should be noted that their goal was to study the entropy generation due to viscous dissipation around a wells turbine blade in this case the air displaced by coastal waves reached to the well turbine blades by a channel causing the blades to rotate and generate power the most significant difference between the well turbines with the conventional wind turbines is the standard design consists of several symmetrical airfoil blades positioned around a hub of well turbines hence well turbines produce electrical power in both processes of the pressure wave collision and suction return wave their numerical calculations showed that the entropy generation around the naca0015 airfoil blade is approximately 12 lower than that of the naca0012 naca0020 and naca0021 airfoils for flows achieving 10 angle of attack mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 examined the exergetic performance of three different national renewable energy laboratory nrel airfoil families for wind turbine application for this purpose they used a two dimensional incompressible unsteady numerical solver considering the effects of turbulent flow around the airfoils in their study they investigated reynolds numbers in the range of 105 106 and attack angles of 0 20 they classified the selected airfoils by presenting variation of exergy efficiency versus angle of attack at different reynolds numbers it should be noted that the method used in their research also had the same nature as that presented by sun et al 2005 this simply implies that the calculated efficiency had an integral form therefore their method is not able to compute the local entropy generation rate and only provides its integral form within the control volume in other words we cannot explicitly specify the main reason behind the superiority of the airfoil in this study we plan to answer this question using viscous entropy generation number soltanmohamadi and lakzian 2015 analyzed the 3 d wells turbine blade using viscous entropy generation number wells turbines are high efficient devices that absorb water wave energy and convert it to pneumatic energy in the air this tool is first introduced by wells et al in 1976 and commonly known as a self rectifying air turbine they eventually demonstrated the superiority of their design case using the viscous entropy generation concept it should be noted that in the present study the method used by soltanmohamadi and lakzian 2015 which is as same as the bejan s methodology is used to analyze wind turbine blades also in 2016 lakzian et al 2016 investigated on the wells turbine blades using entropy generation analysis moreover in 2018 nazeryan and lakzian 2018 investigated the effect of the wells turbine blades thickness by the means of entropy generation zidanea et al 2017a 2017b studied the effect of cleanliness and sand in the air and its effect on the aerodynamic performance of airfoil naca63415 at reynolds number of 460 103 with numerical methods they found that sandstorms reduce the lift coefficient up to 28 li et al 2017 2018 examined the impact of dust drift on the erosion of wind turbine blades s809 at the sand atmosphere they studied the impact of the stokes number on erosion of the airfoils and discovered that increasing the stokes number will increase erosion of the airfoil and its angle of attack marzuki et al 2018a examined effect of the surface roughness on a magnus wind turbine they realized that increasing the roughness of surface can improve performance of the magnus wind turbines sogukpinar and bozkurt 2017 numerically studied the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil s825 used in wind turbines they carried out their research at reynolds numbers 106 and 2 106 and angles of attack 6 to 10 they used the navier stokes equations and the k ω sst turbulence model rasekh et al 2018 examined the aerodynamic performance of a number of s type airfoils s814 s815 and s825 at the reynolds number 106 they also used the navier stokes equations and the k ω sst turbulence model they conducted their examination at the stable mode with angles of attack 0 30 and at unstable mode with oscillatory frequencies of 0 03 and 0 089 hasan et al 2017 numerically analyzed several airfoils applicable to the wind turbines including s822 s823 and s833 they examined their model using the k ω sst turbulence model at reynolds number of 230 000 and angles of attack of 40 to 40 wang et al 2017b improved the airfoil s809 aerodynamic performance using flow control devices they used computational fluid dynamics to solve the navier stokes equations and the k ω sst turbulence model at the reynolds number 106 and the angles of attack 0 25 zidane et al zidanea et al 2016 studied the performance of wind turbines in the saharan environment they declared that sand storms increase the aerodynamic resistance of wind turbines since the blade surface roughness augments marzuki et al 2018b examined the impact of surface roughness of the magnus wind turbine they realized that increasing the surface roughness can improve performance of the magnus wind turbine in this paper investigation is carried out by assuming a smooth surface with a low roughness which is due to the newness of the airfoil in the present study the local viscous entropy generation rate is calculated for three offshore wind turbines airfoils i e s822 s825 and sd7062 in the turbulent flow regime in fig 1 a the offshore wind turbine is depicted and in fig 1 b the schematic of the offshore wind turbine is shown lin et al 2018 since the bejan s entropy generation equation is used the local distribution of entropy generation is observable and the role of each point of the flow field in the irreversibility is predictable in addition correlation of the integral entropy generation irreversibilities and the drag coefficient is investigated which is the main novelty of the present study to achieve a more precise description the effects of five angles of attack including 0 5 10 15 and 20 on the entropy generation are investigated it should be noted that the entropy generation analysis around the offshore wind turbine airfoils using the bejan s entropy generation relations is not studied up to now and the present study is the first one 2 problem description in this study the turbulent and transition flows around three offshore wind turbine airfoils s822 s825 and sd7062 in re 106 based on flow conditions at the inlet and airfoil chord have been studied fig 2 illustrates profile of the selected airfoils these airfoils are very common in the current wind turbines and are used in many wind turbines construction the present paper outlines the result of the first part of our wind turbine construction project therefore selection of reynolds number is objective and is based on the most important reynolds numbers observed in our wind turbine many scholars have already used this airfoil and reynolds number karthikeyan et al 2015 tarhan and yilmaz 2016 bo et al 2015 gross and fasel 2012 as it is seen it has been tried to select airfoils with the highest geometric differences among different profiles used in turbine blades the simulations were carried out at five attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 to investigate the effects of angle of attack and flow separation on the viscous entropy generation in order to see the effects of the angle of attack the interval of 5 was chosen the entropy generation rate is measured locally and its results are presented in terms of contours and profiles also relation between the entropy generation and drag coefficient is determined by extracting the curve fitting on their graphs finally the exergy efficiency for all airfoils at different angles of attack is calculated and reported 3 governing equations in this study the unsteady reynolds averaging navier stokes urans method is used for turbulent simulation of the two dimensional and unsteady flow in order to reduce the computational cost to avoid extending over the equations only the averaged form of the governing equations will be presented davidson 2013 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 continuity equation 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i μ 2 u i x j ρ u i u j f i the above equations along with the turbulent model equations constitute the set of equations that must be analyzed to simulate turbulent flow in this research the k ω sst shear stress transport turbulent model was used to simulate the effects of turbulent flow according to sayed et al 2012 this model has great ability to capture the effects of various factors such as free flow disturbance and pressure gradient that are effective in structure of the flow transition in the present study due to the importance of entropy generation in the wake region there was a need for a model that would accurately predict not only the aerodynamic coefficients but also predict the flow structures in the wake region therefore the k ω sst turbulence model is chosen due to its high ability to release vortices and to simulate transient flow structures in the wake region many scholars have already used this method of turbulence gharali and johnson 2012 yao et al 2012 the equations are as follows

pressure gradient and flow separation davidson 2013 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to calculate the local viscous entropy generation rate in turbulent flow the following equation has been used herwig and kock 2007 kock and herwig 2004 12 s g e n μ μ t t 0 2 u i x i 2 u i x j u j x i ρ ε t 0 in a two dimensional case it is written as follows 13 s g e n μ e f f t 0 2 u x 2 v y 2 u x v y ρ ε t 0 in which effective viscosity is equal to sum of the fluid and turbulent viscosities μ e f f μ μ t and t0 is the reference temperature accordingly integral of the generated entropy or total entropy is calculated as follows 14 s c v s g e n d v the irreversibility or exergy destruction can be related to the generated entropy as follows 15 i t 0 s g e n where for two dimensional case it is obtained as follows 16 i μ e f f 2 u x 2 v y 2 u x v y ρ ε the second law efficiency also known as exergy efficiency is ratio of the useful work to the free flow exergy losses therefore the exergy efficiency is defined as follows 17 ψ w o u t w o u t t 0 s g e n where wout is calculated as follows 18 w o u t f l v y in which fl is the lift applied to the airfoil and vy is the vertical component of the mean velocity on the imaginary line at a very short distance from the airfoil surface herwig and kock 2007 kock and herwig 2004 4 numerical method the governing equations are used for incompressible and unsteady fluid flow and the two dimensional geometry is simulated using segregated and implicit and absolute velocity formulation solver simple algorithm is chosen to couple the pressure and momentum equations the second order upwind finite difference method has been used as a discretization method 5 grid resolution study in this section the grid resolution study for s825 airfoil is investigated since some appropriate experimental and numerical data are available in literature fig 3 illustrates the generated grid for the present study to simulate the flow around this airfoil as it can be seen the computational grid is clustered toward the airfoil from four different sides to study the grid resolution study four grids with dimensions of 25433 62499 110325 and 196769 have been used the number of nodes created on the airfoil s perimeter for the prescribed grids were 100 250 390 and 450 respectively fig 4 show the drag and lift coefficients for these selected grids at different attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 it should be noted that the reynolds number of the fluid stream is assumed 106 it is observed that for angle of attack less than 10 the second computational grid 62499 cells is appropriate and increasing cluster of the grid has no significant effect on the results however for angles of attack at the commencement of flow separation or larger than this value the sensitivity of the aerodynamic coefficients has been increased and grid resolution study for the third grid 110325 cells has been achieved according to these results the third grid 110325 cells has been used for other simulations it is noteworthy to mention that the dimensions and sizes used in this grid are also applied to other considered airfoil geometries too as it is known one of the requirements for using the k ω sst turbulent model is y 1 fig 5 shows variation of this quantity through the airfoil surface along with the s825 airfoil geometry as it can be seen the generated grid completely fulfills this requirement 6 model validation to ensure the validity of the conducted simulations the results are compared with the available numerical and experimental data in the literature fig 6 the results of mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 have been used as numerical data while the results of wind tunnel of the langley research institute of nasa airfoil data and availa 2013 airfoil families for 1995 have been used as experimental data which are extracted from mortazavi and sobhgahi study similar to the graphs of fig 4 the aerodynamic drag and lift coefficients are presented at different attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 and re 106 as shown the lift coefficient curves for the present study and those of mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 are in good agreement with experimental data compared to the drag coefficient curves the main reason behind this trend can be smallness of the drag coefficient and its greater sensitivity to the boundary layer structure and turbulent modeling in addition it can be seen that the deviation between numerical and experimental results increases with an increase in the angle of attack and flow separation also it can be seen that despite the difference between numerical and experimental results the numerical results of the present study have less error than those of mortazavi and sobhgahi tables 1 and 2 present the error percentage of the drag and lift coefficients of the present study and mortazavi sobhgahi mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 with the results of nasa langley airfoil data and availa 2013 airfoil families for 1995 respectively as it can be seen in table 2 the error in computation of lift coefficient at various angles of attack is less than 7 which indicates the high accuracy of the present results however the error percentage in drag coefficients is higher in comparison with the lift coefficients which can be due to its high sensitivity and low values nevertheless the computed results can be verified with those of mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 7 results and discussion in this section the results of the simulations are presented in this regard fig 7 shows the pressure coefficient contours for the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 as can be seen the pressure coefficient is approximately equal to 1 at the stagnation point of the airfoil and decreases thereafter as fluid flow accelerates through the lower and upper surfaces of the airfoil the pressure drop continues to the point where the airfoil thickness reaches to its maximum value and increases thereafter the pressure augmentation is known as adverse or inverse pressure gradient which is the main cause of flow separation from surface of the airfoil increasing the angle of attack increases the reverse pressure gradient at the suction side of the airfoil and eventually leads to the flow separation from the surface as fig 7 b indicates the flow separation causes a significant pressure drop in suction side of the airfoil however the low pressure region takes some distances from the airfoil and is not formed on its surface fig 8 shows the pressure coefficient profile on the surface of the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 as can be seen the pressure gradient between the suction and pressure sides increases at the angle of attack 20 and beginning of the separation point which will result in a significant increase in the airfoil drag coefficient as pointed out the adverse pressure gradient at suction side of the airfoil results in the flow separation the flow separation increases the thickness of the shear layer at the wake region this means that the thickness of the wake region will be increased also it is observed that the pressure gradient between two sides of the airfoil is severely increased resulting in a dramatic increase in the drag coefficient in the following sections we plan to determine the relationship between thickness of the shear layer and the drag coefficient with the entropy generation regarding the relation of the local entropy generation rate eq 12 it is observed that the local entropy generation in this problem depends on two factors of strain rate and eddy viscosity thus the contours of these two quantities for the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 are shown in figs 9 12 respectively these figures indicate that both strain rate and eddy viscosity have the same behavior and have high value at the shear layer formed in the wake region it was expected that the eddy viscosity would be higher in areas with a high strain rate which is mainly due to the fact that the turbulent kinetic energy generation rate depends on the strain rate according to these explanations it is clear that the strain rate is the most important factor in generating local entropy in the present problem to determine the effects of the airfoil geometry on the local entropy generation the local entropy generation profiles at 0 001c from the surface are displayed for various airfoils at three attack angles of 0 10 and 15 in fig 13 it should be noted that the red lines represent the pressure side and the black lines represent the suction side of the blade as it can be seen the effects of different geometries of the s825 airfoil at angle of attack 0 were clearly characterized by two distinct peak points one on the suction surface and another on the pressure surface the main reason behind this phenomenon is the acceleration of the fluid flow near the points x c 0 5 and x c 0 35 on the suction and pressure sides which has increased the local strain rate in these areas therefore at angle of attack zero despite the fact that the s822 and sd7062 airfoils have the maximum local entropy generation at the leading edge the s825 airfoil has the highest local entropy generation rate near the middle of the chord as fig 13 b and c indicate increasing the angle of attack moves region of the maximum local entropy generation towards the leading edge for all airfoils this clearly shows that the geometry of the leading edge of the airfoils plays a significant role in irreversibility generation therefore it is expected that this region will be more important in designing offshore wind turbine blade profiles it is also found that at the angle of attack zero the sd7062 airfoil has the highest local entropy generation at the leading edge however as angle of attack increases and flow separated from the surface almost the symmetrical s822 airfoil will have the highest local entropy generation fig 14 shows the local entropy generation rate contours for the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 according to the graphs of this figure it is clear that the shear layer formed in the wake region of the airfoil is the most important source of local entropy generation in this problem therefore at zero angle of attack that the fluid flow is securely attached to the surface of the airfoil the shear region is very narrow and the local entropy generation rate is minimum however the shear layer is thickened behind the airfoil as angle of attack increases and fluid flow separated from the airfoil suction surface and hence significant local entropy is generated in the wake region therefore it can be expected that by increasing the angle of attack and thickening the wake region more local entropy will be generated to compare the behavior of different airfoils towards the local entropy generation the contours of the local entropy generation rate for the s822 s825 and sd7062 airfoils at attack angles between zero and 20 are presented in fig 15 according to these figures the following conclusions can be made the first point which must be noted is that the largest local entropy generation occurs within the boundary layer to illustrate this fact a part of the boundary layer is displayed in a magnified form as it can be observed the maximum value of local entropy generation occurs in the boundary layer and in regions near the leading edge where the thickness of the boundary layer is very low this fact is true for all simulated airfoils in this study the main reason behind augmentation of the local entropy generation in the boundary layer is the high value of strain rate which is strengthened by acceleration of the fluid flow and reduction of the boundary layer thickness in addition it is observed that the contribution of the airfoil suction side to the local entropy generation is greater than its pressure side due to the fact that the flow is accelerated through the suction side and separated from this side it is expected that the contribution of this side to the local entropy generation will be larger than the discharge side it can be said that in order to reduce the irreversibilities and performance of the airfoils as a result improving suction section is far more important than the pressure section the wake region of all airfoils has the largest contribution to the local entropy generation followed by the leading edge the reason for this trend is the high value of strain rate in this region in addition it is observed that more local entropy is generated at the leading edge as the angle of attack increases and the stagnation point moves towards the discharge side of the airfoil as the angle of attack increases the local entropy generation rate has been increased for all investigated airfoils in addition it is clear that flow separation has a significant role in increasing the thickness of the wake region and consequently in the amount of local entropy generation therefore it seems obvious that as an airfoil retards the separation angle it generates less local entropy it can be pinpointed that any correction on the shape of the airfoils in such a way to delay separation improves the performance of the airfoils at high angles of attack from the second law of thermodynamics vantage point by comparing the results related to attack angles of 15 and 20 for the airfoils investigated in this study it is clear that the local entropy generated by the sd7062 airfoil is less than that of the two other airfoils the reason for this trend is the retarding effect of flow separation in the sd7062 airfoil augmentation rate of the local entropy generation between 15 and 20 is much higher than other angles of attack this indicates that as flow starts to separate and moves towards the stall increase in the local entropy generation of these airfoils is much higher than that of the airfoils with low angle of attack the pattern of the local entropy generation contours for the s825 airfoil is different from two other airfoils at low angles of attack the reason behind this trend is the geometry structure of this airfoil which results in a different velocity field at the lower angles of attack the local entropy generation in the separation bubble zone is lower than the other regions fig 16 explicitly demonstrates this fact by illustrating the local entropy generation contours along with the streamlines for the s822 and sd7062 airfoils therefore the separation region does not directly increase the local entropy generation but also the local entropy augmentation is due to the increase in the shear region size formed behind the airfoil where the strain rate and eddy viscosity are relatively high in this region thus it is observed that the separation bubble indirectly gives rise to the local entropy generation fig 17 a shows the irreversible profiles i for various airfoils at attack angles of 0 20 as it can be seen the s825 airfoil has the lowest entropy generation rate at the attack angles of less than 10 whereas it has the highest value at attack angles of higher than 10 also it is clear that the entropy generated by the sd7062 airfoil has the lowest variation with the increase of the angle of attack and has generated less entropy at the angle of attack 20 compared to other two airfoils this trend definitely is due to the high resistance of this airfoil against the flow separation according to the results presented in fig 16 it is clear that the airflow is not completely separated from the suction surface of the sd7062 airfoil at the angle of attack at 20 it can be mentioned that for a wind turbine with performance range that is restricted to low angles of attack the selection of airfoils with a similar geometry as the s809 airfoil reveals more appropriate results but for high angles of attack the choice of airfoils with a similar geometry as the sd7062 airfoil offers better results fig 17 b shows the drag coefficient profile at various angles of attack for the investigated airfoils as it can be seen there is a great similarity between the drag coefficient diagrams in this figure with the irreversibilities diagrams given in fig 17 a this fact determines a direct relationship between the entropy generation and drag force in aerodynamics science as mentioned in some references li et al 2006 monsch et al 2007 monsch et al 2007 2007 zecher 1999 with respect to fig 17 the important point is the exponential behavior of the diagrams therefore some curves with the following relationships are fitted 19 i a e b α where α is the angle of attack in degree fig 18 shows the fitted curves for the irreversibility and drag coefficient tables 3 and 4 are listed the coefficients of a and b for the irreversibility and drag coefficient diagrams respectively as it is shown there is a fairly good agreement between the symbols related to real numbers and the fitted curves which indicates the exponential behavior of the irreversible variation with the angle of attack in the present problem there is a very small difference between the coefficient b in tables 3 and 4 this fact expressly confirms a direct relation between the entropy generation with the drag coefficient in the aerodynamics science from technical standpoint curve fitting for the irreversible diagrams is important in terms of predicting values outside of the simulated range to make a conclusion the second law efficiency ψ for the investigated airfoils at different angles of attack is studied and the results are presented in fig 19 according to fig 19 for all investigated airfoils the maximum second law efficiency has corresponded to the angle of attack of 10 also due to the uniform increase in the entropy generation with the angle of attack as shown in fig 17 it is evident that the output power augmentation is the main reason behind the increase of the second law efficiency up to the angle of attack 10 however with a further increase in the angle of attack the effects of the entropy augmentation will be dominated and hence the second law efficiency will be decreased regarding the s825 airfoil it is observed that the second law efficiency has its maximum value at attack angles less than 10 and its variations with the angle of attack are less than two other airfoils this is a great merit of the s825 airfoil from the design viewpoint but as the angle of attack increases up to 20 reduction of the second law efficiency will be more substantial for this airfoil and its value will be lower than two other airfoils in the case of the sd7062 airfoil although the variation of the second law efficiency for the attack angles of less than 10 is higher than the s825 airfoil however its reduction rate at attack angles of higher than 10 is also lower in addition it is evident that the average second law efficiency for the sd7062 airfoil is higher than that of the two other airfoils in the investigated range of attack angle 8 conclusions in this study the entropy generation analysis of three airfoils used in the design of offshore wind turbine blades was carried out in this regard the flow field around the s822 s825 and sd7062 airfoils at five attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 and reynolds number of 106 was numerically simulated some important concluding remarks are made through this simulation as follows strain rate is the most important factor in the entropy generation accordingly the dimensions of the shear region at the wake region of the airfoils have a major role in the entropy generation flow separation from the surface of the airfoils will result in growth of the shear region in the wake region thereby increasing the entropy generation the ability of airfoils to control separation is equivalent to their ability to control the entropy generation at high angles of attack at low angles of attack that the fluid flow is not separated from surface of the airfoil their geometry particularly at the leading edge has a significant effect on the entropy generation there is an exact correlation between the amount of generated entropy and the drag coefficient in aerodynamic problems e g present problem among all investigated airfoils in this study the sd7062 airfoil has the lowest entropy generation rate and the highest second law efficiency at attack angles of more than 10 and the s825 airfoil has the highest second law efficiency at attack angles of less than 10 focusing on the

23018,offshore wind turbines are of special interest due to their growing importance and hence comprehensively discussed in this research three popular offshore wind turbine airfoil geometries s822 s825 and sd7062 are studied in this research considering entropy generation there is no similar work in literature considering entropy generation around these offshore wind turbine airfoils computations performed for five different angles of attack 0 5 10 15 and 20 at re 106 viscous entropy generation rate is reported as contour plots and the effect of flow separation on entropy generation is studied it is shown that flow separation has a dramatic effect on viscous entropy generation rate the grows of separation area in the higher angle of attack produces more entropy due to larger shear layer region moreover it is observed that there is a close relation between entropy generation integral irreversibilities and drag coefficient finally second low efficiency is also computed for examined airfoils at the mentioned angle of attack range to compare their effectiveness focusing on the entropy generation in offshore wind turbine blades is essential and useful for designing and achieving a good aerodynamic performance at the offshore wind turbine airfoil the results of simulation revealed that there are no significant differences between the entropy generation rates of the investigated airfoils for the angles of attack of less than 10 but the sd7062 airfoil has the lowest entropy generation rate at larger angles of attack due to the delay in the flow separation also the results of the second law efficiency indicated that the s825 airfoil has the best performance at the angles of attack of less than 10 whilst the sd7062 airfoil has the best performance at the angles of attack of greater than 10 graphical abstract contours of local entropy generation rate for the s825 s822 and sd7062 offshore wind turbine airfoils at angle of attack 20

performed smoke wire experiment to visualize the laminar separation bubble lsb over the naca4412 airfoil at low reynolds numbers the results of this group indicated that reynolds number and angle of attack affect the location and formation of lsb in addition mean and rms velocities revealed that lsb and trailing edge separation affects the flow characteristics near wake region here some major scientific reviews based on optimization of the engineering equipment are presented focusing on the effects of viscosity on the entropy generation the current knowledge related to entropy generation in engineering systems goes back to clausius and kelvin research on the second law of thermodynamics since then this knowledge has been developed a lot and now entropy analysis is used in most engineering productions mahmud and fraser 2003 in different problems the processes associated with heat transfer fluid viscosity flow turbulence mass transfer and combustion are sources that generate entropy bejan was the first scholar who studied entropy generation sources in engineering systems and quantified entropy generation bejan 1979 1980 since the entropy generation is equivalent to the loss of work its accurate measurement in engineering systems can be a more appropriate criterion for studying their performance indeed the first pioneering research in optimization based on the second law of thermodynamics known as the entropy generation minimization egm was carried out by bejan himself on pipe and duct flows which is one of the most applicable method used in engineering equipment bejan 1979 the entropy generation analysis on the gas turbine blades carried out by zeinalpour and mazaheri 2015 they presented a complete continuous adjoint formulation to optimize the turbulent flow entropy generation rate through a turbine cascade they redesigned the shape of a turbine cascade blade and made some schemes to enhance the blade performance sousa and paniagua 2015 introduced a design methodology for supersonic turbine blades based on direct evaluations of the velocity field using the method of characteristics and computation of entropy generation across shock waves regarding the fact that the shock wave is the most important factor in entropy generation of the supersonic turbines hence they designed the blade profile for the lowest entropy generation case they coupled their method with an optimization scenario to minimize the entropy generation across the supersonic passage generally the entropy or irreversibility sources in most engineering equipment are divided into two parts the first part is related to heat transfer while the second part is related to the viscosity bejan 1979 1980 it is noteworthy to mention that the effects of mass transfer and chemical reactions are also of high interest in their related matters investigations reported in the previous paragraphs focused on the entropy generation due to the heat transfer and often ignored the effects of viscosity however the role of heat transfer can be discarded in many engineering equipment in comparison with viscosity effects among these items of equipment wing and fuselage of the airplanes fans and wind turbines can be exemplified li et al li and figliola 2004 li et al 2006 designed and optimized shapes of a two dimensional airfoil and various three dimensional wing planforms to minimize the viscous entropy generation number their exergy based optimization was conducted on the laminar flow li and figliola 2004 and turbulent flow li et al 2006 they studied the viscous entropy generation and its relationship with total and induced drag for different twisted shapes using computational fluid dynamics then the geometry was modified to minimize entropy generated in the flow field and maximize lift drag ratio under laminar and turbulent flow conditions the results of this group determined a relationship between the generated entropy with drag lift ratio for the two dimensional airfoil and the total and induced drag coefficients for the three dimensional wings sun et al 2005 implicitly calculated the entropy generated through a three dimensional wind turbine blade cross section by calculating the useful work difference applied on the blade and integrating the fluid energy loss through this selected control volume it should be noted that their method is based on the integral method and can only calculate integral of the generated entropy through the blade therefore unlike the method introduced by bejan used in this study they only calculated the integral of entropy and its distribution was unknown based on this method they corrected profile of the blade by the non uniform rational b splines nurbs curve and calculated the optimal shape for the lowest entropy generation rate sahin et al 2006 introduced a new efficiency formula to define the performance of wind turbines based on the concept of exergy exergy can be interpreted as the maximum theoretical work that can be achieved from a system stream or substance in order to reach a state of equilibrium with the environment in exergy analysis the mass and energy balance equations and second law of thermodynamics are used to design or improve the performance of energy systems unlike energy exergy is not conserved and is destructed through a control volume depending on the amount of irreversibility in the system therefore the amount of exergy destroyed in a system is proportional to its entropy generation rate they demonstrated that the average differences between energy and exergy efficiencies in a typical wind turbine are approximately 40 at low wind speeds and up to 55 at high wind speeds monsch et al 2007 optimized the wing shapes and wing lift distribution for different aircraft flight mission segments within a design framework to have an optimal distribution using the egm and their previous geometry correction method they determined the relationship between the entropy generation with total and induced drag for several twisted wing geometries in both inviscid euler and viscous flow regimes their results showed that the viscous drag can be predicted with great accuracy when the entropy generation is used behzadmehr and mercadier 2009 numerically studied the flow field and viscous entropy generation on a backward inclined centrifugal fan using 3 d elliptic governing equations they simulated the entire geometry of the fan by considering fixed and moving blades using fluent ansys their results indicated that the viscous entropy generation contours contain very useful information for specifying regions with the highest contribution to hydrodynamic losses regarding this fact they found that the distance between the entrance region and the blade passage has a great influence on the hydrodynamic losses they found that using gap with radial clearance creates less entropy than one without the radial clearance therefore the irreversibilities can be properly reduced by using a logarithmic shape for the blade profile at the blade passage cross section ahmadi and ehyaei 2009 carried out exergy analysis of a typical wind turbine model installed in tehran they concluded that by decreasing the cut in rated and furling speeds from 3 1 m s 13 8 m s and 15 6 m s to 2 53 m s 11 m s and 12 43 m s with regard to the annual average wind data for tehran respectively the annual average output electricity will be increased by approximately 20 while the entropy generation will be reduced by approximately 76 9 pope et al 2010 studied two types of horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines using relations of energy and exergy analysis introduced by sahin et al 2006 their results showed that the exergy analysis provides much more unique insight than the energy analysis and is far more efficient design tool than energy analysis for wind power development shehata et al 2014 compared performance of four symmetric airfoils of naca0015 naca0012 naca0020 and naca0021 through a rigorous numerical study using entropy generation analysis it should be noted that their goal was to study the entropy generation due to viscous dissipation around a wells turbine blade in this case the air displaced by coastal waves reached to the well turbine blades by a channel causing the blades to rotate and generate power the most significant difference between the well turbines with the conventional wind turbines is the standard design consists of several symmetrical airfoil blades positioned around a hub of well turbines hence well turbines produce electrical power in both processes of the pressure wave collision and suction return wave their numerical calculations showed that the entropy generation around the naca0015 airfoil blade is approximately 12 lower than that of the naca0012 naca0020 and naca0021 airfoils for flows achieving 10 angle of attack mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 examined the exergetic performance of three different national renewable energy laboratory nrel airfoil families for wind turbine application for this purpose they used a two dimensional incompressible unsteady numerical solver considering the effects of turbulent flow around the airfoils in their study they investigated reynolds numbers in the range of 105 106 and attack angles of 0 20 they classified the selected airfoils by presenting variation of exergy efficiency versus angle of attack at different reynolds numbers it should be noted that the method used in their research also had the same nature as that presented by sun et al 2005 this simply implies that the calculated efficiency had an integral form therefore their method is not able to compute the local entropy generation rate and only provides its integral form within the control volume in other words we cannot explicitly specify the main reason behind the superiority of the airfoil in this study we plan to answer this question using viscous entropy generation number soltanmohamadi and lakzian 2015 analyzed the 3 d wells turbine blade using viscous entropy generation number wells turbines are high efficient devices that absorb water wave energy and convert it to pneumatic energy in the air this tool is first introduced by wells et al in 1976 and commonly known as a self rectifying air turbine they eventually demonstrated the superiority of their design case using the viscous entropy generation concept it should be noted that in the present study the method used by soltanmohamadi and lakzian 2015 which is as same as the bejan s methodology is used to analyze wind turbine blades also in 2016 lakzian et al 2016 investigated on the wells turbine blades using entropy generation analysis moreover in 2018 nazeryan and lakzian 2018 investigated the effect of the wells turbine blades thickness by the means of entropy generation zidanea et al 2017a 2017b studied the effect of cleanliness and sand in the air and its effect on the aerodynamic performance of airfoil naca63415 at reynolds number of 460 103 with numerical methods they found that sandstorms reduce the lift coefficient up to 28 li et al 2017 2018 examined the impact of dust drift on the erosion of wind turbine blades s809 at the sand atmosphere they studied the impact of the stokes number on erosion of the airfoils and discovered that increasing the stokes number will increase erosion of the airfoil and its angle of attack marzuki et al 2018a examined effect of the surface roughness on a magnus wind turbine they realized that increasing the roughness of surface can improve performance of the magnus wind turbines sogukpinar and bozkurt 2017 numerically studied the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil s825 used in wind turbines they carried out their research at reynolds numbers 106 and 2 106 and angles of attack 6 to 10 they used the navier stokes equations and the k ω sst turbulence model rasekh et al 2018 examined the aerodynamic performance of a number of s type airfoils s814 s815 and s825 at the reynolds number 106 they also used the navier stokes equations and the k ω sst turbulence model they conducted their examination at the stable mode with angles of attack 0 30 and at unstable mode with oscillatory frequencies of 0 03 and 0 089 hasan et al 2017 numerically analyzed several airfoils applicable to the wind turbines including s822 s823 and s833 they examined their model using the k ω sst turbulence model at reynolds number of 230 000 and angles of attack of 40 to 40 wang et al 2017b improved the airfoil s809 aerodynamic performance using flow control devices they used computational fluid dynamics to solve the navier stokes equations and the k ω sst turbulence model at the reynolds number 106 and the angles of attack 0 25 zidane et al zidanea et al 2016 studied the performance of wind turbines in the saharan environment they declared that sand storms increase the aerodynamic resistance of wind turbines since the blade surface roughness augments marzuki et al 2018b examined the impact of surface roughness of the magnus wind turbine they realized that increasing the surface roughness can improve performance of the magnus wind turbine in this paper investigation is carried out by assuming a smooth surface with a low roughness which is due to the newness of the airfoil in the present study the local viscous entropy generation rate is calculated for three offshore wind turbines airfoils i e s822 s825 and sd7062 in the turbulent flow regime in fig 1 a the offshore wind turbine is depicted and in fig 1 b the schematic of the offshore wind turbine is shown lin et al 2018 since the bejan s entropy generation equation is used the local distribution of entropy generation is observable and the role of each point of the flow field in the irreversibility is predictable in addition correlation of the integral entropy generation irreversibilities and the drag coefficient is investigated which is the main novelty of the present study to achieve a more precise description the effects of five angles of attack including 0 5 10 15 and 20 on the entropy generation are investigated it should be noted that the entropy generation analysis around the offshore wind turbine airfoils using the bejan s entropy generation relations is not studied up to now and the present study is the first one 2 problem description in this study the turbulent and transition flows around three offshore wind turbine airfoils s822 s825 and sd7062 in re 106 based on flow conditions at the inlet and airfoil chord have been studied fig 2 illustrates profile of the selected airfoils these airfoils are very common in the current wind turbines and are used in many wind turbines construction the present paper outlines the result of the first part of our wind turbine construction project therefore selection of reynolds number is objective and is based on the most important reynolds numbers observed in our wind turbine many scholars have already used this airfoil and reynolds number karthikeyan et al 2015 tarhan and yilmaz 2016 bo et al 2015 gross and fasel 2012 as it is seen it has been tried to select airfoils with the highest geometric differences among different profiles used in turbine blades the simulations were carried out at five attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 to investigate the effects of angle of attack and flow separation on the viscous entropy generation in order to see the effects of the angle of attack the interval of 5 was chosen the entropy generation rate is measured locally and its results are presented in terms of contours and profiles also relation between the entropy generation and drag coefficient is determined by extracting the curve fitting on their graphs finally the exergy efficiency for all airfoils at different angles of attack is calculated and reported 3 governing equations in this study the unsteady reynolds averaging navier stokes urans method is used for turbulent simulation of the two dimensional and unsteady flow in order to reduce the computational cost to avoid extending over the equations only the averaged form of the governing equations will be presented davidson 2013 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 continuity equation 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i μ 2 u i x j ρ u i u j f i the above equations along with the turbulent model equations constitute the set of equations that must be analyzed to simulate turbulent flow in this research the k ω sst shear stress transport turbulent model was used to simulate the effects of turbulent flow according to sayed et al 2012 this model has great ability to capture the effects of various factors such as free flow disturbance and pressure gradient that are effective in structure of the flow transition in the present study due to the importance of entropy generation in the wake region there was a need for a model that would accurately predict not only the aerodynamic coefficients but also predict the flow structures in the wake region therefore the k ω sst turbulence model is chosen due to its high ability to release vortices and to simulate transient flow structures in the wake region many scholars have already used this method of turbulence gharali and johnson 2012 yao et al 2012 the equations are as follows

pressure gradient and flow separation davidson 2013 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to calculate the local viscous entropy generation rate in turbulent flow the following equation has been used herwig and kock 2007 kock and herwig 2004 12 s g e n μ μ t t 0 2 u i x i 2 u i x j u j x i ρ ε t 0 in a two dimensional case it is written as follows 13 s g e n μ e f f t 0 2 u x 2 v y 2 u x v y ρ ε t 0 in which effective viscosity is equal to sum of the fluid and turbulent viscosities μ e f f μ μ t and t0 is the reference temperature accordingly integral of the generated entropy or total entropy is calculated as follows 14 s c v s g e n d v the irreversibility or exergy destruction can be related to the generated entropy as follows 15 i t 0 s g e n where for two dimensional case it is obtained as follows 16 i μ e f f 2 u x 2 v y 2 u x v y ρ ε the second law efficiency also known as exergy efficiency is ratio of the useful work to the free flow exergy losses therefore the exergy efficiency is defined as follows 17 ψ w o u t w o u t t 0 s g e n where wout is calculated as follows 18 w o u t f l v y in which fl is the lift applied to the airfoil and vy is the vertical component of the mean velocity on the imaginary line at a very short distance from the airfoil surface herwig and kock 2007 kock and herwig 2004 4 numerical method the governing equations are used for incompressible and unsteady fluid flow and the two dimensional geometry is simulated using segregated and implicit and absolute velocity formulation solver simple algorithm is chosen to couple the pressure and momentum equations the second order upwind finite difference method has been used as a discretization method 5 grid resolution study in this section the grid resolution study for s825 airfoil is investigated since some appropriate experimental and numerical data are available in literature fig 3 illustrates the generated grid for the present study to simulate the flow around this airfoil as it can be seen the computational grid is clustered toward the airfoil from four different sides to study the grid resolution study four grids with dimensions of 25433 62499 110325 and 196769 have been used the number of nodes created on the airfoil s perimeter for the prescribed grids were 100 250 390 and 450 respectively fig 4 show the drag and lift coefficients for these selected grids at different attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 it should be noted that the reynolds number of the fluid stream is assumed 106 it is observed that for angle of attack less than 10 the second computational grid 62499 cells is appropriate and increasing cluster of the grid has no significant effect on the results however for angles of attack at the commencement of flow separation or larger than this value the sensitivity of the aerodynamic coefficients has been increased and grid resolution study for the third grid 110325 cells has been achieved according to these results the third grid 110325 cells has been used for other simulations it is noteworthy to mention that the dimensions and sizes used in this grid are also applied to other considered airfoil geometries too as it is known one of the requirements for using the k ω sst turbulent model is y 1 fig 5 shows variation of this quantity through the airfoil surface along with the s825 airfoil geometry as it can be seen the generated grid completely fulfills this requirement 6 model validation to ensure the validity of the conducted simulations the results are compared with the available numerical and experimental data in the literature fig 6 the results of mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 have been used as numerical data while the results of wind tunnel of the langley research institute of nasa airfoil data and availa 2013 airfoil families for 1995 have been used as experimental data which are extracted from mortazavi and sobhgahi study similar to the graphs of fig 4 the aerodynamic drag and lift coefficients are presented at different attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 and re 106 as shown the lift coefficient curves for the present study and those of mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 are in good agreement with experimental data compared to the drag coefficient curves the main reason behind this trend can be smallness of the drag coefficient and its greater sensitivity to the boundary layer structure and turbulent modeling in addition it can be seen that the deviation between numerical and experimental results increases with an increase in the angle of attack and flow separation also it can be seen that despite the difference between numerical and experimental results the numerical results of the present study have less error than those of mortazavi and sobhgahi tables 1 and 2 present the error percentage of the drag and lift coefficients of the present study and mortazavi sobhgahi mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 with the results of nasa langley airfoil data and availa 2013 airfoil families for 1995 respectively as it can be seen in table 2 the error in computation of lift coefficient at various angles of attack is less than 7 which indicates the high accuracy of the present results however the error percentage in drag coefficients is higher in comparison with the lift coefficients which can be due to its high sensitivity and low values nevertheless the computed results can be verified with those of mortazavi and sobhgahi 2015 7 results and discussion in this section the results of the simulations are presented in this regard fig 7 shows the pressure coefficient contours for the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 as can be seen the pressure coefficient is approximately equal to 1 at the stagnation point of the airfoil and decreases thereafter as fluid flow accelerates through the lower and upper surfaces of the airfoil the pressure drop continues to the point where the airfoil thickness reaches to its maximum value and increases thereafter the pressure augmentation is known as adverse or inverse pressure gradient which is the main cause of flow separation from surface of the airfoil increasing the angle of attack increases the reverse pressure gradient at the suction side of the airfoil and eventually leads to the flow separation from the surface as fig 7 b indicates the flow separation causes a significant pressure drop in suction side of the airfoil however the low pressure region takes some distances from the airfoil and is not formed on its surface fig 8 shows the pressure coefficient profile on the surface of the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 as can be seen the pressure gradient between the suction and pressure sides increases at the angle of attack 20 and beginning of the separation point which will result in a significant increase in the airfoil drag coefficient as pointed out the adverse pressure gradient at suction side of the airfoil results in the flow separation the flow separation increases the thickness of the shear layer at the wake region this means that the thickness of the wake region will be increased also it is observed that the pressure gradient between two sides of the airfoil is severely increased resulting in a dramatic increase in the drag coefficient in the following sections we plan to determine the relationship between thickness of the shear layer and the drag coefficient with the entropy generation regarding the relation of the local entropy generation rate eq 12 it is observed that the local entropy generation in this problem depends on two factors of strain rate and eddy viscosity thus the contours of these two quantities for the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 are shown in figs 9 12 respectively these figures indicate that both strain rate and eddy viscosity have the same behavior and have high value at the shear layer formed in the wake region it was expected that the eddy viscosity would be higher in areas with a high strain rate which is mainly due to the fact that the turbulent kinetic energy generation rate depends on the strain rate according to these explanations it is clear that the strain rate is the most important factor in generating local entropy in the present problem to determine the effects of the airfoil geometry on the local entropy generation the local entropy generation profiles at 0 001c from the surface are displayed for various airfoils at three attack angles of 0 10 and 15 in fig 13 it should be noted that the red lines represent the pressure side and the black lines represent the suction side of the blade as it can be seen the effects of different geometries of the s825 airfoil at angle of attack 0 were clearly characterized by two distinct peak points one on the suction surface and another on the pressure surface the main reason behind this phenomenon is the acceleration of the fluid flow near the points x c 0 5 and x c 0 35 on the suction and pressure sides which has increased the local strain rate in these areas therefore at angle of attack zero despite the fact that the s822 and sd7062 airfoils have the maximum local entropy generation at the leading edge the s825 airfoil has the highest local entropy generation rate near the middle of the chord as fig 13 b and c indicate increasing the angle of attack moves region of the maximum local entropy generation towards the leading edge for all airfoils this clearly shows that the geometry of the leading edge of the airfoils plays a significant role in irreversibility generation therefore it is expected that this region will be more important in designing offshore wind turbine blade profiles it is also found that at the angle of attack zero the sd7062 airfoil has the highest local entropy generation at the leading edge however as angle of attack increases and flow separated from the surface almost the symmetrical s822 airfoil will have the highest local entropy generation fig 14 shows the local entropy generation rate contours for the selected airfoils at two attack angles of 0 and 20 according to the graphs of this figure it is clear that the shear layer formed in the wake region of the airfoil is the most important source of local entropy generation in this problem therefore at zero angle of attack that the fluid flow is securely attached to the surface of the airfoil the shear region is very narrow and the local entropy generation rate is minimum however the shear layer is thickened behind the airfoil as angle of attack increases and fluid flow separated from the airfoil suction surface and hence significant local entropy is generated in the wake region therefore it can be expected that by increasing the angle of attack and thickening the wake region more local entropy will be generated to compare the behavior of different airfoils towards the local entropy generation the contours of the local entropy generation rate for the s822 s825 and sd7062 airfoils at attack angles between zero and 20 are presented in fig 15 according to these figures the following conclusions can be made the first point which must be noted is that the largest local entropy generation occurs within the boundary layer to illustrate this fact a part of the boundary layer is displayed in a magnified form as it can be observed the maximum value of local entropy generation occurs in the boundary layer and in regions near the leading edge where the thickness of the boundary layer is very low this fact is true for all simulated airfoils in this study the main reason behind augmentation of the local entropy generation in the boundary layer is the high value of strain rate which is strengthened by acceleration of the fluid flow and reduction of the boundary layer thickness in addition it is observed that the contribution of the airfoil suction side to the local entropy generation is greater than its pressure side due to the fact that the flow is accelerated through the suction side and separated from this side it is expected that the contribution of this side to the local entropy generation will be larger than the discharge side it can be said that in order to reduce the irreversibilities and performance of the airfoils as a result improving suction section is far more important than the pressure section the wake region of all airfoils has the largest contribution to the local entropy generation followed by the leading edge the reason for this trend is the high value of strain rate in this region in addition it is observed that more local entropy is generated at the leading edge as the angle of attack increases and the stagnation point moves towards the discharge side of the airfoil as the angle of attack increases the local entropy generation rate has been increased for all investigated airfoils in addition it is clear that flow separation has a significant role in increasing the thickness of the wake region and consequently in the amount of local entropy generation therefore it seems obvious that as an airfoil retards the separation angle it generates less local entropy it can be pinpointed that any correction on the shape of the airfoils in such a way to delay separation improves the performance of the airfoils at high angles of attack from the second law of thermodynamics vantage point by comparing the results related to attack angles of 15 and 20 for the airfoils investigated in this study it is clear that the local entropy generated by the sd7062 airfoil is less than that of the two other airfoils the reason for this trend is the retarding effect of flow separation in the sd7062 airfoil augmentation rate of the local entropy generation between 15 and 20 is much higher than other angles of attack this indicates that as flow starts to separate and moves towards the stall increase in the local entropy generation of these airfoils is much higher than that of the airfoils with low angle of attack the pattern of the local entropy generation contours for the s825 airfoil is different from two other airfoils at low angles of attack the reason behind this trend is the geometry structure of this airfoil which results in a different velocity field at the lower angles of attack the local entropy generation in the separation bubble zone is lower than the other regions fig 16 explicitly demonstrates this fact by illustrating the local entropy generation contours along with the streamlines for the s822 and sd7062 airfoils therefore the separation region does not directly increase the local entropy generation but also the local entropy augmentation is due to the increase in the shear region size formed behind the airfoil where the strain rate and eddy viscosity are relatively high in this region thus it is observed that the separation bubble indirectly gives rise to the local entropy generation fig 17 a shows the irreversible profiles i for various airfoils at attack angles of 0 20 as it can be seen the s825 airfoil has the lowest entropy generation rate at the attack angles of less than 10 whereas it has the highest value at attack angles of higher than 10 also it is clear that the entropy generated by the sd7062 airfoil has the lowest variation with the increase of the angle of attack and has generated less entropy at the angle of attack 20 compared to other two airfoils this trend definitely is due to the high resistance of this airfoil against the flow separation according to the results presented in fig 16 it is clear that the airflow is not completely separated from the suction surface of the sd7062 airfoil at the angle of attack at 20 it can be mentioned that for a wind turbine with performance range that is restricted to low angles of attack the selection of airfoils with a similar geometry as the s809 airfoil reveals more appropriate results but for high angles of attack the choice of airfoils with a similar geometry as the sd7062 airfoil offers better results fig 17 b shows the drag coefficient profile at various angles of attack for the investigated airfoils as it can be seen there is a great similarity between the drag coefficient diagrams in this figure with the irreversibilities diagrams given in fig 17 a this fact determines a direct relationship between the entropy generation and drag force in aerodynamics science as mentioned in some references li et al 2006 monsch et al 2007 monsch et al 2007 2007 zecher 1999 with respect to fig 17 the important point is the exponential behavior of the diagrams therefore some curves with the following relationships are fitted 19 i a e b α where α is the angle of attack in degree fig 18 shows the fitted curves for the irreversibility and drag coefficient tables 3 and 4 are listed the coefficients of a and b for the irreversibility and drag coefficient diagrams respectively as it is shown there is a fairly good agreement between the symbols related to real numbers and the fitted curves which indicates the exponential behavior of the irreversible variation with the angle of attack in the present problem there is a very small difference between the coefficient b in tables 3 and 4 this fact expressly confirms a direct relation between the entropy generation with the drag coefficient in the aerodynamics science from technical standpoint curve fitting for the irreversible diagrams is important in terms of predicting values outside of the simulated range to make a conclusion the second law efficiency ψ for the investigated airfoils at different angles of attack is studied and the results are presented in fig 19 according to fig 19 for all investigated airfoils the maximum second law efficiency has corresponded to the angle of attack of 10 also due to the uniform increase in the entropy generation with the angle of attack as shown in fig 17 it is evident that the output power augmentation is the main reason behind the increase of the second law efficiency up to the angle of attack 10 however with a further increase in the angle of attack the effects of the entropy augmentation will be dominated and hence the second law efficiency will be decreased regarding the s825 airfoil it is observed that the second law efficiency has its maximum value at attack angles less than 10 and its variations with the angle of attack are less than two other airfoils this is a great merit of the s825 airfoil from the design viewpoint but as the angle of attack increases up to 20 reduction of the second law efficiency will be more substantial for this airfoil and its value will be lower than two other airfoils in the case of the sd7062 airfoil although the variation of the second law efficiency for the attack angles of less than 10 is higher than the s825 airfoil however its reduction rate at attack angles of higher than 10 is also lower in addition it is evident that the average second law efficiency for the sd7062 airfoil is higher than that of the two other airfoils in the investigated range of attack angle 8 conclusions in this study the entropy generation analysis of three airfoils used in the design of offshore wind turbine blades was carried out in this regard the flow field around the s822 s825 and sd7062 airfoils at five attack angles of 0 5 10 15 and 20 and reynolds number of 106 was numerically simulated some important concluding remarks are made through this simulation as follows strain rate is the most important factor in the entropy generation accordingly the dimensions of the shear region at the wake region of the airfoils have a major role in the entropy generation flow separation from the surface of the airfoils will result in growth of the shear region in the wake region thereby increasing the entropy generation the ability of airfoils to control separation is equivalent to their ability to control the entropy generation at high angles of attack at low angles of attack that the fluid flow is not separated from surface of the airfoil their geometry particularly at the leading edge has a significant effect on the entropy generation there is an exact correlation between the amount of generated entropy and the drag coefficient in aerodynamic problems e g present problem among all investigated airfoils in this study the sd7062 airfoil has the lowest entropy generation rate and the highest second law efficiency at attack angles of more than 10 and the s825 airfoil has the highest second law efficiency at attack angles of less than 10 focusing on the

23019,an experimental and numerical comparison of the performance of two self reacting point absorber wave energy converter designs is undertaken for heave motions in irregular waves the experiments consist of a series of 1 25 scale model tests that feature re configurable wec body shapes a feedback controlled power take off and a heave motion constraint apparatus while both designs have the same float the first design features a streamlined reacting body and the second design features a damper plate reacting body a time domain numerical model validated by the experimental results is used to extend the comparisons of the designs in terms of power matrices capture width matrices and mean annual power production results indicate that the wave energy converter design with damper plate produces 41 higher mean annual energy production than the wave energy converter design with streamlined reacting body at a representative location near the west coast of vancouver island british columbia canada keywords wave energy conversion model testing time domain power take off self reacting point absorbers heave plate hydrodynamics 1 introduction self reacting point absorbers srpas are wave energy converters wecs that convert energy from wave driven relative motion between two or more bodies into useful energy forms budal 1985 srpas typically employ a buoyant surface piercing body referred to as the float which driven by waves reacts against a second body referred to as the reacting body the resulting relative motions and forces across these bodies are converted into useful energy by means of a power take off pto two design strategies are evident on axi symmetric heaving srpa devices the key difference between these strategies is the shape of the reacting body the two srpa designs that are the focus of this study are shown in fig 1 the first denoted wec a is modelled after a wavebob wavebob ltd ireland device featuring a surface piercing float and a streamlined reacting body the second denoted wec b is modelled after a powerbuoy ocean power technologies inc usa wec b uses the same float as wec a but its reacting body has a smaller water plane cross sectional area and features a large diameter heave plate this work is to be taken as a companion to the work by beatty et al 2015 to systematically compare the power production of wec a and wec b given independently optimized ptos in this study as well as in beatty et al 2015 all motions are constrained to the heave direction to highlight the hydrodynamic design considerations that dominate the wec s power performance to facilitate a systematic comparison of wecs a and b with independently optimized ptos experimental tests of the physical model wecs with advanced pto emulation will be undertaken a time domain numerical model that contains coefficients extracted from experimental hydrodynamic characterization of the wecs will be developed experimental data gathered during a series of tests in operating conditions will be used to validate the time domain wec model and finally the time domain model will be used to assess each wecs production over a wider range of operational sea conditions relative to the wec comparisons in regular monchromatic waves reported by beatty et al 2015 the current investigation undertakes comparisons of wec a to wec b in irregular panchromatic waves 1 1 literature review previous experimental and numerical studies of srpas focus predominantly on single device designs french 1985 korde 1999 weinstein et al 2003 hals et al 2007 beatty et al 2009 elwood et al 2010 candido and justino 2011 henriques et al 2012 de andres et al 2013 wu et al 2014 fonseca et al 2016 from these studies it is difficult to draw equitable comparisons among different srpa designs due to differences in mooring and pto control strategies and insufficient characterization of experimental and numerical uncertainties a handful of comparative studies of wec devices have been identified fifteen wecs of various classes were compared experimentally in terms of capture width and cost by meyer et al 2002 eight wecs of different class and operating principle were compared by previsic et al 2004 at a high level based on performance data reported by device developers babarit et al 2012 2011 conducted numerical assessments of eight distinct wec designs in irregular waves including one wavebob style srpa similar to wec a in this study based on mean energy production and key cost indicators in more recent work babarit 2015 compiled and presented annual performance data for many wec technologies this final study is a useful overview of the performance achieved by wecs to date across wec archetypes however it is unsuitable for understanding the performance benefits associated with specific design strategies within a given wec archetype a couple of parametric studies that involve srpa bodies are as follows first diamond et al 2015 present an experimental and numerical analysis of an axi symmetric srpa employing adjustable flaps on the reacting body to modulate reacting body added mass in time to maximize wec performance although the numerical model and subsequent parametric study accounts for dynamic effects associated with time varying mass the analysis neglects viscous drag and is limited to regular waves second liang and zuo 2017 seek to build on the srpa comparisons in regular waves reported in beatty et al 2015 by extending the analysis to irregular waves however since liang and zuo s linearized frequency domain model lacks experimental validation and neglects radiation memory and non linear drag effects their results for irregular waves are questionable no detailed studies comparing the performance of alternative axisymmetric srpa reacting body shapes in irregular waves with experimental validation have been identified in an equitable model scale experimental and numerical power production comparison study of two srpas such as wec a to wec b it is paramount that each wec be assessed with individually optimized ptos three key requirements follow 1 the pto simulator on the physical model must have sufficient resolution and repeatability for setting its impedance 2 numerical models derived from experimental results must sufficiently capture each wec s heave motion dynamics for a broad range of irregular wave conditions and 3 each wec s hydrodynamics must be well characterized because the optimal pto settings and numerical models for each wec are highly dependent on knowledge of the complete suite of hydrodynamic parameters a handful of recent works are relevant to requirement 1 pto emulation on the physical model two versions of an opt powerbuoy style srpa similar to wec b of the current work were previously developed and tested at 1 33 scale li et al 2012 previsic et al 2014 neary et al 2014 however due to the inherent limitations of the passive mechanical pto simulators on those models the results were coarse and this ultimately limited the numerical model validation efforts yu and li 2013 conversely villegas and van der schaaf 2011 and mackay et al 2012 describe large scale 1 20 experimental model srpas with advanced approaches to pto emulation the srpa physical models in those studies use feedback controlled linear motors which in concert with suitable instrumentation and control systems provide for highly resolved and repeatable control over the pto force behavior although the advanced pto emulation strategies proved successful neither of the studies state power performance of the srpa device in a comprehensive manner that facilitates comparison to other srpa designs for adhering to requirement 2 above there exists well known dynamics modelling approaches both in the frequency domain and time domain however frequency domain techniques should be avoided for modelling wecs in irregular waves price et al 2009 the time domain approach by cummins 1962 is predominant for wec dynamics modelling in irregular waves although taghipour et al 2008 have investigated and presented viable alternatives recent literature presenting time domain models of srpas include studies by babarit et al 2012 and de andres et al 2013 babarit et al applied the cummins approach to model heave pitch surge and relative motions of the float reacting body in the absence of moorings de andres presents results from a heave motion constrained time domain model olaya et al 2014 developed a heave constrained time domain model of an srpa through a sensitivity study of viscous drag on the simulation results olaya states that viscous drag cannot be neglected however no procedure is presented for specifying the viscous drag coefficient for all three of these studies experimental data validating the component hydrodynamic models is not available finally on literature relevant to requirement 3 hydrodynamic characterization relevant studies have been published for both generic floating bodies and for specific srpa designs ringwood et al 2016 inviscid analyses are routinely done with bem software packages but olaya et al 2013 presents a semi analytical approach to obtain inviscid radiation diffraction loads on an srpa viscid loads such as morison drag are often estimated with high uncertainty from literature whereas experimental characterization by means of free decay tests costello et al 2014 journe and massie 2001 or forced oscillation tests can improve the certainty of the estimation 2 methods 2 1 numerical methods 2 1 1 linear hydrodynamics the boundary element method bem code wamit wamit inc 2012 was used to obtain the inviscid hydrodynamic coefficients of wec a and b namely added mass radiation damping and excitation force the panel meshes used in the analyses of wec a and b are shown in fig 2 the spatial domain was infinite in the horizontal dimensions and the water depth set to 2 0m a three body analysis of each wec configuration was performed of the float body 1 and the reacting body body 2 and body 3 was a numerical moon pool lid introduced at the water surface in the annular gap between the float and reacting body the moon pool lid mitigates erroneous bem numerical solutions such as negative added mass and unrealistically high radiation damping in the fluid domain arising from resonant oscillations the moon pool lid is not considered in any further dynamic analyses of the current work for each body j the frequency dependent added mass a j j ω radiation damping b j j ω and complex excitation forces coefficient x j ω are computed using the bem analysis from the bem solutions the float reacting body radiation coupling terms a 12 ω a 21 ω and b 12 ω b 21 ω are relatively small in comparison to the diagonal terms a 11 ω

section 3 1 1 are complemented with additional nonlinear forces of viscous drag sliding friction and the linear pto reaction force heave displacement velocity and acceleration of the float and reacting body are represented respectively by 2 1 vectors ξ t ξ t and ξ t m a is a 2 2 mass matrix combined with the infinite frequency added mass the remaining terms are 2 1 vectors where f e t are excitation forces f r t are radiation forces with added mass at infinite frequency removed f c t are coulomb friction forces f v t are viscous drag forces f k t are hydrostatic forces and finally f p

1 k e 2 t the radiation forces are modelled by the convolution integrals seen in eq 5 in the implementation the input signals are discrete in time and the continuous integrals become sums with finite bounds at each point in time t the radiation convolutions are evaluated from t 10 to t and the excitation convolutions are evaluated from t 10 to t 10 these convolution integral bounds were chosen to be wide enough so that kernel functions k e j and k r j have approached zero in the time ranges plots of the kernel functions in addition to the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients are given

coefficient and v f j t is taken as the vertical component of the fluid velocity at the depth location of the characteristic diameter refer to figure a 15 for locations of these reference depths the float characteristic diameter d 1 is taken as the float outer diameter while d 2 for wec a is taken as the largest diameter and d 2 for wec b is taken as the diameter of the damper plate 7 f v t ρ π 8

coefficient c p t o between the float j 1 and the reacting body j 2 as seen in eq 9 9 f p t o t c p t o c p t o c p t o c p t o ξ t the selection of c p t o to maximize wave energy conversion in a given wave condition is discussed in the next section a 4th order runge kutta fixed time step integrator with a time step of 0 065 s is used for the time simulations the time domain model runs at approximately 10 1 real time no attempt is made to approximate the convolution integrals in the dynamics equations with a cpu time saving technique such as state space methods jefferys 1984 yu and falnes 1995 taghipour et al 2008 2 2 1 selection of pto damping the selection of the pto damping coefficient c p t o that maximizes power capture in a regular monochromatic wave of frequency ω can be obtained analytically by impedance mathcing for a two body wec the analytical solution is presented in falnes 2002 and utilized in beatty et al 2015 however the analytical relation derived from impedance matching does not apply to panchromatic or irregular waves to overcome this a numerical optimization is used to find an optimal c p t o value for each panchromatic wave spectrum considered the optimization is to choose c p t o that maximizes power capture p given by eq 10 where s ω f h s t p is the variance density spectrum that represents the panchromatic wave conditions the

optimization for each wec and each of the irregular wave test conditions discussed further in sec 3 2 4 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 experimental setup the test facility dimensions 58m 4 5m x 2m depth was memorial university s ocean engineering research center located in st john s newfoundland canada fig 3 shows the locations of the wave probes relative to the wecs and the heave motion constraint apparatus details on the rationale for tank and model sizing considerations are available in beatty et al 2015 summary specifications of the physical models are given in table 2 a feedback controlled linear actuator was used for pto emulation on this project as was done by zurkinden et al 2014 mackay et al 2012 and villegas and van der schaaf 2011 the force feedback control enabled the linear actuator to exert the desired state dependent force for pto emulation the control systems were developed in ni labview and implemented in real time on an ni pxi chassis running at 50 hz for sampling and control the linear motor linmot ps01 37 120 250 n maximum force has a maximum travel of 0 28 m and weighs under 3 kg relative displacement is measured with a laser displacement sensor micro epsilon optoncdt 1402 600 range 600 mm resolution of 80 μm the pto force was measured by a 500 n capacity s type tension compression load cell accelerations of the float and reacting bodies were measured via accelerometers analog devices adxl203 with 1 7 g range a kalman filter enabled the synthesis of a real time velocity signal from the measured displacement and acceleration signals 2 3 2 decay tests records of the displacement signals from the free oscillations of initially displaced bodies were used to extract morison drag c d j and coulomb friction c c j coefficients for the reacting bodies of wec a and wec b in the data analysis the coefficient extraction was done by solving an unconstrained optimization problem the goal is to minimize eq 11 which defines the mean squared error between experimental and time domain model derived displacement vectors of length n the design variables are c d j and c c j the optimization was carried out with the nelder mead simplex

influence of the pto were undertaken to separately assess the validity of the time domain model for each body the tests are performed individually on each floating body allowed to freely move in the heave direction and subjected to waves the rao is defined as the amplitude of the body s heave displacement ξ ˆ j normalized by the wave amplitude η as a function of frequency as a validate method the time domain modelled raos are compared to experimental raos the experimental raos were obtained from two methods 1 regular monochromatic wave tests over a range of frequencies where ξ ˆ j ω η was obtained from the amplitudes of the monochromatic heave and wave signals 2 irregular waves where the wave field is generated as a broadband signal low pass filtered white noise in this method the rao is derived from the ratio of discrete fourier transforms of the heave response ξ j t and wave probe signal η t further detail on the rao test methods can be found in beatty et al 2015 2 4 1 irregular wave selection analysis of a ten year set of hourly hind cast wave data validated by wave measurements from the west coast of bc canada hiles et al 2014 was used to select the sea states applied in the physical model tests in an approach similar to that presented by cahill and lewis 2013 a contour plot showing the contribution of individual sea states to the annual wave occurrences is used to reveal the sea states of importance for wec operation a contour plot of the sea state frequency of occurrence is shown in fig 4 the conditions for the experimental tests are also shown in fig 4 the conditions were chosen to cover as much of the high occurrence contours as possible while aiming to avoid wave maker limitations wec end stop collisions and wave over topping of the wec bodies the test conditions were synthesized by the wave maker using the pierson moscowitz spectrum shape due to control and hardware limitations of the wave making facilities it was not possible to repeat identical wave conditions across multiple tests however the similarity of conditions tested for wec a and wec b as evidenced in fig 4 is deemed sufficient 2 4 2 power capture tests of power capture for wecs a and b were done in 25 synthesized pierson moscowitz spectra within the region indicated in fig 4 the mean power capture for each test was calculated by eq 12 where f p t o t is the instantaneous pto force signal provided by the load cell and u r t is the instantaneous relative velocity signal provided by the displacement sensor and accelerometer kalman sensor fusion technique discussed in section 3 2 1 12 p p t f p t o t u r t capture width a measure that quantifies the production capability of the wec with respect to the available power in the wave conditions is defined by eq 13 13 cw p j where j ρ g c g ω s ω d ω is the wave power transport per unit crest width and the group velocity c g ω is evaluated for intermediate depth using the airy wave relations furthermore the capture width can be normalized by a characteristic dimension to form a metric given by eq 14 known as capture width ratio 14 cwr cw l where the characteristic dimension l in units of meters can be developed in a number of ways for various wecs 3 results 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 decay tests the experimental and time domain model results for the freely decaying oscillations of the initially displaced reacting bodies are shown in fig 5 for each decay test convergence of the optimization algorithm was achieved in approximately 60 iterations with objective function and design variable tolerances set to 10 6 the model results shown in fig 5 are from the time domain model with converged optimal morison drag c d and coulomb friction c c coefficient pairings for reacting body a three heave decay tests were analyzed with the resulting optimum coefficient pairs c d 2 c c 2 2 3 0 0081 1 5 0 011 1 75 0 010 fig 5a shows the first of the three tests for reacting body b one decay test as seen in fig 5b was analyzed with the resulting optimum pairing c d 2 c c 2 2 8 0 0051 the fits between the experimental and numerical results with converged optimal c d 2 and c c 2 as shown in fig 5 are quite close however the spread of the results for reacting body a c d 2 1 5 2 3 showed further analysis was needed to select a single set of coefficients to assess whether the converged values are meaningful grids of the objective function eq 11 were directly computed in the solution regions defined in the parameter space 0 c d 2 6 0 c c 2 0 02 n surfaces of the objective functions are shown in fig 6 in fig 6a and b the objective function surfaces are shown the surfaces are flipped so that optima are viewed as maxima rather than minima to aid visual interpretation five contours around the solution surface optima maxima and the converged optima are shown fig 6a and b shows that the optimizations converged to the global optimum of the objective function for both reacting body a and reacting body b the results for reacting body a seen in fig 6a show the gradient of the objective function is low in the solution region in comparison to the gradient in the outer regions of the c d 2 c c 2 parameter space however the contours indicate the region is convex and smooth in the local area the results for reacting body b seen in fig 6b show the gradient of the objective function is also relatively low in the solution region in comparison to the outer regions the contours indicate the region is convex however the jagged contours indicate the objective function is less smooth in the local area than the decay objective function for reacting body a due to the relatively low gradients of the objective functions in the solution region the resolution and robustness of the method for extracting drag and friction could be improved with repetition of decay tests and subsequent application of the optimization method based on these analyses the drag coefficients for reacting bodies a and b are taken as 1 9 and 2 8 respectively the coulomb friction coefficients for reacting bodies a and b are taken as 0 0051 n and 0 0097 n respectively the difference in the coulomb friction coefficients between reacting bodies a and b despite their use of the same linear guide system can be explained by slight bearing alignment and bearing lubrication differences due to the apparatus disassembly assembly operations the float heave drag coefficient is taken as 1 0 consistent with babarit et al 2011 2012 the coulomb friction of the float is taken conservatively as the higher value of those determined from the reacting body tests 0 0097 n because the physical model of the float uses the same linear guides as the reacting bodies although the graphical approach above provides a verification of the identified reacting body hydrodynamic coefficients the optimization approach presented in section 3 2 2 is proven effective and may be used in future coefficient identification problems where a graphical approach may not be feasible 3 2 validation of time domain model 3 2 1 response amplitude operators experimental and numerical raos of reacting bodies a and b with f p t o 0 are plotted in fig 7 a and b as a strategy to avoid end stop collisions during regular wave rao tests the wave amplitude was varied between tests for reacting body a 0 7 cm η 3 9 cm and for reacting body b 1 5 cm η 6 cm three numerically generated heave rao curves are shown for both reacting bodies a and b each corresponding to a different wave amplitude as shown in fig 7a and b the natural frequency of reacting body a is approximately 2 0 rad s whereas the natural frequency of reacting body b is approximately 0 75 rad s reacting body a behaves as a wave follower at frequencies below 1 5 rad s at 2 0 rad s the resonance condition is approached and heave displacement amplitudes on the order of 5 η are observed reacting body b due to high damping from the plate exhibits much lower heave displacement amplitudes below 1 5 rad s and approximately zero amplitude response above 1 5 rad s there is excellent agreement between the experimental and time domain model heave raos the rao results show that the time domain model when supplied with bem derived radiation and diffraction kernels along with experimentally derived c d and c c is valid in regular wave conditions with c p t o 0 in the following sections the time domain model data is tested against experimental data gathered during pto operation where c p t o 0 3 2 2 power capture data from example wec power production tests along with time domain model results are given in figs 8 and 9 the wave condition is a pm spectrum with h s 0 073m t p 2 26sec denoted wave condition irr3 table 1 gives wave conditions and corresponding c p t o levels the data plotted are water surface elevation relative float reacting body displacement and mechanical power capture as a function of time fig 8 shows the time series for the full test duration and fig 9 shows the time series for an 80sec portion 140 s t 220 s the wave probe signals in fig 8a and b indicate maximum wave heights of 15 cm the zoomed in wave probe plots in fig 9a and b shows that wave probes a and d produced very close but not identical water surface elevation signals with small differences more pronounced at peaks and troughs the differences in the wave probe signals though small are likely due to a combination of tank wall effects and the inclusion of radiated waves from the wec since the wave probe measurements were made in situ from the relative displacement time series shown in fig 8c and d the time domain model output shows strong correlation to the experimental model results peaks and troughs in the experimental and modelled relative displacements align reasonably well temporally though some error in phase is exhibited upon closer inspection via fig 9c and d it is evident some peaks and troughs in the relative displacement signal are over under predicted by the time domain model the rmse between the time domain model and experimental results over the full test duration for both wecs is 5 mm which amounts to 10 of the maximum relative displacements in the tests fig 8e and f shows the complete mechanical power time series and fig 9e and f shows the 80s extracts in these power time series the time domain model output is strongly correlated to the experimental model results as wave groups arrive at the wec the time domain model clearly predicts the general power output behavior well however many of the power production peaks from the time domain model results are under over predicted and or delayed the experimental mean power in wave condition irr3 for wecs a and b is 0 73w and 0 51w respectively the time domain modelled mean power for wecs a and b is 1 1w and 0 61w respectively to summarize the results from all sea states tested mean mechanical power from experimental tests and from the time domain model output for both wecs a and b are shown in fig 10 excluding six outlier tests for wec a sea states 3 4 8 11 13 resulting from float over topping events and some pto force control instability the time domain model is shown to predict the mean mechanical power output within 35 error for both wecs summary plots of normalized rms error between experimental and numerical relative heave displacement for both wecs a and b in all sea states tested are shown in fig 11 the normalized rms error of relative displacement is similar in magnitude for both wecs but the highest observed error is seen for wec b since viscous drag comprises a large proportion of the forces on reacting body b the discrepancy in relative displacement is likely due to inaccuracy in the wec b reacting body drag coefficient specifically the inaccuracy in the drag coefficient can be attributed to three sources 1 the drag coefficient was obtained from a single decay test rather than for an average of over three as done for wec a 2 due to the high drag of the damper plate the decaying oscillations within that test were damped out much faster than for wec b thus reducing the data for which the fitting scheme was applied hence weakening the fit 3 drag coefficients for oscillating flow are known to vary with frequency and amplitude of oscillation and the drag coefficient for reacting body b was extracted at the natural frequency of reacting body b a low frequency compared to the wave frequencies applied during the power production tests for calculation of average power conversion of the wec designs in irregular waves the time domain model are validated by fig 10 however the choice of sea conditions within the experimental test validation exercises have not illuminated significant power conversion performance differences between the wec designs in the following section the validated time domain model is used to assess and compare the wec a and b power production characteristics in a wider range of sea states 3 3 performance matrices to undertake a comparison of wec a and b s power production levels in a wider range of wave conditions than those shown in table 1 the time domain model was run for each wec over a grid of 144 total sea states covering model scale h s 0 02 0 35 m and t p 8 5 sec representing full scale h s 0 5 8 75 m and t p 4 25 sec for each of the 144 sea states the optimum passive pto damping was chosen using the method discussed in section 3 1 3 for each simulation the water surface elevation was synthesized from a pierson moscowitz spectrum using the random phase model contour plots of mean power production for each wec as a function of h s and t p are shown in fig 12 contour plots of capture width are shown in fig 13 observing the power contours and capture width contours of figs 12 and 13 wec a s production reaches a higher peak value but wec b shows a greater bandwidth of power production in comparison to wec a wec b s power production and capture width are less sensitive to variation in the peak wave period therefore wec b is expected to capture more power from wider range of conditions this confirms observations made about wec b s bandwidth in comparison to wec a s made in beatty et al 2015 although figs 12 and 13 show clear differences in performance characteristics of wec a and b with regard to sea state it is not clear which wec has an advantage at a specific offshore site consequently the following section estimates the annual production of each wec at a specific location 3 4 performance off the pacific coast of north america for a representative location near hesquiaht sound located off the west coast of bc canada ten years of hourly parametric wave data from hiles et al 2014 is used to assess the energy conversion performance of wec a and wec b the mean wave power transport at the site is j 29 5 kw m the capture width contours given by fig 13 for wec a and b are froude scaled by geometric scale ratio α 25 then interpolated and multiplied by the wave power transport for each hour in the wave data to account for a realistic power shutdown mode in extreme conditions power production is set to null for h s 5m the results are shown in fig 14 observing fig 14 the power production of wec b is often greater than for wec a in the west coast of bc canada sea conditions the data shows that wec b produces greater power output than wec a for 62 of the data records the average power output at the west coast bc location for wec a is 51 7 kw and for wec b 73 1 kw there are visible points where power production is zero indicating when conditions exceed h s 5m and both wecs are in survival mode the mean annual energy production maep for wec a is 453 mwh and for wec b is 641 mwh it can be concluded that the greater performance bandwidth of wec b is driving its increased annual production compared to wec a and that wec b has a distinct economic advantage at the location studied 3 5 sensitivity of wec performance to drag coefficients analysis of heave decay tests on the reacting bodies discussed in section 4 1 1 yielded a range of drag coefficients for the wec a reacting body and only a single test was available to determine the drag coefficient for the wec b reacting body further the float drag coefficient applied was a value informed by the literature not experiments a sensitivity study was executed to gain insight into the uncertainty in the wec performance associated with the drag coefficient assumptions the power performance analysis at the west coast bc location was re executed for both wecs and for drag coefficient values of 50 and 150 of the experimentally calculated coefficient values results are summarized in table 3 the sensitivity results in table 3 show for both wecs that increases in each of the float and reacting body drag coefficients while holding the other body s drag coefficient constant by 50 causes reductions of approximately 10 in maep over the 10 year data set for wec a reductions of the float and reacting body drag coefficients by 50 also causes reductions in meap these reductions may be explained by the lack of accounting for the perturbed viscous drag coefficients in the pto damping optimization calculations discussed in section 3 1 3 thus leading to non optimal c p t o levels for the perturbed cases within the sensitivity study similarly for wec b a 50 reduced float drag coefficient leads to a small reduction of meap however a 50 reduced reacting body drag coefficient leads to a small increase of meap it is likely that the effects of non optimality of c p t o as well as a reduction of energy dissipation into viscous drag are affecting the results in summary the sensitivity to drag results indicate the range of change in maep is 11 to 3 for associated with changes in drag coefficients of 50 3 6 alternative performance measures there are other ways to summarize the efficiency of wecs including capture width and capture width ratio defined by eqs 13 and 14 the average capture widths for wec a and b at the west coast bc canada location are formulated into average capture width ratios with the characteristic dimension l determined in three ways as the float diameter as the square root of the wetted surface area and as the cube root of the submerged volume the individual average capture width ratios are denoted cwr d cwr a and cwr v respectively results are given in table 4 the results in table 4 indicate that wec b has a greater efficiency of conversion from wave power to mechanical power on average at the west coast bc location regardless of the chosen capture width measure however because wec a has a lower surface area than wec b wec a is viewed as more competitive with wec b in terms of cwr a lastly because wec b has a much lower submerged volume than wec a wec b s performance advantage based on cwr v is amplified in comparison to wec a s performance 4 conclusions an experimental and numerical comparison of two variations of two body heaving self reacting point absorber wecs in irregular waves was presented the two body wecs denoted a and b are constrained to move in the heave direction only time domain models of the wecs based on cummins equation with additional terms for pto force coulomb friction and morison drag were developed and validated using experimental data free motion decay test data was used to calibrate the morison drag and coulomb friction coefficients by minimizing the squared error between time domain model and experimental data the time domain models are validated by way of experimental results of the wecs producing power in 25 irregular sea states the time domain models are accurate to within 20 of the normalized rmse in relative displacements and 35 in mechanical power after experimental validation in irregular wave conditions the time domain model was used to compare the power production of the wecs in a wide range of conditions the average power and capture width comparisons from the time domain model over an expanded range of wave conditions indicate wec a the wec with a streamlined reacting body has a greater peak production capability but wec b with a damper plate reacting body features a wider bandwidth and ultimately better performance comparisons of hourly power production over a multi year data set from a representative location off the west coast bc canada suggest on average wec a with the streamlined reacting body produces 51 7 kw and wec b with the damper plate reacting body produces 73 1 kw

23019,an experimental and numerical comparison of the performance of two self reacting point absorber wave energy converter designs is undertaken for heave motions in irregular waves the experiments consist of a series of 1 25 scale model tests that feature re configurable wec body shapes a feedback controlled power take off and a heave motion constraint apparatus while both designs have the same float the first design features a streamlined reacting body and the second design features a damper plate reacting body a time domain numerical model validated by the experimental results is used to extend the comparisons of the designs in terms of power matrices capture width matrices and mean annual power production results indicate that the wave energy converter design with damper plate produces 41 higher mean annual energy production than the wave energy converter design with streamlined reacting body at a representative location near the west coast of vancouver island british columbia canada keywords wave energy conversion model testing time domain power take off self reacting point absorbers heave plate hydrodynamics 1 introduction self reacting point absorbers srpas are wave energy converters wecs that convert energy from wave driven relative motion between two or more bodies into useful energy forms budal 1985 srpas typically employ a buoyant surface piercing body referred to as the float which driven by waves reacts against a second body referred to as the reacting body the resulting relative motions and forces across these bodies are converted into useful energy by means of a power take off pto two design strategies are evident on axi symmetric heaving srpa devices the key difference between these strategies is the shape of the reacting body the two srpa designs that are the focus of this study are shown in fig 1 the first denoted wec a is modelled after a wavebob wavebob ltd ireland device featuring a surface piercing float and a streamlined reacting body the second denoted wec b is modelled after a powerbuoy ocean power technologies inc usa wec b uses the same float as wec a but its reacting body has a smaller water plane cross sectional area and features a large diameter heave plate this work is to be taken as a companion to the work by beatty et al 2015 to systematically compare the power production of wec a and wec b given independently optimized ptos in this study as well as in beatty et al 2015 all motions are constrained to the heave direction to highlight the hydrodynamic design considerations that dominate the wec s power performance to facilitate a systematic comparison of wecs a and b with independently optimized ptos experimental tests of the physical model wecs with advanced pto emulation will be undertaken a time domain numerical model that contains coefficients extracted from experimental hydrodynamic characterization of the wecs will be developed experimental data gathered during a series of tests in operating conditions will be used to validate the time domain wec model and finally the time domain model will be used to assess each wecs production over a wider range of operational sea conditions relative to the wec comparisons in regular monchromatic waves reported by beatty et al 2015 the current investigation undertakes comparisons of wec a to wec b in irregular panchromatic waves 1 1 literature review previous experimental and numerical studies of srpas focus predominantly on single device designs french 1985 korde 1999 weinstein et al 2003 hals et al 2007 beatty et al 2009 elwood et al 2010 candido and justino 2011 henriques et al 2012 de andres et al 2013 wu et al 2014 fonseca et al 2016 from these studies it is difficult to draw equitable comparisons among different srpa designs due to differences in mooring and pto control strategies and insufficient characterization of experimental and numerical uncertainties a handful of comparative studies of wec devices have been identified fifteen wecs of various classes were compared experimentally in terms of capture width and cost by meyer et al 2002 eight wecs of different class and operating principle were compared by previsic et al 2004 at a high level based on performance data reported by device developers babarit et al 2012 2011 conducted numerical assessments of eight distinct wec designs in irregular waves including one wavebob style srpa similar to wec a in this study based on mean energy production and key cost indicators in more recent work babarit 2015 compiled and presented annual performance data for many wec technologies this final study is a useful overview of the performance achieved by wecs to date across wec archetypes however it is unsuitable for understanding the performance benefits associated with specific design strategies within a given wec archetype a couple of parametric studies that involve srpa bodies are as follows first diamond et al 2015 present an experimental and numerical analysis of an axi symmetric srpa employing adjustable flaps on the reacting body to modulate reacting body added mass in time to maximize wec performance although the numerical model and subsequent parametric study accounts for dynamic effects associated with time varying mass the analysis neglects viscous drag and is limited to regular waves second liang and zuo 2017 seek to build on the srpa comparisons in regular waves reported in beatty et al 2015 by extending the analysis to irregular waves however since liang and zuo s linearized frequency domain model lacks experimental validation and neglects radiation memory and non linear drag effects their results for irregular waves are questionable no detailed studies comparing the performance of alternative axisymmetric srpa reacting body shapes in irregular waves with experimental validation have been identified in an equitable model scale experimental and numerical power production comparison study of two srpas such as wec a to wec b it is paramount that each wec be assessed with individually optimized ptos three key requirements follow 1 the pto simulator on the physical model must have sufficient resolution and repeatability for setting its impedance 2 numerical models derived from experimental results must sufficiently capture each wec s heave motion dynamics for a broad range of irregular wave conditions and 3 each wec s hydrodynamics must be well characterized because the optimal pto settings and numerical models for each wec are highly dependent on knowledge of the complete suite of hydrodynamic parameters a handful of recent works are relevant to requirement 1 pto emulation on the physical model two versions of an opt powerbuoy style srpa similar to wec b of the current work were previously developed and tested at 1 33 scale li et al 2012 previsic et al 2014 neary et al 2014 however due to the inherent limitations of the passive mechanical pto simulators on those models the results were coarse and this ultimately limited the numerical model validation efforts yu and li 2013 conversely villegas and van der schaaf 2011 and mackay et al 2012 describe large scale 1 20 experimental model srpas with advanced approaches to pto emulation the srpa physical models in those studies use feedback controlled linear motors which in concert with suitable instrumentation and control systems provide for highly resolved and repeatable control over the pto force behavior although the advanced pto emulation strategies proved successful neither of the studies state power performance of the srpa device in a comprehensive manner that facilitates comparison to other srpa designs for adhering to requirement 2 above there exists well known dynamics modelling approaches both in the frequency domain and time domain however frequency domain techniques should be avoided for modelling wecs in irregular waves price et al 2009 the time domain approach by cummins 1962 is predominant for wec dynamics modelling in irregular waves although taghipour et al 2008 have investigated and presented viable alternatives recent literature presenting time domain models of srpas include studies by babarit et al 2012 and de andres et al 2013 babarit et al applied the cummins approach to model heave pitch surge and relative motions of the float reacting body in the absence of moorings de andres presents results from a heave motion constrained time domain model olaya et al 2014 developed a heave constrained time domain model of an srpa through a sensitivity study of viscous drag on the simulation results olaya states that viscous drag cannot be neglected however no procedure is presented for specifying the viscous drag coefficient for all three of these studies experimental data validating the component hydrodynamic models is not available finally on literature relevant to requirement 3 hydrodynamic characterization relevant studies have been published for both generic floating bodies and for specific srpa designs ringwood et al 2016 inviscid analyses are routinely done with bem software packages but olaya et al 2013 presents a semi analytical approach to obtain inviscid radiation diffraction loads on an srpa viscid loads such as morison drag are often estimated with high uncertainty from literature whereas experimental characterization by means of free decay tests costello et al 2014 journe and massie 2001 or forced oscillation tests can improve the certainty of the estimation 2 methods 2 1 numerical methods 2 1 1 linear hydrodynamics the boundary element method bem code wamit wamit inc 2012 was used to obtain the inviscid hydrodynamic coefficients of wec a and b namely added mass radiation damping and excitation force the panel meshes used in the analyses of wec a and b are shown in fig 2 the spatial domain was infinite in the horizontal dimensions and the water depth set to 2 0m a three body analysis of each wec configuration was performed of the float body 1 and the reacting body body 2 and body 3 was a numerical moon pool lid introduced at the water surface in the annular gap between the float and reacting body the moon pool lid mitigates erroneous bem numerical solutions such as negative added mass and unrealistically high radiation damping in the fluid domain arising from resonant oscillations the moon pool lid is not considered in any further dynamic analyses of the current work for each body j the frequency dependent added mass a j j ω radiation damping b j j ω and complex excitation forces coefficient x j ω are computed using the bem analysis from the bem solutions the float reacting body radiation coupling terms a 12 ω a 21 ω and b 12 ω b 21 ω are relatively small in comparison to the diagonal terms a 11 ω

section 3 1 1 are complemented with additional nonlinear forces of viscous drag sliding friction and the linear pto reaction force heave displacement velocity and acceleration of the float and reacting body are represented respectively by 2 1 vectors ξ t ξ t and ξ t m a is a 2 2 mass matrix combined with the infinite frequency added mass the remaining terms are 2 1 vectors where f e t are excitation forces f r t are radiation forces with added mass at infinite frequency removed f c t are coulomb friction forces f v t are viscous drag forces f k t are hydrostatic forces and finally f p

bounds at each point in time t the radiation convolutions are evaluated from t 10 to t and the excitation convolutions are evaluated from t 10 to t 10 these convolution integral bounds were chosen to be wide enough so that kernel functions k e j and k r j have approached zero in the time ranges plots of the kernel functions in addition to the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients are given

coefficient and v f j t is taken as the vertical component of the fluid velocity at the depth location of the characteristic diameter refer to figure a 15 for locations of these reference depths the float characteristic diameter d 1 is taken as the float outer diameter while d 2 for wec a is taken as the largest diameter and d 2 for wec b is taken as the diameter of the damper plate 7 f v t ρ π 8

coefficient c p t o between the float j 1 and the reacting body j 2 as seen in eq 9 9 f p t o t c p t o c p t o c p t o c p t o ξ t the selection of c p t o to maximize wave energy conversion in a given wave condition is discussed in the next section a 4th order runge kutta fixed time step integrator with a time step of 0 065 s is used for the time simulations the time domain model runs at approximately 10 1 real time no attempt is made to approximate the convolution integrals in the dynamics equations with a cpu time saving technique such as state space methods jefferys 1984 yu and falnes 1995 taghipour et al 2008 2 2 1 selection of pto damping the selection of the pto damping coefficient c p t o that maximizes power capture in a regular monochromatic wave of frequency ω can be obtained analytically by impedance mathcing for a two body wec the analytical solution is presented in falnes 2002 and utilized in beatty et al 2015 however the analytical relation derived from impedance matching does not apply to panchromatic or irregular waves to overcome this a numerical optimization is used to find an optimal c p t o value for each panchromatic wave spectrum considered the optimization is to choose c p t o that maximizes power capture p given by eq 10 where s ω f h s t p is the variance density spectrum that represents the panchromatic wave conditions the

optimization for each wec and each of the irregular wave test conditions discussed further in sec 3 2 4 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 experimental setup the test facility dimensions 58m 4 5m x 2m depth was memorial university s ocean engineering research center located in st john s newfoundland canada fig 3 shows the locations of the wave probes relative to the wecs and the heave motion constraint apparatus details on the rationale for tank and model sizing considerations are available in beatty et al 2015 summary specifications of the physical models are given in table 2 a feedback controlled linear actuator was used for pto emulation on this project as was done by zurkinden et al 2014 mackay et al 2012 and villegas and van der schaaf 2011 the force feedback control enabled the linear actuator to exert the desired state dependent force for pto emulation the control systems were developed in ni labview and implemented in real time on an ni pxi chassis running at 50 hz for sampling and control the linear motor linmot ps01 37 120 250 n maximum force has a maximum travel of 0 28 m and weighs under 3 kg relative displacement is measured with a laser displacement sensor micro epsilon optoncdt 1402 600 range 600 mm resolution of 80 μm the pto force was measured by a 500 n capacity s type tension compression load cell accelerations of the float and reacting bodies were measured via accelerometers analog devices adxl203 with 1 7 g range a kalman filter enabled the synthesis of a real time velocity signal from the measured displacement and acceleration signals 2 3 2 decay tests records of the displacement signals from the free oscillations of initially displaced bodies were used to extract morison drag c d j and coulomb friction c c j coefficients for the reacting bodies of wec a and wec b in the data analysis the coefficient extraction was done by solving an unconstrained optimization problem the goal is to minimize eq 11 which defines the mean squared error between experimental and time domain model derived displacement vectors of length n the design variables are c d j and c c j the optimization was carried out with the nelder mead simplex

influence of the pto were undertaken to separately assess the validity of the time domain model for each body the tests are performed individually on each floating body allowed to freely move in the heave direction and subjected to waves the rao is defined as the amplitude of the body s heave displacement ξ ˆ j normalized by the wave amplitude η as a function of frequency as a validate method the time domain modelled raos are compared to experimental raos the experimental raos were obtained from two methods 1 regular monochromatic wave tests over a range of frequencies where ξ ˆ j ω η was obtained from the amplitudes of the monochromatic heave and wave signals 2 irregular waves where the wave field is generated as a broadband signal low pass filtered white noise in this method the rao is derived from the ratio of discrete fourier transforms of the heave response ξ j t and wave probe signal η t further detail on the rao test methods can be found in beatty et al 2015 2 4 1 irregular wave selection analysis of a ten year set of hourly hind cast wave data validated by wave measurements from the west coast of bc canada hiles et al 2014 was used to select the sea states applied in the physical model tests in an approach similar to that presented by cahill and lewis 2013 a contour plot showing the contribution of individual sea states to the annual wave occurrences is used to reveal the sea states of importance for wec operation a contour plot of the sea state frequency of occurrence is shown in fig 4 the conditions for the experimental tests are also shown in fig 4 the conditions were chosen to cover as much of the high occurrence contours as possible while aiming to avoid wave maker limitations wec end stop collisions and wave over topping of the wec bodies the test conditions were synthesized by the wave maker using the pierson moscowitz spectrum shape due to control and hardware limitations of the wave making facilities it was not possible to repeat identical wave conditions across multiple tests however the similarity of conditions tested for wec a and wec b as evidenced in fig 4 is deemed sufficient 2 4 2 power capture tests of power capture for wecs a and b were done in 25 synthesized pierson moscowitz spectra within the region indicated in fig 4 the mean power capture for each test was calculated by eq 12 where f p t o t is the instantaneous pto force signal provided by the load cell and u r t is the instantaneous relative velocity signal provided by the displacement sensor and accelerometer kalman sensor fusion technique discussed in section 3 2 1 12 p p t f p t o t u r t capture width a measure that quantifies the production capability of the wec with respect to the available power in the wave conditions is defined by eq 13 13 cw p j where j ρ g c g ω s ω d ω is the wave power transport per unit crest width and the group velocity c g ω is evaluated for intermediate depth using the airy wave relations furthermore the capture width can be normalized by a characteristic dimension to form a metric given by eq 14 known as capture width ratio 14 cwr cw l where the characteristic dimension l in units of meters can be developed in a number of ways for various wecs 3 results 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 decay tests the experimental and time domain model results for the freely decaying oscillations of the initially displaced reacting bodies are shown in fig 5 for each decay test convergence of the optimization algorithm was achieved in approximately 60 iterations with objective function and design variable tolerances set to 10 6 the model results shown in fig 5 are from the time domain model with converged optimal morison drag c d and coulomb friction c c coefficient pairings for reacting body a three heave decay tests were analyzed with the resulting optimum coefficient pairs c d 2 c c 2 2 3 0 0081 1 5 0 011 1 75 0 010 fig 5a shows the first of the three tests for reacting body b one decay test as seen in fig 5b was analyzed with the resulting optimum pairing c d 2 c c 2 2 8 0 0051 the fits between the experimental and numerical results with converged optimal c d 2 and c c 2 as shown in fig 5 are quite close however the spread of the results for reacting body a c d 2 1 5 2 3 showed further analysis was needed to select a single set of coefficients to assess whether the converged values are meaningful grids of the objective function eq 11 were directly computed in the solution regions defined in the parameter space 0 c d 2 6 0 c c 2 0 02 n surfaces of the objective functions are shown in fig 6 in fig 6a and b the objective function surfaces are shown the surfaces are flipped so that optima are viewed as maxima rather than minima to aid visual interpretation five contours around the solution surface optima maxima and the converged optima are shown fig 6a and b shows that the optimizations converged to the global optimum of the objective function for both reacting body a and reacting body b the results for reacting body a seen in fig 6a show the gradient of the objective function is low in the solution region in comparison to the gradient in the outer regions of the c d 2 c c 2 parameter space however the contours indicate the region is convex and smooth in the local area the results for reacting body b seen in fig 6b show the gradient of the objective function is also relatively low in the solution region in comparison to the outer regions the contours indicate the region is convex however the jagged contours indicate the objective function is less smooth in the local area than the decay objective function for reacting body a due to the relatively low gradients of the objective functions in the solution region the resolution and robustness of the method for extracting drag and friction could be improved with repetition of decay tests and subsequent application of the optimization method based on these analyses the drag coefficients for reacting bodies a and b are taken as 1 9 and 2 8 respectively the coulomb friction coefficients for reacting bodies a and b are taken as 0 0051 n and 0 0097 n respectively the difference in the coulomb friction coefficients between reacting bodies a and b despite their use of the same linear guide system can be explained by slight bearing alignment and bearing lubrication differences due to the apparatus disassembly assembly operations the float heave drag coefficient is taken as 1 0 consistent with babarit et al 2011 2012 the coulomb friction of the float is taken conservatively as the higher value of those determined from the reacting body tests 0 0097 n because the physical model of the float uses the same linear guides as the reacting bodies although the graphical approach above provides a verification of the identified reacting body hydrodynamic coefficients the optimization approach presented in section 3 2 2 is proven effective and may be used in future coefficient identification problems where a graphical approach may not be feasible 3 2 validation of time domain model 3 2 1 response amplitude operators experimental and numerical raos of reacting bodies a and b with f p t o 0 are plotted in fig 7 a and b as a strategy to avoid end stop collisions during regular wave rao tests the wave amplitude was varied between tests for reacting body a 0 7 cm η 3 9 cm and for reacting body b 1 5 cm η 6 cm three numerically generated heave rao curves are shown for both reacting bodies a and b each corresponding to a different wave amplitude as shown in fig 7a and b the natural frequency of reacting body a is approximately 2 0 rad s whereas the natural frequency of reacting body b is approximately 0 75 rad s reacting body a behaves as a wave follower at frequencies below 1 5 rad s at 2 0 rad s the resonance condition is approached and heave displacement amplitudes on the order of 5 η are observed reacting body b due to high damping from the plate exhibits much lower heave displacement amplitudes below 1 5 rad s and approximately zero amplitude response above 1 5 rad s there is excellent agreement between the experimental and time domain model heave raos the rao results show that the time domain model when supplied with bem derived radiation and diffraction kernels along with experimentally derived c d and c c is valid in regular wave conditions with c p t o 0 in the following sections the time domain model data is tested against experimental data gathered during pto operation where c p t o 0 3 2 2 power capture data from example wec power production tests along with time domain model results are given in figs 8 and 9 the wave condition is a pm spectrum with h s 0 073m t p 2 26sec denoted wave condition irr3 table 1 gives wave conditions and corresponding c p t o levels the data plotted are water surface elevation relative float reacting body displacement and mechanical power capture as a function of time fig 8 shows the time series for the full test duration and fig 9 shows the time series for an 80sec portion 140 s t 220 s the wave probe signals in fig 8a and b indicate maximum wave heights of 15 cm the zoomed in wave probe plots in fig 9a and b shows that wave probes a and d produced very close but not identical water surface elevation signals with small differences more pronounced at peaks and troughs the differences in the wave probe signals though small are likely due to a combination of tank wall effects and the inclusion of radiated waves from the wec since the wave probe measurements were made in situ from the relative displacement time series shown in fig 8c and d the time domain model output shows strong correlation to the experimental model results peaks and troughs in the experimental and modelled relative displacements align reasonably well temporally though some error in phase is exhibited upon closer inspection via fig 9c and d it is evident some peaks and troughs in the relative displacement signal are over under predicted by the time domain model the rmse between the time domain model and experimental results over the full test duration for both wecs is 5 mm which amounts to 10 of the maximum relative displacements in the tests fig 8e and f shows the complete mechanical power time series and fig 9e and f shows the 80s extracts in these power time series the time domain model output is strongly correlated to the experimental model results as wave groups arrive at the wec the time domain model clearly predicts the general power output behavior well however many of the power production peaks from the time domain model results are under over predicted and or delayed the experimental mean power in wave condition irr3 for wecs a and b is 0 73w and 0 51w respectively the time domain modelled mean power for wecs a and b is 1 1w and 0 61w respectively to summarize the results from all sea states tested mean mechanical power from experimental tests and from the time domain model output for both wecs a and b are shown in fig 10 excluding six outlier tests for wec a sea states 3 4 8 11 13 resulting from float over topping events and some pto force control instability the time domain model is shown to predict the mean mechanical power output within 35 error for both wecs summary plots of normalized rms error between experimental and numerical relative heave displacement for both wecs a and b in all sea states tested are shown in fig 11 the normalized rms error of relative displacement is similar in magnitude for both wecs but the highest observed error is seen for wec b since viscous drag comprises a large proportion of the forces on reacting body b the discrepancy in relative displacement is likely due to inaccuracy in the wec b reacting body drag coefficient specifically the inaccuracy in the drag coefficient can be attributed to three sources 1 the drag coefficient was obtained from a single decay test rather than for an average of over three as done for wec a 2 due to the high drag of the damper plate the decaying oscillations within that test were damped out much faster than for wec b thus reducing the data for which the fitting scheme was applied hence weakening the fit 3 drag coefficients for oscillating flow are known to vary with frequency and amplitude of oscillation and the drag coefficient for reacting body b was extracted at the natural frequency of reacting body b a low frequency compared to the wave frequencies applied during the power production tests for calculation of average power conversion of the wec designs in irregular waves the time domain model are validated by fig 10 however the choice of sea conditions within the experimental test validation exercises have not illuminated significant power conversion performance differences between the wec designs in the following section the validated time domain model is used to assess and compare the wec a and b power production characteristics in a wider range of sea states 3 3 performance matrices to undertake a comparison of wec a and b s power production levels in a wider range of wave conditions than those shown in table 1 the time domain model was run for each wec over a grid of 144 total sea states covering model scale h s 0 02 0 35 m and t p 8 5 sec representing full scale h s 0 5 8 75 m and t p 4 25 sec for each of the 144 sea states the optimum passive pto damping was chosen using the method discussed in section 3 1 3 for each simulation the water surface elevation was synthesized from a pierson moscowitz spectrum using the random phase model contour plots of mean power production for each wec as a function of h s and t p are shown in fig 12 contour plots of capture width are shown in fig 13 observing the power contours and capture width contours of figs 12 and 13 wec a s production reaches a higher peak value but wec b shows a greater bandwidth of power production in comparison to wec a wec b s power production and capture width are less sensitive to variation in the peak wave period therefore wec b is expected to capture more power from wider range of conditions this confirms observations made about wec b s bandwidth in comparison to wec a s made in beatty et al 2015 although figs 12 and 13 show clear differences in performance characteristics of wec a and b with regard to sea state it is not clear which wec has an advantage at a specific offshore site consequently the following section estimates the annual production of each wec at a specific location 3 4 performance off the pacific coast of north america for a representative location near hesquiaht sound located off the west coast of bc canada ten years of hourly parametric wave data from hiles et al 2014 is used to assess the energy conversion performance of wec a and wec b the mean wave power transport at the site is j 29 5 kw m the capture width contours given by fig 13 for wec a and b are froude scaled by geometric scale ratio α 25 then interpolated and multiplied by the wave power transport for each hour in the wave data to account for a realistic power shutdown mode in extreme conditions power production is set to null for h s 5m the results are shown in fig 14 observing fig 14 the power production of wec b is often greater than for wec a in the west coast of bc canada sea conditions the data shows that wec b produces greater power output than wec a for 62 of the data records the average power output at the west coast bc location for wec a is 51 7 kw and for wec b 73 1 kw there are visible points where power production is zero indicating when conditions exceed h s 5m and both wecs are in survival mode the mean annual energy production maep for wec a is 453 mwh and for wec b is 641 mwh it can be concluded that the greater performance bandwidth of wec b is driving its increased annual production compared to wec a and that wec b has a distinct economic advantage at the location studied 3 5 sensitivity of wec performance to drag coefficients analysis of heave decay tests on the reacting bodies discussed in section 4 1 1 yielded a range of drag coefficients for the wec a reacting body and only a single test was available to determine the drag coefficient for the wec b reacting body further the float drag coefficient applied was a value informed by the literature not experiments a sensitivity study was executed to gain insight into the uncertainty in the wec performance associated with the drag coefficient assumptions the power performance analysis at the west coast bc location was re executed for both wecs and for drag coefficient values of 50 and 150 of the experimentally calculated coefficient values results are summarized in table 3 the sensitivity results in table 3 show for both wecs that increases in each of the float and reacting body drag coefficients while holding the other body s drag coefficient constant by 50 causes reductions of approximately 10 in maep over the 10 year data set for wec a reductions of the float and reacting body drag coefficients by 50 also causes reductions in meap these reductions may be explained by the lack of accounting for the perturbed viscous drag coefficients in the pto damping optimization calculations discussed in section 3 1 3 thus leading to non optimal c p t o levels for the perturbed cases within the sensitivity study similarly for wec b a 50 reduced float drag coefficient leads to a small reduction of meap however a 50 reduced reacting body drag coefficient leads to a small increase of meap it is likely that the effects of non optimality of c p t o as well as a reduction of energy dissipation into viscous drag are affecting the results in summary the sensitivity to drag results indicate the range of change in maep is 11 to 3 for associated with changes in drag coefficients of 50 3 6 alternative performance measures there are other ways to summarize the efficiency of wecs including capture width and capture width ratio defined by eqs 13 and 14 the average capture widths for wec a and b at the west coast bc canada location are formulated into average capture width ratios with the characteristic dimension l determined in three ways as the float diameter as the square root of the wetted surface area and as the cube root of the submerged volume the individual average capture width ratios are denoted cwr d cwr a and cwr v respectively results are given in table 4 the results in table 4 indicate that wec b has a greater efficiency of conversion from wave power to mechanical power on average at the west coast bc location regardless of the chosen capture width measure however because wec a has a lower surface area than wec b wec a is viewed as more competitive with wec b in terms of cwr a lastly because wec b has a much lower submerged volume than wec a wec b s performance advantage based on cwr v is amplified in comparison to wec a s performance 4 conclusions an experimental and numerical comparison of two variations of two body heaving self reacting point absorber wecs in irregular waves was presented the two body wecs denoted a and b are constrained to move in the heave direction only time domain models of the wecs based on cummins equation with additional terms for pto force coulomb friction and morison drag were developed and validated using experimental data free motion decay test data was used to calibrate the morison drag and coulomb friction coefficients by minimizing the squared error between time domain model and experimental data the time domain models are validated by way of experimental results of the wecs producing power in 25 irregular sea states the time domain models are accurate to within 20 of the normalized rmse in relative displacements and 35 in mechanical power after experimental validation in irregular wave conditions the time domain model was used to compare the power production of the wecs in a wide range of conditions the average power and capture width comparisons from the time domain model over an expanded range of wave conditions indicate wec a the wec with a streamlined reacting body has a greater peak production capability but wec b with a damper plate reacting body features a wider bandwidth and ultimately better performance comparisons of hourly power production over a multi year data set from a representative location off the west coast bc canada suggest on average wec a with the streamlined reacting body produces 51 7 kw and wec b with the damper plate reacting body produces 73 1 kw
