7585,a sound understanding of erosive processes at different scales can contribute substantially to the design of suitable management strategies the main aim of this work was to evaluate key factors at the pedon scale that cause soil erosion to occur to achieve this goal we quantified infiltration permeability soil losses and runoff volumes in a small southern spanish catchment cultivated with olive orchards to assess which factor contributed most to speeding up soil erosion a spearman rank coefficient and principal components analysis were carried out the results confirmed low infiltration values 11 8 mm h 1 in the surface soil layers and high permeability values 24 6 mm h 1 in the sub surface soil layers and produced an average soil loss of 19 7 g m 2 and average runoff coefficients of 26 1 statistical analyses showed that i the generation of runoff was closely correlated with soil loss and ii an increase in the vegetation cover helped reduce soil erosion in comparison to larger areas such as a catchment the pedon scale produced lower or similar soil losses and runoff coefficients in rainfall simulation conditions although the influence of vegetation cover as a control factor was also detected keywords soil erosion infiltration permeability olive orchards pedon scale 1 introduction the quality of the soil is one of the cornerstones of successful agriculture and it is also

living tekaya et al 2016 authors such as durán zuazo et al 2011 and kairis et al 2013 have warned about underestimating soil degradation processes in olive orchards the extreme complexity of the different erosive processes taking place in agricultural areas at different spatiotemporal scales such as inter rill erosion gullies headcut retreats piping cracks excess of flood waters and mass movement marzolff and poesen 2009 make it increasingly difficult for the scientific community to foresee land degradation problems which may prove irreparable prasuhn 2011 runoff generation and water erosion are typically assessed in olive orchard catchments by applying empirical models such as rusle revised universal soil loss equation or the curve number method di stefano et al 2016 parras

sediment collectors gómez et al 2009 sastre et al 2016 with all of these methods soil losses and runoff volumes are up to 50 times higher on bare soils than on covered soils this may be due to the wide variability of controlling factors such as climate soil properties topography and land management which leads to dominant erosive processes taking place on farms in the mediterranean basin that have been monitored over the last decade there has been considerable discussion about the factors that enhance soil erosion in olive orchards fleskens and stroosnijder 2007 gómez et al 2008 to develop sustainable land management systems and naturally based solutions keesstra et al 2018 which are effective in avoiding soil erosion it is essential to understand soil erosion as well as the factors that control it at different scales e g kinnell 2016 nearing et al 1999 in particular at the pedon scale 1 m2 it is vital to understand the activation mechanisms of soil erosion which determine hydrological and erosive responses at larger scales and where connectivity of the different sub processes involved can be described more easily lópez vicente et al 2013 among the drivers that have been recognized as facilitating soil erosion are i the inclination and length of the slopes kinnell 2009 nadal romero et al 2014 ii shallow soils and highly erodible parent materials cerdà 1999a ruiz

general soil development or chemical degradation status salome et al 2014 understanding hydrological and erosion processes at the pedon scale is therefore essential to complete the information obtained at larger spatial scales cammeraat 2004 and to design suitable management strategies blavet et al 2009 chevigny et al 2014 in this research the most crucial environmental factors such as vegetation stone cover local slopes and soil surface roughness were measured in order to assess their impact on the hydrological and erosive responses in a small catchment of olive orchards the specific aims of this research were i to measure the variability of the infiltration and permeability values throughout the catchment taking into account its local features and ii to quantify and compare runoff generation and soil loss in different points of the studied area this was achieved by using a combination of three different measurement methods namely a single ring infiltrometer sri a guelph permeameter gp and a small portable rainfall simulator in addition the results at the pedon scale were compared with the available 5 year data series on runoff and soil losses in the outlet taguas et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the puente genil micro catchment is located to the west of the province of cordoba spain 37 4 n 4 8 w fig 1 and covers an area of 6 1 ha it extends from 213 to 262 m a s l with an average slope gradient of 10 and a maximum gradient of 20 taguas et al 2013 the average annual rainfall is 400 mm with the highest amounts falling from september to january the average daily rainfall with a 2 yr return period is 43 1 mm taguas et al 2010a b the climate is typically mediterranean with an average daily temperature of 26 5 c in the hottest month july and 8 4 c in the coldest one january the parent material is limestone which is visible in outcrops all over the catchment the main soil types as described taguas et al 2013 are calcic haplic cambisol types iuss working group wrb 2014 the soil profile is characterized by i loamy sand sand 77 silt 8 and clay 15 ii soil ph values of 8 8 iii bulk density up to 1 60 g cm 3 iv average carbonate content 48 8 of weight and v organic matter content in the top horizon between 0 2 and 1 4 land use management practices are focused on the production of olives and olive oil of the arbequina variety the management type is no tillage with a spontaneous grass cover that grows in winter and spring in the lanes between olive tree rows the grass cover is regularly controlled once or twice a year october and march or april using herbicides or machinery the olive yield in the catchment is relatively low 2000 kg ha 1 and the management system can be considered as the extensive type 2 2 methods 2 2 1 infiltration capacity and soil permeability a guelph permeameter gp and a single ring infiltrometer sri were used to measure permeability and infiltration rates at the pedon scale at different points in the catchment fig 1 a total of 20 permeability measurements were taken following the procedure described in rodrigo comino et al 2016b the total duration for each run was 30 mins the water level was recorded every 2 mins and then the steady rates cm min 1 were calculated by averaging the measurement results after the gp measurements the permeability or water flux eq 1 and saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs eq 2 were calculated according to reynolds 1986 whose methodology has been applied by authors such as rodrigo comino et al 2016a b c and xiang 1994 1 permeability

compacted soils with coarse gravely sand with numerous cracks and macro pores e g 0 36 on the contrary the soils in our study are similar to crusted soils with less structure but not clayey or silty like landfill caps liners lacustrine or marine sediments e g 0 01 they should therefore be considered a sub type between compacted and agricultural soils characterized by a fine unstructured texture and degraded by tillage e g 0 04 2 2 2 runoff generation and soil erosion runoff generation and soil erosion were quantified with a small portable rainfall simulator based on the one described by cerdà 1999b and modified by iserloh et al 2012 calibrated reproducible rainfall with an intensity of about 40 mm h 1 was discharged for 30 min from a height of 2 m using a lechler 460 608 nozzle on a 0 28 m2 ring plot this corresponds to a return period of around 2 years taguas et al 2013 the complete device is covered by a rubber tarpaulin to block out external forces such as wind thirty rainfall simulations were carried out following a random sampling strategy to cover all the catchment in every plot stone cover and vegetation cover were quantified by an expert s visual interpretation local slopes were measured with a digital inclinometer and soil roughness estimated by the chain method saleh 1993 each experiment was divided into six intervals 5 min each where runoff and sediment load were collected in sealable plastic bottles runoff was quantified gravimetrically for every interval l or l m 2 and the water in each sample was filtered using fine meshed filter paper to determine after drying at 105 c the sediment load g or g m 2 and sediment concentration g l 1 the runoff and infiltration coefficients were also estimated by subtracting the total sprayed rainfall and collected runoff the time s up to runoff generation was also quantified for each plot antecedent soil moisture and organic matter were also measured however since all the results showed values below 2 it was not considered a relevant factor to be taken into account in this research finally after each experiment the infiltration front was also surveyed in order to achieve this measurement soil profiles were excavated across the ring plot under wet conditions next a measuring tape was fitted across the ring and the maximum infiltrated points were checked every 5 cm 2 3 statistical analysis the average median standard deviations and outliers of the permeability infiltration and kfs were calculated in order to describe the variability inside the catchment fig 2 moreover information on the depth of the soil was also included fig 2a and b for rainfall simulation results runoff sediment load and sediment concentration the same statistic procedures were calculated and depicted in box plots total averages and intervals with the median and average marks continued and discontinued lines respectively as well as the outliers finally the averages and the maximum and minimum depth values of the infiltration fronts of all the experiments were plotted on a linear graph since the data did not follow a normal distribution a spearman rank coefficient was performed after observing the correlations between pairs of variables we were able to distinguish which environmental plot characteristics and soil erosion variables could be correlated to identify the key factors that act as drivers of soil erosion a principal component analysis pca was carried out the pca allowed us to group similar variables into dimensions without distinguishing between independent and dependent variables previously variables were centered and normalized to verify the assumptions we started by applying a kaiser mayer olkin kmo test of sphericity and calculated the coefficients and determinants a pca with an orthogonal rotation method varimax and a correlation matrix using factors with eigenvalues 1 was carried out the variables considered in the analysis should produce the closest possible model of the phenomenon studied which in this case is soil erosion at the pedon scale identifying specifically the most significant variables that affect water soil erosion malinowski 2002 shukla et al 2006 our dataset included eleven variables which were classified into three different groups i hydrological response variables such as runoff coefficient time to runoff generation infiltration and total average infiltration front ii erosional response such as sediment load and sediment concentration and iii explanatory variables such as rainfall intensity local slopes vegetation cover stone cover and soil surface roughness the resulting principal components will also allow us to identify the factors that determine the different effects of rainfall simulations interpreting their influence on each factor we will be able to distinguish how much importance each factor brings to bear in this process at the pedon scale 3 results 3 1 gp based permeability and sri based infiltration fig 2 shows the permeability of the subsoil and infiltration including the calculated kfs supplementary tables 1 and 2 show every location and present the environmental plot characteristics the soil permeability carried out at a depth of 16 3 cm shows a high variability the average permeability is 24 6 mm h 1 with a maximum of 94 4 mm h 1 and a minimum of 5 0 mm h 1 kfs shows lower values with a total average of 7 mm h 1 maximum of 26 6 mm h 1 and minimum of 2 81 mm h 1 the results for infiltration capacity are notably lower with a slightly lower variability than gp measurements the average infiltration rate is 11 8 mm h 1 the maximum 24 6 mm h 1 and the minimum of 0 2 mm h 1 the kfs of the soil surface reaches an average of 2 9 mm h 1 while the range of variation is between 0 2 mm h 1 and 5 7 mm h 1 3 2 runoff sediment concentration and soil loss table 1 presents the total average characteristics of the rainfall simulation plots n 30 and supplementary materials 3 shows the location and environmental plot characteristics of each experiment the average local slope is 9 9 max 18 3 min 4 the average vegetation cover is 29 the highest value reaches up to 70 and the lowest which means that the soil is completely free of vegetation stone cover registers an average of 35 ranging from 5 to 80 soil surface roughness average value is 102 7 reaching a maximum value of 113 finally the average time to runoff generation is 393 s with a maximum value of 1500 s and a minimum of 50 s it should be noted that in the three experiments rainfall simulations did not generate any runoff table 1 in fig 3 a shows the values of runoff volume over time for these experiments and fig 3b the corresponding percentage of infiltration for all the experiments over time the runoff coefficient reaches an average value of 26 1 with an increase from the beginning 2 7 to the last interval 37 4 the soil becomes saturated in a few minutes and runoff is rapidly activated these findings also confirm the low infiltration capacity and kfs on the surface layers in fig 3c the infiltration fronts measured after every experiment show a total average depth of 13 5 7 1 cm maximum depth registered at a single point is 41 cm while 3 cm is the minimum in general the water infiltrated slightly deeper into soil at the edges of the plot which is linked to the disturbance of the soil surface by the steel ring to mark the limits of the plot when the water is able to connect with sub surface layers soil water fluxes permeability increases and a higher more variable saturated hydraulic conductivity than in the surface layers can be noted thus the front line registered poor values for depth of infiltration which was 13 cm at several points 54 this agrees with the experimental patterns of saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements in the study catchment described by taguas et al 2010a the total sediment load see fig 4 ranged between 0 and 105 6 g m 2 with an average value of 19 7 g m 2 total runoff registered values of up to 5 6 l m 2 reaching a maximum amount of 23 4 l m 2 the average sediment concentration was 2 5 g l 1 with a maximum value of 7 2 g l 1 finally with regard to the erosive behaviour per interval during the experiments soil losses were also higher in the first experiments 0 7 g m 2 than the last 4 6 g m 2 coinciding with the runoff water loss values increased from 0 1 l m 2 first interval to 1 3 l m 2 last interval although the sediment concentration was highly variable at the beginning most values remained constant with a variation in range between 2 2 g l 1 and 2 6 g l 1 3 3 factors determining runoff and soil erosion at the pedon scale after scrutinizing the correlation between the factors recorded in the rainfall simulations spearman s rank correlation coefficient table 2 demonstrates the statistical correlations between the variables a spearman s rank correlation coefficient rsp of up to 0 4 is considered in our study total soil loss and sediment concentration depend clearly on runoff with results of rsp 0 809 and rsp 0 809 respectively vegetation cover also affects the runoff rsp 0 475 and sediment load rsp 0 442 which means that while the vegetation cover is low runoff or sediment load increase an increase in infiltration also results in a decrease in runoff coefficient rsp 0 708 and an increase of time to runoff leads to a fall in the sediment concentration rsp 0 548 in table 3 the total variance is shown after performing the pca we can observe that four factors explained a large amount of the variability 76 although the first two components accounted for almost half 43 2 the first component accounting for 23 1 of the variability in the rainfall simulations is mainly determined by parameters related to runoff generation 0 78 infiltration of water 0 871 and soil loss 0 575 in other words the soils showed a wide variability in their hydrological and erosional properties which are not reflected clearly in the characteristics of soil surface the second component illustrates the positive correlation between sediment concentration 0 925 and infiltration 0 932 with lower values the significant impact of vegetation cover 0 345 can be observed in the third component an increase in rainfall intensity 0 88 and sediment load 0 613 results in a high correlation with a decrease in vegetation cover 0 828 low values are also obtained with an increase in runoff coefficient 0 402 finally the last component 4th also shows a significant result by including increases in stone cover 0 776 and slope 0 803 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 water movement runoff infiltration and permeability the soils of the area showed low values of infiltration and kfs on the surface and high permeability in the sub surface layers the pattern observed in the lowest rates of infiltration in the top horizons may be associated to non tillage as has been described by authors in experiments in olive groves at the catchment scale durán zuazo et al 2011 kairis et al 2013 taguas et al 2010a 2015 in fact the lack of vegetation cover fig 5 a and soil compaction may be responsible for significant differences in surface organic matter content bulk density and hydraulic conductivity in the inter rows and the higher infiltration rates fig 5b and macro porosity of the area beneath the tree gómez et al 2008 2009 another related factor could be the observed crust on the soil texture and crust formation not measured in this study showed in fig 5c and 5d also registered in other mediterranean agricultural areas castillo monroy et al 2010 crusts are able to significantly reduce infiltration rates and increase erosion in this way burguet et al 2016 using the water drop penetration time test evaluated short term soil water repellence and demonstrated a high spatiotemporal variability for olive orchards with conventional but unsuitable management like our study area these results are similar to those obtained in this study where infiltration on the surface and the depth of the infiltration front were low and the time to runoff generation was also a few seconds in fact this effect could also be linked to the saturated flow mechanisms ruiz sinoga and martinez murillo 2009 rodrigo comino et al 2017a as at catchment scales compaction bare soils soil crusts and soil water repellence could be associated to a hortonian flow type whose effects are illustrated by the presence of rills and ephemeral gullies durán zuazo et al 2011 kairis et al 2013 taguas et al 2015 our results also showed a high variability in infiltration and permeability rates thus confirming that local factors clearly control certain hot spots in the catchment which are the points that need most urgent protection parras alcántara et al 2016 gp results showed that at the sub surface layers from 10 cm to 25 cm permeability and kfs are higher than on the surface which could be due to the fact the impact of soil compaction or the soil crust is less in this study we observed that very high runoff values 5 l m 2 or 26 runoff coefficient can be observed at the pedon scale this agrees with the pattern observed in the catchment particularly during dry cycles taguas et al 2010b 2013 2015 where a few very erosive events with runoff coefficients over 30 were responsible for most annual runoff and soil losses moreover taguas et al 2015 also linked the formation of gullies to rainfall events with maximum intensities of 30 mins over a 2 yr return period 4 2 studying drivers to understand soil loss and runoff generation the use of herbicides contributes to bare soils and as a consequence erosion occurs at a faster rate cerdà et al 2017a b in this study total average soil losses of 19 7 g m 2 and maximum values of 105 6 g m 2 were obtained at larger scales with other methodologies several authors have clearly indicated the significant potential for erosion in olive orchards taguas and gómez 2015 taguas et al 2017 it is significant how the average values were close to the average sediment load measured in the outlet of the catchment 15 g m 2 0 15 t ha 1 which were derived from data series of 53 natural events with less intense events taguas et al 2013 however sediment concentration was notably lower than that measured at the catchment scale in taguas et al 2013 where the average was about 15 g l 1 and even lower in spring different erosive processes and event types in terms of intensity and erosivity may account for the differences observed in the generation of rills and gullies in addition the seasonal pattern of rainfall events and non tillage practices also determine antecedent soil moisture soil compaction and rill or ephemeral gully formations the average runoff coefficient measured in the catchment was approximately 7 with a standard deviation of 13 a runoff coefficient of 39 was recorded after a natural event with a maximum intensity of 32 mm h 1 which can be compared to those simulated in the experiments at the pedon scale taguas et al 2010a b 2015 thus it is relevant how at the catchment scale the use of natural spontaneous grass cover seems to be highly effective for soil protection especially when the topography is considered at the catchment scale taguas et al 2015 2017 in our study we have also observed that the main factor driving this high erosion rate is the bare soil surface no vegetation which also controls infiltration conditions the principal component analysis furthermore does not produce results that simplify the process analysis the four principal components detected accounted for only 76 of the total variability in addition they involve all 11 variables only two components cannot explain 60 of the variability the high number of variables considered in the analysis should produce an accurate model of the phenomenon studied however these findings also agree with other research carried out in agricultural fields where the tillage use of herbicides or intensive production has modified the natural dynamic preventing statistical analysis from producing clear results fleskens and stroosnijder 2007 gómez et al 2014 rodrigo comino et al 2016b it is also noteworthy that in the three rainfall simulations where no runoff was obtained the plots were covered with over 30 of vegetation cover and over 60 of stone cover our research has shown that vegetation cover and stones has a significant impact on soil erosion and hydrological processes in these cultivated soils the study site was characterized by slopes from 4 to 18 where lower runoff coefficients may be expected however high values confirmed the high level of activity of hydrological processes in this catchment as reported by other authors in mediterranean olive groves such as in greece kairis et al 2013 jordan kraushaar et al 2014 or israel bughici and wallach 2016 our findings demonstrate that olive farmers should not remove either the spontaneous vegetation cover or the embedded stones from their soils as they contribute to reducing soil losses at least when risk of competition for water with the olive trees is low we did however observe the simple fact that bare soils enhance soil erosion although other authors have also pointed out that other combined environmental conditions interact and may contribute to its acceleration such as i an increase in local slopes nadal romero et al 2014 and ii low soil surface roughness and micro topographical changes rodrigo comino et al 2017a b seeger 2007 by making comparisons with other traditional land uses rodrigo comino et al 2016a quantified lower amounts of runoff in the vineyards of málaga 1 6 l m 2 using a small portable rainfall simulator in eastern spain with higher simulated rainfall 55 mm h 1 and 78 mm h 1 a higher total average runoff coefficient was also found 40 in apricot orchards keesstra et al 2016 and 60 in persimmon plantations cerdà et al 2016 finally we would like to stress the importance of researching at the pedon scale into how human changes in soil compaction derived from the removal of vegetation cover increase the soil erosion we would also like to stress the importance of coming up with tools to mitigate the negative impacts of the drivers of this type of soil degradation 5 conclusions a wide variability in infiltration capacity and soil permeability runoff generation and soil loss patterns were quantified and described at the pedon scale in a small catchment of olive trees in southern spain infiltration capacity and related saturated hydraulic conductivity in the top soil were considerably lower than those measured in the sub surface layers we observed that soil loss and runoff generation were clearly related to a decrease in the vegetation cover reduced tillage which affects the topsoil water retention capacity and crust generation was also a possible factor to take into account in comparison to larger areas such as the catchment scale the pedon scale behaves similarly in terms of soil losses and higher in terms of runoff coefficients despite the differences in methods and measuring equipment the average values of soil losses and runoff at the pedon scale of 19 7 g m 2 0 2 mg ha 1 and 5 6 l m 2 are similar to or lower than those observed at the small catchment scale in this study for events of a similar nature acknowledgments we would like to thank the farmers antonio muñoz and esteban ruiz for providing access to the study areas as well as

obtained at larger spatial scales cammeraat 2004 and to design suitable management strategies blavet et al 2009 chevigny et al 2014 in this research the most crucial environmental factors such as vegetation stone cover local slopes and soil surface roughness were measured in order to assess their impact on the hydrological and erosive responses in a small catchment of olive orchards the specific aims of this research were i to measure the variability of the infiltration and permeability values throughout the catchment taking into account its local features and ii to quantify and compare runoff generation and soil loss in different points of the studied area this was achieved by using a combination of three different measurement methods namely a single ring infiltrometer sri a guelph permeameter gp and a small portable rainfall simulator in addition the results at the pedon scale were compared with the available 5 year data series on runoff and soil losses in the outlet taguas et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the puente genil micro catchment is located to the west of the province of cordoba spain 37 4 n 4 8 w fig 1 and covers an area of 6 1 ha it extends from 213 to 262 m a s l with an average slope gradient of 10 and a maximum gradient of 20 taguas et al 2013 the average annual rainfall is 400 mm with the highest amounts falling from september to january the average daily rainfall with a 2 yr return period is 43 1 mm taguas et al 2010a b the climate is typically mediterranean with an average daily temperature of 26 5 c in the hottest month july and 8 4 c in the coldest one january the parent material is limestone which is visible in outcrops all over the catchment the main soil types as described taguas et al 2013 are

average carbonate content 48 8 of weight and v organic matter content in the top horizon between 0 2 and 1 4 land use management practices are focused on the production of olives and olive oil of the arbequina variety the management type is no tillage with a spontaneous grass cover that grows in winter and spring in the lanes between olive tree rows the grass cover is regularly controlled once or twice a year october and march or april using herbicides or machinery the olive yield in the catchment is relatively low 2000 kg ha 1 and the management system can be considered as the extensive type 2 2 methods 2 2 1 infiltration capacity and soil permeability a guelph permeameter gp and a single ring infiltrometer sri were used to measure permeability and infiltration rates at the pedon scale at different points in the catchment fig 1 a total of 20 permeability measurements were taken following the procedure described in rodrigo comino et al 2016b the total duration for each run was 30 mins the water level was recorded every 2 mins and then the steady rates cm min 1 were calculated by averaging the measurement results after the gp measurements the permeability or water flux eq 1 and saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs eq 2 were calculated according to reynolds 1986 whose methodology has been applied by authors such as rodrigo comino et al 2016a b c and xiang 1994 1 permeability

like landfill caps liners lacustrine or marine sediments e g 0 01 they should therefore be considered a sub type between compacted and agricultural soils characterized by a fine unstructured texture and degraded by tillage e g 0 04 2 2 2 runoff generation and soil erosion runoff generation and soil erosion were quantified with a small portable rainfall simulator based on the one described by cerdà 1999b and modified by iserloh et al 2012 calibrated reproducible rainfall with an intensity of about 40 mm h 1 was discharged for 30 min from a height of 2 m using a lechler 460 608 nozzle on a 0 28 m2 ring plot this corresponds to a return period of around 2 years taguas et al 2013 the complete device is covered by a rubber tarpaulin to block out external forces such as wind thirty rainfall simulations were carried out following a random sampling strategy to cover all the catchment in every plot stone cover and vegetation cover were quantified by an expert s visual interpretation local slopes were measured with a digital inclinometer and soil roughness estimated by the chain method saleh 1993 each experiment was divided into six intervals 5 min each where runoff and sediment load were collected in sealable plastic bottles runoff was quantified gravimetrically for every interval l or l m 2 and the water in each sample was filtered using fine meshed filter paper to determine after drying at 105 c the sediment load g or g m 2 and sediment concentration g l 1 the runoff and infiltration coefficients were also estimated by subtracting the total sprayed rainfall and collected runoff the time s up to runoff generation was also quantified for each plot antecedent soil moisture and organic matter were also measured however since all the results showed values below 2 it was not considered a relevant factor to be taken into account in this research finally after each experiment the infiltration front was also surveyed in order to achieve this measurement soil profiles were excavated across the ring plot under wet conditions next a measuring tape was fitted across the ring and the maximum infiltrated points were checked every 5 cm 2 3 statistical analysis the average median standard deviations and outliers of the permeability infiltration and kfs were calculated in order to describe the variability inside the catchment fig 2 moreover information on the depth of the soil was also included fig 2a and b for rainfall simulation results runoff sediment load and sediment concentration the same statistic procedures were calculated and depicted in box plots total averages and intervals with the median and average marks continued and discontinued lines respectively as well as the outliers finally the averages and the maximum and minimum depth values of the infiltration fronts of all the experiments were plotted on a linear graph since the data did not follow a normal distribution a spearman rank coefficient was performed after observing the correlations between pairs of variables we were able to distinguish which environmental plot characteristics and soil erosion variables could be correlated to identify the key factors that act as drivers of soil erosion a principal component analysis pca was carried out the pca allowed us to group similar variables into dimensions without distinguishing between independent and dependent variables previously variables were centered and normalized to verify the assumptions we started by applying a kaiser mayer olkin kmo test of sphericity and calculated the coefficients and determinants a pca with an orthogonal rotation method varimax and a correlation matrix using factors with eigenvalues 1 was carried out the variables considered in the analysis should produce the closest possible model of the phenomenon studied which in this case is soil erosion at the pedon scale identifying specifically the most significant variables that affect water soil erosion malinowski 2002 shukla et al 2006 our dataset included eleven variables which were classified into three different groups i hydrological response variables such as runoff coefficient time to runoff generation infiltration and total average infiltration front ii erosional response such as sediment load and sediment concentration and iii explanatory variables such as rainfall intensity local slopes vegetation cover stone cover and soil surface roughness the resulting principal components will also allow us to identify the factors that determine the different effects of rainfall simulations interpreting their influence on each factor we will be able to distinguish how much importance each factor brings to bear in this process at the pedon scale 3 results 3 1 gp based permeability and sri based infiltration fig 2 shows the permeability of the subsoil and infiltration including the calculated kfs supplementary tables 1 and 2 show every location and present the environmental plot characteristics the soil permeability carried out at a depth of 16 3 cm shows a high variability the average permeability is 24 6 mm h 1 with a maximum of 94 4 mm h 1 and a minimum of 5 0 mm h 1 kfs shows lower values with a total average of 7 mm h 1 maximum of 26 6 mm h 1 and minimum of 2 81 mm h 1 the results for infiltration capacity are notably lower with a slightly lower variability than gp measurements the average infiltration rate is 11 8 mm h 1 the maximum 24 6 mm h 1 and the minimum of 0 2 mm h 1 the kfs of the soil surface reaches an average of 2 9 mm h 1 while the range of variation is between 0 2 mm h 1 and 5 7 mm h 1 3 2 runoff sediment concentration and soil loss table 1 presents the total average characteristics of the rainfall simulation plots n 30 and supplementary materials 3 shows the location and environmental plot characteristics of each experiment the average local slope is 9 9 max 18 3 min 4 the average vegetation cover is 29 the highest value reaches up to 70 and the lowest which means that the soil is completely free of vegetation stone cover registers an average of 35 ranging from 5 to 80 soil surface roughness average value is 102 7 reaching a maximum value of 113 finally the average time to runoff generation is 393 s with a maximum value of 1500 s and a minimum of 50 s it should be noted that in the three experiments rainfall simulations did not generate any runoff table 1 in fig 3 a shows the values of runoff volume over time for these experiments and fig 3b the corresponding percentage of infiltration for all the experiments over time the runoff coefficient reaches an average value of 26 1 with an increase from the beginning 2 7 to the last interval 37 4 the soil becomes saturated in a few minutes and runoff is rapidly activated these findings also confirm the low infiltration capacity and kfs on the surface layers in fig 3c the infiltration fronts measured after every experiment show a total average depth of 13 5 7 1 cm maximum depth registered at a single point is 41 cm while 3 cm is the minimum in general the water infiltrated slightly deeper into soil at the edges of the plot which is linked to the disturbance of the soil surface by the steel ring to mark the limits of the plot when the water is able to connect with sub surface layers soil water fluxes permeability increases and a higher more variable saturated hydraulic conductivity than in the surface layers can be noted thus the front line registered poor values for depth of infiltration which was 13 cm at several points 54 this agrees with the experimental patterns of saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements in the study catchment described by taguas et al 2010a the total sediment load see fig 4 ranged between 0 and 105 6 g m 2 with an average value of 19 7 g m 2 total runoff registered values of up to 5 6 l m 2 reaching a maximum amount of 23 4 l m 2 the average sediment concentration was 2 5 g l 1 with a maximum value of 7 2 g l 1 finally with regard to the erosive behaviour per interval during the experiments soil losses were also higher in the first experiments 0 7 g m 2 than the last 4 6 g m 2 coinciding with the runoff water loss values increased from 0 1 l m 2 first interval to 1 3 l m 2 last interval although the sediment concentration was highly variable at the beginning most values remained constant with a variation in range between 2 2 g l 1 and 2 6 g l 1 3 3 factors determining runoff and soil erosion at the pedon scale after scrutinizing the correlation between the factors recorded in the rainfall simulations spearman s rank correlation coefficient table 2 demonstrates the statistical correlations between the variables a spearman s rank correlation coefficient rsp of up to 0 4 is considered in our study total soil loss and sediment concentration depend clearly on runoff with results of rsp 0 809 and rsp 0 809 respectively vegetation cover also affects the runoff rsp 0 475 and sediment load rsp 0 442 which means that while the vegetation cover is low runoff or sediment load increase an increase in infiltration also results in a decrease in runoff coefficient rsp 0 708 and an increase of time to runoff leads to a fall in the sediment concentration rsp 0 548 in table 3 the total variance is shown after performing the pca we can observe that four factors explained a large amount of the variability 76 although the first two components accounted for almost half 43 2 the first component accounting for 23 1 of the variability in the rainfall simulations is mainly determined by parameters related to runoff generation 0 78 infiltration of water 0 871 and soil loss 0 575 in other words the soils showed a wide variability in their hydrological and erosional properties which are not reflected clearly in the characteristics of soil surface the second component illustrates the positive correlation between sediment concentration 0 925 and infiltration 0 932 with lower values the significant impact of vegetation cover 0 345 can be observed in the third component an increase in rainfall intensity 0 88 and sediment load 0 613 results in a high correlation with a decrease in vegetation cover 0 828 low values are also obtained with an increase in runoff coefficient 0 402 finally the last component 4th also shows a significant result by including increases in stone cover 0 776 and slope 0 803 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 water movement runoff infiltration and permeability the soils of the area showed low values of infiltration and kfs on the surface and high permeability in the sub surface layers the pattern observed in the lowest rates of infiltration in the top horizons may be associated to non tillage as has been described by authors in experiments in olive groves at the catchment scale durán zuazo et al 2011 kairis et al 2013 taguas et al 2010a 2015 in fact the lack of vegetation cover fig 5 a and soil compaction may be responsible for significant differences in surface organic matter content bulk density and hydraulic conductivity in the inter rows and the higher infiltration rates fig 5b and macro porosity of the area beneath the tree gómez et al 2008 2009 another related factor could be the observed crust on the soil texture and crust formation not measured in this study showed in fig 5c and 5d also registered in other mediterranean agricultural areas castillo monroy et al 2010 crusts are able to significantly reduce infiltration rates and increase erosion in this way burguet et al 2016 using the water drop penetration time test evaluated short term soil water repellence and demonstrated a high spatiotemporal variability for olive orchards with conventional but unsuitable management like our study area these results are similar to those obtained in this study where infiltration on the surface and the depth of the infiltration front were low and the time to runoff generation was also a few seconds in fact this effect could also be linked to the saturated flow mechanisms ruiz sinoga and martinez murillo 2009 rodrigo comino et al 2017a as at catchment scales compaction bare soils soil crusts and soil water repellence could be associated to a hortonian flow type whose effects are illustrated by the presence of rills and ephemeral gullies durán zuazo et al 2011 kairis et al 2013 taguas et al 2015 our results also showed a high variability in infiltration and permeability rates thus confirming that local factors clearly control certain hot spots in the catchment which are the points that need most urgent protection parras alcántara et al 2016 gp results showed that at the sub surface layers from 10 cm to 25 cm permeability and kfs are higher than on the surface which could be due to the fact the impact of soil compaction or the soil crust is less in this study we observed that very high runoff values 5 l m 2 or 26 runoff coefficient can be observed at the pedon scale this agrees with the pattern observed in the catchment particularly during dry cycles taguas et al 2010b 2013 2015 where a few very erosive events with runoff coefficients over 30 were responsible for most annual runoff and soil losses moreover taguas et al 2015 also linked the formation of gullies to rainfall events with maximum intensities of 30 mins over a 2 yr return period 4 2 studying drivers to understand soil loss and runoff generation the use of herbicides contributes to bare soils and as a consequence erosion occurs at a faster rate cerdà et al 2017a b in this study total average soil losses of 19 7 g m 2 and maximum values of 105 6 g m 2 were obtained at larger scales with other methodologies several authors have clearly indicated the significant potential for erosion in olive orchards taguas and gómez 2015 taguas et al 2017 it is significant how the average values were close to the average sediment load measured in the outlet of the catchment 15 g m 2 0 15 t ha 1 which were derived from data series of 53 natural events with less intense events taguas et al 2013 however sediment concentration was notably lower than that measured at the catchment scale in taguas et al 2013 where the average was about 15 g l 1 and even lower in spring different erosive processes and event types in terms of intensity and erosivity may account for the differences observed in the generation of rills and gullies in addition the seasonal pattern of rainfall events and non tillage practices also determine antecedent soil moisture soil compaction and rill or ephemeral gully formations the average runoff coefficient measured in the catchment was approximately 7 with a standard deviation of 13 a runoff coefficient of 39 was recorded after a natural event with a maximum intensity of 32 mm h 1 which can be compared to those simulated in the experiments at the pedon scale taguas et al 2010a b 2015 thus it is relevant how at the catchment scale the use of natural spontaneous grass cover seems to be highly effective for soil protection especially when the topography is considered at the catchment scale taguas et al 2015 2017 in our study we have also observed that the main factor driving this high erosion rate is the bare soil surface no vegetation which also controls infiltration conditions the principal component analysis furthermore does not produce results that simplify the process analysis the four principal components detected accounted for only 76 of the total variability in addition they involve all 11 variables only two components cannot explain 60 of the variability the high number of variables considered in the analysis should produce an accurate model of the phenomenon studied however these findings also agree with other research carried out in agricultural fields where the tillage use of herbicides or intensive production has modified the natural dynamic preventing statistical analysis from producing clear results fleskens and stroosnijder 2007 gómez et al 2014 rodrigo comino et al 2016b it is also noteworthy that in the three rainfall simulations where no runoff was obtained the plots were covered with over 30 of vegetation cover and over 60 of stone cover our research has shown that vegetation cover and stones has a significant impact on soil erosion and hydrological processes in these cultivated soils the study site was characterized by slopes from 4 to 18 where lower runoff coefficients may be expected however high values confirmed the high level of activity of hydrological processes in this catchment as reported by other authors in mediterranean olive groves such as in greece kairis et al 2013 jordan kraushaar et al 2014 or israel bughici and wallach 2016 our findings demonstrate that olive farmers should not remove either the spontaneous vegetation cover or the embedded stones from their soils as they contribute to reducing soil losses at least when risk of competition for water with the olive trees is low we did however observe the simple fact that bare soils enhance soil erosion although other authors have also pointed out that other combined environmental conditions interact and may contribute to its acceleration such as i an increase in local slopes nadal romero et al 2014 and ii low soil surface roughness and micro topographical changes rodrigo comino et al 2017a b seeger 2007 by making comparisons with other traditional land uses rodrigo comino et al 2016a quantified lower amounts of runoff in the vineyards of málaga 1 6 l m 2 using a small portable rainfall simulator in eastern spain with higher simulated rainfall 55 mm h 1 and 78 mm h 1 a higher total average runoff coefficient was also found 40 in apricot orchards keesstra et al 2016 and 60 in persimmon plantations cerdà et al 2016 finally we would like to stress the importance of researching at the pedon scale into how human changes in soil compaction derived from the removal of vegetation cover increase the soil erosion we would also like to stress the importance of coming up with tools to mitigate the negative impacts of the drivers of this type of soil degradation 5 conclusions a wide variability in infiltration capacity and soil permeability runoff generation and soil loss patterns were quantified and described at the pedon scale in a small catchment of olive trees in southern spain infiltration capacity and related saturated hydraulic conductivity in the top soil were considerably lower than those measured in the sub surface layers we observed that soil loss and runoff generation were clearly related to a decrease in the vegetation cover reduced tillage which affects the topsoil water retention capacity and crust generation was also a possible factor to take into account in comparison to larger areas such as the catchment scale the pedon scale behaves similarly in terms of soil losses and higher in terms of runoff coefficients despite the differences in methods and measuring equipment the average values of soil losses and runoff at the pedon scale of 19 7 g m 2 0 2 mg ha 1 and 5 6 l m 2 are similar to or lower than those observed at the small catchment scale in this study for events of a similar nature acknowledgments we would like to thank the farmers antonio muñoz and esteban ruiz for providing access to the study areas as well as

7586,human activities and climate change have altered the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability which is a principal prerequisite for allocation of different water resources in order to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on water availability and optimal allocation of water resources hydrological models and optimal water resource allocation models should be integrated given that increasing human water demand and varying water availability conditions necessitate adaptation measures we propose a framework to assess the effects of these measures on optimal allocation of water resources the proposed model and framework were applied to a case study of the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin in china two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 were employed to project future climate and the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model was used to simulate the variability of flows under historical 1956 2011 and future 2012 2099 conditions the water availability determined by simulating flow with the vic hydrological model was used to establish the optimal water resources allocation model the allocation results were derived under an extremely dry year with an annual average water flow frequency of 95 a very dry year with an annual average water flow frequency of 90 a dry year with an annual average water flow frequency of 75 and a normal year with an annual average water flow frequency of 50 during historical and future periods the results show that the total available water resources in the study area and the inflow of the danjiangkou reservoir will increase in the future however the uneven distribution of water availability will cause water shortage problems especially in the boundary areas the effects of adaptation measures including water saving and dynamic control of flood limiting water levels flwls for reservoir operation were assessed and implemented to alleviate water shortages the negative impacts from the south to north water transfer project middle route in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin can be avoided through the dynamic control of flwls in danjiangkou reservoir under the historical and future rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios however the effects of adaptation measures are limited due to their own constraints such as the characteristics of the reservoirs influencing the flwls the utilization of storm water appears necessary to meet future water demand overall the results indicate that the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation might aid water resources management not only in the study area but also in other places where water availability conditions vary due to climate change and human activities keywords flood limiting water levels climate change adaptation impact assessment water resources allocation hanjiang river 1 introduction water availabilityis a principal prerequisite for allocation of water resources due to human activities and climate change the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability has been altered bringing about daunting challengesin water resources allocation arnell et al 2001 labat et al 2004 immerzeel 2008 wang et al 2016a zessner et al 2017 notably water transfer projects directly decrease the amount of water availability in donor areas and increase it in the receiving areas it is critical to understand how human activities and climate change influence water availability in orderto determine water resources allocation and to ensure adequate access to these resources for users schuol et al 2008 richey et al 2015 in recent years numerous studies have assessed the impacts caused by climate change or human activities on hydrological processes and water resources at various scales such as the basin chang et al 2015 kundu et al 2017 national liu et al 2017 regional suppan et al 2008 kusangaya et al 2014 and even global arnell 1999 arnell et al 2001 scales the majority of these studies focus on changes in water availability including the quantification of contribution by climate or land use cover changes herrera pantoja and hiscock 2015 kirby et al 2016 nepal 2016 while very few have concentrated on the impacts of the varied water availability on water resources allocation however it is important to note that the relationship between optimal water resources allocation and water availability is nonlinear e g the nonlinear reservoir operation rule in optimal water resources allocation applies here this is because optimal water resources allocation refers to project e g reservoir operations and it can also alter the spatial and temporal distribution of water supply according to water demand therefore it is unreasonable to equate the impacts of climate change and human activities on water availability to optimal water resources allocation alone in other words a gap exists between research on variable water availability and water resources allocation hence it is necessary to integrate hydrological models and water resources allocation models to quantify the nonlinear relationship between the two in order to alleviate the impacts of human activities and climate change on optimal water resources allocation corresponding adaptation measures have been widely adopted to reduce the conflict between supply and demand in water management adger et al 2005 parry et al 2007 hallegatte 2009 sun et al 2015 these topics have been discussed in multiple national academies of science reports pamrs 2004 walkerden 2006 water management adaptation options for meeting water demand are categorized into supply side options which focus on augmenting water availability and demand side options which aim to reduce water demand mainly through the efficient use of water borgomeo et al 2014 supply side management can include reservoir operation mcfarlane et al 2012 which integrates flood management and water supply as technological changes will shape some choices for water demand adaptation iglesias et al 2011 water saving measures will be implemented across a wide range of feasible future states cosgrove and loucks 2015 therefore a forward looking quantitative assessment of adaptation measures on optimal water resources allocation is required for effective adaptation planning and water project operation under a changing environment while the approaches developed for optimal water resources allocation based on historical water availabilities are widely accepted for long term planning purposes liu et al 2010 szemis et al 2013 liu et al 2014 they are unsuitable for a changing future environment taking account of varying water availability in the future an integrated water resources allocation model is proposed to quantify the nonlinear impacts of water availability on water resources allocation and to develop a framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation 2 methodology 2 1 framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on optimal water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on optimal water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions broadly consists of three parts 1 the determination of the varied water availability conditions 2 description of the adaptation measures and 3 optimal water resources allocation in order to determine available water resources taking into account climate change and land use cover changes hydrological models with forcing typical in global climate model gcm outputs have been widely used shamir et al 2015 this allows researchers to quantify the nonlinear impacts of water availability on water resources allocation hydrological models and optimal water resources allocation models must be integrated through water availability if adaptation measures are implemented in the optimal allocation model in the form of constraints e g the rules of reservoir operation from the supply side or inputs e g water saving from the demand side the effects of the adaptation measures can be assessed by comparing the allocation results the workflow for this process is shown in fig 1 2 2 hydrological model for available water resources the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model is adopted to determine the amount of available water resources under a changing climate it is a physically based and semi distributed model liang et al 1994 cherkauer et al 2003 which was originally developed as a land surface scheme to provide the boundary conditions for gcms at the university of washington and princeton university it solves water and energy balance equations between land and atmosphere thus it can be used to simulate hydrological processes including surface flow base flow evapotranspiration snowmelt and the distribution of soil moisture in the uppermost two to three soil layers liang et al 1994 1996 cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 ma et al 2016 input data to the vic hydrological model are grid based variables that include precipitation air temperature downward shortwave solar and long wave radiation humidity and land surface characteristics such as the elevation the land cover type and the soil characteristics the sub grid parameterization of the model based on topography soil vegetation and meteorological data make it distinct from other hydrological models with these characteristics the model is designed to consider the heterogeneity of land surface properties and can describe the physical hydrological processes within a model grid cell wu et al 2011 the vic hydrological model is forced with observed surface meteorological data and outputs stream discharge including base flow and direct runoff it has now been widely used as a hydrological model to assess hydrologic response to climate change guo 2009 bae et al 2015 michelle et al 2015 gould et al 2016 wang et al 2016b the amount of available water resources in a region can vary widely due to changes in climate the gcm is the most important tool for studying climate change johnson and sharma 2009 chen et al 2013 pervez et al 2014 gcm outputs are metrological variables and will be used as the inputs for hydrological models to reflect hydrologic responses to the climate change however the major challenge of linking gcms to hydrologic models is the vast scale gap between the outputs of climate processes and the requirement of hydrological processes bell et al 2014 the vast scale gap requirements have led to the development of downscaling methodologies statistical downscaling models sdsm are regression based and are constructed by deriving empirical relationships between the large scale gcm predictors and the station scale predictands the sdsm can also provide a reliable and less computationally intensive alternative to models using local surface weather variables and many recent studies have adopted the statistical downscaling methods in the assessment of future climate impact on hydrologic regimes and water resources subhrendu and pruitt 2011 meenu et al 2013 pervez and henebry 2014 wilby et al 2014 singh et al 2015 mullan et al 2016 tang et al 2016 the climate variables from the projections of the statistical downscaling model version 4 2 wilby and wigley 1997 haylock et al 2006 which is a freely available tool that produces high resolution climate change scenarios meenu et al 2013 wilby and dawason 2013 will be used in a hydrologic model to predict the available water resources in the future 2 3 optimal water resources allocation model the optimal water resources allocation model is composed of three components objective functions system constraints and optimization techniques 2 3 1 objective functions as shown in fig 1 the objective functions of 1 of 2 and of 3 are described as follows i minimisation of water shortages of1 this objective represents the equal sharing of water resources in each operational zone an operational zone is a sub basin determined by the distribution of administrative counties or cities and rivers this equal sharing of water resources is expressed by the amount of water shortage per capita in every operational zone and is defined as 1 minimize of 1 x t 1 12 1 n i 1 n j 1 l dw ij t x ij t npo i where t is the number of months 1 12 l is the number of sectors or water users such as agriculture industry and domesticity in every operational zone n is the number of operational zones xt ij is the decision variable that represents the water resources allocated to sector j in the ith operational zone in the tth month npoi is the population in the ith operational zone from the statistical yearbook or the results of economicandsocialdevelopment prediction in the future dwt ij is the water demand of sector j in the ith operational zone in the tth month and can be determined by the quotamethod the volume of water demanded in agriculture is calculated by multiplying the estimated area in hectares of every measured crop by the net water requirement m3 ha 1 of the crop the volume of industry water demand is determined by the product of gross domestic product gdp of industry in the future and the water use per ten thousand yuan of gdp m3 yuan 1 10 4 the volume of domestic water demand is obtained from the product of the number of people and per capita water use liu et al 2010 ii maximisation of the economic interest of2 in order to maximize the economic interest of the whole area the second objective function of 2 is defined as the total economic value of the whole basin in a year that is 2 maximize of 2 x t 1 12 i 1 n j 1 l x ij t ner ij where nerij is the net economic return per unit of water quantity from sector j in the ith operational zone rmbyuan m3 in our case study the ners from agricultural and industrial sectors are calculated as the difference between the total benefit and the total cost of production the benefit from water use in the domesticity sector cannot be quantified since the domesticity sector is the most important sector its ner is considered simply as the maximum ner values from agriculture and industry iii minimization of the amount of waste water of3 in order to minimize the total amount of waste water in the whole area the objective function is given as 3 minimize of 3 x t 1 12 i 1 n j 1 l x ij t pp ij where ppij is the wastewaterdischargeamount per unit of supplied water swij from sector j in the ith operational zone ppij can be determined by pwij swij where pwij is the amount of waste water and can be found in water resources bulletins 2 3 2 system constraints i water balance equation 4 q i t q i t 1 k 1 m rr k i o k t r i t j 1 l x i j t ret i j t u i t j 1 l x i j t tw i t where qi t is the discharge of the ith operational zone at time t qi t 1 is the discharge at t 1 time m is the number of large medium sized reservoirs ok t is the release from the kth reservoir rrk i is the water connection ratio between the ith operational zone and the kth reservoir and can be determined by the ratio of water diversion of the rivers between the kth reservoir and the ith operational zone as provided by the bureauofhydrologyofchangjiangwater resources commission in china ri is the sum of the water yield produced in the watersheds located up to the ith zone xij and l are the variables as mentioned in eq 1 rett i j is the return flow coefficient dimensionless which is greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one ui t is the amount of water loss including evaporation seepage and loss during conveyances twi t is the amount of water transferred out of the basin ii reservoir constraints a the continuity equation for the kth reservoir can be written as follows 5 s k t s k t 1 i k t o

awrt i is the amount of the water available in the ith operational zone in the tth month methods for determining the parameters shown in eqs 1 8 can be found in liu et al 2010 2014 2 3 3 optimization techniques as the water resources allocation model is complex yeh and becker 1982 ming et al 2015 it is difficult to arrive at an optimal solution the genetic algorithm ga which is originally based on darwin s evolution theory holland 1975 goldberg 1989 is a heuristic inexact probabilistic random combinatorial discrete and search based optimization technique the continuing improvements of price performance of computational systems have made the algorithm effective for various types of optimization holland 1992 and widely used to solve problems concerning optimization with single or multiple objectives rauch and harremoes 1999 van dijk et al 2002 sarkar and modak 2003 the ga has also widely been used in the optimization of water resource systems janejira et al 2005 jothiprakash and arunkumar 2013 therefore the ga will be employed in our study to solve the optimal allocation model since the goal of this study is to assess the impacts of climate change on water systems and the effects of the corresponding adaptation measures the three mentioned objective functions are further combined into a single objective optimization problem by the weighted sum method as maximizing the function of 2 is equivalent to minimizing the function of 2 the single objective optimization can be expressed as eq 9 9 miniminze f x i 1 3 ω i o f i x i j t where o f i x is the normalized form of the ith objectives from its nondimensionalization and ωi is the weight of the ith objectives which i 1 3 ω i equals to 1 we assume equal weight ω i 1 3 in our study the approach of normalizing the multi objective functions ofs is to first optimize each of the objectives of 1 of 2 and of 3 individually and then divide each objective by those optimum values 2 4 responses of adaptation measures to the changing environment to increase water availability during drought periods liu et al 2010 and liu et al 2015 proposed a dynamic control of the flood limiting water level flwl method for reservoir operation which will be adopted in this study the relevant alternatives concerning water saving demand side option include the promotion of domesticwatersavingdevices and irrigation styles and reducing the leakagerateof water supply infrastructure which will also be considered in the study therefore the flwl method for reservoir operation supply side option and the water demand after the action of water saving demand side option will be used as inputs for the optimal water resources allocation model and their effects on water resources allocation will be assessed in this study 3 a case study in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin 3 1 study area hanjiang river is the largest tributary in the middle reaches of yangtze river fig 2 and serves as a water source for the middle route of south to north water transfer project in china the total area of the hanjiang river basin is 1 59 000 km2 the areas of the upper and mid lower reaches of the basin are 95 200 km2 and 63 800 km2 respectively danjiangkou reservoir is located in danjiangkou city hubei province and the water is fed directly to the middle route south to north water transfer project as danjiangkou reservoir is the boundary of the upper and mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin the water availability in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin is impacted not only by climate change in the local area and the upper basin but also the transfer project and the reservoir s operation about 15 3 million people lived in the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river in 2010 with 36 6 among them living in urban areas due to the fast growth of population and the rapid development of the local economy and urbanization water demand is expanding and conflicts over water use are increasing substantially as a very useful case study to help inform water resources management the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river are evaluated in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptation measures on water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions to establish the optimal water resources allocation model the water network in the study area is depicted in fig 3 according to the distribution of administrative counties or cities and rivers 28 sub basins are determined as the operational zones for the allocation model seventeen existing medium or large reservoirs whose total capacity is more than 10 million m3 are taken into account in the model shown in figs 2 and 3 3 2 data we use three groups of data in this study hydrological data water demand data series and data on the characteristics of reservoirs for operation purposes the first data set hydrological data is used to determine the available water resources the area above danjiangkou reservoir accounts for 59 of the whole basin and its outflow serves as the inflow of the danjiangkou reservoir thus the hydrologic processes of the upper area during climate change determine the south to north water transfer project scheduling and the reservoir operation which can alter the available water resources in the mid lower reaches the rules applied for water supply operation in the south to north water transfer project in danjiangkou reservoir are shown in fig 4 and are described as follows 1 if the reservoir water level is higher than the limit of flood water level zone i the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 420 m3 s which is the maximum capacity of the project 2 if the reservoir water level is lower than the limit of flood water level but higher than the operating rule curve for water supply control zone ii the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 350 m3 s 3 if the reservoir water level is lower than the operating rule curve for water supply control but higher than the operating rule curve for water supply reduction zone iii the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 300 m3 s 4 if the reservoir water level is lower than the operating rule curve for water supply reduction but higher than the operating rule curve for water supply confining zone iv the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 260 m3 s 5 if the reservoir water level is lower than the operating rule curve for water supply confining zone v the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 135 m3 s there are 15 meteorological gauging stations with sufficient data series on daily precipitation and daily maximum and minimum air temperatures 1956 2010 shown in fig 5 in order to calibrate and validate the statistically downscaled results from the gcm the meteorological data can be downloaded from the climatic data centre national meteorological information centre china meteorological administration 261 precipitation gauging stations and 24 runoff gauging stations provided by bureauofhydrology changjiangwater resources commission with runoff data series from 1956 to 2010 are used to calibrate and validate the vic hydrological model for the projected future climate the beijing climate centre climate system model version 1 1 bcc csm1 1 used in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 has been widely applied and provided a relatively good performance in reproducing observed climate variations of temperature and precipitation in china xin et al 2013 we adopted two representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 using simulations performed with the bcc csm1 1 the second data set used in this study is comprised of water demand data series in our present work three water user sectors agricultural industrial and domestic were considered to assess conservative water resources allocation plans with a higher water supply guarantee rate four types of agricultural water demand are adopted with water inflow frequencies of 95 90 75 and 50 these inflows represent an extremely dry year a very dry year a dry year and a normal year respectively the domestic water demand covers the rural area cities and towns in the last two regions the domestic water demand should include the corresponding ecology demand which includes to ecological and environmental preservation and protection of urban green areas while 2010 is the benchmark year demands for 2020 2030 and 2040 are also projected based on the expectation for social and economic development from the bureauofhydrologyofchangjiangwater resources commission in china gdp in the study area in 2020 2030 and 2040is projected to be 2 03 3 89 and 7 12 times larger respectively than the benchmark value of gdp in 2010 however the projected area for irrigation in 2020 2030 and 2040 is 1 06 1 07 and 1 07 times larger than the area in 2010 respectively due to the red line farmland policy in china according to the population structure and the china s child family policy the population in study area in 2020 2030 and 2040 is projected to be respectively 1 02 1 09 and 1 13 times larger than in 2010 as water saving is one of the most effective adaptation measures to meet varying water availability conditions this study does not only determine water demands under different economicandsocialdevelopment scenarios shown in table 1 but also estimates the water demands resulting from the implementation of water shown in table 2 all the water demand data shown in tables 1 and 2 are collected from the report on the comprehensive management plan on water resources for the hanjiang river basin china cwrc 2011 which are estimated by the quota method the in stream ecology water demand is estimated by the tennant method tennant 1976 the last data set used in this study contains the characteristics of reservoirs in the study area there are 17 large to medium sized reservoirs in the study area the reservoir data are used as the model input including total storage reservoir storage at normal water level dead storage and reservoir storage at flwl shown in table 3 according to our proposed model if there is enough water in the river for all water user sectors the reservoir operations will be standard i e maintaining the water level at the highest possible limit in order to maximize water storage however according to the chinese flood control act the standing committee of the eighth national people s congress of the people s republic of china 1997 reservoir water levels are generally not allowed to exceed the flwl which is the highest limiting water level to provide adequate storage for flood prevention during flood season in order to respond to the increasing water demand and the reduction of available water resources due to climate change the dynamic control of the flwl for reservoir operation which is an effective adaptation measure and avoids exceeding the design risk is proposed and implemented in china li et al 2010 2015 this dynamic control of flml will be implemented in sanliping and danjiangkou reservoirs since only these two reservoirs can satisfy the requirements for the dynamic control li et al 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation of the sdsm downscaling and hydrological model the sdsm is applied to project daily surface temperature particularly maximum t max and minimum temperatures t min and precipitation based on the national centre for environmental prediction ncep http www esrl noaa gov psd reanalysis dataset and observations from 15 meteorological stations including air temperature solar radiation humidity wind speed precipitation amounts and so on available from http data cma cn the geographical domain 102 5 e 115 e 27 5 n 37 5 e was chosen to include all areas with noticeable influence on the circulation patterns that govern weather in the hanjiang basin during the screening of downscaling predictors the default values were found to have a confidence level of 95 and partial correlation p r of 1 selection of predictor variables was based on the explained variance and correlation between sets of predictors and single predictands precipitation or temperature in this case relationships analysed in sdsm 4 2 for precipitation mean sea level pressure 500 hpa geopotential height and specific humidity at 850 hpa were identified as the predictor set mean sea level pressure mean surface air temperature at 2 m 500 hpa geopotential height 500 hpa zonal velocity surface temperature at 850 hpa and mean surface air temperature at 2 m were considered as the predictors for temperature to calibrate and validate the prediction we split the period 1961 2010 into two parts the first part from 1961 to 2000 is used for calibration and the remaining part from 2001 to 2010 is used for validation the performance of sdsm in downscaling monthly precipitation is shown in fig 6 the performance of daily t max and t min are assessed from the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between the observed and sdsm simulated series shown in tables 4 and 5 the results in tables 4 and 5 indicate an acceptable performance between the observed and simulated predictands the predictands are monthly precipitation p daily t max and daily t min corresponding to the predictors in the calibration and validation periods the nse between the observed and simulated p t max and t min during the calibration period shown in table 4 are reasonable since most of nse values in the stations are above 0 70 for p 0 90 for t max and 0 94 for t min since the precipitation from future scenarios and downscaling methods remains impossible to project with complete accuracy the validity or accuracy of the model bcc csm1 1 combining the sdsm is often tested by its ability to accurately represent the historical climate the results confirm the good applicability of sdsm and bcc csm1 1 in downscaling future precipitation and surface temperature for hydrologic simulation the vic distributed hydrological model with the three soil layers model vic 3l model in the hanjiang basin was calibrated and validated by the daily runoff data obtained from 24 gauge stations their data are available from changjiangwaterresourcescommission china daily maximum and minimum temperature data obtained from 15 gauge stations and precipitation data collected from 261 gauge stations their data are available from changjiangwaterresourcescommission china from 1980 to 1995 and 1996 2005 respectively the nse between the observed and simulated monthly runoff r during the validation period with a range of 0 681 to 0 856 shown in table 5 suggests that the application of the vic hydrological model for runoff simulation and prediction under the future climate change scenarios is successful 4 2 changes of water availability under climate change and water transfer project the synthetic future daily data series of rainfall and temperature can be produced under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios using the calibrated sdsm model in section 4 1 under the stationary assumption that the determined temporal structure of climatology and the calibrated hydrological model parameters over the historical period are valid for use in the future the available water resources can be determined through the calibrated vic hydrological model in section 4 1 to do this two periods of time a historical period 1961 2011 and a future period 2012 2099 are defined the patterns of change of the future inflow of danjiangkou reservoir and the flow generation at the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin were then analysed it is seen from fig 7 that under scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 at the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin the streamflow during the dry season of a year in the future period 2012 2099 will decrease while the streamflow during the flood seasons will increase during the years with frequencies of 50 75 90 and 95 opposite trends are found for the inflow results in danjiangkou reservoir fig 8 the results are consistent with the finding that the mean precipitation will likely increase in many mid latitude wet regions ipcc 2014 largely due to increasing of atmospheric moisture content since topography serves as a barrier to the monsoon winds coming from the east precipitation will be intensified in the upstream mountain areas the precipitation in plains areas mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin will lessen therefore the available water resources from the upstream of the hanjiang river basin increase in the future a potentially favourable outcome for water users however the south to north water transfer project will transfer some of the water from the danjiangkou reservoir and reduce the total available water resources at the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin the relevant alternatives concerning water saving and flwl reservoir operation will alter the water demand and available water resources thus the impacts of the water transfer project water saving and flwl should be examined in order to optimize local water resources management especially when the locally available water decreases in order to reduce the water shortage induced by climate change and the transfer project human activities the effects of adaptation water options the dynamic control of the flwls for the reservoirs operation and water saving measures in the study area should be assessed 4 3 water resources allocation response to climate change and adaptation measures as the water usage in an operational zone located in the upstream affects the downstream area the released water from danjiangkou reservoir can be extracted by operational zones located along the main stream as the rules of water supply operation for the south to north water transfer project in danjiangkou reservoir shown in fig 4 have been taken into account when assessing water demand in the study area no water shortage is found in most of the operational zones along the main stream except qianjiang as there are two reservoirs danjiangkou and siping reservoirs that satisfy dynamic control of flwl four types of operational zones are classified in the study area shown in fig 9 if there is no water shortage in 2010 2020 2030 and 2040 in an operational zone the zone is defined as the type a shown in fig 9 if there is water shortage in one operational zone along the main stream in the study area water supply might be influenced by the water transfer project through the operation of danjiangkou reservoir this operational zone qianjiang is defined as type b shown in fig 9 fangxian and baokang are defined as type c shown in fig 9 because water supply in these two operational zones is impacted by the flwl operation type d in fig 9 is defined as the areas where water shortages can be found where water saving measures are in effect 4 3 1 impacts of variations of water resources availability on water resources allocation the variations of water resources availability result from climate change and the south to north water transfer project the results of an impact assessment of climate change and of the south to north water transfer project on the water resources allocation in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin are shown in rose diagrams figs 10 and 11 the colour of arc line radii boundaries and fan shape area in these two figures represents the frequency level that is the probability of non occurrence of the drought event referring to the available water resources while the arc line is the water demand at the frequency level and the arc polygon is the responding allocated water result the gap between the arc line water demand and the fan shape allocated water resources represents the amount of water shortage four planninglevelyears 2010 2020 2030 and 2040 are shown in the four quadrants of the cartesian coordinate system three scenarios the historical period 1956 2011 and predicted water flows from rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 are employed in each planninglevelyear four frequencies 95 90 75 and 50 of water inflow are adopted in each scenario therefore 48 4 3 4 types of allocation results in an operational zone are shown in one chart in a concise way to present the impact of various factors on resource allocation as the water demand under theeconomicandsocialdevelopment scenario is increasing in shenglongjia gucheng nanzhang xiangyang tangbai zaoyang and jingmen zhupi operational zones shown in table 1 denoted as type d in fig 9 at frequency levels of 95 90 75 and 50 in 2010 2020 2030 and 2040 respectively the allocated water in these operational zones will generally increase however the allocated water depends on not only water demand but also on available water resources as a result the colours representing the allocated water in each frequency level are in a different order in the different years the minimum allocated water among the four frequency levels in type d operational zones is 50 shown as fan shape in purple except the jingmen zhupi which is 90 shown as fan shape in blue the maximum water demand among the four frequency levels is the 90 while the maximum water resources are at the 50 frequency level as the allocated water under the 50 frequency level is more than the one under the 95 frequency level in jingmen zhupi operational zone the amount of allocated water in jingmen zhupi operational zone mainly depends on available water resources rather than water demand the monthly available water resources are quite unevenly distributed at the 90 and 95 frequency levels shown in fig 7 and most of the water demand is from agriculture shown in tables 1 and 2 the agricultural sector is heavily influenced by climate factors while the industrial and domestic sectors are comparatively stable during climate change bell et al 2014 thus since most demand comes from the agricultural sector water resource allocations are heavily influenced by climate change as shown in fig 3 there are no reservoirs in jingmen zhupi and shenglongjia operational zones and their historical 1956 2011 allocation water results are greater in number than those in the future predicted water flow under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 in the other four operational zones the allocated water resources calculated under the historical scenarios are the same as those calculated for the future scenarios the main reason for this is that the reservoirs satisfy the water demand by adjusting water flow under future scenarios as the total available water resources are predicted to decrease in the future especially during the dry season according to rcp 2 6 or rcp 4 5 scenarios shown in section 4 2 and since there are not enough reservoirs to adjust the available water to the demand water shortages in the operational zones situated around the boundary of the basins such as jingmen zhupi and shenglongjia will become increasingly serious in the future qianjiang type b shown in fig 9 is located downstream of the danjiangkou reservoir which provides water for the south to north water transfer project as the instream ecological water demand is sensitive to danjiangkou reservoir operations in this area water shortage occurs under the historical scenario shown in fig 11 b and the south to north water transfer project proceeds according to its operational rules shown in section 3 2 if the effects of the transfer project are removed there is no water shortage in qianjiang shown in fig 11 a water inflow in danjiangkou reservoir will increase in the future under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 but the increased inflow cannot completely satisfy the south to north water transfer project at the monthly scale additionally the decreasing amount of water shortage in qianjiang is not equal or linearly related to the increasing amount of inflow into the danjiangkou reservoir due to the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of increasing inflow and the nonlinear operation rule in danjiangkou reservoir 4 3 2 effects of dynamic control of the flwl for the reservoirs operation on water resources allocation fig 12 illustrates the effect of the dynamic control of flwl for the reservoirs operation on water resources allocation in qianjiang influenced by danjiangkou reservoir fangxian and baokang influenced by sanliping reservoir for all optimal water resources allocation results in these three operational zones more water was allocated after the application of the dynamic control of flwl specifically 1 the amount of water allocated in qianjiang is more than that in fangxian and baokang because th danjiangkou reservoir is larger than sanliping reservoir 2 compared with the fig 12 a including qianjiang fangxian and baokang the effects of the dynamic control of flwl on increasing allocated water is more significant at the 95 frequency level especially under the historical scenario since more flood water was stored in the reservoir and then released during the dry season it is worth noting that water shortage will become more severe under the future scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp 4 5 than under historical scenarios in fangxian and baokang operational zones although more water can be gained from the implementation of the dynamic control of flwl adaptation measures in sanliping reservoir for fangxian and baokang operational zones the locally available water cannot satisfy water demand in every scenario and in every year especially in the baokang operational zone 4 3 3 role of water saving alternatives in water resources allocation water saving is an effective option for water resources management as the relationship between water demand and available water resources is nonlinear and optimal water resources allocation is an integral part of a basin system water saving alternatives not only influences optimal water resources allocation in an operational zone but also alleviate the extent of water shortage in the whole basin the possible effects of planned water saving alternatives on water demand in the future can be found in the report on the comprehensive management plan on water resources for the hanjiang river basin china cwrc 2011 in the form of water demands following the implementation of water saving measure shown in table 2 as shown in fig 13 the extent of water shortage in most scenarios was reduced radii boundaries in fig 13 are reduced compared to the results shown in fig 10 figs 11 b and 12 b under the same allocation conditions but using different water demand alternatives shown in tables 1 and 2 the allocated water in nanzhang zaoyang and qianjiang operational zones can satisfy most of their water demands following the implementation of water saving measure however water shortages remain a serious problem in shenglongjia gucheng xiangyang tangbai and jingmen zhupi where the maximum allocated water is less than the water demand at the 50 frequency level under the implementation of water saving measure water shortage under the future scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 is more serious than under the historical scenarios in shengloangjia and jingmen zhupi while the opposite trend is observed in gucheng as these four operational zones are located at the source of the tributaries in hanjiang it is not feasible to transfer or allocate the water from the danjiangkou reservoir to these areas therefore unconventional water resources such as storm water might be good options to satisfy the water demand water shortages in fangxian and baokang are less severe and occur mainly in the regional agricultural sector strategies for allocating water to meet the instream ecology requirements and human demand will be improved in the future 5 conclusion the results of our case study show that the uneven distribution and changes of available water resources will increase the risk of water shortage especially in the optimal water resources allocation operational zones located on the boundaries of the basin where not only is available water reduced but available adaptation measure are fewer and the effects of the measures not as significant as in locations downstream of the tributary or reservoirs the analysis of the adaptation measures demonstrates that water saving and the dynamic control of reservoir operations by flwl can alleviate water shortages and that their effects on optimal water resources allocation is nonlinear the negative impacts of water transfer projects can be avoided through the dynamic control of reservoirs by flwl under all the historical and future rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios however it should be kept in mind that these two conventional adaptation measures are not a complete solution unconventional adaptation measures such as the harvest and use of storm water should also be implemented to solve water shortage problems in this area in summary climate change will bring different challenges and opportunities to different places adaptation measures including water saving flexible reservoir operation and storm water gathering can be adopted to solve the problems of water shortage induced by climate change or water transfer projects on the variability of water resources availability this research has proposed a framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation through an optimal water resources allocation model the optimal model combined climate change and human activities land use cover and water transfer projects to consider the variability of water resources availability therefore the framework proposed in this paper shows quantitatively the effects of adaptation measures to changing environments and will contribute to the support of water management and adaptation choice or policy making reflecting the multi dimensional aspects of optimal water resources allocation as the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions includes gcm downscaling methods hydrological models water demand estimation and optimal allocation models thereare someuncertainties presented in the assessment available datasets are rarely sufficient for calibrating and validating all the required parameters furthermore interacting uncertainties can often become very complex it is important to assess the uncertainty of the assessments in order to determine the level of risk which will be a topic of future research however the results found in this study still offer usefulguidelines for local and international

7586,human activities and climate change have altered the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability which is a principal prerequisite for allocation of different water resources in order to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on water availability and optimal allocation of water resources hydrological models and optimal water resource allocation models should be integrated given that increasing human water demand and varying water availability conditions necessitate adaptation measures we propose a framework to assess the effects of these measures on optimal allocation of water resources the proposed model and framework were applied to a case study of the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin in china two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 were employed to project future climate and the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model was used to simulate the variability of flows under historical 1956 2011 and future 2012 2099 conditions the water availability determined by simulating flow with the vic hydrological model was used to establish the optimal water resources allocation model the allocation results were derived under an extremely dry year with an annual average water flow frequency of 95 a very dry year with an annual average water flow frequency of 90 a dry year with an annual average water flow frequency of 75 and a normal year with an annual average water flow frequency of 50 during historical and future periods the results show that the total available water resources in the study area and the inflow of the danjiangkou reservoir will increase in the future however the uneven distribution of water availability will cause water shortage problems especially in the boundary areas the effects of adaptation measures including water saving and dynamic control of flood limiting water levels flwls for reservoir operation were assessed and implemented to alleviate water shortages the negative impacts from the south to north water transfer project middle route in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin can be avoided through the dynamic control of flwls in danjiangkou reservoir under the historical and future rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios however the effects of adaptation measures are limited due to their own constraints such as the characteristics of the reservoirs influencing the flwls the utilization of storm water appears necessary to meet future water demand overall the results indicate that the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation might aid water resources management not only in the study area but also in other places where water availability conditions vary due to climate change and human activities keywords flood limiting water levels climate change adaptation impact assessment water resources allocation hanjiang river 1 introduction water availabilityis a principal prerequisite for allocation of water resources due to human activities and climate change the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability has been altered bringing about daunting challengesin water resources allocation arnell et al 2001 labat et al 2004 immerzeel 2008 wang et al 2016a zessner et al 2017 notably water transfer projects directly decrease the amount of water availability in donor areas and increase it in the receiving areas it is critical to understand how human activities and climate change influence water availability in orderto determine water resources allocation and to ensure adequate access to these resources for users schuol et al 2008 richey et al 2015 in recent years numerous studies have assessed the impacts caused by climate change or human activities on hydrological processes and water resources at various scales such as the basin chang et al 2015 kundu et al 2017 national liu et al 2017 regional suppan et al 2008 kusangaya et al 2014 and even global arnell 1999 arnell et al 2001 scales the majority of these studies focus on changes in water availability including the quantification of contribution by climate or land use cover changes herrera pantoja and hiscock 2015 kirby et al 2016 nepal 2016 while very few have concentrated on the impacts of the varied water availability on water resources allocation however it is important to note that the relationship between optimal water resources allocation and water availability is nonlinear e g the nonlinear reservoir operation rule in optimal water resources allocation applies here this is because optimal water resources allocation refers to project e g reservoir operations and it can also alter the spatial and temporal distribution of water supply according to water demand therefore it is unreasonable to equate the impacts of climate change and human activities on water availability to optimal water resources allocation alone in other words a gap exists between research on variable water availability and water resources allocation hence it is necessary to integrate hydrological models and water resources allocation models to quantify the nonlinear relationship between the two in order to alleviate the impacts of human activities and climate change on optimal water resources allocation corresponding adaptation measures have been widely adopted to reduce the conflict between supply and demand in water management adger et al 2005 parry et al 2007 hallegatte 2009 sun et al 2015 these topics have been discussed in multiple national academies of science reports pamrs 2004 walkerden 2006 water management adaptation options for meeting water demand are categorized into supply side options which focus on augmenting water availability and demand side options which aim to reduce water demand mainly through the efficient use of water borgomeo et al 2014 supply side management can include reservoir operation mcfarlane et al 2012 which integrates flood management and water supply as technological changes will shape some choices for water demand adaptation iglesias et al 2011 water saving measures will be implemented across a wide range of feasible future states cosgrove and loucks 2015 therefore a forward looking quantitative assessment of adaptation measures on optimal water resources allocation is required for effective adaptation planning and water project operation under a changing environment while the approaches developed for optimal water resources allocation based on historical water availabilities are widely accepted for long term planning purposes liu et al 2010 szemis et al 2013 liu et al 2014 they are unsuitable for a changing future environment taking account of varying water availability in the future an integrated water resources allocation model is proposed to quantify the nonlinear impacts of water availability on water resources allocation and to develop a framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation 2 methodology 2 1 framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on optimal water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on optimal water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions broadly consists of three parts 1 the determination of the varied water availability conditions 2 description of the adaptation measures and 3 optimal water resources allocation in order to determine available water resources taking into account climate change and land use cover changes hydrological models with forcing typical in global climate model gcm outputs have been widely used shamir et al 2015 this allows researchers to quantify the nonlinear impacts of water availability on water resources allocation hydrological models and optimal water resources allocation models must be integrated through water availability if adaptation measures are implemented in the optimal allocation model in the form of constraints e g the rules of reservoir operation from the supply side or inputs e g water saving from the demand side the effects of the adaptation measures can be assessed by comparing the allocation results the workflow for this process is shown in fig 1 2 2 hydrological model for available water resources the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model is adopted to determine the amount of available water resources under a changing climate it is a physically based and semi distributed model liang et al 1994 cherkauer et al 2003 which was originally developed as a land surface scheme to provide the boundary conditions for gcms at the university of washington and princeton university it solves water and energy balance equations between land and atmosphere thus it can be used to simulate hydrological processes including surface flow base flow evapotranspiration snowmelt and the distribution of soil moisture in the uppermost two to three soil layers liang et al 1994 1996 cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 ma et al 2016 input data to the vic hydrological model are grid based variables that include precipitation air temperature downward shortwave solar and long wave radiation humidity and land surface characteristics such as the elevation the land cover type and the soil characteristics the sub grid parameterization of the model based on topography soil vegetation and meteorological data make it distinct from other hydrological models with these characteristics the model is designed to consider the heterogeneity of land surface properties and can describe the physical hydrological processes within a model grid cell wu et al 2011 the vic hydrological model is forced with observed surface meteorological data and outputs stream discharge including base flow and direct runoff it has now been widely used as a hydrological model to assess hydrologic response to climate change guo 2009 bae et al 2015 michelle et al 2015 gould et al 2016 wang et al 2016b the amount of available water resources in a region can vary widely due to changes in climate the gcm is the most important tool for studying climate change johnson and sharma 2009 chen et al 2013 pervez et al 2014 gcm outputs are metrological variables and will be used as the inputs for hydrological models to reflect hydrologic responses to the climate change however the major challenge of linking gcms to hydrologic models is the vast scale gap between the outputs of climate processes and the requirement of hydrological processes bell et al 2014 the vast scale gap requirements have led to the development of downscaling methodologies statistical downscaling models sdsm are regression based and are constructed by deriving empirical relationships between the large scale gcm predictors and the station scale predictands the sdsm can also provide a reliable and less computationally intensive alternative to models using local surface weather variables and many recent studies have adopted the statistical downscaling methods in the assessment of future climate impact on hydrologic regimes and water resources subhrendu and pruitt 2011 meenu et al 2013 pervez and henebry 2014 wilby et al 2014 singh et al 2015 mullan et al 2016 tang et al 2016 the climate variables from the projections of the statistical downscaling model version 4 2 wilby and wigley 1997 haylock et al 2006 which is a freely available tool that produces high resolution climate change scenarios meenu et al 2013 wilby and dawason 2013 will be used in a hydrologic model to predict the available water resources in the future 2 3 optimal water resources allocation model the optimal water resources allocation model is composed of three components objective functions system constraints and optimization techniques 2 3 1 objective functions as shown in fig 1 the objective functions of 1 of 2 and of 3 are described as follows i minimisation of water shortages of1 this objective represents the equal sharing of water resources in each operational zone an operational zone is a sub basin determined by the distribution of administrative counties or cities and rivers this equal sharing of water resources is expressed by the amount of water shortage per capita in every operational zone and is defined as 1 minimize of 1 x t 1 12 1 n i 1 n j 1 l dw ij t x ij t npo i where t is the number of months 1 12 l is the number of sectors or water users such as agriculture industry and domesticity in every operational zone n is the number of operational zones xt ij is the decision variable that represents the water resources allocated to sector j in the ith operational zone in the tth month npoi is the population in the ith operational zone from the statistical yearbook or the results of economicandsocialdevelopment prediction in the future dwt ij is the water demand of sector j in the ith operational zone in the tth month and can be determined by the quotamethod the volume of water demanded in agriculture is calculated by multiplying the estimated area in hectares of every measured crop by the net water requirement m3 ha 1 of the crop the volume of industry water demand is determined by the product of gross domestic product gdp of industry in the future and the water use per ten thousand yuan of gdp m3 yuan 1 10 4 the volume of domestic water demand is obtained from the product of the number of people and per capita water use liu et al 2010 ii maximisation of the economic interest of2 in order to maximize the economic interest of the whole area the second objective function of 2 is defined as the total economic value of the whole basin in a year that is 2 maximize of 2 x t 1 12 i 1 n j 1 l x ij t ner ij where nerij is the net economic return per unit of water quantity from sector j in the ith operational zone rmbyuan m3 in our case study the ners from agricultural and industrial sectors are calculated as the difference between the total benefit and the total cost of production the benefit from water use in the domesticity sector cannot be quantified since the domesticity sector is the most important sector its ner is considered simply as the maximum ner values from agriculture and industry iii minimization of the amount of waste water of3 in order to minimize the total amount of waste water in the whole area the objective function is given as 3 minimize of 3 x t 1 12 i 1 n j 1 l x ij t pp ij where ppij is the wastewaterdischargeamount per unit of supplied water swij from sector j in the ith operational zone ppij can be determined by pwij swij where pwij is the amount of waste water and can be found in water resources bulletins 2 3 2 system constraints i water balance equation 4 q i t q i t 1 k 1 m rr k i o k t r i t j 1 l x i j t ret i j t u i t j 1 l x i j t tw i t where qi t is the discharge of the ith operational zone at time t qi t 1 is the discharge at t 1 time m is the number of large medium sized reservoirs ok t is the release from the kth reservoir rrk i is the water connection ratio between the ith operational zone and the kth reservoir and can be determined by the ratio of water diversion of the rivers between the kth reservoir and the ith operational zone as provided by the bureauofhydrologyofchangjiangwater resources commission in china ri is the sum of the water yield produced in the watersheds located up to the ith zone xij and l are the variables as mentioned in eq 1 rett i j is the return flow coefficient dimensionless which is greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one ui t is the amount of water loss including evaporation seepage and loss during conveyances twi t is the amount of water transferred out of the basin ii reservoir constraints a the continuity equation for the kth reservoir can be written as follows 5 s k t s k t 1 i k t o k t ev k t where s k t is the storage at time t s k t 1 is the storage at time t 1 i k t is the net reservoir inflow excluding seepage during the time t o k t is the reservoir outflow during the time t ev k t is the water loss due to evaporation during the time t b the storages for the kth reservoir are constraints based on physical limits 6 s min k t s k t s max k t where s min k t is the minimum storage at time t and s max k t is the maximum storage at time t iii water demand constraints 7 x i j t dw i j t iv water availability and non negativity constraints 8 0 j 1 l x i j t awr i t where awrt i is the amount of the water available in the ith operational zone in the tth month methods for determining the parameters shown in eqs 1 8 can be found in liu et al 2010 2014 2 3 3 optimization techniques as the water resources allocation model is complex yeh and becker 1982 ming et al 2015 it is difficult to arrive at an optimal solution the genetic algorithm ga which is originally based on darwin s evolution theory holland 1975 goldberg 1989 is a heuristic inexact probabilistic random combinatorial discrete and search based optimization technique the continuing improvements of price performance of computational systems have made the algorithm effective for various types of optimization holland 1992 and widely used to solve problems concerning optimization with single or multiple objectives rauch and harremoes 1999 van dijk et al 2002 sarkar and modak 2003 the ga has also widely been used in the optimization of water resource systems janejira et al 2005 jothiprakash and arunkumar 2013 therefore the ga will be employed in our study to solve the optimal allocation model since the goal of this study is to assess the impacts of climate change on water systems and the effects of the corresponding adaptation measures the three mentioned objective functions are further combined into a single objective optimization problem by the weighted sum method as maximizing the function of 2 is equivalent to minimizing the function of 2 the single objective optimization can be expressed as eq 9 9 miniminze f x i 1 3 ω i o f i x i j t where o f i x is the normalized form of the ith objectives from its nondimensionalization and ωi is the weight of the ith objectives which i 1 3 ω i equals to 1 we assume equal weight ω i 1 3 in our study the approach of normalizing the multi objective functions ofs is to first optimize each of the objectives of 1 of 2 and of 3 individually and then divide each objective by those optimum values 2 4 responses of adaptation measures to the changing environment to increase water availability during drought periods liu et al 2010 and liu et al 2015 proposed a dynamic control of the flood limiting water level flwl method for reservoir operation which will be adopted in this study the relevant alternatives concerning water saving demand side option include the promotion of domesticwatersavingdevices and irrigation styles and reducing the leakagerateof water supply infrastructure which will also be considered in the study therefore the flwl method for reservoir operation supply side option and the water demand after the action of water saving demand side option will be used as inputs for the optimal water resources allocation model and their effects on water resources allocation will be assessed in this study 3 a case study in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin 3 1 study area hanjiang river is the largest tributary in the middle reaches of yangtze river fig 2 and serves as a water source for the middle route of south to north water transfer project in china the total area of the hanjiang river basin is 1 59 000 km2 the areas of the upper and mid lower reaches of the basin are 95 200 km2 and 63 800 km2 respectively danjiangkou reservoir is located in danjiangkou city hubei province and the water is fed directly to the middle route south to north water transfer project as danjiangkou reservoir is the boundary of the upper and mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin the water availability in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin is impacted not only by climate change in the local area and the upper basin but also the transfer project and the reservoir s operation about 15 3 million people lived in the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river in 2010 with 36 6 among them living in urban areas due to the fast growth of population and the rapid development of the local economy and urbanization water demand is expanding and conflicts over water use are increasing substantially as a very useful case study to help inform water resources management the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river are evaluated in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptation measures on water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions to establish the optimal water resources allocation model the water network in the study area is depicted in fig 3 according to the distribution of administrative counties or cities and rivers 28 sub basins are determined as the operational zones for the allocation model seventeen existing medium or large reservoirs whose total capacity is more than 10 million m3 are taken into account in the model shown in figs 2 and 3 3 2 data we use three groups of data in this study hydrological data water demand data series and data on the characteristics of reservoirs for operation purposes the first data set hydrological data is used to determine the available water resources the area above danjiangkou reservoir accounts for 59 of the whole basin and its outflow serves as the inflow of the danjiangkou reservoir thus the hydrologic processes of the upper area during climate change determine the south to north water transfer project scheduling and the reservoir operation which can alter the available water resources in the mid lower reaches the rules applied for water supply operation in the south to north water transfer project in danjiangkou reservoir are shown in fig 4 and are described as follows 1 if the reservoir water level is higher than the limit of flood water level zone i the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 420 m3 s which is the maximum capacity of the project 2 if the reservoir water level is lower than the limit of flood water level but higher than the operating rule curve for water supply control zone ii the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 350 m3 s 3 if the reservoir water level is lower than the operating rule curve for water supply control but higher than the operating rule curve for water supply reduction zone iii the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 300 m3 s 4 if the reservoir water level is lower than the operating rule curve for water supply reduction but higher than the operating rule curve for water supply confining zone iv the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 260 m3 s 5 if the reservoir water level is lower than the operating rule curve for water supply confining zone v the discharge from water supply to the transfer project will not exceed 135 m3 s there are 15 meteorological gauging stations with sufficient data series on daily precipitation and daily maximum and minimum air temperatures 1956 2010 shown in fig 5 in order to calibrate and validate the statistically downscaled results from the gcm the meteorological data can be downloaded from the climatic data centre national meteorological information centre china meteorological administration 261 precipitation gauging stations and 24 runoff gauging stations provided by bureauofhydrology changjiangwater resources commission with runoff data series from 1956 to 2010 are used to calibrate and validate the vic hydrological model for the projected future climate the beijing climate centre climate system model version 1 1 bcc csm1 1 used in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 has been widely applied and provided a relatively good performance in reproducing observed climate variations of temperature and precipitation in china xin et al 2013 we adopted two representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 using simulations performed with the bcc csm1 1 the second data set used in this study is comprised of water demand data series in our present work three water user sectors agricultural industrial and domestic were considered to assess conservative water resources allocation plans with a higher water supply guarantee rate four types of agricultural water demand are adopted with water inflow frequencies of 95 90 75 and 50 these inflows represent an extremely dry year a very dry year a dry year and a normal year respectively the domestic water demand covers the rural area cities and towns in the last two regions the domestic water demand should include the corresponding ecology demand which includes to ecological and environmental preservation and protection of urban green areas while 2010 is the benchmark year demands for 2020 2030 and 2040 are also projected based on the expectation for social and economic development from the bureauofhydrologyofchangjiangwater resources commission in china gdp in the study area in 2020 2030 and 2040is projected to be 2 03 3 89 and 7 12 times larger respectively than the benchmark value of gdp in 2010 however the projected area for irrigation in 2020 2030 and 2040 is 1 06 1 07 and 1 07 times larger than the area in 2010 respectively due to the red line farmland policy in china according to the population structure and the china s child family policy the population in study area in 2020 2030 and 2040 is projected to be respectively 1 02 1 09 and 1 13 times larger than in 2010 as water saving is one of the most effective adaptation measures to meet varying water availability conditions this study does not only determine water demands under different economicandsocialdevelopment scenarios shown in table 1 but also estimates the water demands resulting from the implementation of water shown in table 2 all the water demand data shown in tables 1 and 2 are collected from the report on the comprehensive management plan on water resources for the hanjiang river basin china cwrc 2011 which are estimated by the quota method the in stream ecology water demand is estimated by the tennant method tennant 1976 the last data set used in this study contains the characteristics of reservoirs in the study area there are 17 large to medium sized reservoirs in the study area the reservoir data are used as the model input including total storage reservoir storage at normal water level dead storage and reservoir storage at flwl shown in table 3 according to our proposed model if there is enough water in the river for all water user sectors the reservoir operations will be standard i e maintaining the water level at the highest possible limit in order to maximize water storage however according to the chinese flood control act the standing committee of the eighth national people s congress of the people s republic of china 1997 reservoir water levels are generally not allowed to exceed the flwl which is the highest limiting water level to provide adequate storage for flood prevention during flood season in order to respond to the increasing water demand and the reduction of available water resources due to climate change the dynamic control of the flwl for reservoir operation which is an effective adaptation measure and avoids exceeding the design risk is proposed and implemented in china li et al 2010 2015 this dynamic control of flml will be implemented in sanliping and danjiangkou reservoirs since only these two reservoirs can satisfy the requirements for the dynamic control li et al 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation of the sdsm downscaling and hydrological model the sdsm is applied to project daily surface temperature particularly maximum t max and minimum temperatures t min and precipitation based on the national centre for environmental prediction ncep http www esrl noaa gov psd reanalysis dataset and observations from 15 meteorological stations including air temperature solar radiation humidity wind speed precipitation amounts and so on available from http data cma cn the geographical domain 102 5 e 115 e 27 5 n 37 5 e was chosen to include all areas with noticeable influence on the circulation patterns that govern weather in the hanjiang basin during the screening of downscaling predictors the default values were found to have a confidence level of 95 and partial correlation p r of 1 selection of predictor variables was based on the explained variance and correlation between sets of predictors and single predictands precipitation or temperature in this case relationships analysed in sdsm 4 2 for precipitation mean sea level pressure 500 hpa geopotential height and specific humidity at 850 hpa were identified as the predictor set mean sea level pressure mean surface air temperature at 2 m 500 hpa geopotential height 500 hpa zonal velocity surface temperature at 850 hpa and mean surface air temperature at 2 m were considered as the predictors for temperature to calibrate and validate the prediction we split the period 1961 2010 into two parts the first part from 1961 to 2000 is used for calibration and the remaining part from 2001 to 2010 is used for validation the performance of sdsm in downscaling monthly precipitation is shown in fig 6 the performance of daily t max and t min are assessed from the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse between the observed and sdsm simulated series shown in tables 4 and 5 the results in tables 4 and 5 indicate an acceptable performance between the observed and simulated predictands the predictands are monthly precipitation p daily t max and daily t min corresponding to the predictors in the calibration and validation periods the nse between the observed and simulated p t max and t min during the calibration period shown in table 4 are reasonable since most of nse values in the stations are above 0 70 for p 0 90 for t max and 0 94 for t min since the precipitation from future scenarios and downscaling methods remains impossible to project with complete accuracy the validity or accuracy of the model bcc csm1 1 combining the sdsm is often tested by its ability to accurately represent the historical climate the results confirm the good applicability of sdsm and bcc csm1 1 in downscaling future precipitation and surface temperature for hydrologic simulation the vic distributed hydrological model with the three soil layers model vic 3l model in the hanjiang basin was calibrated and validated by the daily runoff data obtained from 24 gauge stations their data are available from changjiangwaterresourcescommission china daily maximum and minimum temperature data obtained from 15 gauge stations and precipitation data collected from 261 gauge stations their data are available from changjiangwaterresourcescommission china from 1980 to 1995 and 1996 2005 respectively the nse between the observed and simulated monthly runoff r during the validation period with a range of 0 681 to 0 856 shown in table 5 suggests that the application of the vic hydrological model for runoff simulation and prediction under the future climate change scenarios is successful 4 2 changes of water availability under climate change and water transfer project the synthetic future daily data series of rainfall and temperature can be produced under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios using the calibrated sdsm model in section 4 1 under the stationary assumption that the determined temporal structure of climatology and the calibrated hydrological model parameters over the historical period are valid for use in the future the available water resources can be determined through the calibrated vic hydrological model in section 4 1 to do this two periods of time a historical period 1961 2011 and a future period 2012 2099 are defined the patterns of change of the future inflow of danjiangkou reservoir and the flow generation at the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin were then analysed it is seen from fig 7 that under scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 at the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin the streamflow during the dry season of a year in the future period 2012 2099 will decrease while the streamflow during the flood seasons will increase during the years with frequencies of 50 75 90 and 95 opposite trends are found for the inflow results in danjiangkou reservoir fig 8 the results are consistent with the finding that the mean precipitation will likely increase in many mid latitude wet regions ipcc 2014 largely due to increasing of atmospheric moisture content since topography serves as a barrier to the monsoon winds coming from the east precipitation will be intensified in the upstream mountain areas the precipitation in plains areas mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin will lessen therefore the available water resources from the upstream of the hanjiang river basin increase in the future a potentially favourable outcome for water users however the south to north water transfer project will transfer some of the water from the danjiangkou reservoir and reduce the total available water resources at the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin the relevant alternatives concerning water saving and flwl reservoir operation will alter the water demand and available water resources thus the impacts of the water transfer project water saving and flwl should be examined in order to optimize local water resources management especially when the locally available water decreases in order to reduce the water shortage induced by climate change and the transfer project human activities the effects of adaptation water options the dynamic control of the flwls for the reservoirs operation and water saving measures in the study area should be assessed 4 3 water resources allocation response to climate change and adaptation measures as the water usage in an operational zone located in the upstream affects the downstream area the released water from danjiangkou reservoir can be extracted by operational zones located along the main stream as the rules of water supply operation for the south to north water transfer project in danjiangkou reservoir shown in fig 4 have been taken into account when assessing water demand in the study area no water shortage is found in most of the operational zones along the main stream except qianjiang as there are two reservoirs danjiangkou and siping reservoirs that satisfy dynamic control of flwl four types of operational zones are classified in the study area shown in fig 9 if there is no water shortage in 2010 2020 2030 and 2040 in an operational zone the zone is defined as the type a shown in fig 9 if there is water shortage in one operational zone along the main stream in the study area water supply might be influenced by the water transfer project through the operation of danjiangkou reservoir this operational zone qianjiang is defined as type b shown in fig 9 fangxian and baokang are defined as type c shown in fig 9 because water supply in these two operational zones is impacted by the flwl operation type d in fig 9 is defined as the areas where water shortages can be found where water saving measures are in effect 4 3 1 impacts of variations of water resources availability on water resources allocation the variations of water resources availability result from climate change and the south to north water transfer project the results of an impact assessment of climate change and of the south to north water transfer project on the water resources allocation in the mid lower reaches of the hanjiang river basin are shown in rose diagrams figs 10 and 11 the colour of arc line radii boundaries and fan shape area in these two figures represents the frequency level that is the probability of non occurrence of the drought event referring to the available water resources while the arc line is the water demand at the frequency level and the arc polygon is the responding allocated water result the gap between the arc line water demand and the fan shape allocated water resources represents the amount of water shortage four planninglevelyears 2010 2020 2030 and 2040 are shown in the four quadrants of the cartesian coordinate system three scenarios the historical period 1956 2011 and predicted water flows from rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 are employed in each planninglevelyear four frequencies 95 90 75 and 50 of water inflow are adopted in each scenario therefore 48 4 3 4 types of allocation results in an operational zone are shown in one chart in a concise way to present the impact of various factors on resource allocation as the water demand under theeconomicandsocialdevelopment scenario is increasing in shenglongjia gucheng nanzhang xiangyang tangbai zaoyang and jingmen zhupi operational zones shown in table 1 denoted as type d in fig 9 at frequency levels of 95 90 75 and 50 in 2010 2020 2030 and 2040 respectively the allocated water in these operational zones will generally increase however the allocated water depends on not only water demand but also on available water resources as a result the colours representing the allocated water in each frequency level are in a different order in the different years the minimum allocated water among the four frequency levels in type d operational zones is 50 shown as fan shape in purple except the jingmen zhupi which is 90 shown as fan shape in blue the maximum water demand among the four frequency levels is the 90 while the maximum water resources are at the 50 frequency level as the allocated water under the 50 frequency level is more than the one under the 95 frequency level in jingmen zhupi operational zone the amount of allocated water in jingmen zhupi operational zone mainly depends on available water resources rather than water demand the monthly available water resources are quite unevenly distributed at the 90 and 95 frequency levels shown in fig 7 and most of the water demand is from agriculture shown in tables 1 and 2 the agricultural sector is heavily influenced by climate factors while the industrial and domestic sectors are comparatively stable during climate change bell et al 2014 thus since most demand comes from the agricultural sector water resource allocations are heavily influenced by climate change as shown in fig 3 there are no reservoirs in jingmen zhupi and shenglongjia operational zones and their historical 1956 2011 allocation water results are greater in number than those in the future predicted water flow under rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 in the other four operational zones the allocated water resources calculated under the historical scenarios are the same as those calculated for the future scenarios the main reason for this is that the reservoirs satisfy the water demand by adjusting water flow under future scenarios as the total available water resources are predicted to decrease in the future especially during the dry season according to rcp 2 6 or rcp 4 5 scenarios shown in section 4 2 and since there are not enough reservoirs to adjust the available water to the demand water shortages in the operational zones situated around the boundary of the basins such as jingmen zhupi and shenglongjia will become increasingly serious in the future qianjiang type b shown in fig 9 is located downstream of the danjiangkou reservoir which provides water for the south to north water transfer project as the instream ecological water demand is sensitive to danjiangkou reservoir operations in this area water shortage occurs under the historical scenario shown in fig 11 b and the south to north water transfer project proceeds according to its operational rules shown in section 3 2 if the effects of the transfer project are removed there is no water shortage in qianjiang shown in fig 11 a water inflow in danjiangkou reservoir will increase in the future under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 but the increased inflow cannot completely satisfy the south to north water transfer project at the monthly scale additionally the decreasing amount of water shortage in qianjiang is not equal or linearly related to the increasing amount of inflow into the danjiangkou reservoir due to the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of increasing inflow and the nonlinear operation rule in danjiangkou reservoir 4 3 2 effects of dynamic control of the flwl for the reservoirs operation on water resources allocation fig 12 illustrates the effect of the dynamic control of flwl for the reservoirs operation on water resources allocation in qianjiang influenced by danjiangkou reservoir fangxian and baokang influenced by sanliping reservoir for all optimal water resources allocation results in these three operational zones more water was allocated after the application of the dynamic control of flwl specifically 1 the amount of water allocated in qianjiang is more than that in fangxian and baokang because th danjiangkou reservoir is larger than sanliping reservoir 2 compared with the fig 12 a including qianjiang fangxian and baokang the effects of the dynamic control of flwl on increasing allocated water is more significant at the 95 frequency level especially under the historical scenario since more flood water was stored in the reservoir and then released during the dry season it is worth noting that water shortage will become more severe under the future scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp 4 5 than under historical scenarios in fangxian and baokang operational zones although more water can be gained from the implementation of the dynamic control of flwl adaptation measures in sanliping reservoir for fangxian and baokang operational zones the locally available water cannot satisfy water demand in every scenario and in every year especially in the baokang operational zone 4 3 3 role of water saving alternatives in water resources allocation water saving is an effective option for water resources management as the relationship between water demand and available water resources is nonlinear and optimal water resources allocation is an integral part of a basin system water saving alternatives not only influences optimal water resources allocation in an operational zone but also alleviate the extent of water shortage in the whole basin the possible effects of planned water saving alternatives on water demand in the future can be found in the report on the comprehensive management plan on water resources for the hanjiang river basin china cwrc 2011 in the form of water demands following the implementation of water saving measure shown in table 2 as shown in fig 13 the extent of water shortage in most scenarios was reduced radii boundaries in fig 13 are reduced compared to the results shown in fig 10 figs 11 b and 12 b under the same allocation conditions but using different water demand alternatives shown in tables 1 and 2 the allocated water in nanzhang zaoyang and qianjiang operational zones can satisfy most of their water demands following the implementation of water saving measure however water shortages remain a serious problem in shenglongjia gucheng xiangyang tangbai and jingmen zhupi where the maximum allocated water is less than the water demand at the 50 frequency level under the implementation of water saving measure water shortage under the future scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 is more serious than under the historical scenarios in shengloangjia and jingmen zhupi while the opposite trend is observed in gucheng as these four operational zones are located at the source of the tributaries in hanjiang it is not feasible to transfer or allocate the water from the danjiangkou reservoir to these areas therefore unconventional water resources such as storm water might be good options to satisfy the water demand water shortages in fangxian and baokang are less severe and occur mainly in the regional agricultural sector strategies for allocating water to meet the instream ecology requirements and human demand will be improved in the future 5 conclusion the results of our case study show that the uneven distribution and changes of available water resources will increase the risk of water shortage especially in the optimal water resources allocation operational zones located on the boundaries of the basin where not only is available water reduced but available adaptation measure are fewer and the effects of the measures not as significant as in locations downstream of the tributary or reservoirs the analysis of the adaptation measures demonstrates that water saving and the dynamic control of reservoir operations by flwl can alleviate water shortages and that their effects on optimal water resources allocation is nonlinear the negative impacts of water transfer projects can be avoided through the dynamic control of reservoirs by flwl under all the historical and future rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios however it should be kept in mind that these two conventional adaptation measures are not a complete solution unconventional adaptation measures such as the harvest and use of storm water should also be implemented to solve water shortage problems in this area in summary climate change will bring different challenges and opportunities to different places adaptation measures including water saving flexible reservoir operation and storm water gathering can be adopted to solve the problems of water shortage induced by climate change or water transfer projects on the variability of water resources availability this research has proposed a framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation through an optimal water resources allocation model the optimal model combined climate change and human activities land use cover and water transfer projects to consider the variability of water resources availability therefore the framework proposed in this paper shows quantitatively the effects of adaptation measures to changing environments and will contribute to the support of water management and adaptation choice or policy making reflecting the multi dimensional aspects of optimal water resources allocation as the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation under varied water availability conditions includes gcm downscaling methods hydrological models water demand estimation and optimal allocation models thereare someuncertainties presented in the assessment available datasets are rarely sufficient for calibrating and validating all the required parameters furthermore interacting uncertainties can often become very complex it is important to assess the uncertainty of the assessments in order to determine the level of risk which will be a topic of future research however the results found in this study still offer usefulguidelines for local and international

7587,non rainfall water nrw e g fog and dew in addition to rainfall and snowfall are considered important water inputs to drylands at the same time biological soil crusts bscs are important components of drylands however little information is available regarding the effect of nrw inputs on bsc activation in this study the effects of nrw on physiological activation in three bsc successional stages including the cyanobacteria crust stage crust c moss colonization stage crust cm and moss crust stage crust m were studied in situ results suggest nrw inputs hydrated and activated physiological activity fv fm carbon exchange and nitrogen fixation in bscs but led to a negative carbon balance and low rates of nitrogen fixation in bscs one effective nrw event could hydrate bscs for 7 h following simulated rainfall the physiological activities recovered within 3 h and net carbon gain occurred until 3 h after hydration whereas nrw induced physiological recovery processes were slower and exhibited lower activities leading to a negative carbon balance there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm in all the three bsc stages p 001 the thresholds for fv fm activation decreased with bsc succession and the annual effective nrw events increased with bsc succession with values of 29 8 89 2 and 110 7 in crust c crust cm and crust m respectively the results suggest that moss crust and moss cyanobacteria crust use nrw to prolong metabolic activity and reduce drought stress more efficiently than cyanobacteria crusts therefore these results suggest that bscs utilize nrw to sustain life while growth and biomass accumulation require precipitation rainfall events over a certain threshold keywords biological soil crusts non rainfall water effective non rainfall water events physiological activation succession 1 introduction biological soil crusts bscs are associations of soil organisms mosses liverworts algae lichens fungi bacteria and cyanobacteria and topsoil bscs represent the most ubiquitous surface soil type in drylands and serve important ecological functions in such areas eldridge and greene 1994 bscs are the active organic layer influencing carbon and nitrogen cycle in deserts elbert et al 2009 by stabilizing the topsoil bscs can reduce soil erosion and enhance soil stability thus benefiting the establishment of vegetation and other soil organism in the community jia et al 2014 lange et al 1994 furthermore soil crusts influence ecohydrological processes such as water holding capacity rainfall infiltration and dew formation li et al 2013 in drylands where water is the most limiting factor ji et al 2013 kidron 2014 noy meir 1973 water availability dominates the physiological activity of poikilohydric bscs organisms therefore water is a crucial factor in the growth and development of bscs jia et al 2014 in some inland deserts precipitation in the form of rain or snow is the main water resource in drylands and dew and fog were considered to be ancillary moisture resource jia et al 2014 rao et al 2009 while in some coastal deserts non rainfall water can exceed annual rainfall input beysens 1995 henschel and seely 2008 it has been shown that rain induced physiological processes in bscs respond quickly with activity initiated within a few minutes and recovery to a good state within a few hours belnap 2001 harel et al 2004 proctor 2001 the crust state prior to precipitation and meteorological conditions influence the recovery rate and physiological activity during rain induced hydration belnap 2001 escolar et al 2015 morillas et al 2017 whether nrw represents available water for bscs is unclear bscs are able to utilize nrw to initiate organismal metabolism and nrw events resulted in carbon exchange nitrogen cycling fluorescence recovery and net photosynthesis csintalan et al 2000 del prado and sancho 2007 delgado baquerizo et al 2013 lange et al 1994 rao et al 2009 on the other hand compared to rain dew is characterized by small amounts ca 0 02 0 5 mm slow formation rates and high frequency liu et al 2006 pan et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 and only wets the surface layer of bscs most of the time nrw is formed in the dark and at low temperatures with the exception that fog may persist after sunrise thus nrw induced recovery processes may be distinct from rain induced processes in bsc and require further study however literature on nrw induced physiological processes is scarce especially those focused on different bsc successional stages as most studies have focused on lichen crusts lange et al 1994 veste et al 2008 nrw formation ability increases along with bsc succession owing to the changes in soil surface features such as thermal properties soil constituents and roughness kidron et al 2002 liu et al 2006 furthermore nrw utilization ability varies with bsc developmental level the later successional stages can use nrw more efficiently compared to early stages kidron et al 2002 2014 nrw amounts that are higher than the corresponding thresholds can activate soil organism physiological activity previous studies have indicated that these thresholds vary between different bscs composition belnap et al 2004 kidron et al 2014 lange et al 1992 the thresholds for photosynthetic activity were 0 1 mm for cyanobacteria crust and cyanolichen 0 22 mm for collema 0 03 0 04 mm for some phycolichens and approximately 0 03 for moss belnap et al 2004 kidron 2014 kidron et al 2002 lange et al 1992 at present the terms fog dew and non rainfall water have been used interchangeably and need precise definition non rainfall water is a kind of surface water input which includes dew fog and vapour adsorption kaseke et al 2011b dew is condensing of water vapour on substrate surface when surface temperature falls below dewpoint temperature kaseke et al 2011b fog occurs when atmospheric water vapour reaches saturation and water droplets are suspended fog can occur when relative humidity is above 75 and does not depend on surface temperature george 1951 wang et al 2016 vapour adsorption means vapour movement from the atmosphere to the soil caused by vapour gradient between the two kaseke et al 2011b the commonly used methods for dew collection such as microlysimeters and cloth plate method cpm have been considered to measure not only dew but also can not exclude vapour adsorption and fog deposition kidron and kronenfeld 2017 wang et al 2016 therefore we tend to consider that water input collected by these methods which was considered as dew in previous literatures jia et al 2014 liu et al 2006 pan et al 2010 rao et al 2009 should more properly be regarded as non rainfall water although different forms of precipitation exhibit distinct features few studies have compared the influence of different precipitation forms on different bsc successional stages studies have found that nrw occurs frequently and was considerable in total amount evenari 1981 liu et al 2006 but few studies have linked nrw amount with physiological activity in different bsc successional stages thus the proportion of nrw events that are microbially available is largely unknown to evaluate the possible ecological role of nrw in the growth and survival of bscs we monitored the physiological recovery processes of different bsc successional stages in situ during nrw formation and simulated rain and taking fv fm as an indicator we measured the effects of nrw amount on the activation of photosynthesis in bscs this study aims to 1 verify whether and how nrw inputs activate bsc physiological recovery activity in the field and compare this to rain induced physiological recovery processes and to 2 determine the threshold values of nrw inputs for physiological activation in different bsc successional stages and estimate the annual effective nrw events and annual nrw induced carbon gain 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and bscs sampling the field investigation was conducted at the research station in dalate county 40 21 n 109 51 e on the eastern edge of the hobq desert inner mongolia china the hobq desert is at an elevation of 1040 m and is characterized by shifting sand dunes with an average height of 5 m li et al 2014 the region has a semiarid temperate continental monsoon climate with an average temperature of 6 1 c and a wind velocity of 3 3 m s 1 rao et al 2009 the annual precipitation and evaporation are 293 mm and 2448 mm respectively and most precipitation occurs between july and september rao et al 2009 fog and dew is abundant and occurs on 40 of the mornings the natural vegetation is dominated by drought resistant plants represented by agriphyllum squarrosum elymus dahuricus salsola collina and agropyron mongolicum li et al 2014 to control desertification in the hobq desert the cyanobacteria microcoleus vaginatus and scytonema javanicum which were isolated from natural bscs were chosen as strains to induce biological soil crusts from 2002 to 2009 cyanobacteria crust formed shortly after inoculation while moss began occurring three years later on the shaded sides of sand dunes lan et al 2014 after 15 years of development induced bscs at different successional stages were distributed in different environmental conditions bscs that were inoculated in 2008 were used for investigation three typical bsc successional stages including the cyanobacteria crust crust c moss colonization stage crust cm and moss crust crust m were investigated detailed description in table 1 the three stages of bscs were distributed 1 3 ms apart on a gentle slope fig 1 nearby bare sand that had not been inoculated with microcoleus vaginatus or scytonema javanicum was used as a control fig 1 2 2 experimental design the in situ nrw non rainfall water amounts were measured at 2 h intervals from 19 00 07 00 during september 2014 with simultaneous measurements of the associated meteorological parameters air temperature rh etc in situ recovery of bsc chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm co2 exchange rate and nitrogenase activity na during nrw formation processes were also measured simultaneously the in situ crust samples that experienced nrw formation were taken for physiological measurement at different times during the nrw formation the fv fm and co2 exchange rate were recorded at 2 h intervals from 19 00 5 00 and then at 0 5 h intervals until the fv fm and net photosynthesis declined to nearly zero the na rates were measured during four periods 19 00 23 00 23 00 3 00 3 00 5 00 and 5 00 8 00 to understand the response of photosynthesis to nrw amount fv fm were taken as an indicator of photosynthesis and recorded 16 nrw events and the corresponding fv fm values during september 2014 to understand the physiological recovery process after simulated rainfall dry intact crust layers were sampled taken to the nearby station and incubated on natural sand for three days to simulate a daytime rainfall crust samples were wetted with 4 mm of distilled water at 9 00 on a cloudy day and incubated under natural environmental conditions the fv fm and co2 exchange were measured before and 6 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 3 h 5 h and 7 h after the simulated rainfall the na of soil crust is light dependent and thus the samples used to measure na were wetted at 12 00 and the diurnal variation in na was measured at 0 2 2 6 6 12 12 18 and 18 24 h after hydration to simulate a nocturnal rainfall crust samples were wetted at 19 00 and incubated under natural conditions physiological activity using the same time frame as the nrw treated physiological measurements with the exception that fv fm and co2 exchange were measured more frequently from 19 00 21 00 2 3 the nrw formation process we used a method similar to rao et al 2009 who measured dew on bsc by driving cylindrical pvc containers diameter of 5 4 cm and height of 5 cm into the soil to collect the crusts and subsurface sand soil the base of each collector was then covered with a porous base lid and set close to the sampling site to collect dew however we recognise this method does not exclude vapour adsorption hence decide to use the term non rainfall water input unlike in the previous study the collectors were weighed on a balance digital l102 from 19 00 7 00 on 27 28 september at 2 h intervals the results were recorded and the differences in weight indicated the nrw input calculated in millimetres of liquid water on the crusts and sand surface

humidity at height of 1 5 m were monitored by an automatic weather micro station milos 500 vaisala inc diurnal variations in light intensity were measured with a quantitherm light meter thermometer hansatech uk the soil moisture water content by volume of bscs and sand were measured with a soil moisture meter tzs ii heb biotechnology co xi an china 2 5 chlorophyll fluorescence chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm is the maximum quantum efficiency of ps ii photochemistry and represents the highest solar energy conversion efficiency of the ps ii reaction center wu et al 2013 fv fm was measured to monitor the recovery of photosynthesis a plant efficiency analyzer handy pea hansatech instruments ltd norfolk uk was used for chlorophyll fluorescence measurement a dark adaptation period of at least 10 min was employed and a saturating pulse of approximately 1500 μmol photos m 2 s 1 was used to excite the chlorophyll molecules the minimal fo and maximal fluorescence fm were recorded the variable fluorescence fv was calculated as fv fm fo 2 6 carbon exchange rate measurements the carbon exchange rate was determined by using the co2 variation rate as measured by a yaxin 1102 photosynthesis system beijing yaxinliyi sci and tech co ltd beijing intact crust samples with diameter of 5 cm were transferred into a 0 4 l transparency air chamber attached to a closed flow system and the co2 concentration was monitored with an infrared carbon dioxide sensor the carbon exchange rate was recorded after the variations in co2 concentrations stabilized 2 7 nitrogenase activity measurements na was measured by a modified acetylene reduction assay stewart et al 1967 a crust sample with an area of 1 44 cm2 was put into a 20 ml glass cuvette and sealed with a rubber stopper ten percent of the air volume within the cuvette was replaced with acetylene gas freshly produced from calcium carbide the cuvettes for nrw treated samples were incubated in situ and those for the simulated rain treated samples were incubated under natural conditions after specified intervals 5 ml gas sample within each cuvette was withdrawn and injected into a 5 ml vacutainer the content of ethylene was measured with a shimadzu gc14c gas chromatograph equipped with a gas chromatography column and a flame ionization detector one gram of nearby bare sand was chosen as a control 2 8 data analysis the integrated areas under the curves of the carbon exchange rates during nrw input and simulated rainfall were calculated using graph pad prism 7 software to estimate cumulative carbon exchange for these events a one way anova with lsd least significant difference multiple comparisons was used to test the differences in soil characteristics and nrw amounts among different bsc types a one way anova with lsd multiple comparisons was used to test the differences in physiological activities fv fm carbon exchange nitrogen fixation and cumulative carbon exchange among crust types during nrw input and simulated rain regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between nrw amount and the recovered fv fm the slopes and intercepts were compared using ancova and the slopes of the regression suggested that the rate of recovered fv fm changes with nrw amount based on the regression equation the minimal nrw amounts threshold values for fv fm activation defined as fv fm 0 1 brandt et al 2015 in different bscs were calculated the proportion of nrw amount over the threshold value was considered as the effective nrw frequency and the annual effective nrw events was calculated as the product of the number of annual dewy days 119 days provided by local weather bureau and the effective nrw frequency the annual nrw induced carbon gain was calculated as the product of the annual effective nrw events and the carbon gain per effective nrw event statistical analyses were conducted using spss 20 0 software spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 diurnal variations in meteorological factors and the nrw formation process during the research period september 2014 8 rainy days with 102 7 mm rainfall amount in total were recorded sunrise occurred around 06 00 when light intensity began to increase and this peaked at 11 00 and declined after that fig 2 a relative humidity increased during the night and was consistently over 90 between 01 00 8 00 and declined during the day to a low of 34 at 17 00 fig 2a soil moisture was relatively high at night and declined in the daytime fig 2b soil moisture in moss crust was significantly higher than in other crust types and all types of bscs exhibited higher soil moistures than sand fig 2b air and surface temperatures followed similar trends increasing from morning and reaching peak temperature at 13 00 and before steadily declining fig 2c however surface temperatures had much greater fluctuation than air temperature fig 2c from 1 00 to 5 00 the surface temperatures of bscs and bare sand were lower than the dew point the surface temperatures in bscs were higher during daytime and lower at night compared to those of bare sand for bscs crust m and crust cm often showed lower surface temperatures than crust c at night fig 2c nrw input into each type of crust occurred from 19 00 to 7 00 at different rates fig 2d crust m experienced significantly more nrw input than the rest for crust cm crust c and bare sand there were no difference in cumulative nrw amount from 19 00 to 23 00 after 1 00 crust cm exhibited faster nrw accumulation than crust c and the nrw accumulation on bare sand was the slowest fig 2d 3 2 recovery of physiological activities in bscs activated by nrw and simulated rainfall the nrw induced fv fm recovery process in each type of crust showed a similar trend fv fm began to recover at 1 00 for crust m and 3 00 for crust c and crust cm and reached peak at approximately 3 00 for crust c 0 167 and at 06 00 for crust cm 0 402 and crust m 0 55 fv fm was relatively stable until 6 30 and then gradually declined to zero fig 3 a the recovered fv fm was significantly higher in crust m than in crust cm p 01 and was significantly higher in crust cm than in crust c p 01 fig 3a the rainfall induced fv fm recovery processes during the day and at night in each crust were initiated on hydration were recovered to a stable state within 2 3 h of rehydration fig 3b c the fv fm in crust c and crust cm induced by nocturnal rainfall increased slight after sunrise fig 3b these recoveries were faster and higher than those in the nrw induced recovery process in the corresponding crusts before sunrise the nrw induced carbon exchange rate which indicates the respiration of bscs showed a gradual increase in carbon loss in crust cm and crust m while the carbon loss in crust c increased until 1 00 and then remained relatively steady until sunrise fig 3d after sunrise carbon exchange increased until 06 30 and then declined photosynthetic carbon gain was observed for 1 h 1 h and 1 5 h for crust c crust cm and crust m respectively then carbon exchange in all crusts declined to below zero reached peak carbon loss at 8 00 and then gradually increased to zero at 9 00 fig 3d the carbon exchange indicated that bsc organisms were activated for longer than 7 h in each crust however carbon exchange induced by nocturnal rainfall reached a peak of carbon loss immediately and the carbon loss declined within the following hour and remained low rates until 5 30 fig 3e after sunrise photosynthetic carbon gain occurred rapidly increased to high rates and then remained relatively stable fig 3e the carbon exchange induced by daytime rainfall in all crusts exhibited carbon loss within 1 h on hydration with the maximum carbon loss occurring at 15 min after hydration fig 3f these crusts began to gain carbon at 2 h after hydration and carbon exchange rates were relatively steady at 3 h after hydration fig 3f the nrw induced nitrogen fixation in each type of crust is shown in fig 3g from 19 00 to 3 00 no nitrogen fixation was detected in any crust from 3 00 to 8 00 all crusts showed relatively low rates of nitrogen fixation as for rainfall the nitrogen fixation induced by nocturnal rainfall was observed after hydration and the nitrogen fixation rates in all crusts were low but were higher than the corresponding nrw induced values fig 3h the nitrogen fixation induced by daytime rainfall peaked within 2 h for all crusts on hydration and declined to low rates at night fig 3i the nrw induced cumulative carbon exchange was negative in all crusts fig 4 a the carbon loss of crust m was significantly higher than that of crust cm and crust c p 01 and crust cm showed significantly higher carbon loss than crust c p 01 fig 4a as for rainfall the cumulative carbon exchange induced by nocturnal rainfall in all crusts showed an increase of carbon loss until 5 30 after sunrise the photosynthetic carbon gain gradually offset the carbon loss and the cumulative carbon exchange became positive at 10 00 fig 4b the daytime rain induced cumulative carbon exchange in all crusts was negative within 3 h after hydration and the maximum cumulative carbon loss occurred at 1 h after hydration fig 4c the cumulative carbon exchange became positive at 3 h after hydration and increased with hydration duration fig 4c for rain induced cumulative carbon exchange crust m showed a significantly higher cumulative carbon loss than the other two types of bscs on hydration p 05 and showed significantly higher cumulative carbon gain along with hydration p 01 fig 4b c 3 3 correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered fv fm in the morning the nrw amount and recovered fv fm during 16 nrw days in september 2014 are shown in fig 5 there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered fv fm values in different bsc successional stages r2 0 681 p 001 in crust c r2 0 495 p 001 in crust cm r2 0 480 p 001 in crust m fig 5 ancova revealed that the slope of the relationship between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm was 1 008 in crust c which was significantly lower than the slopes of 2 295 in crust cm p 01 and 2 433 in crust m p 01 table 2 the thresholds for fv fm activation decreased with bsc succession the thresholds were approximately 0 160 mm 0 074 mm and 0 060 mm for crust c crust cm and crust m respectively table 2 the effective nrw frequency increased with bsc successional stage table 3 the annual effective nrw events were 29 8 89 2 and 110 7 in crust c crust cm and crust m respectively table 3 4 discussion 4 1 nrw includes vapour condensation ability of the three bsc successional stages we observed dramatic diurnal variations in meteorological factors at the study site and nocturnal meteorology was characterized by low air and soil surface temperature and high relative humidity duvdevani 1964 pan et al 2010 zangvil 1996 nrw was continuously formed from 19 00 to 7 00 based on the definition of different nrw forms kaseke et al 2012 the nrw input was mainly vapour adsorption from 19 00 01 00 when surface temperatures were above dewpoint high relative humidity 81 92 between 23 00 01 00 brought possibility of fog deposition from 01 00 07 00 surface temperatures were lower than dew point temperatures meanwhile relative humidity was above 90 which allowed dew formation kaseke et al 2011a vapour adsorption and fog contributed to around 50 of nrw input in all crusts and bare sand it is interesting that vapour adsorption by moss crust was significantly higher than other crust types and bare sand while there was no difference of vapour adsorption by other surface soil types this may because the moss shoots protrude above the surface resulted a higher surface area in direct contact with the atmosphere which could facilitate vapour adsorption kaseke et al 2011b the mosses with rhizoids embedded into soil may also create channels allowing for vapour movement into the soil bscs can acquire significantly higher amounts of dew than bare sand and the later successional stages had higher dew condensation abilities than the early stage this may because that the development of bscs changes the geomorphology and properties of the surface layer consequently changing the ability of bscs to form dew kidron et al 2002 liu et al 2006 sun et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 cyanobacteria crust can capture more silt and clay particles and reduce the surface heat capacity resulting in a larger temperature difference between night and day and thus facilitating dew formation on surface soil rao et al 2009 in this study bscs also showed faster heating and cooling processes than bare sand which may promote nrw input the fog and dew in crust cm and crust m were higher than crust c indicates that protrusions of moss shoot could be contribute to fog harvest and dew formation moss protrusion was considered to facilitate cooling of soil surface at night jia et al 2014 kidron et al 2002 thus may promote dew formation in moss cyanobacteria crust and moss crust the effect of protrusion on nrw has also been experimentally shown by kidron et al 2002 who found that the higher the nrw collector cloth protruded above soil surface the more the nrw was formed kidron et al 2002 4 2 nrw induced and simulated rain induced physiological recovery processes this study found that nrw could activate physiological activity in all stages of bscs and that nrw induced physiological activation resulted in carbon exchange and low nitrogen fixation rates the in situ fv fm in all stages of bscs recovered before sunrise and net carbon fixation was achieved for brief periods immediately after sunrise however carbon exchange rapidly declined below zero after sunrise mainly owing to reduction of photosynthesis which was indicated by the decline trend of fv fm the rapid increasing of light intensity may promote evaporation of crusts surface where most photosynthetic organism distributes thus reduced the photosynthesis these results are consistent with previous field and laboratory investigations csintalan et al 2000 del prado and sancho 2007 lange et al 1994 rao et al 2009 however similar to carbon loss in moss and lichen bscs during nrw formation csintalan et al 2000 lange et al 1994 yoshitake et al 2010 net photosynthesis cannot compensate for the long period of respiration resulting in a negative carbon balance low nitrogen fixation rates may be attributed to low temperatures and dark conditions distinct differences were found between the nrw induced and simulated rain induced physiological recovery processes first in contrast with the immediate physiological response to simulated rain nrw induced physiological activation began hours after nrw accumulation nrw induced physiological recovery rates were also slower water deficiency might be the dominating limiting factor as physiological activation required minimal water amounts csintalan et al 2000 veste and littmann 2006 this suggestion can be confirmed by our results showing that the fv fm in crust cm and crust m began to recover when nrw amount exceeded corresponding threshold values in addition low temperature and dark conditions were unfavourable for nitrogen fixation in all crusts and limited the recovery of fv fm in crust c and crust cm second we observed outbursts of co2 efflux upon rehydration by simulated rainfall which is consistent with other rain induced recovery processes rey et al 2016 sponseller 2007 but these outbursts of co2 efflux did not occur during nrw formation the pulse of co2 efflux is purported to stem from soil co2 release huxman et al 2004 sponseller 2007 the mineralization of intracellular compounds fierer and schimel 2003 and decomposition and microbial activity during soil hydration austin et al 2004 huxman et al 2004 the gradual formation of nrw in the field resulted in nrw amounts that were insufficient to induce outbursts of co2 efflux when 0 15 mm volumes of dew were added at a time during a simulation experiment a respiration peak appeared briefly delgado baquerizo et al 2013 in addition rain induced hydration duration depended on rain size and meteorological conditions while the nrw induced hydration duration is always long longer than 7 h in our study approximately 8 h in the namib desert lange et al 1994 and 12 h in the negev desert veste and littmann 2006 long hydration durations should be enough to activate metabolism repair the damage caused by desiccation rajeev et al 2013 and prepare a suitable physiological state for the next rain despite the long hydration duration nrw induced hydration resulted in carbon loss and low nitrogen fixation rates in contrast 3 4 h of rain induced hydration during the day can result in a positive carbon balance and a relatively high rate of nitrogen fixation 4 3 annual effective nrw events and annual carbon gain in different bsc successional stages there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm in all crusts the fv fm threshold for activation declined with bsc succession previous studies have shown that the thresholds for photosynthesis activation are approximately 0 1 mm for cyanobacteria crust lange et al 1992 rao et al 2009 and 0 03 for moss herrnstadt and kidron 2005 kidron et al 2002 the thresholds for the cyanobacteria crust and moss crust in this study were higher than those in previous studies which may be because we tested nrw on soil columns with a height of 5 cm rather than testing surface crust layers as surface soil moistures have been found to be much lower than nrw values kidron and kronenfeld 2017 in summary the nrw utilization ability was inconformity in different bsc successional stages and moss crust and moss cyanobacteria crust could use nrw more efficiently than cyanobacteria crust the numerous annual effective nrw events reduced the desiccation duration which may contribute to physiological activation and improve physiological activity in subsequent rain events belnap 2002 belnap 2003 harel et al 2004 a desiccation duration longer than 3 days led to low rates of nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria crust and cyanolichen belnap 2002 thus by shortening the desiccation duration nrw can increase nitrogen fixation in bscs during rainfall for less drought resistant moss büdel et al 2009 coe et al 2012 when the desiccation duration increased from 5 days to 10 days the carbon loss increased by 50 and carbon balance changed from positive to negative coe et al 2012 the high number of annual effective nrw events 89 2 days for crust cm and 110 7 days for crust m may protect moss from long term desiccation damage and improve photosynthesis during rain moreover the nrw brought frequent diurnal desiccation rehydration cycles which could promote photosynthetic activation in cyanobacteria subjected to long term desiccation harel et al 2004 wu et al 2013 nrw may thus be beneficial for the survival of photosynthetic organisms before rainfall and improve their photosynthetic performance after rainfall warren rhodes et al 2006 in the negev desert nrw was found to facilitate the formation of reproductive organs in bryum thus allowing for immediate fertilization with the onset of the first rain herrnstadt and kidron 2005 thus although nrw resulted in high carbon deficits in bscs especially in crust cm and crust m these carbon deficits may be offset by rain induced carbon gain this study was conducted in september which is at the end of the rainy season when bscs were in good physiological state which may be conducive to the recovery process of bscs under nrw formation and in this period with more soil water existed in underlaying soil than normal nrw formation could benefit from increased vapour movement up from soil and enriched atmospheric vapour from the evaporation of wetter soil jia et al 2014 in other seasons the impacts of nrw on bscs may be different considering the different climate conditions and physiological state 4 4 the ecological role of nrw in successional stages of bscs nrw plays a significant role in alleviating drought stress and in allowing bscs to survive and stay ready for rainfall in the negev desert where the nrw has been thoroughly studied the estimated annual nrw amount is approximately 33 mm yr 1 accounting for one third of the annual rainfall with 195 dewy nights per year everani et al 1971 nrw is microbially available and can induce the physiological activation of bscs kidron et al 2002 veste et al 2008 veste and littmann 2006 however owing to a long period of respiration at night versus a brief photosynthesis period in the morning the proportion of nrw resulting in carbon gain that consequently supports bscs growth is lower in coastal deserts heavy fog and dew can prolong photosynthesis duration and nrw induced photosynthesis is much higher than night respiration making nrw the major driver of carbon gain lange et al 1994 however in the negev desert the nrw induced photosynthesis hours accounted for 10 of the rain induced carbon gain suggesting a minimal role of nrw in carbon gain kidron et al 2002 wilske et al 2008 in our study nrw was found to prolong metabolic duration shorten the desiccation duration and allow bscs to prepare for next rainfall nrw itself plays an auxiliary role in bscs growth as nrw yields a negative carbon balance and low rates of nitrogen fixation a small rainfall supporting light hydration durations less than three or four hours also cannot support bscs growth only a large rainfall and the consequently longer hydration duration lead to rapid growth and mass carbon and nitrogen input the activation processes under different water inputs indicated that the growth of bscs were fluctuant most of the time nrw mainly kept bscs alive and allowed them to maintain a prepared state only during large rainfall did bscs grow rapidly and accumulate biomass this finding may explain the field monitoring results indicating that the biomass of bscs remained constant and increased dramatically during large rainfalls kidron et al 2002 rao et al 2009 nrw played a role in driving bsc succession liu et al 2006 the development of bscs increases nrw amount which in turn benefits the survival and growth of bscs thus promoting the development of bscs our results indicated that moss cyanobacteria crust and moss crust could use nrw more efficiently than cyanobacteria crust and nrw may be indispensable for moss crust in adapting to arid deserts this finding may explain the microtopographical distribution of moss crust in which moss crust was common in places with larger amounts higher frequencies and longer wetness durations of nrw such as around shrubs dune bases and north facing footslopes in the induced bscs at our research site moss crust occurred mainly on the north facing slopes lan et al 2014 5 conclusion the succession of bscs promoted nrw formation on soil surface nrw could activate physiological activity and resulted in respiration at night short term photosynthesis after sunrise and low rates of nitrogen fixation in bscs however the total carbon exchange was negative in all the crusts and carbon loss increased with bsc succession the nrw induced physiological recovery processes were slower and exhibited lower activity compared to the rain induced recovery processes there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm in all the crusts with succession proceeding more nrw was condensed on crust surface but less nrw amount was needed for physiological activation resulting in more annual effective nrw events our results indicated that moss crust and moss cyanobacteria crust can use nrw more efficiently than the early stage and that nrw may act as an essential water resource for moss crust in adapting to arid deserts in summary nrw acts as an efficient water resource prolonging metabolic activity and reducing drought stress for bscs especially for the later successional stages however desert organisms mainly used the nrw to keep alive but growth and the accumulation of biomass require large size of precipitation acknowledgements we are thankful to prof xinqian liu and xiaoliang an from the inner mongolia academy of forestry for their assistance

7587,non rainfall water nrw e g fog and dew in addition to rainfall and snowfall are considered important water inputs to drylands at the same time biological soil crusts bscs are important components of drylands however little information is available regarding the effect of nrw inputs on bsc activation in this study the effects of nrw on physiological activation in three bsc successional stages including the cyanobacteria crust stage crust c moss colonization stage crust cm and moss crust stage crust m were studied in situ results suggest nrw inputs hydrated and activated physiological activity fv fm carbon exchange and nitrogen fixation in bscs but led to a negative carbon balance and low rates of nitrogen fixation in bscs one effective nrw event could hydrate bscs for 7 h following simulated rainfall the physiological activities recovered within 3 h and net carbon gain occurred until 3 h after hydration whereas nrw induced physiological recovery processes were slower and exhibited lower activities leading to a negative carbon balance there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm in all the three bsc stages p 001 the thresholds for fv fm activation decreased with bsc succession and the annual effective nrw events increased with bsc succession with values of 29 8 89 2 and 110 7 in crust c crust cm and crust m respectively the results suggest that moss crust and moss cyanobacteria crust use nrw to prolong metabolic activity and reduce drought stress more efficiently than cyanobacteria crusts therefore these results suggest that bscs utilize nrw to sustain life while growth and biomass accumulation require precipitation rainfall events over a certain threshold keywords biological soil crusts non rainfall water effective non rainfall water events physiological activation succession 1 introduction biological soil crusts bscs are associations of soil organisms mosses liverworts algae lichens fungi bacteria and cyanobacteria and topsoil bscs represent the most ubiquitous surface soil type in drylands and serve important ecological functions in such areas eldridge and greene 1994 bscs are the active organic layer influencing carbon and nitrogen cycle in deserts elbert et al 2009 by stabilizing the topsoil bscs can reduce soil erosion and enhance soil stability thus benefiting the establishment of vegetation and other soil organism in the community jia et al 2014 lange et al 1994 furthermore soil crusts influence ecohydrological processes such as water holding capacity rainfall infiltration and dew formation li et al 2013 in drylands where water is the most limiting factor ji et al 2013 kidron 2014 noy meir 1973 water availability dominates the physiological activity of poikilohydric bscs organisms therefore water is a crucial factor in the growth and development of bscs jia et al 2014 in some inland deserts precipitation in the form of rain or snow is the main water resource in drylands and dew and fog were considered to be ancillary moisture resource jia et al 2014 rao et al 2009 while in some coastal deserts non rainfall water can exceed annual rainfall input beysens 1995 henschel and seely 2008 it has been shown that rain induced physiological processes in bscs respond quickly with activity initiated within a few minutes and recovery to a good state within a few hours belnap 2001 harel et al 2004 proctor 2001 the crust state prior to precipitation and meteorological conditions influence the recovery rate and physiological activity during rain induced hydration belnap 2001 escolar et al 2015 morillas et al 2017 whether nrw represents available water for bscs is unclear bscs are able to utilize nrw to initiate organismal metabolism and nrw events resulted in carbon exchange nitrogen cycling fluorescence recovery and net photosynthesis csintalan et al 2000 del prado and sancho 2007 delgado baquerizo et al 2013 lange et al 1994 rao et al 2009 on the other hand compared to rain dew is characterized by small amounts ca 0 02 0 5 mm slow formation rates and high frequency liu et al 2006 pan et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 and only wets the surface layer of bscs most of the time nrw is formed in the dark and at low temperatures with the exception that fog may persist after sunrise thus nrw induced recovery processes may be distinct from rain induced processes in bsc and require further study however literature on nrw induced physiological processes is scarce especially those focused on different bsc successional stages as most studies have focused on lichen crusts lange et al 1994 veste et al 2008 nrw formation ability increases along with bsc succession owing to the changes in soil surface features such as thermal properties soil constituents and roughness kidron et al 2002 liu et al 2006 furthermore nrw utilization ability varies with bsc developmental level the later successional stages can use nrw more efficiently compared to early stages kidron et al 2002 2014 nrw amounts that are higher than the corresponding thresholds can activate soil organism physiological activity previous studies have indicated that these thresholds vary between different bscs composition belnap et al 2004 kidron et al 2014 lange et al 1992 the thresholds for photosynthetic activity were 0 1 mm for cyanobacteria crust and cyanolichen 0 22 mm for collema 0 03 0 04 mm for some phycolichens and approximately 0 03 for moss belnap et al 2004 kidron 2014 kidron et al 2002 lange et al 1992 at present the terms fog dew and non rainfall water have been used interchangeably and need precise definition non rainfall water is a kind of surface water input which includes dew fog and vapour adsorption kaseke et al 2011b dew is condensing of water vapour on substrate surface when surface temperature falls below dewpoint temperature kaseke et al 2011b fog occurs when atmospheric water vapour reaches saturation and water droplets are suspended fog can occur when relative humidity is above 75 and does not depend on surface temperature george 1951 wang et al 2016 vapour adsorption means vapour movement from the atmosphere to the soil caused by vapour gradient between the two kaseke et al 2011b the commonly used methods for dew collection such as microlysimeters and cloth plate method cpm have been considered to measure not only dew but also can not exclude vapour adsorption and fog deposition kidron and kronenfeld 2017 wang et al 2016 therefore we tend to consider that water input collected by these methods which was considered as dew in previous literatures jia et al 2014 liu et al 2006 pan et al 2010 rao et al 2009 should more properly be regarded as non rainfall water although different forms of precipitation exhibit distinct features few studies have compared the influence of different precipitation forms on different bsc successional stages studies have found that nrw occurs frequently and was considerable in total amount evenari 1981 liu et al 2006 but few studies have linked nrw amount with physiological activity in different bsc successional stages thus the proportion of nrw events that are microbially available is largely unknown to evaluate the possible ecological role of nrw in the growth and survival of bscs we monitored the physiological recovery processes of different bsc successional stages in situ during nrw formation and simulated rain and taking fv fm as an indicator we measured the effects of nrw amount on the activation of photosynthesis in bscs this study aims to 1 verify whether and how nrw inputs activate bsc physiological recovery activity in the field and compare this to rain induced physiological recovery processes and to 2 determine the threshold values of nrw inputs for physiological activation in different bsc successional stages and estimate the annual effective nrw events and annual nrw induced carbon gain 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and bscs sampling the field investigation was conducted at the research station in dalate county 40 21 n 109 51 e on the eastern edge of the hobq desert inner mongolia china the hobq desert is at an elevation of 1040 m and is characterized by shifting sand dunes with an average height of 5 m li et al 2014 the region has a semiarid temperate continental monsoon climate with an average temperature of 6 1 c and a wind velocity of 3 3 m s 1 rao et al 2009 the annual precipitation and evaporation are 293 mm and 2448 mm respectively and most precipitation occurs between july and september rao et al 2009 fog and dew is abundant and occurs on 40 of the mornings the natural vegetation is dominated by drought resistant plants represented by agriphyllum squarrosum elymus dahuricus salsola collina and agropyron mongolicum li et al 2014 to control desertification in the hobq desert the cyanobacteria microcoleus vaginatus and scytonema javanicum which were isolated from natural bscs were chosen as strains to induce biological soil crusts from 2002 to 2009 cyanobacteria crust formed shortly after inoculation while moss began occurring three years later on the shaded sides of sand dunes lan et al 2014 after 15 years of development induced bscs at different successional stages were distributed in different environmental conditions bscs that were inoculated in 2008 were used for investigation three typical bsc successional stages including the cyanobacteria crust crust c moss colonization stage crust cm and moss crust crust m were investigated detailed description in table 1 the three stages of bscs were distributed 1 3 ms apart on a gentle slope fig 1 nearby bare sand that had not been inoculated with microcoleus vaginatus or scytonema javanicum was used as a control fig 1 2 2 experimental design the in situ nrw non rainfall water amounts were measured at 2 h intervals from 19 00 07 00 during september 2014 with simultaneous measurements of the associated meteorological parameters air temperature rh etc in situ recovery of bsc chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm co2 exchange rate and nitrogenase activity na during nrw formation processes were also measured simultaneously the in situ crust samples that experienced nrw formation were taken for physiological measurement at different times during the nrw formation the fv fm and co2 exchange rate were recorded at 2 h intervals from 19 00 5 00 and then at 0 5 h intervals until the fv fm and net photosynthesis declined to nearly zero the na rates were measured during four periods 19 00 23 00 23 00 3 00 3 00 5 00 and 5 00 8 00 to understand the response of photosynthesis to nrw amount fv fm were taken as an indicator of photosynthesis and recorded 16 nrw events and the corresponding fv fm values during september 2014 to understand the physiological recovery process after simulated rainfall dry intact crust layers were sampled taken to the nearby station and incubated on natural sand for three days to simulate a daytime rainfall crust samples were wetted with 4 mm of distilled water at 9 00 on a cloudy day and incubated under natural environmental conditions the fv fm and co2 exchange were measured before and 6 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 3 h 5 h and 7 h after the simulated rainfall the na of soil crust is light dependent and thus the samples used to measure na were wetted at 12 00 and the diurnal variation in na was measured at 0 2 2 6 6 12 12 18 and 18 24 h after hydration to simulate a nocturnal rainfall crust samples were wetted at 19 00 and incubated under natural conditions physiological activity using the same time frame as the nrw treated physiological measurements with the exception that fv fm and co2 exchange were measured more frequently from 19 00 21 00 2 3 the nrw formation process we used a method similar to rao et al 2009 who measured dew on bsc by driving cylindrical pvc containers diameter of 5 4 cm and height of 5 cm into the soil to collect the crusts and subsurface sand soil the base of each collector was then covered with a porous base lid and set close to the sampling site to collect dew however we recognise this method does not exclude vapour adsorption hence decide to use the term non rainfall water input unlike in the previous study the collectors were weighed on a balance digital l102 from 19 00 7 00 on 27 28 september at 2 h intervals the results were recorded and the differences in weight indicated the nrw input calculated in millimetres of liquid water on the crusts and sand surface

humidity at height of 1 5 m were monitored by an automatic weather micro station milos 500 vaisala inc diurnal variations in light intensity were measured with a quantitherm light meter thermometer hansatech uk the soil moisture water content by volume of bscs and sand were measured with a soil moisture meter tzs ii heb biotechnology co xi an china 2 5 chlorophyll fluorescence chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm is the maximum quantum efficiency of ps ii photochemistry and represents the highest solar energy conversion efficiency of the ps ii reaction center wu et al 2013 fv fm was measured to monitor the recovery of photosynthesis a plant efficiency analyzer handy pea hansatech instruments ltd norfolk uk was used for chlorophyll fluorescence measurement a dark adaptation period of at least 10 min was employed and a saturating pulse of approximately 1500 μmol photos m 2 s 1 was used to excite the chlorophyll molecules the minimal fo and maximal fluorescence fm were recorded the variable fluorescence fv was calculated as fv fm fo 2 6 carbon exchange rate measurements the carbon exchange rate was determined by using the co2 variation rate as measured by a yaxin 1102 photosynthesis system beijing yaxinliyi sci and tech co ltd beijing intact crust samples with diameter of 5 cm were transferred into a 0 4 l transparency air chamber attached to a closed flow system and the co2 concentration was monitored with an infrared carbon dioxide sensor the carbon exchange rate was recorded after the variations in co2 concentrations stabilized 2 7 nitrogenase activity measurements na was measured by a modified acetylene reduction assay stewart et al 1967 a crust sample with an area of 1 44 cm2 was put into a 20 ml glass cuvette and sealed with a rubber stopper ten percent of the air volume within the cuvette was replaced with acetylene gas freshly produced from calcium carbide the cuvettes for nrw treated samples were incubated in situ and those for the simulated rain treated samples were incubated under natural conditions after specified intervals 5 ml gas sample within each cuvette was withdrawn and injected into a 5 ml vacutainer the content of ethylene was measured with a shimadzu gc14c gas chromatograph equipped with a gas chromatography column and a flame ionization detector one gram of nearby bare sand was chosen as a control 2 8 data analysis the integrated areas under the curves of the carbon exchange rates during nrw input and simulated rainfall were calculated using graph pad prism 7 software to estimate cumulative carbon exchange for these events a one way anova with lsd least significant difference multiple comparisons was used to test the differences in soil characteristics and nrw amounts among different bsc types a one way anova with lsd multiple comparisons was used to test the differences in physiological activities fv fm carbon exchange nitrogen fixation and cumulative carbon exchange among crust types during nrw input and simulated rain regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between nrw amount and the recovered fv fm the slopes and intercepts were compared using ancova and the slopes of the regression suggested that the rate of recovered fv fm changes with nrw amount based on the regression equation the minimal nrw amounts threshold values for fv fm activation defined as fv fm 0 1 brandt et al 2015 in different bscs were calculated the proportion of nrw amount over the threshold value was considered as the effective nrw frequency and the annual effective nrw events was calculated as the product of the number of annual dewy days 119 days provided by local weather bureau and the effective nrw frequency the annual nrw induced carbon gain was calculated as the product of the annual effective nrw events and the carbon gain per effective nrw event statistical analyses were conducted using spss 20 0 software spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 diurnal variations in meteorological factors and the nrw formation process during the research period september 2014 8 rainy days with 102 7 mm rainfall amount in total were recorded sunrise occurred around 06 00 when light intensity began to increase and this peaked at 11 00 and declined after that fig 2 a relative humidity increased during the night and was consistently over 90 between 01 00 8 00 and declined during the day to a low of 34 at 17 00 fig 2a soil moisture was relatively high at night and declined in the daytime fig 2b soil moisture in moss crust was significantly higher than in other crust types and all types of bscs exhibited higher soil moistures than sand fig 2b air and surface temperatures followed similar trends increasing from morning and reaching peak temperature at 13 00 and before steadily declining fig 2c however surface temperatures had much greater fluctuation than air temperature fig 2c from 1 00 to 5 00 the surface temperatures of bscs and bare sand were lower than the dew point the surface temperatures in bscs were higher during daytime and lower at night compared to those of bare sand for bscs crust m and crust cm often showed lower surface temperatures than crust c at night fig 2c nrw input into each type of crust occurred from 19 00 to 7 00 at different rates fig 2d crust m experienced significantly more nrw input than the rest for crust cm crust c and bare sand there were no difference in cumulative nrw amount from 19 00 to 23 00 after 1 00 crust cm exhibited faster nrw accumulation than crust c and the nrw accumulation on bare sand was the slowest fig 2d 3 2 recovery of physiological activities in bscs activated by nrw and simulated rainfall the nrw induced fv fm recovery process in each type of crust showed a similar trend fv fm began to recover at 1 00 for crust m and 3 00 for crust c and crust cm and reached peak at approximately 3 00 for crust c 0 167 and at 06 00 for crust cm 0 402 and crust m 0 55 fv fm was relatively stable until 6 30 and then gradually declined to zero fig 3 a the recovered fv fm was significantly higher in crust m than in crust cm p 01 and was significantly higher in crust cm than in crust c p 01 fig 3a the rainfall induced fv fm recovery processes during the day and at night in each crust were initiated on hydration were recovered to a stable state within 2 3 h of rehydration fig 3b c the fv fm in crust c and crust cm induced by nocturnal rainfall increased slight after sunrise fig 3b these recoveries were faster and higher than those in the nrw induced recovery process in the corresponding crusts before sunrise the nrw induced carbon exchange rate which indicates the respiration of bscs showed a gradual increase in carbon loss in crust cm and crust m while the carbon loss in crust c increased until 1 00 and then remained relatively steady until sunrise fig 3d after sunrise carbon exchange increased until 06 30 and then declined photosynthetic carbon gain was observed for 1 h 1 h and 1 5 h for crust c crust cm and crust m respectively then carbon exchange in all crusts declined to below zero reached peak carbon loss at 8 00 and then gradually increased to zero at 9 00 fig 3d the carbon exchange indicated that bsc organisms were activated for longer than 7 h in each crust however carbon exchange induced by nocturnal rainfall reached a peak of carbon loss immediately and the carbon loss declined within the following hour and remained low rates until 5 30 fig 3e after sunrise photosynthetic carbon gain occurred rapidly increased to high rates and then remained relatively stable fig 3e the carbon exchange induced by daytime rainfall in all crusts exhibited carbon loss within 1 h on hydration with the maximum carbon loss occurring at 15 min after hydration fig 3f these crusts began to gain carbon at 2 h after hydration and carbon exchange rates were relatively steady at 3 h after hydration fig 3f the nrw induced nitrogen fixation in each type of crust is shown in fig 3g from 19 00 to 3 00 no nitrogen fixation was detected in any crust from 3 00 to 8 00 all crusts showed relatively low rates of nitrogen fixation as for rainfall the nitrogen fixation induced by nocturnal rainfall was observed after hydration and the nitrogen fixation rates in all crusts were low but were higher than the corresponding nrw induced values fig 3h the nitrogen fixation induced by daytime rainfall peaked within 2 h for all crusts on hydration and declined to low rates at night fig 3i the nrw induced cumulative carbon exchange was negative in all crusts fig 4 a the carbon loss of crust m was significantly higher than that of crust cm and crust c p 01 and crust cm showed significantly higher carbon loss than crust c p 01 fig 4a as for rainfall the cumulative carbon exchange induced by nocturnal rainfall in all crusts showed an increase of carbon loss until 5 30 after sunrise the photosynthetic carbon gain gradually offset the carbon loss and the cumulative carbon exchange became positive at 10 00 fig 4b the daytime rain induced cumulative carbon exchange in all crusts was negative within 3 h after hydration and the maximum cumulative carbon loss occurred at 1 h after hydration fig 4c the cumulative carbon exchange became positive at 3 h after hydration and increased with hydration duration fig 4c for rain induced cumulative carbon exchange crust m showed a significantly higher cumulative carbon loss than the other two types of bscs on hydration p 05 and showed significantly higher cumulative carbon gain along with hydration p 01 fig 4b c 3 3 correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered fv fm in the morning the nrw amount and recovered fv fm during 16 nrw days in september 2014 are shown in fig 5 there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered fv fm values in different bsc successional stages r2 0 681 p 001 in crust c r2 0 495 p 001 in crust cm r2 0 480 p 001 in crust m fig 5 ancova revealed that the slope of the relationship between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm was 1 008 in crust c which was significantly lower than the slopes of 2 295 in crust cm p 01 and 2 433 in crust m p 01 table 2 the thresholds for fv fm activation decreased with bsc succession the thresholds were approximately 0 160 mm 0 074 mm and 0 060 mm for crust c crust cm and crust m respectively table 2 the effective nrw frequency increased with bsc successional stage table 3 the annual effective nrw events were 29 8 89 2 and 110 7 in crust c crust cm and crust m respectively table 3 4 discussion 4 1 nrw includes vapour condensation ability of the three bsc successional stages we observed dramatic diurnal variations in meteorological factors at the study site and nocturnal meteorology was characterized by low air and soil surface temperature and high relative humidity duvdevani 1964 pan et al 2010 zangvil 1996 nrw was continuously formed from 19 00 to 7 00 based on the definition of different nrw forms kaseke et al 2012 the nrw input was mainly vapour adsorption from 19 00 01 00 when surface temperatures were above dewpoint high relative humidity 81 92 between 23 00 01 00 brought possibility of fog deposition from 01 00 07 00 surface temperatures were lower than dew point temperatures meanwhile relative humidity was above 90 which allowed dew formation kaseke et al 2011a vapour adsorption and fog contributed to around 50 of nrw input in all crusts and bare sand it is interesting that vapour adsorption by moss crust was significantly higher than other crust types and bare sand while there was no difference of vapour adsorption by other surface soil types this may because the moss shoots protrude above the surface resulted a higher surface area in direct contact with the atmosphere which could facilitate vapour adsorption kaseke et al 2011b the mosses with rhizoids embedded into soil may also create channels allowing for vapour movement into the soil bscs can acquire significantly higher amounts of dew than bare sand and the later successional stages had higher dew condensation abilities than the early stage this may because that the development of bscs changes the geomorphology and properties of the surface layer consequently changing the ability of bscs to form dew kidron et al 2002 liu et al 2006 sun et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 cyanobacteria crust can capture more silt and clay particles and reduce the surface heat capacity resulting in a larger temperature difference between night and day and thus facilitating dew formation on surface soil rao et al 2009 in this study bscs also showed faster heating and cooling processes than bare sand which may promote nrw input the fog and dew in crust cm and crust m were higher than crust c indicates that protrusions of moss shoot could be contribute to fog harvest and dew formation moss protrusion was considered to facilitate cooling of soil surface at night jia et al 2014 kidron et al 2002 thus may promote dew formation in moss cyanobacteria crust and moss crust the effect of protrusion on nrw has also been experimentally shown by kidron et al 2002 who found that the higher the nrw collector cloth protruded above soil surface the more the nrw was formed kidron et al 2002 4 2 nrw induced and simulated rain induced physiological recovery processes this study found that nrw could activate physiological activity in all stages of bscs and that nrw induced physiological activation resulted in carbon exchange and low nitrogen fixation rates the in situ fv fm in all stages of bscs recovered before sunrise and net carbon fixation was achieved for brief periods immediately after sunrise however carbon exchange rapidly declined below zero after sunrise mainly owing to reduction of photosynthesis which was indicated by the decline trend of fv fm the rapid increasing of light intensity may promote evaporation of crusts surface where most photosynthetic organism distributes thus reduced the photosynthesis these results are consistent with previous field and laboratory investigations csintalan et al 2000 del prado and sancho 2007 lange et al 1994 rao et al 2009 however similar to carbon loss in moss and lichen bscs during nrw formation csintalan et al 2000 lange et al 1994 yoshitake et al 2010 net photosynthesis cannot compensate for the long period of respiration resulting in a negative carbon balance low nitrogen fixation rates may be attributed to low temperatures and dark conditions distinct differences were found between the nrw induced and simulated rain induced physiological recovery processes first in contrast with the immediate physiological response to simulated rain nrw induced physiological activation began hours after nrw accumulation nrw induced physiological recovery rates were also slower water deficiency might be the dominating limiting factor as physiological activation required minimal water amounts csintalan et al 2000 veste and littmann 2006 this suggestion can be confirmed by our results showing that the fv fm in crust cm and crust m began to recover when nrw amount exceeded corresponding threshold values in addition low temperature and dark conditions were unfavourable for nitrogen fixation in all crusts and limited the recovery of fv fm in crust c and crust cm second we observed outbursts of co2 efflux upon rehydration by simulated rainfall which is consistent with other rain induced recovery processes rey et al 2016 sponseller 2007 but these outbursts of co2 efflux did not occur during nrw formation the pulse of co2 efflux is purported to stem from soil co2 release huxman et al 2004 sponseller 2007 the mineralization of intracellular compounds fierer and schimel 2003 and decomposition and microbial activity during soil hydration austin et al 2004 huxman et al 2004 the gradual formation of nrw in the field resulted in nrw amounts that were insufficient to induce outbursts of co2 efflux when 0 15 mm volumes of dew were added at a time during a simulation experiment a respiration peak appeared briefly delgado baquerizo et al 2013 in addition rain induced hydration duration depended on rain size and meteorological conditions while the nrw induced hydration duration is always long longer than 7 h in our study approximately 8 h in the namib desert lange et al 1994 and 12 h in the negev desert veste and littmann 2006 long hydration durations should be enough to activate metabolism repair the damage caused by desiccation rajeev et al 2013 and prepare a suitable physiological state for the next rain despite the long hydration duration nrw induced hydration resulted in carbon loss and low nitrogen fixation rates in contrast 3 4 h of rain induced hydration during the day can result in a positive carbon balance and a relatively high rate of nitrogen fixation 4 3 annual effective nrw events and annual carbon gain in different bsc successional stages there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm in all crusts the fv fm threshold for activation declined with bsc succession previous studies have shown that the thresholds for photosynthesis activation are approximately 0 1 mm for cyanobacteria crust lange et al 1992 rao et al 2009 and 0 03 for moss herrnstadt and kidron 2005 kidron et al 2002 the thresholds for the cyanobacteria crust and moss crust in this study were higher than those in previous studies which may be because we tested nrw on soil columns with a height of 5 cm rather than testing surface crust layers as surface soil moistures have been found to be much lower than nrw values kidron and kronenfeld 2017 in summary the nrw utilization ability was inconformity in different bsc successional stages and moss crust and moss cyanobacteria crust could use nrw more efficiently than cyanobacteria crust the numerous annual effective nrw events reduced the desiccation duration which may contribute to physiological activation and improve physiological activity in subsequent rain events belnap 2002 belnap 2003 harel et al 2004 a desiccation duration longer than 3 days led to low rates of nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria crust and cyanolichen belnap 2002 thus by shortening the desiccation duration nrw can increase nitrogen fixation in bscs during rainfall for less drought resistant moss büdel et al 2009 coe et al 2012 when the desiccation duration increased from 5 days to 10 days the carbon loss increased by 50 and carbon balance changed from positive to negative coe et al 2012 the high number of annual effective nrw events 89 2 days for crust cm and 110 7 days for crust m may protect moss from long term desiccation damage and improve photosynthesis during rain moreover the nrw brought frequent diurnal desiccation rehydration cycles which could promote photosynthetic activation in cyanobacteria subjected to long term desiccation harel et al 2004 wu et al 2013 nrw may thus be beneficial for the survival of photosynthetic organisms before rainfall and improve their photosynthetic performance after rainfall warren rhodes et al 2006 in the negev desert nrw was found to facilitate the formation of reproductive organs in bryum thus allowing for immediate fertilization with the onset of the first rain herrnstadt and kidron 2005 thus although nrw resulted in high carbon deficits in bscs especially in crust cm and crust m these carbon deficits may be offset by rain induced carbon gain this study was conducted in september which is at the end of the rainy season when bscs were in good physiological state which may be conducive to the recovery process of bscs under nrw formation and in this period with more soil water existed in underlaying soil than normal nrw formation could benefit from increased vapour movement up from soil and enriched atmospheric vapour from the evaporation of wetter soil jia et al 2014 in other seasons the impacts of nrw on bscs may be different considering the different climate conditions and physiological state 4 4 the ecological role of nrw in successional stages of bscs nrw plays a significant role in alleviating drought stress and in allowing bscs to survive and stay ready for rainfall in the negev desert where the nrw has been thoroughly studied the estimated annual nrw amount is approximately 33 mm yr 1 accounting for one third of the annual rainfall with 195 dewy nights per year everani et al 1971 nrw is microbially available and can induce the physiological activation of bscs kidron et al 2002 veste et al 2008 veste and littmann 2006 however owing to a long period of respiration at night versus a brief photosynthesis period in the morning the proportion of nrw resulting in carbon gain that consequently supports bscs growth is lower in coastal deserts heavy fog and dew can prolong photosynthesis duration and nrw induced photosynthesis is much higher than night respiration making nrw the major driver of carbon gain lange et al 1994 however in the negev desert the nrw induced photosynthesis hours accounted for 10 of the rain induced carbon gain suggesting a minimal role of nrw in carbon gain kidron et al 2002 wilske et al 2008 in our study nrw was found to prolong metabolic duration shorten the desiccation duration and allow bscs to prepare for next rainfall nrw itself plays an auxiliary role in bscs growth as nrw yields a negative carbon balance and low rates of nitrogen fixation a small rainfall supporting light hydration durations less than three or four hours also cannot support bscs growth only a large rainfall and the consequently longer hydration duration lead to rapid growth and mass carbon and nitrogen input the activation processes under different water inputs indicated that the growth of bscs were fluctuant most of the time nrw mainly kept bscs alive and allowed them to maintain a prepared state only during large rainfall did bscs grow rapidly and accumulate biomass this finding may explain the field monitoring results indicating that the biomass of bscs remained constant and increased dramatically during large rainfalls kidron et al 2002 rao et al 2009 nrw played a role in driving bsc succession liu et al 2006 the development of bscs increases nrw amount which in turn benefits the survival and growth of bscs thus promoting the development of bscs our results indicated that moss cyanobacteria crust and moss crust could use nrw more efficiently than cyanobacteria crust and nrw may be indispensable for moss crust in adapting to arid deserts this finding may explain the microtopographical distribution of moss crust in which moss crust was common in places with larger amounts higher frequencies and longer wetness durations of nrw such as around shrubs dune bases and north facing footslopes in the induced bscs at our research site moss crust occurred mainly on the north facing slopes lan et al 2014 5 conclusion the succession of bscs promoted nrw formation on soil surface nrw could activate physiological activity and resulted in respiration at night short term photosynthesis after sunrise and low rates of nitrogen fixation in bscs however the total carbon exchange was negative in all the crusts and carbon loss increased with bsc succession the nrw induced physiological recovery processes were slower and exhibited lower activity compared to the rain induced recovery processes there were significant positive correlations between nrw amounts and the recovered values of fv fm in all the crusts with succession proceeding more nrw was condensed on crust surface but less nrw amount was needed for physiological activation resulting in more annual effective nrw events our results indicated that moss crust and moss cyanobacteria crust can use nrw more efficiently than the early stage and that nrw may act as an essential water resource for moss crust in adapting to arid deserts in summary nrw acts as an efficient water resource prolonging metabolic activity and reducing drought stress for bscs especially for the later successional stages however desert organisms mainly used the nrw to keep alive but growth and the accumulation of biomass require large size of precipitation acknowledgements we are thankful to prof xinqian liu and xiaoliang an from the inner mongolia academy of forestry for their assistance

downstream this study assessed upland and in stream controls on baseflow nutrient concentrations in a low gradient tile drained agroecosystem watershed we conducted time series analysis using empirical mode decomposition of seven decade long nutrient concentration time series in the agricultural upper big walnut creek watershed ohio usa four tributaries of varying drainage areas and three main stem sites were monitored and nutrient grab samples were collected weekly from 2006 to 2016 and analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorus drp nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp statistically significant seasonal fluctuations were compared with seasonality of baseflow watershed characteristics e g tile drain density and in stream water quality parameters ph do temperature findings point to statistically significant seasonality of all parameters with peak p concentrations in summer and peak n in late winter early spring results suggest that upland processes exert strong control on drp concentrations in the winter and spring months while coupled upland and in stream conditions control watershed baseflow drp concentrations during summer and early fall conversely upland flow sources driving streamflow exert strong control on baseflow no3 n and in stream attenuation through transient and permanent pathways impacts the magnitude of removal regarding tn and tp we found that tn was governed by no3 n while tp was governed by drp in summer and fluvial erosion of p rich benthic sediments during higher baseflow conditions findings of the study highlight the importance of coupled in stream and upland management for mitigating eutrophic conditions during environmentally sensitive timeframes keywords water quality nutrients drainage agriculture time series ceap 1 introduction increases in systematic tile drainage in low gradient agricultural landscapes have significantly impacted watershed hydrology and nutrient fate and transport over the past 50 years blann et al 2009 king et al 2014a christianson et al 2016 for instance in the western lake erie basin increasing occurrence of harmful cyanobacteria algal blooms habs has been linked to increases in dissolved reactive phosphorus drp loading potentially caused by several compounding factors including increased drainage intensity smith et al 2015 much emphasis has been placed on nutrient loading dynamics during storm flows given the disproportionate control of events on nutrient fluxes e g sharpley et al 2008 notwithstanding the significance of large nutrient fluxes during storm events tile drainage can be a major component of stream baseflow shilling and helmers 2008 king et al 2014a b and baseflow nutrient concentrations schilling and zhang 2004 baseflow nutrient concentrations which constitute less than 10 of annual nutrient loads may play a significant role in hab formation in small lakes and riverine environments given the low water retention times in these systems shore et al 2017 in order to identify the most effective management strategies at a watershed scale a need exists to better understand the underlying upland and in stream mechanisms controlling nutrient concentrations in tile drained landscapes intra annual variability in baseflow stream nitrate no3 n concentration has been reported due to seasonal differences in the rates of in stream and riparian biochemical reactions and time varying contributions of drainage sources pionke et al 1999 peterson et al 2001 mulholland et al 2008 griffiths et al 2012 exner kittridge et al 2016 ford et al 2017a as recently highlighted in exner kittridge et al 2016 stream baseflow no3 n concentrations have been observed to increase in the winter and decrease in the summer within temperate tile drained landscapes denitrification and algal uptake are pronounced in the summer and can deplete no3 n resulting in either permanent or transient removal of n yet algal assimilation is often neglected in watershed mass balance calculations mulholland et al 2008 ford et al 2017a the source of no3 n and flow pathway for delivery may also influence concentrations in these watersheds nitrate may originate from subsurface seepage in the variably saturated vadose zone and or deeper saturated aquifers exner kittridge et al 2016 high stream no3 n concentrations in winter may reflect the prominence of n laden shallow vadose zone water from tile drains during wet antecedent conditions conversely low stream no3 n concentrations in summer may reflect minimal contributions of systematic drainage williams et al 2015a and higher saturated zone flow from deeper aquifers that are depleted in n due to extended residence time for denitrification while both in stream and upland processes likely exert some control on stream no3 n concentration the extent to which processes control no3 n at increasing watershed scales is not well understood while dissolved reactive phosphorus drp trends from long term records have shown mixed results in terms of seasonal max min dynamics studies specifically targeting baseflow have shown peak drp concentrations during summer however the mechanisms controlling these dynamics are not well understood mulholland and hill 1997 pionke et al 1999 stow et al 2015 shore et al 2017 elevated drp concentration in summer could reflect several potential in stream and upland pathways regarding upland soil drainage greater drp could reflect enhanced weathering and dissolution of phosphorus p bearing substrata evapotranspiration in the vadose zone or enhanced mineralization of organic matter jarvie et al 2014 hartmann et al 2014 ford et al 2015a in many agricultural watersheds soil bound p tends to be highly stratified with elevated levels in surface soils hence we would not suspect high connectivity to subsurface drainage for baseflow concentrations king et al 2014a b baker et al 2017 however macropore flow through desiccation cracks could resupply shallow aquifers below tile drains with enriched p concentrations during dry summer months which is subsequently leached to the stream williams et al 2016 ford et al 2017b in streams elevated drp concentrations could be associated with enhanced release of drp by polyphosphate accumulating organisms in benthic biofilms dissolution of phosphate precipitates analogous to soil drainage or desorption of legacy sediment p immobilized in transient storage zones wang et al 2008 jarvie et al 2014 wu et al 2014 saia et al 2017 the objective of the present study was to utilize ambient long term records of nutrient concentrations namely no3 n drp total n tn and total p tp to identify upland and in stream controls on nutrient concentrations at baseflow conditions we focus on tile drained midwestern watersheds given the rampant acute and chronic nutrient flux problems that are well documented in these landscapes specifically we aim to identify and discuss the following questions 1 do seasonal baseflow nutrient dynamics agree with common perceptions 2 to what extent are watershed fluxes reflective of in stream and upland controls and 3 what are the environmental and management implications for tile drained agroecosystems to answer these questions we use a 10 year dataset and time series analysis of longitudinal watershed data in the upper big walnut creek ubwc usda benchmark watershed located in central ohio usa and compare the data to critical upland drainage nutrient concentrations and in stream water quality indicators 2 methods 2 1 study sites the huc

one of the 24 watersheds selected for the conservation effects assessment project ceap arnold et al 2014 fig 1 the watershed drains through the hoover reservoir which is a major drinking water source for the columbus ohio metropolitan area richardson et al 2008 fig 1 the ubwc has a drainage area of 492 km2 and is predominantly 60 composed of cropland for production agriculture with major crops including corn soybeans and wheat king et al 2008 extensive tile drainage networks in the watershed stem from fine clayey soil texture which primarily consist of bennington pewamo cardington soil associations 60 table 1 king et al 2008 we refer the reader to king et al 2008 for further site characterization eight huc 12 watersheds are nested within the ubwc basin of which four t 1 t 2 t 3 and t 4 were monitored from 2006 through 2016 three additional sites located on the main stem ms 1 ms 2 and ms 3 of the watershed were also monitored and each main stem monitoring site incorporates an additional huc 12 watershed a u s geological survey real time gauging station co located at ms 2 usgs 03228300 has historical water quality data spanning much of the nutrient data collection timeframe

of the huc 12 watersheds are summarized in table 1 information in table 1 for the main stem sites reflect the additional drainage area added at the monitoring location two small municipal wastewater

monitoring report pollutant loading tool u s epa 2017 such loadings are small in comparison with agricultural watershed p loadings reported in the ubwc of 98 kg p km2 yr 2 2 data collection and analysis weekly grab samples were collected from the middle of the stream at each of the seven study locations using standard u s epa protocol for collection and preservation of water samples for n and p analysis u s epa 1983 water level at each of the monitoring locations was also measured at the time of sample collection water samples were immediately brought back to the lab and refrigerated 4 c until they were filtered through 0 45 µm glass microfibre filters drp and no3 n concentrations in filtered samples were determined colorimetrically by flow injection analysis using a quik chem 8000 fia automated ion analyzer lachat instruments total n and tp analyses were performed on unfiltered samples following alkaline persulfate oxidation koroleff 1983 all water samples were analyzed within 28 days following collection 2 3 statistical analysis empirical mode decomposition was selected as the preferred method for the analysis since the method is purely empirical e g does not use sine cosine functions makes no limiting assumptions about the dataset can be applied to a wide class of signals and can be used as an a posteriori approach which is ideal for an exploratory analysis huang et al 1998 wu et al 2007 ford et al 2015b the method has been broadly applied to a wide range of environmental signals most relevant to this study include applications to sediment carbon and n elemental and isotopic signatures ford et al 2015b and climate data wu et al 2007 for the analyses in the current study datasets were assumed to be non linear non stationary and to have non parametric distributions therefore all datasets were first log transformed due to their non normal skewed distributions so that the noise of the stochastic event event variability did not mask significant trends venier et al 2012 exploratory time series analysis was performed on the decade long nutrient datasets at all monitoring locations within the ubwc watershed empirical mode decomposition emd was used to decompose the nutrient time series into intrinsic mode functions imfs huang et al 1998 wu et al 2007 intrinsic mode functions are a finite series of amplitude and frequency modulated oscillatory functions in which lowest frequency imf is identified as the base trend and the highest frequency trend is considered noise for well sampled datasets wu et al 2007 empirical mode decomposition was conducted utilizing a six step iterative procedure as summarized in ford et al 2015b in which 1 local maxima and minima are identified in the time series 2 cubic spline interpolation signals are computed to create upper and lower envelopes 3 upper and lower envelopes are averaged 4 the average envelope is subtracted from the signal related to the current iteration 5 the process is repeated until the averaged envelope converges to a stated threshold 6 the resulting imf is subtracted from the original dataset to create a new time series and steps 1 5 are repeated until all extremes are removed we compiled a previously published code in matlab that performs emd and generates imfs for each site rato et al 2008 we performed statistical significance tests to test the hypothesis that imfs of the dataset were statistically different from white noise imfs wu and huang 2004 wu et al 2007 ford et al 2015b a log log plot of variance versus mean period was plotted for each imf and tested against a confidence interval for white noise wu and huang 2004 the highest frequency trend was used as the basis for noise and a negative linear relationship of log var versus log period with a slope of 1 was plotted with upper and lower bounds for the confidence interval being represented with log10 var log10 3 the protocol allotted three standard deviations for confidence bounds for noise intrinsic mode functions with frequencies that plot outside the specified variance range are statistically differentiable from white noise and thus are expected to have some physical meaning aggregation of statistically significant trends for imfs for the emd results was conducted by combining imfs at environmentally relevant timescales for the present study we focus on the seasonal timescale given the implications for seasonal eutrophication and habs statistically significant frequencies between 0 7 and 1 3 years were included as a seasonal fluctuation because trends may not have pronounced peaks in some years resulting in a frequency 1 year or may experience a secondary oscillation in some years resulting in a frequency 1 year if such a phenomenon is commonly occurring leading to frequencies outside of the specified bounds we suggest that the result is likely due to a non seasonal fluctuation for the results we define any statistically significant imf as a trend throughout the remainder of the manuscript non parametric statistical tests linear regression and explanatory visual statistical plots were utilized to compare nutrient datasets between sites box and whisker plots were used to visualize distributions and were generated in sigmaplot 13 given the skew of the data the y axis was plotted on a log scale independence of individually collected samples was assumed and statistical tests were performed in the statistical package sigmastat 13 specifically the mann whitney rank sum test was utilized to determine statistically significant differences in median values for the datasets the rank sum test is nonparametric thus does not require assuming data normality or equal variance a significance level of α 0 05 was selected for testing the null hypothesis that the two samples were not drawn from the same populations specifically we were interested in testing how the main stem sites compared to tributary ranges 3 results 3 1 exploratory statistics median concentrations in the tributaries ranged from 0 6 1 5 mg l for no3 n 1 0 2 2 mg l for tn 0 01 0 06 mg l for drp and 0 05 0 09 mg l for tp fig 2 in general t 2 had significantly higher p 001 median values relative to other tributaries for all water quality constituents table 2 t 1 had the lowest total nutrient concentrations while t 3 had the lowest dissolved nutrient concentrations reflecting higher sediment bound nutrient constituents in t 3 relative to t 1 statistical results in table 2 and fig 2 show that median values of ms 1 and ms 2 were not significantly greater than the maximum tributary median or less than the minimum tributary median for any nutrient concentration regarding ms 3 results for both no3 n and tn show that the median was not statistically differentiable from the maximum tributary while drp was significantly greater than both the maximum and minimum tributary medians as shown in table 1 ms 3 only drains an additional 22 km2 approximately 10 of the total drainage area 3 2 empirical mode decompositions results of the emd statistical analysis for monitored watersheds highlight significant trends at multiple timescales table 3 figs 3 and 4 intra annual trends 6 month frequency rarely occurred however they were found for several parameters at ms 2 including flow no3 n and tn results of emd analysis showed that statistically significant seasonal trends were common among all sites and measured parameters the only datasets without seasonal trends were t 3 and ms 1 no3 n t 3 drp and t 2 tp we note that seasonal trends reflect baseflow conditions based on results of the time series analysis of flow depth longer term trends 2 years were less common but were found for flow depths at most sites all sites for drp and tp and approximately half the sites for no3 n and tn nevertheless visual observations of seasonal trends describe much of the cumulative statistically significant variability in the dataset especially for p figs 3 and 4 this result is evidenced by direct comparison of the sum of all significant imfs with the seasonal residual imfs for no3 n and tn intra annual trends become an important descriptor of total variability at some stations namely t 2 t 3 and ms 2 for instance no3 n at ms 2 shows frequencies of approximately six months in the first half of the year throughout the monitored timeframe this was likely attributed to n fertilizer applications which are commonly applied at time of planting and side dressed during the growing season multi year trends rarely appeared and were less commonly significant as compared to seasonality it is likely that multi year trends were associated with compounding factors such as annual precipitation wet year dry year and predominant crop rotations however the imprint of these fluctuations was relatively minor compared to seasonal and intra annual variability as such we do not emphasize multi year or intra annual trends in the subsequent discussion of emd results differences in seasonal maximums minimums for n and p were also observed figs 3 and 4 in general t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 ms 1 and ms 2 showed consistent patterns albeit different magnitudes of max min timing for both n and p given this result we place emphasis on ms 2 since seasonal trends can be compared to water quality data at the co located usgs gauging station peak n concentrations were often found in spring april june and minimum n concentrations were found in mid summer to early fall august october the timing and magnitude of seasonal trends for no3 n and tn were similar and will be further discussed in section 3 3 phosphorus seasonal trends were generally inversely related to n with minimum p concentrations generally found in early to mid spring april june and maximum values typically found in mid summer to early fall august october dissolved reactive p and tp deviated in seasonal trends at some locations for instance we observed a seasonal trend for tp but not drp at site t 3 table 3 fig 4 in which the timing was more reflective of n dynamics with maximums in spring and minimums in late summer longitudinal variability in seasonal trends of the main stem sites showed increasing downstream nutrient concentrations that periodically exceed ranges of seasonal trends observed in monitored tributaries fig 5 regarding no3 n no statistically significant seasonal trend was observed for ms 1 however ms 2 generally fell within the range observed for tributary seasonal trends nevertheless we found minimum concentrations to fall on the high side of the tributary seasonal trend range for drp we found ms 1 to fall on the lower side of the tributary seasonal trend range year round while ms 2 fell on the higher side of the tributary seasonal trend range in summer and low side of the range in winter and spring it is important to note the unique deviation of ms 3 from the results of all other study sites results in fig 5 highlight a long term residual decrease in all nutrient time series preceding january 2013 all parameters showed distinct downward trends that level out or increase thereafter trends for n at ms 3 were not significantly different from results found at t 2 table 2 however the timing of no3 n peaks and valleys prior to 2014 was more reflective of p dynamics with peaks in summer and valleys in winter fig 5 regarding p the timing of drp and tp concentrations in ms 3 were the same as results found for other tributaries and main stem sites with the main difference being the amplitude of the trends especially pre 2014 trend concentration gradients of both drp and tp for ms 3 were an order of magnitude greater than trends found for other sites in the ubwc 0 2 0 mg l instead of 0 0 4 mg l 3 3 comparison with descriptive variables scatterplots and linear regressions were performed to determine how flow and water quality parameters were related to nutrient concentrations simple linear regressions of noise defined herein as the raw data minus the sum of statistically significant imfs showed a positive correlation between flow rate and nutrient concentrations for all parameters table 4 a coefficients of determination varied widely among sites and water quality parameters 0 01 0 33 the positive relationship between noise of flow and nutrient parameters likely reflects surface runoff during storm events that dissolve and entrain fertilizers and p rich surface soils via surface and subsurface macropore pathways which is well recognized to occur in the studied landscape ford et al 2015a williams et al 2016 linear regressions between statistically significant seasonal trends for flow rate and nutrient concentrations highlight contrasting dynamics for n and p species table 4b regarding baseflow seasonal trends in n species both no3 n and tn relationships were positively correlated for all sites except for ms 3 in which a near zero slope was observed conversely p showed an inverse relationship decreased concentrations with increased flow for all sites except for tp from t 3 as previously mentioned t 3 did not have statistically significant seasonal trends for drp but did for tp which was reminiscent of n seasonality total p had less distinct inverse relationships with flow compared to drp for instance at t 2 there was no distinct seasonal trend for tp and there was a negative relationship for drp similarly at ms 2 the slope for tp was nearly equal to zero to further investigate factors impacting the contrasting findings for drp and no3 n dynamics qualitative comparison of statistically significant trends for ms 2 was performed with ph do and temperature measured at a nearby usgs gauging station fig 6 descriptions are qualitative since the usgs data was an incomplete time series that did not include data in the winter and hence emd could not be performed peak drp concentration in the summer closely aligned with maximum values of temperature minimum values of do and minimum values of ph nitrate was inversely related to temperature and tightly linked to do concentration we also provide qualitative comparison of the ms 2 site with a small monitored watershed 4 km2 with extensive tile drainage and a monitored tile main 2 km2 from 2005 to 2012 figs 7 and 8 this data has been previous published elsewhere king et al 2014b results for the small watershed and tile main generally mimicked findings from ms 2 fig 7 for both the tile main and small watershed peak n dynamics occurred in the first half of the year jan june while peak p dynamics occurred in the second half of the year july december of note tile drain n concentrations in the summer and fall months were consistently greater than that of the small watershed while concentrations were equivalent in winter and spring for p no distinct visual differences were observed between tile drains the small watershed and seasonal trends at ms 2 to better understand sources of baseflow fluctuations the relationship between dissolved and total nutrient concentration for the small watershed and tile main was investigated fig 8 regarding p dynamics we found that tp dynamics were governed primarily by drp in tile drains year round as evidenced by a slope close to one 1 2 and a high r2 of 0 67 for the linear regression for the small watershed we found that the high drp concentrations reflecting seasonal peaks in dry summer conditions governed tp dynamics however we found an inverse relationship between drp and tp for low drp conditions e g 0 1 mg p l which coincide with wetter antecedent moisture conditions in winter and spring this finding was evidenced by a higher slope from the linear regression 1 67 and poor r2 value 0 09 highlighting the non linearity of the tp drp relationship at the small watershed scale the increase in tp during high baseflow conditions in winter and spring are reflective of the decreased slope of flow tp relationships for seasonal fluctuations table 4 similar to tile p dynamics we found that both the tile and small watershed site showed tight correlation between no3 n and tn slopes of 1 18 and 1 21 respectively with r2 values of 0 91 and 0 80 respectively highlighting the significance of no3 n for downstream n loading for these reasons we do not place further emphasis on tn in the discussion to avoid redundancy with no3 n discussion 4 discussion 4 1 upland and in stream controls on baseflow nutrient concentrations 4 1 1 phosphorus results of the time series analysis for tributary and main stem sites suggest that upland soil drainage exerts a strong control on the timing of baseflow drp concentrations peak concentrations of drp in summer followed by minimum drp in late winter to early spring in both tributaries and main stem sites were reflective of seasonal trends observed from the tile drain and the small 4 km2 watershed in which concentration was inversely related to baseflow flow depth figs 4 5c d table 4 during the winter and early spring when antecedent moisture is high and water residence times in the soil are low leaching of surface fertilizers and soil p to tile drains is well recognized especially following storm events williams et al 2016 however during the summer it is unlikely that leaching from high soil test p soils or fertilizers at the surface governs baseflow concentrations given the dis connectivity of the tile drains and the seasonal water table tile drains provide a small proportion of flow in the summer and as a result subsurface leaching of p following storm events is subjected to more tortuous percolation through a deeper saturated aquifer before resurfacing to stream channels exner kittridge et al 2016 soil bound inorganic p in agricultural landscapes is also often highly stratified ford et al 2015a thus we would not suspect desorption of inorganic p from soils in deeper aquifers to support high concentration of drp during the summer if this were the case we would have expected to see higher concentrations in winter we therefore hypothesize that high baseflow drp concentrations during warm summer months reflect re mineralization of organic p in the soil column and subsequent delivery to the stream channel through subsurface pathways below the tile drains while leaching of inorganic p from surface soils or lower rates of re mineralization due to decreased microbial activity and subsequently delivery through tile drains controlled concentrations during the winter months results from the current study adds to a growing body of literature that suggests organic matter mineralization is an important pathway in fluvial p cycling and merits enhanced research efforts a recent edge of field modeling study of the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model supports the concept of mineralization of organic matter to control baseflow concentration in central and northwestern ohio tile drained landscapes ford et al 2015a ford et al 2015a highlights the potential of mineralization of organic rich soils to support baseline drp concentrations exceeding eutrophic standards dodds et al 1998 king et al 2014a as a second example joshi et al 2015 recently used a novel phosphate isotope fingerprinting approach to identify re mineralization of inorganic p from organic sediment as a predominant source within the chesapeake bay utilizing fingerprinting methods and numerical models that are sensitive to such processes are key areas for future research to build towards comprehensive watershed p budgets and development of appropriate upland management strategies while time series analyses suggest that upland soil drainage was important for determining the timing of baseflow drp concentration results of longitudinal gradients along the main stem highlight the importance of in stream processes to control peak drp concentrations in the summer longitudinal results showed an increase of drp in summer fall months between ms 1 and ms 2 but relatively stable drp concentrations in winter spring months the increases in summer drp concentration could either reflect additional upland source contributions from the additional 59 km2 drainage area table 1 or it could be a result of an in stream source due to changing water quality conditions we marginalize the likelihood of the potential for an additional upland source through a simple mass balance calculation assuming drainage area proportional flow rates in 2008 given that ms 1 statistically significant seasonal trends were found to be 0 059 mg p l and that its drainage area represented 77 of the drainage area at ms 2 where the seasonally high concentration was 0 10 mg p l for 2008 we calculated that concentrations from the additional drainage area at ms 2 would need to be 0 23 mg p l which is nearly double that of seasonably high drp concentrations observed in the small watershed fig 7 and the statistically significant seasonal trends in the highest drp tributary fig 4 based on these findings our results suggest that upland processes exert strong control on drp concentrations in the winter and spring months while coupled upland and in stream conditions control watershed baseflow drp concentrations during summer and early fall regarding processes our results suggest that in stream increases of drp to the stream channel under low flow summer conditions is likely reflective of favorable water quality conditions for drp release from benthic sediments while organic matter mineralization of benthic sediments is a possible source of increased drp we suspect this is low given the lack of sensitivity of other dissolved nutrient concentrations to sediment organic matter mineralization rates in agricultural streams i e dissolved inorganic carbon ford and fox 2014 ford and fox 2015 and no3 n ford et al 2017a however recent studies have highlighted the ability of microbial activity in benthic biofilms by polyphosphate accumulating organisms to enhance drp release in streams saia et al 2017 under low oxygen warm summer months fig 6 it is plausible that microbial biota release labile inorganic p through this mechanism increased drp concentration may also reflect favorable water quality conditions for drp desorption and dissolution from inorganic p stores within benthic sediments results from the current study show tight linkages between maximum drp concentrations and seasonally elevated temperature and seasonally low ph and dissolved oxygen levels fig 6 several previous studies have highlighted the release of drp to stream and lake water under anaerobic low ph conditions due to desorption from sediment surfaces and dissolution of phosphate precipitates due to favorable redox conditions for iron bound p wang et al 2008 wu et al 2014 further work is needed to tease out the controlling mechanism in laboratory incubations or through novel tracer approaches such as po4 oxygen isotopes further discussion is presented in section 4 2 results of the time series analysis for total nutrient concentrations in tributary and main stem sites showed that tp dynamics deviated from drp at high baseflow due to in stream particulate p erosion and transport time series analysis results for tp highlight the importance of particulate p contributions in winter and spring when baseflow is high and drp contributions are low figs 4 5 and 8 the less pronounced inverse relationship and sometimes shift to positive relationship of tp with flow as compared to drp table 4 reflects tile drainage water that enters the channel with low sediment concentrations this mechanism is further supported by the tight correlation between drp and tp for tile and the poor correlation for drp and tp in the small watershed fig 7 it is well recognized that the stream channel will scour loosely deposited sediments from the streambed to fulfill the sediment transport carrying capacity even in low flow conditions russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 streambed sediments will partially reflect erosion from upland soils which as we have previously mentioned are rich in soil test p in the region king et al 2014a ford et al 2015a b 4 1 2 nitrate similar to drp results statistically significant seasonal trends of no3 n in tributary and main stem sites suggest upland controls governing concentrations in winter and spring regarding source water contributions shallow subsurface water is typically enriched in no3 n relative to groundwater exner kittridge et al 2016 for winter and spring baseflow this theory describes our results given that the most intensely drained tributaries tributaries 1 and 2 had the highest winter spring no3 n concentrations and the least intensively drained tributary tributary 4 had the lowest peak no3 n concentrations for main stem sites ms 2 has slightly greater peak values as compared to ms 1 which could be attributed to the increased drainage density for the additional drainage area between ms 1 and ms 2 see table 1 these results point to the potential for tile drainage to enhance baseline no3 n levels when the vadose zone has higher antecedent moisture results for seasonally low no3 n concentrations during low antecedent moisture reflect a mixture of upland and in stream controls tile drains contribute a small proportion of flow during the dry summer months and hence source water contributions depleted in no3 n were expected and occurred in all tributary and main stem sites reflective of the small watershed results we hypothesized that as the watershed size increased connectivity with the deeper aquifers and in stream biological processing would increase and as a result no3 n concentrations at main stem sites would decrease relative to upstream tributaries the assertion of in stream biotic processing during warm summer months is reasonable given the high stream water temperature and low dissolved oxygen levels measured at ms 2 fig 6 that promote favorable water quality conditions for autochthonous growth and denitrification mulholland et al 2008 griffiths et al 2012 ford et al 2017a our results contradict this hypothesis since main stem sites downstream of the tributary have seasonally low concentrations that are 0 1 mg n l recent studies in agroecosystem streams have shown that denitrification and algal no3 n uptake can be on the same order of magnitude and that the potential downstream fate of the regenerated n from transient storage and algal biomass could become important hotchkiss and hall 2015 webster et al 2016 ford et al 2017a our finding provides evidence that this regenerative fate of algal n may fuel downstream n increases which has significant implications for downstream reservoirs and waterbodies subjected to harmful and nuisance algal blooms explicitly accounting for n fate transport and exchange in these various pools in watershed scale models will be critical for quantifying flux pathways and nutrient management at varying watershed scales 4 1 3 sensitivity of seasonal nutrient concentrations to disturbance near the outlet time series analysis results for ms 3 the last main stem site before the hoover reservoir were unique relative to the other tributary and main stem sites within the ubwc watershed we found disequilibrium conditions from fall 2006 through 2013 for all water quality parameters that subsequently returned to equilibrium we hypothesize that this finding was reflective of small perturbations near the watershed outlet our findings showed significantly higher drp and no3 n concentrations that were not differentiable from high tributary nutrient distributions fig 2 table 2 ms 3 drains an additional 22 km2 10 of the total drainage area over ms 2 but shows no3 n concentrations that are twofold greater and drp concentrations that are 10 fold greater during seasonally high periods figs 3 and 4 upon visual inspection of aerial photographs during this timeframe the only notable change was associated with a small development upstream of ms 3 within the additional drainage area based on photographs from 2005 2009 2011 2014 and 2016 it appears that the development started in 2005 and was completed by 2014 the impact of conversion of agricultural land for urban and suburban land use is well known to increase sediment delivery to stream channels and the authors postulate that high sediment loads especially early in the disturbance were deposited to the stream adjacent to the construction site and were subsequently subjected to microbial mineralization and drp release during low flow warm summer months seasonal timing of peaks and valleys and differences in magnitudes between no3 n and drp concentrations support the hypothesis of sediment deposits to fuel disequilibrium conditions at ms 3 from 2006 and 2013 statistically significant no3 n concentrations during the disturbance shifted to being high in summer and fall and low in winter analogous to watershed drp dynamics and then reversed post disturbance however we note that concentrations of no3 n during winter and spring were comparable to ms 2 this would suggest a pulse of no3 n occurring in warm summer months we would not suspect this to be tied to upland processes given the dis connectivity between tile drains and the stream channel during warm low antecedent moisture summer months and the return to equilibrium processes in later years given the occurrence in summer this is likely attributed to benthic microbial ammonification and nitrification resulting in no3 n regeneration to the stream channel further the 10 fold magnitude increase in drp concentrations during summer months reflects rapid desorption or release of p by polyphosphate accumulating biofilms acting on labile p in streambed sediments polyphosphate accumulating organisms are commonly used as an enhanced biological p removal platform in wastewater facilities however they release p under anaerobic conditions saia et al 2017 proliferation of microbial communities in this stream reach are likely enhanced by the small wastewater facility discharges both upstream and downstream of the urbanizing disturbance fig 1 while at a different spatial scale our results are reminiscent of findings from a large scale sparrow model of the mississippi river basin alexander et al 2008 that highlight the importance of managing nutrient dynamics near large rivers or fast flowing streams to achieve load and concentration reductions at the environmentally relevant scale specifically our result highlights the importance of minimizing nutrient rich sediment pulses to stream channels that then settle out and are subjected to biotic and abiotic processes near receiving waterbodies 4 2 broader implications for tile drained agroecosystems results of the study for baseline p concentrations in tile drained agroecosystems show non rate limiting conditions of algal proliferation suggesting alternative mechanisms may be needed for managing drp baseline flows our findings of watershed baseflow drp concentrations are significant given that watershed scale bioavailable drp concentrations at ms 2 oscillated between an average minimum and maximum seasonal concentration of 0 02 and 0 08 mg p l respectively fig 5 eutrophic conditions in freshwater lakes are established above tp thresholds of 0 071 mg p l dodds et al 1998 however it is well recognized that drp concentrations exceeding 0 03 mg p l create conditions conducive to algal proliferation king et al 2014a while much emphasis has been placed on managing drp through effective field bmps and agronomic practices to reduce runoff from surface applied fertilizers and leaching from high soil test p soils broadly they have resulted in insufficient water quality improvements shapley et al 2013 2015 our results of baseflow drp to favor more chronic legacy phosphorus issues high organic matter turnover in soils and benthic sediment release partially highlight why such bmps have led to insufficient improvements especially in systems with low residence times the implication is that more systematic in stream management strategies may need to be coupled with upland management to mitigate environmentally harmful concentration thresholds we note the challenge that results of this study presents given that mechanisms have contrasting impacts on nutrient regeneration attenuation we caution that practitioners be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of promoting conditions such as anaerobic zones for denitrification while no3 n levels at baseflow are generally below eutrophic levels during summer and fall the elevated baseline no3 n levels in winter and spring originating from tile drains make receiving surface water bodies susceptible to drinking water contamination in the ubwc watershed the hoover reservoir is susceptible to excess no3 n levels exceeding 10 mg l which makes the water toxic for infants due to the transformation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin which has limited oxygen carrying capacity in recent years no3 n levels were well above the epa thresholds in the reservoir which serves as the drinking water source for nearly 8 00 000 residents in and around the city of columbus oh while we did not find statistically significant seasonal pulses to exceed this threshold our results show baseline levels at ms 2 upwards of 3 mg n l therefore the reservoir may become more sensitive i e have less buffering capacity to pulses of n in stormflow that result in exceedance of the 10 mg n l threshold a potential mitigation strategy to reducing no3 n levels during environmentally sensitive periods is inclusion of drainage water management systems in intensively drained areas drainage water management has been found to significantly reduce no3 n loading in a nearby watershed by reducing tile discharge i e holding the water in the field williams et al 2015b while williams et al 2015b found that no3 n concentrations in drainage water were not statistically different pre and post drainage water management the reduction in water flux allows deeper percolation and mixing with subsurface water therefore a smaller proportion of baseflow is associated with tile drainage findings from our study suggest that lower intensity tile drained watersheds have lower seasonally high concentrations in winter and spring therefore widespread implementation could provide significant reductions in reservoir no3 n concentrations during this timeframe 5 conclusions collectively our study highlights the importance of both in stream and upland controls on nutrient baseflow concentrations in tile drained agricultural landscapes further work is needed at the watershed scale to model and quantify the extent of these identified controls specifically our results support the potential importance of upland management strategies e g drainage water management and within channel mitigation to alter nutrient concentration dynamics at baseflow conditions given the contrasting dynamics of n and p caution should be taken when promoting specific practices as it may promote unintended consequences e g drp release in anoxic zones that promote denitrification sustainable solutions will be especially important to combat increasing prominence of

empirical mode decomposition of seven decade long nutrient concentration time series in the agricultural upper big walnut creek watershed ohio usa four tributaries of varying drainage areas and three

temperature findings point to statistically significant seasonality of all parameters with peak p concentrations in summer and peak n in late winter early spring results suggest that upland processes

conversely upland flow sources driving streamflow exert strong control on baseflow no3 n and in stream attenuation through transient and permanent pathways impacts the magnitude of removal regarding tn and tp we found that tn was governed by no3 n while tp was governed by drp in summer and fluvial erosion of p rich benthic sediments during higher baseflow conditions findings of the study

nutrient concentrations which constitute less than 10 of annual nutrient loads may play a significant role in hab formation in small lakes and riverine environments given the low water retention times in these systems shore et al 2017 in order to identify the most effective management strategies at a watershed scale a need exists to better understand the underlying upland and in stream mechanisms controlling nutrient concentrations in tile drained landscapes intra annual variability in baseflow stream nitrate no3 n concentration has been reported due to seasonal differences in the rates of in stream and riparian biochemical reactions and time varying contributions of drainage sources pionke et al 1999 peterson et al 2001 mulholland et al 2008 griffiths et al 2012 exner kittridge et al 2016 ford et al 2017a as recently highlighted in exner kittridge et al 2016 stream baseflow no3 n concentrations have been observed to increase in the winter and decrease in the summer within temperate tile drained landscapes denitrification and algal uptake are pronounced in the summer and can deplete no3 n resulting in either permanent or transient removal of n yet algal assimilation is often neglected in watershed mass balance calculations mulholland et al 2008 ford et al 2017a the source of no3 n and flow pathway for delivery may also influence concentrations in these watersheds nitrate may originate from subsurface seepage in the variably saturated vadose zone and or deeper saturated aquifers exner kittridge et al 2016 high stream no3 n concentrations in winter may reflect the prominence of n laden shallow vadose zone water from tile drains during wet antecedent conditions conversely low stream no3 n concentrations in summer may reflect minimal contributions of systematic drainage williams et al 2015a and higher saturated zone flow from deeper aquifers that are depleted in n due to extended residence time for denitrification while both in stream and upland processes likely exert some control on stream no3 n concentration the extent to which processes control no3 n at increasing watershed scales is not well understood while dissolved reactive phosphorus drp trends from long term records have shown mixed results in terms of seasonal max min dynamics studies specifically targeting baseflow have shown peak drp concentrations during summer however the mechanisms controlling these dynamics are not well understood mulholland and hill 1997 pionke et al 1999 stow et al 2015 shore et al 2017 elevated drp concentration in summer could reflect several potential in stream and upland pathways regarding upland soil drainage greater drp could reflect enhanced weathering and dissolution of phosphorus p bearing substrata evapotranspiration in the vadose zone or enhanced mineralization of organic matter jarvie et al 2014 hartmann et al 2014 ford et al 2015a in many agricultural watersheds soil bound p tends to be highly stratified with elevated levels in surface soils hence we would not suspect high connectivity to subsurface drainage for baseflow concentrations king et al 2014a b baker et al 2017 however macropore flow through desiccation cracks could resupply shallow aquifers below tile drains with enriched p concentrations during dry summer months which is subsequently leached to the stream williams et al 2016 ford et al 2017b in streams elevated drp concentrations could be associated with enhanced release of drp by polyphosphate accumulating organisms in benthic biofilms dissolution of phosphate precipitates analogous to soil drainage or desorption of legacy sediment p immobilized in transient storage zones wang et al 2008 jarvie et al 2014 wu et al 2014 saia et al 2017 the objective of the present study was to utilize ambient long term records of nutrient concentrations namely no3 n drp total n tn and total p tp to identify upland and in stream controls on nutrient concentrations at baseflow conditions we focus on tile drained midwestern watersheds given the rampant acute and chronic nutrient flux problems that are well documented in these landscapes specifically we aim to identify and discuss the following questions 1 do seasonal baseflow nutrient dynamics agree with common perceptions 2 to what extent are watershed fluxes reflective of in stream and upland controls and 3 what are the environmental and management implications for tile drained agroecosystems to answer these questions we use a 10 year dataset and time series analysis of longitudinal watershed data in the upper big walnut creek ubwc usda benchmark watershed located in central ohio usa and compare the data to critical upland drainage nutrient concentrations and in stream water quality indicators 2 methods 2 1 study sites the huc

one of the 24 watersheds selected for the conservation effects assessment project ceap arnold et al 2014 fig 1 the watershed drains through the hoover reservoir which is a major drinking water source for the columbus ohio metropolitan area richardson et al 2008 fig 1 the ubwc has a drainage area of 492 km2 and is predominantly 60 composed of cropland for production agriculture with major crops including corn soybeans and wheat king et al 2008 extensive tile drainage networks in the watershed stem from fine clayey soil texture which primarily consist of bennington pewamo cardington soil associations 60 table 1 king et al 2008 we refer the reader to king et al 2008 for further site characterization eight huc 12 watersheds are nested within the ubwc basin of which four t 1 t 2 t 3 and t 4 were monitored from 2006 through 2016 three additional sites located on the main stem ms 1 ms 2 and ms 3 of the watershed were also monitored and each main stem monitoring site incorporates an additional huc 12 watershed a u s geological survey real time gauging station co located at ms 2 usgs 03228300 has historical water quality data spanning much of the nutrient data collection timeframe

of the huc 12 watersheds are summarized in table 1 information in table 1 for the main stem sites reflect the additional drainage area added at the monitoring location two small municipal wastewater

analysis weekly grab samples were collected from the middle of the stream at each of the seven study locations using standard u s epa protocol for collection and preservation of water samples for n and p analysis u s epa 1983 water level at each of the monitoring locations was also measured at the time of sample collection water samples were immediately brought back to the lab and refrigerated 4 c until they were filtered through 0 45 µm glass microfibre filters drp and no3 n concentrations in filtered samples were determined colorimetrically by flow injection analysis using a quik chem 8000 fia automated ion analyzer lachat instruments total n and tp analyses were performed on unfiltered samples following alkaline persulfate oxidation koroleff 1983 all water samples were analyzed within 28 days following collection 2 3 statistical analysis empirical mode decomposition was selected as the preferred method for the analysis since the method is purely empirical e g does not use sine cosine functions makes no limiting assumptions about the dataset can be applied to a wide class of signals and can be used as an a posteriori approach which is ideal for an exploratory analysis huang et al 1998 wu et al 2007 ford et al 2015b the method has been broadly applied to a wide range of environmental signals most relevant to this study include applications to sediment carbon and n elemental and isotopic signatures ford et al 2015b and climate data wu et al 2007 for the analyses in the current study datasets were assumed to be non linear non stationary and to have non parametric distributions therefore all datasets were first log transformed due to their non normal skewed distributions so that the noise of the stochastic event event variability did not mask significant trends venier et al 2012 exploratory time series analysis was performed on the decade long nutrient datasets at all monitoring locations within the ubwc watershed empirical mode decomposition emd was used to decompose the nutrient time series into intrinsic mode functions imfs huang et al 1998 wu et al 2007 intrinsic mode functions are a finite series of amplitude and frequency modulated oscillatory functions in which lowest frequency imf is identified as the base trend and the highest frequency trend is considered noise for well sampled datasets wu et al 2007 empirical mode decomposition was conducted utilizing a six step iterative procedure as summarized in ford et al 2015b in which 1 local maxima and minima are identified in the time series 2 cubic spline interpolation signals are computed to create upper and lower envelopes 3 upper and lower envelopes are averaged 4 the average envelope is subtracted from the signal related to the current iteration 5 the process is repeated until the averaged envelope converges to a stated threshold 6 the resulting imf is subtracted from the original dataset to create a new time series and steps 1 5 are repeated until all extremes are removed we compiled a previously published code in matlab that performs emd and generates imfs for each site rato et al 2008 we performed statistical significance tests to test the hypothesis that imfs of the dataset were statistically different from white noise imfs wu and huang 2004 wu et al 2007 ford et al 2015b a log log plot of variance versus mean period was plotted for each imf and tested against a confidence interval for white noise wu and huang 2004 the highest frequency trend was used as the basis for noise and a negative linear relationship of log var versus log period with a slope of 1 was plotted with upper and lower bounds for the confidence interval being represented with log10 var log10 3 the protocol allotted three standard deviations for confidence bounds for noise intrinsic mode functions with frequencies that plot outside the specified variance range are statistically differentiable from white noise and thus are expected to have some physical meaning aggregation of statistically significant trends for imfs for the emd results was conducted by combining imfs at environmentally relevant timescales for the present study we focus on the seasonal timescale given the implications for seasonal eutrophication and habs statistically significant frequencies between 0 7 and 1 3 years were included as a seasonal fluctuation because trends may not have pronounced peaks in some years resulting in a frequency 1 year or may experience a secondary oscillation in some years resulting in a frequency 1 year if such a phenomenon is commonly occurring leading to frequencies outside of the specified bounds we suggest that the result is likely due to a non seasonal fluctuation for the results we define any statistically significant imf as a trend throughout the remainder of the manuscript non parametric statistical tests linear regression and explanatory visual statistical plots were utilized to compare nutrient datasets between sites box and whisker plots were used to visualize distributions and were generated in sigmaplot 13 given the skew of the data the y axis was plotted on a log scale independence of individually collected samples was assumed and statistical tests were performed in the statistical package sigmastat 13 specifically the mann whitney rank sum test was utilized to determine statistically significant differences in median values for the datasets the rank sum test is nonparametric thus does not require assuming data normality or equal variance a significance level of α 0 05 was selected for testing the null hypothesis that the two samples were not drawn from the same populations specifically we were interested in testing how the main stem sites compared to tributary ranges 3 results 3 1 exploratory statistics median concentrations in the tributaries ranged from 0 6 1 5 mg l for no3 n 1 0 2 2 mg l for tn 0 01 0 06 mg l for drp and 0 05 0 09 mg l for tp fig 2 in general t 2 had significantly higher p 001 median values relative to other tributaries for all water quality constituents table 2 t 1 had the lowest total nutrient concentrations while t 3 had the lowest dissolved nutrient concentrations reflecting higher sediment bound nutrient constituents in t 3 relative to t 1 statistical results in table 2 and fig 2 show that median values of ms 1 and ms 2 were not significantly greater than the maximum tributary median or less than the minimum tributary median for any nutrient concentration regarding ms 3 results for both no3 n and tn show that the median was not statistically differentiable from the maximum tributary while drp was significantly greater than both the maximum and minimum tributary medians as shown in table 1 ms 3 only drains an additional 22 km2 approximately 10 of the total drainage area 3 2 empirical mode decompositions results of the emd statistical analysis for monitored watersheds highlight significant trends at multiple timescales table 3 figs 3 and 4 intra annual trends 6 month frequency rarely occurred however they were found for several parameters at ms 2 including flow no3 n and tn results of emd analysis showed that statistically significant seasonal trends were common among all sites and measured parameters the only datasets without seasonal trends were t 3 and ms 1 no3 n t 3 drp and t 2 tp we note that seasonal trends reflect baseflow conditions based on results of the time series analysis of flow depth longer term trends 2 years were less common but were found for flow depths at most sites all sites for drp and tp and approximately half the sites for no3 n and tn nevertheless visual observations of seasonal trends describe much of the cumulative statistically significant variability in the dataset especially for p figs 3 and 4 this result is evidenced by direct comparison of the sum of all significant imfs with the seasonal residual imfs for no3 n and tn intra annual trends become an important descriptor of total variability at some stations namely t 2 t 3 and ms 2 for instance no3 n at ms 2 shows frequencies of approximately six months in the first half of the year throughout the monitored timeframe this was likely attributed to n fertilizer applications which are commonly applied at time of planting and side dressed during the growing season multi year trends rarely appeared and were less commonly significant as compared to seasonality it is likely that multi year trends were associated with compounding factors such as annual precipitation wet year dry year and predominant crop rotations however the imprint of these fluctuations was relatively minor compared to seasonal and intra annual variability as such we do not emphasize multi year or intra annual trends in the subsequent discussion of emd results differences in seasonal maximums minimums for n and p were also observed figs 3 and 4 in general t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 ms 1 and ms 2 showed consistent patterns albeit different magnitudes of max min timing for both n and p given this result we place emphasis on ms 2 since seasonal trends can be compared to water quality data at the co located usgs gauging station peak n concentrations were often found in spring april june and minimum n concentrations were found in mid summer to early fall august october the timing and magnitude of seasonal trends for no3 n and tn were similar and will be further discussed in section 3 3 phosphorus seasonal trends were generally inversely related to n with minimum p concentrations generally found in early to mid spring april june and maximum values typically found in mid summer to early fall august october dissolved reactive p and tp deviated in seasonal trends at some locations for instance we observed a seasonal trend for tp but not drp at site t 3 table 3 fig 4 in which the timing was more reflective of n dynamics with maximums in spring and minimums in late summer longitudinal variability in seasonal trends of the main stem sites showed increasing downstream nutrient concentrations that periodically exceed ranges of seasonal trends observed in monitored tributaries fig 5 regarding no3 n no statistically significant seasonal trend was observed for ms 1 however ms 2 generally fell within the range observed for tributary seasonal trends nevertheless we found minimum concentrations to fall on the high side of the tributary seasonal trend range for drp we found ms 1 to fall on the lower side of the tributary seasonal trend range year round while ms 2 fell on the higher side of the tributary seasonal trend range in summer and low side of the range in winter and spring it is important to note the unique deviation of ms 3 from the results of all other study sites results in fig 5 highlight a long term residual decrease in all nutrient time series preceding january 2013 all parameters showed distinct downward trends that level out or increase thereafter trends for n at ms 3 were not significantly different from results found at t 2 table 2 however the timing of no3 n peaks and valleys prior to 2014 was more reflective of p dynamics with peaks in summer and valleys in winter fig 5 regarding p the timing of drp and tp concentrations in ms 3 were the same as results found for other tributaries and main stem sites with the main difference being the amplitude of the trends especially pre 2014 trend concentration gradients of both drp and tp for ms 3 were an order of magnitude greater than trends found for other sites in the ubwc 0 2 0 mg l instead of 0 0 4 mg l 3 3 comparison with descriptive variables scatterplots and linear regressions were performed to determine how flow and water quality parameters were related to nutrient concentrations simple linear regressions of noise defined herein as the raw data minus the sum of statistically significant imfs showed a positive correlation between flow rate and nutrient concentrations for all parameters table 4 a coefficients of determination varied widely among sites and water quality parameters 0 01 0 33 the positive relationship between noise of flow and nutrient parameters likely reflects surface runoff during storm events that dissolve and entrain fertilizers and p rich surface soils via surface and subsurface macropore pathways which is well recognized to occur in the studied landscape ford et al 2015a williams et al 2016 linear regressions between statistically significant seasonal trends for flow rate and nutrient concentrations highlight contrasting dynamics for n and p species table 4b regarding baseflow seasonal trends in n species both no3 n and tn relationships were positively correlated for all sites except for ms 3 in which a near zero slope was observed conversely p showed an inverse relationship decreased concentrations with increased flow for all sites except for tp from t 3 as previously mentioned t 3 did not have statistically significant seasonal trends for drp but did for tp which was reminiscent of n seasonality total p had less distinct inverse relationships with flow compared to drp for instance at t 2 there was no distinct seasonal trend for tp and there was a negative relationship for drp similarly at ms 2 the slope for tp was nearly equal to zero to further investigate factors impacting the contrasting findings for drp and no3 n dynamics qualitative comparison of statistically significant trends for ms 2 was performed with ph do and temperature measured at a nearby usgs gauging station fig 6 descriptions are qualitative since the usgs data was an incomplete time series that did not include data in the winter and hence emd could not be performed peak drp concentration in the summer closely aligned with maximum values of temperature minimum values of do and minimum values of ph nitrate was inversely related to temperature and tightly linked to do concentration we also provide qualitative comparison of the ms 2 site with a small monitored watershed 4 km2 with extensive tile drainage and a monitored tile main 2 km2 from 2005 to 2012 figs 7 and 8 this data has been previous published elsewhere king et al 2014b results for the small watershed and tile main generally mimicked findings from ms 2 fig 7 for both the tile main and small watershed peak n dynamics occurred in the first half of the year jan june while peak p dynamics occurred in the second half of the year july december of note tile drain n concentrations in the summer and fall months were consistently greater than that of the small watershed while concentrations were equivalent in winter and spring for p no distinct visual differences were observed between tile drains the small watershed and seasonal trends at ms 2 to better understand sources of baseflow fluctuations the relationship between dissolved and total nutrient concentration for the small watershed and tile main was investigated fig 8 regarding p dynamics we found that tp dynamics were governed primarily by drp in tile drains year round as evidenced by a slope close to one 1 2 and a high r2 of 0 67 for the linear regression for the small watershed we found that the high drp concentrations reflecting seasonal peaks in dry summer conditions governed tp dynamics however we found an inverse relationship between drp and tp for low drp conditions e g 0 1 mg p l which coincide with wetter antecedent moisture conditions in winter and spring this finding was evidenced by a higher slope from the linear regression 1 67 and poor r2 value 0 09 highlighting the non linearity of the tp drp relationship at the small watershed scale the increase in tp during high baseflow conditions in winter and spring are reflective of the decreased slope of flow tp relationships for seasonal fluctuations table 4 similar to tile p dynamics we found that both the tile and small watershed site showed tight correlation between no3 n and tn slopes of 1 18 and 1 21 respectively with r2 values of 0 91 and 0 80 respectively highlighting the significance of no3 n for downstream n loading for these reasons we do not place further emphasis on tn in the discussion to avoid redundancy with no3 n discussion 4 discussion 4 1 upland and in stream controls on baseflow nutrient concentrations 4 1 1 phosphorus results of the time series analysis for tributary and main stem sites suggest that upland soil drainage exerts a strong control on the timing of baseflow drp concentrations peak concentrations of drp in summer followed by minimum drp in late winter to early spring in both tributaries and main stem sites were reflective of seasonal trends observed from the tile drain and the small 4 km2 watershed in which concentration was inversely related to baseflow flow depth figs 4 5c d table 4 during the winter and early spring when antecedent moisture is high and water residence times in the soil are low leaching of surface fertilizers and soil p to tile drains is well recognized especially following storm events williams et al 2016 however during the summer it is unlikely that leaching from high soil test p soils or fertilizers at the surface governs baseflow concentrations given the dis connectivity of the tile drains and the seasonal water table tile drains provide a small proportion of flow in the summer and as a result subsurface leaching of p following storm events is subjected to more tortuous percolation through a deeper saturated aquifer before resurfacing to stream channels exner kittridge et al 2016 soil bound inorganic p in agricultural landscapes is also often highly stratified ford et al 2015a thus we would not suspect desorption of inorganic p from soils in deeper aquifers to support high concentration of drp during the summer if this were the case we would have expected to see higher concentrations in winter we therefore hypothesize that high baseflow drp concentrations during warm summer months reflect re mineralization of organic p in the soil column and subsequent delivery to the stream channel through subsurface pathways below the tile drains while leaching of inorganic p from surface soils or lower rates of re mineralization due to decreased microbial activity and subsequently delivery through tile drains controlled concentrations during the winter months results from the current study adds to a growing body of literature that suggests organic matter mineralization is an important pathway in fluvial p cycling and merits enhanced research efforts a recent edge of field modeling study of the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model supports the concept of mineralization of organic matter to control baseflow concentration in central and northwestern ohio tile drained landscapes ford et al 2015a ford et al 2015a highlights the potential of mineralization of organic rich soils to support baseline drp concentrations exceeding eutrophic standards dodds et al 1998 king et al 2014a as a second example joshi et al 2015 recently used a novel phosphate isotope fingerprinting approach to identify re mineralization of inorganic p from organic sediment as a predominant source within the chesapeake bay utilizing fingerprinting methods and numerical models that are sensitive to such processes are key areas for future research to build towards comprehensive watershed p budgets and development of appropriate upland management strategies while time series analyses suggest that upland soil drainage was important for determining the timing of baseflow drp concentration results of longitudinal gradients along the main stem highlight the importance of in stream processes to control peak drp concentrations in the summer longitudinal results showed an increase of drp in summer fall months between ms 1 and ms 2 but relatively stable drp concentrations in winter spring months the increases in summer drp concentration could either reflect additional upland source contributions from the additional 59 km2 drainage area table 1 or it could be a result of an in stream source due to changing water quality conditions we marginalize the likelihood of the potential for an additional upland source through a simple mass balance calculation assuming drainage area proportional flow rates in 2008 given that ms 1 statistically significant seasonal trends were found to be 0 059 mg p l and that its drainage area represented 77 of the drainage area at ms 2 where the seasonally high concentration was 0 10 mg p l for 2008 we calculated that concentrations from the additional drainage area at ms 2 would need to be 0 23 mg p l which is nearly double that of seasonably high drp concentrations observed in the small watershed fig 7 and the statistically significant seasonal trends in the highest drp tributary fig 4 based on these findings our results suggest that upland processes exert strong control on drp concentrations in the winter and spring months while coupled upland and in stream conditions control watershed baseflow drp concentrations during summer and early fall regarding processes our results suggest that in stream increases of drp to the stream channel under low flow summer conditions is likely reflective of favorable water quality conditions for drp release from benthic sediments while organic matter mineralization of benthic sediments is a possible source of increased drp we suspect this is low given the lack of sensitivity of other dissolved nutrient concentrations to sediment organic matter mineralization rates in agricultural streams i e dissolved inorganic carbon ford and fox 2014 ford and fox 2015 and no3 n ford et al 2017a however recent studies have highlighted the ability of microbial activity in benthic biofilms by polyphosphate accumulating organisms to enhance drp release in streams saia et al 2017 under low oxygen warm summer months fig 6 it is plausible that microbial biota release labile inorganic p through this mechanism increased drp concentration may also reflect favorable water quality conditions for drp desorption and dissolution from inorganic p stores within benthic sediments results from the current study show tight linkages between maximum drp concentrations and seasonally elevated temperature and seasonally low ph and dissolved oxygen levels fig 6 several previous studies have highlighted the release of drp to stream and lake water under anaerobic low ph conditions due to desorption from sediment surfaces and dissolution of phosphate precipitates due to favorable redox conditions for iron bound p wang et al 2008 wu et al 2014 further work is needed to tease out the controlling mechanism in laboratory incubations or through novel tracer approaches such as po4 oxygen isotopes further discussion is presented in section 4 2 results of the time series analysis for total nutrient concentrations in tributary and main stem sites showed that tp dynamics deviated from drp at high baseflow due to in stream particulate p erosion and transport time series analysis results for tp highlight the importance of particulate p contributions in winter and spring when baseflow is high and drp contributions are low figs 4 5 and 8 the less pronounced inverse relationship and sometimes shift to positive relationship of tp with flow as compared to drp table 4 reflects tile drainage water that enters the channel with low sediment concentrations this mechanism is further supported by the tight correlation between drp and tp for tile and the poor correlation for drp and tp in the small watershed fig 7 it is well recognized that the stream channel will scour loosely deposited sediments from the streambed to fulfill the sediment transport carrying capacity even in low flow conditions russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 streambed sediments will partially reflect erosion from upland soils which as we have previously mentioned are rich in soil test p in the region king et al 2014a ford et al 2015a b 4 1 2 nitrate similar to drp results statistically significant seasonal trends of no3 n in tributary and main stem sites suggest upland controls governing concentrations in winter and spring regarding source water contributions shallow subsurface water is typically enriched in no3 n relative to groundwater exner kittridge et al 2016 for winter and spring baseflow this theory describes our results given that the most intensely drained tributaries tributaries 1 and 2 had the highest winter spring no3 n concentrations and the least intensively drained tributary tributary 4 had the lowest peak no3 n concentrations for main stem sites ms 2 has slightly greater peak values as compared to ms 1 which could be attributed to the increased drainage density for the additional drainage area between ms 1 and ms 2 see table 1 these results point to the potential for tile drainage to enhance baseline no3 n levels when the vadose zone has higher antecedent moisture results for seasonally low no3 n concentrations during low antecedent moisture reflect a mixture of upland and in stream controls tile drains contribute a small proportion of flow during the dry summer months and hence source water contributions depleted in no3 n were expected and occurred in all tributary and main stem sites reflective of the small watershed results we hypothesized that as the watershed size increased connectivity with the deeper aquifers and in stream biological processing would increase and as a result no3 n concentrations at main stem sites would decrease relative to upstream tributaries the assertion of in stream biotic processing during warm summer months is reasonable given the high stream water temperature and low dissolved oxygen levels measured at ms 2 fig 6 that promote favorable water quality conditions for autochthonous growth and denitrification mulholland et al 2008 griffiths et al 2012 ford et al 2017a our results contradict this hypothesis since main stem sites downstream of the tributary have seasonally low concentrations that are 0 1 mg n l recent studies in agroecosystem streams have shown that denitrification and algal no3 n uptake can be on the same order of magnitude and that the potential downstream fate of the regenerated n from transient storage and algal biomass could become important hotchkiss and hall 2015 webster et al 2016 ford et al 2017a our finding provides evidence that this regenerative fate of algal n may fuel downstream n increases which has significant implications for downstream reservoirs and waterbodies subjected to harmful and nuisance algal blooms explicitly accounting for n fate transport and exchange in these various pools in watershed scale models will be critical for quantifying flux pathways and nutrient management at varying watershed scales 4 1 3 sensitivity of seasonal nutrient concentrations to disturbance near the outlet time series analysis results for ms 3 the last main stem site before the hoover reservoir were unique relative to the other tributary and main stem sites within the ubwc watershed we found disequilibrium conditions from fall 2006 through 2013 for all water quality parameters that subsequently returned to equilibrium we hypothesize that this finding was reflective of small perturbations near the watershed outlet our findings showed significantly higher drp and no3 n concentrations that were not differentiable from high tributary nutrient distributions fig 2 table 2 ms 3 drains an additional 22 km2 10 of the total drainage area over ms 2 but shows no3 n concentrations that are twofold greater and drp concentrations that are 10 fold greater during seasonally high periods figs 3 and 4 upon visual inspection of aerial photographs during this timeframe the only notable change was associated with a small development upstream of ms 3 within the additional drainage area based on photographs from 2005 2009 2011 2014 and 2016 it appears that the development started in 2005 and was completed by 2014 the impact of conversion of agricultural land for urban and suburban land use is well known to increase sediment delivery to stream channels and the authors postulate that high sediment loads especially early in the disturbance were deposited to the stream adjacent to the construction site and were subsequently subjected to microbial mineralization and drp release during low flow warm summer months seasonal timing of peaks and valleys and differences in magnitudes between no3 n and drp concentrations support the hypothesis of sediment deposits to fuel disequilibrium conditions at ms 3 from 2006 and 2013 statistically significant no3 n concentrations during the disturbance shifted to being high in summer and fall and low in winter analogous to watershed drp dynamics and then reversed post disturbance however we note that concentrations of no3 n during winter and spring were comparable to ms 2 this would suggest a pulse of no3 n occurring in warm summer months we would not suspect this to be tied to upland processes given the dis connectivity between tile drains and the stream channel during warm low antecedent moisture summer months and the return to equilibrium processes in later years given the occurrence in summer this is likely attributed to benthic microbial ammonification and nitrification resulting in no3 n regeneration to the stream channel further the 10 fold magnitude increase in drp concentrations during summer months reflects rapid desorption or release of p by polyphosphate accumulating biofilms acting on labile p in streambed sediments polyphosphate accumulating organisms are commonly used as an enhanced biological p removal platform in wastewater facilities however they release p under anaerobic conditions saia et al 2017 proliferation of microbial communities in this stream reach are likely enhanced by the small wastewater facility discharges both upstream and downstream of the urbanizing disturbance fig 1 while at a different spatial scale our results are reminiscent of findings from a large scale sparrow model of the mississippi river basin alexander et al 2008 that highlight the importance of managing nutrient dynamics near large rivers or fast flowing streams to achieve load and concentration reductions at the environmentally relevant scale specifically our result highlights the importance of minimizing nutrient rich sediment pulses to stream channels that then settle out and are subjected to biotic and abiotic processes near receiving waterbodies 4 2 broader implications for tile drained agroecosystems results of the study for baseline p concentrations in tile drained agroecosystems show non rate limiting conditions of algal proliferation suggesting alternative mechanisms may be needed for managing drp baseline flows our findings of watershed baseflow drp concentrations are significant given that watershed scale bioavailable drp concentrations at ms 2 oscillated between an average minimum and maximum seasonal concentration of 0 02 and 0 08 mg p l respectively fig 5 eutrophic conditions in freshwater lakes are established above tp thresholds of 0 071 mg p l dodds et al 1998 however it is well recognized that drp concentrations exceeding 0 03 mg p l create conditions conducive to algal proliferation king et al 2014a while much emphasis has been placed on managing drp through effective field bmps and agronomic practices to reduce runoff from surface applied fertilizers and leaching from high soil test p soils broadly they have resulted in insufficient water quality improvements shapley et al 2013 2015 our results of baseflow drp to favor more chronic legacy phosphorus issues high organic matter turnover in soils and benthic sediment release partially highlight why such bmps have led to insufficient improvements especially in systems with low residence times the implication is that more systematic in stream management strategies may need to be coupled with upland management to mitigate environmentally harmful concentration thresholds we note the challenge that results of this study presents given that mechanisms have contrasting impacts on nutrient regeneration attenuation we caution that practitioners be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of promoting conditions such as anaerobic zones for denitrification while no3 n levels at baseflow are generally below eutrophic levels during summer and fall the elevated baseline no3 n levels in winter and spring originating from tile drains make receiving surface water bodies susceptible to drinking water contamination in the ubwc watershed the hoover reservoir is susceptible to excess no3 n levels exceeding 10 mg l which makes the water toxic for infants due to the transformation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin which has limited oxygen carrying capacity in recent years no3 n levels were well above the epa thresholds in the reservoir which serves as the drinking water source for nearly 8 00 000 residents in and around the city of columbus oh while we did not find statistically significant seasonal pulses to exceed this threshold our results show baseline levels at ms 2 upwards of 3 mg n l therefore the reservoir may become more sensitive i e have less buffering capacity to pulses of n in stormflow that result in exceedance of the 10 mg n l threshold a potential mitigation strategy to reducing no3 n levels during environmentally sensitive periods is inclusion of drainage water management systems in intensively drained areas drainage water management has been found to significantly reduce no3 n loading in a nearby watershed by reducing tile discharge i e holding the water in the field williams et al 2015b while williams et al 2015b found that no3 n concentrations in drainage water were not statistically different pre and post drainage water management the reduction in water flux allows deeper percolation and mixing with subsurface water therefore a smaller proportion of baseflow is associated with tile drainage findings from our study suggest that lower intensity tile drained watersheds have lower seasonally high concentrations in winter and spring therefore widespread implementation could provide significant reductions in reservoir no3 n concentrations during this timeframe 5 conclusions collectively our study highlights the importance of both in stream and upland controls on nutrient baseflow concentrations in tile drained agricultural landscapes further work is needed at the watershed scale to model and quantify the extent of these identified controls specifically our results support the potential importance of upland management strategies e g drainage water management and within channel mitigation to alter nutrient concentration dynamics at baseflow conditions given the contrasting dynamics of n and p caution should be taken when promoting specific practices as it may promote unintended consequences e g drp release in anoxic zones that promote denitrification sustainable solutions will be especially important to combat increasing prominence of

7589,classical understanding on basin scale groundwater flow patterns is based on tóth s findings of a single flow system in a unit basin tóth 1962 and nested flow systems in a complex basin tóth 1963 both of which were based on steady state models vandenberg 1980 extended tóth 1962 by deriving a transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a unit basin and examined the flow field distortion under different dimensionless response time τ following vandenberg s 1980 approach we extended tóth 1963 by deriving the transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a complex basin and examined the transient behavior of nested flow systems due to the effect of specific storage the flow field is asymmetric with respect to the midline and the trajectory of internal stagnation points constitutes a non enclosed loop whose width decreases when τ decreases the distribution of the relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation δ h is dependent on the horizontal distance away from a divide and the depth below the land surface in the shallow part δ h decreases from 1 at the divide to 0 at its neighboring valley under all τ while in the deep part δ h reaches a threshold whose value decreases when τ increases the zones with flowing wells are also found to change periodically as water table falls there is a general trend of shrinkage in the area of zones with flowing wells which has a lag to the declining water table under a large τ although fluxes have not been assigned in our model the recharge discharge flux across the top boundary can be obtained this study is critical to understand a series of periodically changing hydrogeological phenomena in large scale basins keywords periodically changing groundwater flow system stagnation point hydraulic head fluctuation zone with flowing wells 1 introduction quantitative studies on basin scale groundwater circulation could be traced back to the 1960s when the undulating water table consists of one scale the pattern of groundwater circulation is in the form of a single flow system tóth 1962 when the undulating water table of consists of multiple scales the pattern of groundwater circulation is found to be in the form of hierarchically nested flow systems tóth 1963 engelen and jones 1986 the former has been defined to be a unit basin tόth 2009 while the latter a tóthian basin robinson and love 2013 in both kinds of basins each flow system is a circulation cell with distinct characteristics of groundwater hydraulics and chemical evolution the concept of groundwater flow systems has been not only utilized in the hydrogeology community engelen and kloosterman 1996 liang et al 2010 sophocleous 2002 winter 1999 but also applied in many earth science disciplines such as petroleum and hydrocarbon exploration garven 1995 tóth 1988 verweij 1993 ecohydrology batelaan et al 2003 and radioactive waste disposal voss and provost 2001 due to such factors as climate vegetation and tide diurnal seasonal inter annual and multi decadal variabilities are quite common in such observations as water table depth groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge gribovszki et al 2010 maxwell and kollet 2008 sacks et al 1992 van roosmalen et al 2007 therefore the cyclical dynamics of groundwater has been studied extensively nielsen 1990 townley 1995 trefry 1999 unfortunately in tóth s classic model and most subsequent modified models it is generally assumed that the flow field is controlled by the multi year mean water table which implies that the fluctuation of water table is ignored in the few studies examining the evolution of groundwater flow systems during the geological time scale steady state flow was assumed within each geological period tóth 1978 zhang et al 2013 vandenberg 1980 modified tóth s 1962 unit basin model to examine the response of groundwater flow to a periodically oscillating water table and found that the a high ratio of response time to period could result in severely distorted flow fields which are significantly different from those obtained by steady state models in a recent study gomez and wilson 2013 used a tóthian basin model to study the age distributions in nested flow systems under a periodically changing water table by ignoring the effect of specific storage on the flow field based on a tóthian basin model niu et al 2015 studied the transient process of nested flow system evolution between two steady state conditions to the authors knowledge the transient effect of a periodically changing water table on the development of nested flow systems accounting for the effect of specific storage has never been examined in this paper following vandenberg s 1980 study on transient groundwater flow in a unit basin we develop a conceptual model of groundwater flow in a tóthian basin with a periodically fluctuating water table the major difference between our model and gomez and wilson s 2013 model is that specific storage has been taken into account in the current study after deriving the analytical solutions of hydraulic head under transient conditions we discuss the effect of the periodically changing water table on the nested flow systems in the tóthian basin based on the evolution of flow fields the distribution of internal stagnation points the magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation the recharge discharge flux across the top boundary and the evolution of zones with flowing wells 2 the mathematical model and analytical solutions 2 1 model description similar to tóth 1962 1963 and vandenberg 1980 the two dimensional cross section of a groundwater basin is represented by a rectangle domain ranging in x from 0 to l and in z from 0 to z 0 fig 1 as long as the slope of water table is small the flat top has little effect on the flow field tóth 1962 1963 zlotnik et al 2015 the bottom and lateral boundaries are all no flow boundaries while the top of the domain is a specified head boundary whose hydraulic head equals the elevation of the fluctuating water table the fluctuating water table varying with time indicates a transient flow according to vandenberg 1980 the governing equation of hydraulic head piezometric head in the rectangle domain induced by the fluctuating water table can be written as 1 2 h x 2 2 h z 2 s s k h t where h is hydraulic head k is hydraulic conductivity and ss is specific storage note that piezometric head implies that the compressibility of water is neglected the topography of a tóthian basin can be represented by the function proposed by jiang et al 2011 2 z s x z 0 h l h l cos m π l x h r h r cos π l x where hr is the amplitude of the regional undulation of topography at the divide hl is the amplitude of local undulation at all divides m is an odd number determining the number of local valleys and local divides based on the relationship between water table and topography water table could be categorized into topography controlled and recharge controlled haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the former represents the case water table is a subdued replica of the topography which could be resulted from low permeability and or high recharge while the latter the case water table is not related to topography which could be resulted from high permeability and or low recharge as pointed out by bresciani and batelaan 2015 the major difference between topography controlled and recharge controlled water tables is that the control of the topography occurs via the valleys where the water table outcrops when water table is topography controlled all major valleys are groundwater outcrops and when water table is recharge controlled most valleys are not groundwater outcrops the red 1 for interpretation of color in fig 1 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 line fig 1 represents the highest water table equaling topography consists of both local and regional undulations while the blue line represents a water table consists of only regional undulation which can be considered as the transition between topography controlled and recharge controlled water table note that in drier climates it is entirely possible that water table is controlled by recharge and could be lower than the blue line to make sure that nested flow systems could develop in the tóthian basin i e local and regional undulations of water table co exist we assume that the water table ranges between the red line and the blue line shown in fig 1 therefore we modify eq 2 by multiplying a time dependent term α t ranging between 0 and 1 to characterize the fluctuating water table 3 h 0 x t z 0 α t h l h l cos m π l x h r h r cos π l x a similar treatment had been proposed by gomez and wilson 2009 eq 3 ensures that water table at the valleys does not change with time which is in accordance with perennial streams in real basins and the amplitude of water table fluctuates which is in accordance with field observations winter et al 2003 gomez and wilson 2013 α t 1 indicates highest water table equaling the topography and α t 0 represents the case without local undulation at x l the elevation of water table is z 0 2hr 2hl when α t 1 and is z 0 2hr when α t 0 note that α t can be represented by various forms of functions in this study we choose cos2 πt p where p is the period of periodically changing water table in each period α equals 1 at t 0 and p equals 1 2 at t p 4 and 3p 4 and equals 0 at t p 2 due to the fact that water table configuration is highly dependent on not only topography and geology but also climate groundwater models with a specified flux upper boundary condition have been employed or suggested by a number of researchers to examine the development of nested flow systems anderson and munter 1981 winter 1983 nield et al 1994 liang et al 2013 goderniaux et al 2013 bresciani et al 2016 in regional scale models although assigning an average recharge rate uniformly over the entire model domain is sufficient in many cases it has been pointed out that the spatial variation in recharge is required for accurate simulation of baseflow juckem et al 2006 and groundwater levels cao et al 2013 moreover the fluctuating water table is caused by temporal variabilities in groundwater recharge and discharge therefore a specified flux upper boundary model with spatial and temporal variations in groundwater recharge and discharge could also be employed to study the periodically changing nested flow systems however such a study using the specified flux upper boundary is beyond the scope of the current study which aims to extend vandenberg s 1980 analytical solution 2 2 solution of hydraulic head under the transient condition to obtain the solution of eq 1 under the periodically fluctuating water table we first discompose h into ha hydraulic head induced only by the regional undulation of water table and hb hydraulic head induced by the periodically changing local undulation of water table note that ha does not change with time while hb is time dependent the governing equation for ha is 4 2 h a x 2 2 h a z 2 0 with the following boundary conditions h a x z z 0 z 0 h r 1 cos π x l 5 h a x x 0 0 h a x x l 0 h a z z 0 0 the governing equation for hb can be written as 6 2 h b x 2 2 h b z 2 s s k h b t with the initial condition 7 h b x z t 0 0 and boundary conditions h b x z z 0 t α t h l 1 cos m π x l 8 h b x x 0 0 h b x x l 0 h b z z 0 0 the following dimensionless variables are defined h h z 0 h l z 0 z 0 l ω π s s l 2 kp α t cos 2 ω t x x l z z l t kt s s l 2 following jiang et al 2011 h a can be solved by the separation variable method the solution is 9 h a x z h r h l 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 following vandenberg 1980 h b can be solved by laplace transform and the separation variable method when t is small the sharp step induced by h l 1 cos m π x l at the initial time would lead to an unwanted transient evolution of hydraulic head when t that evolution of hydraulic head within a period would not be affected by the initial condition at t 0 vandenberg 1980 the periodic solution of h b when t can be written as 10 h b x z t 1 z 0 n 1 1 n 1 α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 α n 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 4 4 ω 2 cos m π x z 0 n 1 1 n α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 m 2 π 2 α n 2 m 2 π 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 2 m 2 π 2 2 4 ω 2 where α n 1 2 2 n 1 π z 0 the details of obtaining eq 10 can be found in appendix a by adding eqs 9 and 10 the hydraulic head induced by the periodically changing water table as shown in eq 3 can be written as 11a h x z t h a x z h b x z t h r h l 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 1 z 0 n 1 1 n 1 α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 α n 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 4 4 ω 2 cos m π x z 0 n 1 1 n α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 m 2 π 2 α n 2 m 2 π 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 2 m 2 π 2 2 4 ω 2 according to eq a14 the distribution of hydraulic head can be written in the simplified form as 11b h x z t h a f x z z 0 a x z sin 2 ω t ξ z 0 where f x z is mean hydraulic head induced by the fluctuating local undulation a x z is amplitude of hydraulic head induced by the fluctuating local undulation and ξ is phase difference this equation is convenient for analyzing the influencing factors of the transient flow field we found that the period of h still is p the phase difference ξ is a function of x z and ω which indicates that the lag time of h varies with position as well as ω the third term to the right side of eq 11b leads to the transient behavior of h in the periodically changing flow fields we find z 0 i e the ratio of z 0 l impacts not only the development of nested flow systems under the steady condition tóth 1963 but also the flow field distortion under the transient condition eqs 11a and 11b show that ω π s s l 2 kp is a critical parameter influencing the transient flow field a similar term 2 π s s l 2 kp had already been used in vandenberg 1980 in later studies on the transient behavior of groundwater flow the response time τ l 2 ss k is more widely employed to examine the response of a specific aquifer to head perturbation domenico and schwartz 1998 reilly and harbaugh 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2013 when τ is much smaller than the period of head perturbation the basin as a whole will respond quickly and the head distribution will correspond closely to the steady state model at each instant of time therefore the non dimensional ratio τ p has been widely applied to characterize the capacity of the aquifer to respond to and propagate periodic forcing townley 1995 dickinson et al 2004 in the current study we introduce dimensionless response time τ to represent τ p which equals ω π 2 3 solution of hydraulic head under the quasi steady condition in hydrogeological studies when the transient state can be approximated through a succession of steady states the quasi steady state assumption can be employed zecharias and brutsaert 1988 zhang and neuman 1996 in the current study when τ is small the flow system can be assumed to have an instantaneous response to water table oscillation i e the quasi steady state approximation is acceptable the analytical solution of hydraulic head under the quasi steady state condition is derived in this section for a homogenous and isotropic basin the governing equation for quasi steady state groundwater flow can be written as 12 2 h x 2 2 h z 2 0 by utilizing the separation variable method the solution of hydraulic head can be derived as 13 h x z t h r h l 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 α t 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 eq 13 can be regarded as an extreme condition that the water table perturbation can penetrate the basin instantly although the second term to the right side of eq 13 differs greatly in mathematical form from eq 10 they lead to the same flow field when τ is small 3 results and discussion according to eq 11b the ratios of basin depth to basin width z 0 l and response time to period τ p both influence the transient hydraulic head distribution as discussed in tóth 1963 the development of nested flow systems in steady state conditions is dependent on ratios of z 0 l and hr hl to exclude the influence of z 0 l we limit our discussion on the effect of dimensionless response time τ on the transient behavior of nested flow systems to insure that local middle and regional flow system all develop when water table approaches to the topography we use l 7000m z 0 2500m hr 50m and hl 50m m 7 we choose a series of hydraulic diffusivity k ss ranging between 104 and 107 m2 d assuming that the period is 1year i e the seasonally fluctuating water table is considered the corresponding τ ranges from 0 013 to 13 note that a small τ can also be found when fluctuating period is long or the dimension of a basin is small based on eq 11a the transient hydraulic head in a period under different τ can be obtained here we examine the evolutions of flow fields internal stagnant points and zone with flowing wells and the magnitude of relative hydraulic head under different τ we also calculate the recharge discharge flux across the top boundary when water table falls and rises 3 1 the evolution of flow fields and internal stagnation points fig 2 shows the evolution of flow field when τ equals 13 and 0 013 a major difference caused by τ is the distribution of nested flow systems which is symmetric with respect to the mid line when τ equals 0 013 but is asymmetric due to the increasing τ because each internal stagnation point divides four flow systems we also show the evolution of internal stagnation points sp1 sp2 and sp3 under four different τ fig 3 note that a stagnation point was originally defined as the point with zero velocity in a steady state flow field however in transient conditions there are also positions with zero velocity which still divide the flow systems anderson and munter 1981 jin and steward 1999 therefore it is worthwhile to study the evolution of internal stagnation points in our study to represent the evolution processes of nested flow systems when τ is small fig 2a2 d2 the local flow systems have the largest penetration depths when α 1 as α decreases the smoothed water table undulation leads to decreases in the penetration depths and the sizes of local flow systems which further lead to an expansion in the size of the regional flow system when α decreases to 0 there is no local undulation of water table thus both local and intermediate flow systems diminish the weakening of local flow systems with decreasing α can be explained by the ratio of amplitude of local water table undulation αhl versus the amplitude of regional water table undulation hr i e αhl hr which is in accordance with tóth s 1963 and jiang et al s 2011 findings on the effect of water table relief on the development of local versus regional flow systems therefore fig 2a2 and c2 represents two extreme cases of the dynamically changing groundwater flow systems however it is worthwhile to note that the internal stagnation points disappear before α h l h r reaches 0 we found sp 2 disappears when α h l h r equals 1 m we also found the distribution of flow systems and internal stagnation points is only dependent on α t this is illustrated by the same flow fields as shown in fig 2a2 and d2 with different t but the same α and the coincidence of internal stagnation points with the same α but different t as shown in fig 3d this is a direct result of the instantaneous response of the flow field to the fluctuating water table when τ is large fig 2a1 d1 the distribution of hydraulic head is severely distorted and the flow patterns are more complicated due to the long response time to the fluctuating water table although water table is the highest with the largest αhl hr when α 1 the penetration depths of local flow systems have not reached the deepest yet instead sp 1 and sp 2 reach their deepest when α 0 9 and sp 3 reaches its deepest when α 0 6 fig 3a as α decreases the three internal stagnation points disappear at different t fig 2c1 shows that when α 0 there is an upward component of groundwater flow over the whole basin whose flow field is significantly different from other cases when α increases to 0 3 at t 0 68p the three internal stagnation points and the nested structure of the flow field appear again at t 0 75p α increases to 0 5 which is the same as that at t 0 25p the flow fields shown in fig 2b1 and d1 differ when α increases back to 1 the pattern of nested flow systems is identical to the initial flow field of the period fig 2a1 fig 3a clearly shows that the movement of internal stagnation points in one period has the form of a loop which is non enclosed in the shallow part due to the disappearance of internal stagnation points as τ decreases the non enclosed loops of stagnation points become narrower and approach to a line fig 3 we also note that the locations for disappearance and reappearance of internal stagnation points do not coincide when τ is large fig 3a c fig 2 also shows the distribution of the magnitude of velocity the zones in rose are trapped by velocity contour v 0 005m d which can be regarded as stagnant zones when τ is small the areas of stagnant zones change little with the fluctuating water table when τ is large however the sizes of both internal and basin bottom stagnant zones are found to be sensitive to the fluctuating water table as shown in fig 2c1 with α 0 the basin bottom stagnant zone at the divide is so large that it reaches the land surface 3 2 the magnitude of head fluctuation in the field it is difficult to obtain the accurate distribution of nested flow systems and the internal stagnant zones instead the fluctuations of water table in shallow wells and water level in deep wells are routinely monitored in many basins which are direct observations of the dynamically changing groundwater flow fields here the distribution and influencing factors of the magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation in the tόthian basin are discussed the difference between the maximum and the minimum hydraulic head in one period is denoted as h according to eq 3 each divide has the largest h equaling 2hl and each valley has the lowest h equaling 0 fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation δ h which is defined as h 2hl the divides and valleys separate the rectangle domain into seven symmetric parts in the shallow portion of the basin under each τ δ h shows a decreasing trend from 1 at the divide to 0 at the neighboring valley which can be explained by the decaying driving force of groundwater flow from water table highs to lows in the deep portion of the basin δ h below water table highs and lows has little difference under each τ however δ h in the deep part of the basin is found to be highly dependent on τ when τ 13 δ h in the basin bottom approaches to 0 1 indicating that the fluctuating water table has limited effect on the hydraulic head in the deep part when τ 0 013 δ h in the basin bottom approaches to 0 5 indicating that the fluctuating water table has strong effect on the hydraulic head in the deep part under the quasi steady state condition if we assume that the thickness of the basin is infinite i e z 0 δ h can be expressed as 14 δ h x z 1 cos m π x exp m π z 2 this equation confirms that δ h approaches to 0 5 in the basin bottom when τ is small fig 5 shows the profiles of δ h through a divide profile a and a valley profile b which clearly illustrates the different patterns of vertical changes in hydraulic head fluctuation in water table highs and lows note that although only one divide and one valley are labeled in each of the basins in fig 4 the pattern of vertical changes in hydraulic head fluctuation for each of the four divides is the same and that for each of the four valleys is also the same for the profiles in the divide δ h decreases nonlinearly from 1 to a threshold dependent on τ fig 5a for the profiles in the valleys δ h increases nonlinearly from 0 to a threshold when τ is small and increases nonlinearly from 0 to a maximum value and then decrease to a threshold when τ is large fig 5a the τ dependent pattern of vertical change in δ h in the valley is a result of fact that the head perturbation in the top boundary is hard to penetrate to the basin bottom under large τ according to eq 14 based on the quasi steady state model δ h increases almost exponentially from 0 to 0 5 in the valley and decreases almost negative exponentially from 1 to 0 5 in the valley fig 5 also shows that when τ is as small as 0 13 the profiles of δ h in both the divide and the valley coincide with those with τ 0 013 and ss 0 this confirms that when τ is small the quasi steady state model could be employed to characterize the transient behavior of groundwater flow 3 3 the evolution of zones with flowing wells based on the concept of gravity driven groundwater flow freeze and cherry 1979 proposed that flowing wells could develop in the discharge area of a groundwater basin without the existence of confining beds in the field the development of seasonal flowing wells or seasonal variations of head or flux in flowing wells are quite common therefore it is interesting to relate the dynamic phenomena of flowing wells to the periodically changing flow systems wang et al 2015 defined head exceeding land surface hf i e the hydraulic head at a specific point in the flow domain minus the corresponding elevation of land surface to delineate the flowing conditions in basins flowing wells could develop in the zones with positive hf but not in zones with negative hf to examine the transient behavior of zones with flowing wells in the tόthian basin we calculate the h f by using the following equation 15 h f x z t h x z t z s x where z s x is the dimensionless form of zs by substituting eq 11a into 15 we obtain the evolution of h f in the homogeneous and isotropic tόthian basin under different τ fig 6 the contour lines with h f 0 which constitute the boundaries between zones with flowing wells and non flowing wells are in bold there are four zones with flowing wells labeled as a b c and d which are all located in the topographic lows of the basin fig 6 shows that the response of zones with flowing wells to the periodically fluctuating water table is also dependent on τ when τ is small the highest water table at the initial time leads to the maximum area of zones with flowing wells as well as the highest h f in each zone with flowing wells fig 6a2 as α decreases the area of zones with flowing wells shrinks and when α 0 the lowest water table without local undulation results in the minimum area of zones with flowing wells even disappearance of zones with flowing wells c and d in the upper reaches of the basin fig 6c2 as the water table rises zones with flowing wells c and d will appear again fig 6d2 similar to the phenomenon of dependence of flow field on α t the distribution of zones with flowing wells is also dependent on α t instead of t when τ is large the distribution of h f lags to the changing water table and is more complicated than that under the quasi steady state condition due to the long response time to the fluctuating water table the largest area of zones with flowing wells occurs at t 0 15p with α 0 8 fig 6b1 instead of at t 0 with α 1 with the highest water table fig 6a1 as α decreases further the decreasing water table also leads to shrinkage of zones with flowing wells at t 0 5p with α 0 although water table is the lowest the area of zones with flowing wells does not reach the minimum fig 6c1 due to the time lag the area of zones with flowing wells decreases further even though water table rises after t 0 5p at t 0 65p with α 0 2 fig 6d1 the area of zones with flowing wells reaches its minimum and zones with flowing wells c and d still exist as water table rises further the area of zones with flowing wells increases with α therefore the distribution of zones with flowing wells is dependent not only on α t but also on t due to the lag of response to the fluctuating water table inside the basin which differs from the situation with small τ the dependences of zones with flowing wells and h f on α t well explains the existence of seasonal flowing wells in arid regions which could not flow out in seasons with insignificant undulation of water table 3 4 the evolution of recharge discharge fluxes at the top boundary according to freeze and witherspoon 1968 the vertical flux across the top boundary q z k h z based on the steady state flow field induced by the mean water table undulation represents spatial distribution of recharge discharge flux at the land surface in the steady state case the total recharge flux equals the total discharge flux in transient cases the recharge discharge flux should include not only the vertical flux across the top boundary but also the changes in water storage as reflected in the fluctuating water table zijl 1999 mathematically the recharge discharge flux r at the top boundary can be expressed as 16 r s y h t q z where sy is specific yield in the shallow part of the basin a positive r indicates recharge at the land surface while a negative r indicates groundwater discharge assuming that specific yield equals 0 1 we show the change in dimensionless recharge discharge flux r r khl with time in fig 7 a and b when t equals 0 0 5p and p r equals qz because h t equals 0 during the process of water table decline r is smaller than qz while during the process of water table rise r is larger than qz fig 7a and b also show that the distribution of recharge and discharge areas changes with time at t 0 the distribution of recharge and discharge areas is associated with water table highs and lows as water table declines most parts of the top boundary behave as discharge areas as water table rises the area of recharge areas is greater than that of discharge areas the evolution of total recharge flux versus total discharge flux during a period is shown in fig 7c it is clear that groundwater discharge dominates during the process of water table decline while groundwater recharge dominates during the process of water table rise which is in accordance with the relationship between water table change and groundwater recharge discharge healy and cook 2002 4 conclusions periodically changing water table is a widely observed phenomenon in the field to study its impact on basin scale groundwater flow the combination of a time independent regional undulation and a time dependent local undulation is used to represent the fluctuating water table in a tόthian basin following vandenberg s 1980 study on transient flow in a unit basin we derived the analytical solution of hydraulic head under periodically changing water table and found two critical parameters z 0 l and τ largely controls the spatial distribution of transient hydraulic head thus the evolution of nested flow systems when τ is small enough hydraulic head distribution is the same as that obtained by the analytical solution under the quasi steady state condition when τ is large the nested flow systems distort severely due to the effect of specific storage in each period internal stagnation points move in a loop which is non enclosed near the land surface due to disappearance of internal stagnation points in the shallow part and the size of stagnant zones changes greatly as τ deceases the hydraulic head perturbation can diffuse easier and the non enclosed loop becomes narrower when τ is small enough internal stagnation points move nearly vertically therefore in arid climate the nested flow systems could not necessarily develop even if the undulation of topography is significant and the stagnant zones which are critical to accumulation of transported matter might be unstable because the water table has the largest magnitude of fluctuation in the divides and is fixed in the valleys the magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation decreases with the distance away from the divide the magnitude of head fluctuation is also found to be depth dependent throughout the basin which increases to a threshold near the valley and decreases to a threshold near the divide the threshold value of the relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation in the deep part of the basin is found to be highly dependent on τ the threshold value approaches to 0 5 when τ is 0 013 or 0 13 i e approximates to the quasi steady state condition and approaches to 0 1 when τ is 13 this indicates that a high τ could lead to a less fluctuating hydraulic head field but a more fluctuating flow field we also examined the development of zones with flowing wells under periodically changing water table when τ is small the instant response of hydraulic head leads to instant response of zones with flowing wells to the fluctuating water table the zones with flowing wells reach their maximum areas when water table is the highest and reach their minimum even disappear when water table is the lowest when τ is large the lag of hydraulic head response to the fluctuating water table leads to a complicated evolution of zones with flowing wells the zones with flowing wells reach their maximum when water table declines from α 1 to α 0 8 and reach their minimum when water table rises from α 0 to α 0 2 these findings well explain the development of seasonal flowing wells in the field and could provide guidelines for well drilling in large scale basins in our model of transient groundwater flow controlled by the time dependent specified head top boundary we found groundwater discharge dominates during water table decline and groundwater recharge dominates during water table rise this is in agreement with field observations of the relationship between the fluctuating water table and groundwater recharge discharge therefore although fluxes across the top boundary have not been assigned the spatial and temporal variabilities in recharge and discharge fluxes at the top boundary have been implicitly accounted for acknowledgement this study is supported by the national young talents support program the national natural science foundation of china 41522205 the

7589,classical understanding on basin scale groundwater flow patterns is based on tóth s findings of a single flow system in a unit basin tóth 1962 and nested flow systems in a complex basin tóth 1963 both of which were based on steady state models vandenberg 1980 extended tóth 1962 by deriving a transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a unit basin and examined the flow field distortion under different dimensionless response time τ following vandenberg s 1980 approach we extended tóth 1963 by deriving the transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a complex basin and examined the transient behavior of nested flow systems due to the effect of specific storage the flow field is asymmetric with respect to the midline and the trajectory of internal stagnation points constitutes a non enclosed loop whose width decreases when τ decreases the distribution of the relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation δ h is dependent on the horizontal distance away from a divide and the depth below the land surface in the shallow part δ h decreases from 1 at the divide to 0 at its neighboring valley under all τ while in the deep part δ h reaches a threshold whose value decreases when τ increases the zones with flowing wells are also found to change periodically as water table falls there is a general trend of shrinkage in the area of zones with flowing wells which has a lag to the declining water table under a large τ although fluxes have not been assigned in our model the recharge discharge flux across the top boundary can be obtained this study is critical to understand a series of periodically changing hydrogeological phenomena in large scale basins keywords periodically changing groundwater flow system stagnation point hydraulic head fluctuation zone with flowing wells 1 introduction quantitative studies on basin scale groundwater circulation could be traced back to the 1960s when the undulating water table consists of one scale the pattern of groundwater circulation is in the form of a single flow system tóth 1962 when the undulating water table of consists of multiple scales the pattern of groundwater circulation is found to be in the form of hierarchically nested flow systems tóth 1963 engelen and jones 1986 the former has been defined to be a unit basin tόth 2009 while the latter a tóthian basin robinson and love 2013 in both kinds of basins each flow system is a circulation cell with distinct characteristics of groundwater hydraulics and chemical evolution the concept of groundwater flow systems has been not only utilized in the hydrogeology community engelen and kloosterman 1996 liang et al 2010 sophocleous 2002 winter 1999 but also applied in many earth science disciplines such as petroleum and hydrocarbon exploration garven 1995 tóth 1988 verweij 1993 ecohydrology batelaan et al 2003 and radioactive waste disposal voss and provost 2001 due to such factors as climate vegetation and tide diurnal seasonal inter annual and multi decadal variabilities are quite common in such observations as water table depth groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge gribovszki et al 2010 maxwell and kollet 2008 sacks et al 1992 van roosmalen et al 2007 therefore the cyclical dynamics of groundwater has been studied extensively nielsen 1990 townley 1995 trefry 1999 unfortunately in tóth s classic model and most subsequent modified models it is generally assumed that the flow field is controlled by the multi year mean water table which implies that the fluctuation of water table is ignored in the few studies examining the evolution of groundwater flow systems during the geological time scale steady state flow was assumed within each geological period tóth 1978 zhang et al 2013 vandenberg 1980 modified tóth s 1962 unit basin model to examine the response of groundwater flow to a periodically oscillating water table and found that the a high ratio of response time to period could result in severely distorted flow fields which are significantly different from those obtained by steady state models in a recent study gomez and wilson 2013 used a tóthian basin model to study the age distributions in nested flow systems under a periodically changing water table by ignoring the effect of specific storage on the flow field based on a tóthian basin model niu et al 2015 studied the transient process of nested flow system evolution between two steady state conditions to the authors knowledge the transient effect of a periodically changing water table on the development of nested flow systems accounting for the effect of specific storage has never been examined in this paper following vandenberg s 1980 study on transient groundwater flow in a unit basin we develop a conceptual model of groundwater flow in a tóthian basin with a periodically fluctuating water table the major difference between our model and gomez and wilson s 2013 model is that specific storage has been taken into account in the current study after deriving the analytical solutions of hydraulic head under transient conditions we discuss the effect of the periodically changing water table on the nested flow systems in the tóthian basin based on the evolution of flow fields the distribution of internal stagnation points the magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation the recharge discharge flux across the top boundary and the evolution of zones with flowing wells 2 the mathematical model and analytical solutions 2 1 model description similar to tóth 1962 1963 and vandenberg 1980 the two dimensional cross section of a groundwater basin is represented by a rectangle domain ranging in x from 0 to l and in z from 0 to z 0 fig 1 as long as the slope of water table is small the flat top has little effect on the flow field tóth 1962 1963 zlotnik et al 2015 the bottom and lateral boundaries are all no flow boundaries while the top of the domain is a specified head boundary whose hydraulic head equals the elevation of the fluctuating water table the fluctuating water table varying with time indicates a transient flow according to vandenberg 1980 the governing equation of hydraulic head piezometric head in the rectangle domain induced by the fluctuating water table can be written as 1 2 h x 2 2 h z 2 s s k h t where h is hydraulic head k is hydraulic conductivity and ss is specific storage note that piezometric head implies that the compressibility of water is neglected the topography of a tóthian basin can be represented by the function proposed by jiang et al 2011 2 z s x z 0 h l h l cos m π l x h r h r cos π l x where hr is the amplitude of the regional undulation of topography at the divide hl is the amplitude of local undulation at all divides m is an odd number determining the number of local valleys and local divides based on the relationship between water table and topography water table could be categorized into topography controlled and recharge controlled haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the former represents the case water table is a subdued replica of the topography which could be resulted from low permeability and or high recharge while the latter the case water table is not related to topography which could be resulted from high permeability and or low recharge as pointed out by bresciani and batelaan 2015 the major difference between topography controlled and recharge controlled water tables is that the control of the topography occurs via the valleys where the water table outcrops when water table is topography controlled all major valleys are groundwater outcrops and when water table is recharge controlled most valleys are not groundwater outcrops the red 1 for interpretation of color in fig 1 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 line fig 1 represents the highest water table equaling topography consists of both local and regional undulations while the blue line represents a water table consists of only regional undulation which can be considered as the transition between topography controlled and recharge controlled water table note that in drier climates it is entirely possible that water table is controlled by recharge and could be lower than the blue line to make sure that nested flow systems could develop in the tóthian basin i e local and regional undulations of water table co exist we assume that the water table ranges between the red line and the blue line shown in fig 1 therefore we modify eq 2 by multiplying a time dependent term α t ranging between 0 and 1 to characterize the fluctuating water table 3 h 0 x t z 0 α t h l h l cos m π l x h r h r cos π l x a similar treatment had been proposed by gomez and wilson 2009 eq 3 ensures that water table at the valleys does not change with time which is in accordance with perennial streams in real basins and the amplitude of water table fluctuates which is in accordance with field observations winter et al 2003 gomez and wilson 2013 α t 1 indicates highest water table equaling the topography and α t 0 represents the case without local undulation at x l the elevation of water table is z 0 2hr 2hl when α t 1 and is z 0 2hr when α t 0 note that α t can be represented by various forms of functions in this study we choose cos2 πt p where p is the period of periodically changing water table in each period α equals 1 at t 0 and p equals 1 2 at t p 4 and 3p 4 and equals 0 at t p 2 due to the fact that water table configuration is highly dependent on not only topography and geology but also climate groundwater models with a specified flux upper boundary condition have been employed or suggested by a number of researchers to examine the development of nested flow systems anderson and munter 1981 winter 1983 nield et al 1994 liang et al 2013 goderniaux et al 2013 bresciani et al 2016 in regional scale models although assigning an average recharge rate uniformly over the entire model domain is sufficient in many cases it has been pointed out that the spatial variation in recharge is required for accurate simulation of baseflow juckem et al 2006 and groundwater levels cao et al 2013 moreover the fluctuating water table is caused by temporal variabilities in groundwater recharge and discharge therefore a specified flux upper boundary model with spatial and temporal variations in groundwater recharge and discharge could also be employed to study the periodically changing nested flow systems however such a study using the specified flux upper boundary is beyond the scope of the current study which aims to extend vandenberg s 1980 analytical solution 2 2 solution of hydraulic head under the transient condition to obtain the solution of eq 1 under the periodically fluctuating water table we first discompose h into ha hydraulic head induced only by the regional undulation of water table and hb hydraulic head induced by the periodically changing local undulation of water table note that ha does not change with time while hb is time dependent the governing equation for ha is 4 2 h a x 2 2 h a z 2 0 with the following boundary conditions h a x z z 0 z 0 h r 1 cos π x l 5 h a x x 0 0 h a x x l 0 h a z z 0 0 the governing equation for hb can be written as 6 2 h b x 2 2 h b z 2 s s k h b t with the initial condition 7 h b x z t 0 0 and boundary conditions h b x z z 0 t α t h l 1 cos m π x l 8 h b x x 0 0 h b x x l 0 h b z z 0 0 the following dimensionless variables are defined h h z 0 h l z 0 z 0 l ω π s s l 2 kp α t cos 2 ω t x x l z z l t kt s s l 2 following jiang et al 2011 h a can be solved by the separation variable method the solution is 9 h a x z h r h l 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 following vandenberg 1980 h b can be solved by laplace transform and the separation variable method when t is small the sharp step induced by h l 1 cos m π x l at the initial time would lead to an unwanted transient evolution of hydraulic head when t that evolution of hydraulic head within a period would not be affected by the initial condition at t 0 vandenberg 1980 the periodic solution of h b when t can be written as 10 h b x z t 1 z 0 n 1 1 n 1 α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 α n 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 4 4 ω 2 cos m π x z 0 n 1 1 n α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 m 2 π 2 α n 2 m 2 π 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 2 m 2 π 2 2 4 ω 2 where α n 1 2 2 n 1 π z 0 the details of obtaining eq 10 can be found in appendix a by adding eqs 9 and 10 the hydraulic head induced by the periodically changing water table as shown in eq 3 can be written as 11a h x z t h a x z h b x z t h r h l 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 1 z 0 n 1 1 n 1 α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 α n 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 4 4 ω 2 cos m π x z 0 n 1 1 n α n cos α n z 1 α n 2 m 2 π 2 α n 2 m 2 π 2 cos 2 ω t 2 ω sin 2 ω t α n 2 m 2 π 2 2 4 ω 2 according to eq a14 the distribution of hydraulic head can be written in the simplified form as 11b h x z t h a f x z z 0 a x z sin 2 ω t ξ z 0 where f x z is mean hydraulic head induced by the fluctuating local undulation a x z is amplitude of hydraulic head induced by the fluctuating local undulation and ξ is phase difference this equation is convenient for analyzing the influencing factors of the transient flow field we found that the period of h still is p the phase difference ξ is a function of x z and ω which indicates that the lag time of h varies with position as well as ω the third term to the right side of eq 11b leads to the transient behavior of h in the periodically changing flow fields we find z 0 i e the ratio of z 0 l impacts not only the development of nested flow systems under the steady condition tóth 1963 but also the flow field distortion under the transient condition eqs 11a and 11b show that ω π s s l 2 kp is a critical parameter influencing the transient flow field a similar term 2 π s s l 2 kp had already been used in vandenberg 1980 in later studies on the transient behavior of groundwater flow the response time τ l 2 ss k is more widely employed to examine the response of a specific aquifer to head perturbation domenico and schwartz 1998 reilly and harbaugh 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2013 when τ is much smaller than the period of head perturbation the basin as a whole will respond quickly and the head distribution will correspond closely to the steady state model at each instant of time therefore the non dimensional ratio τ p has been widely applied to characterize the capacity of the aquifer to respond to and propagate periodic forcing townley 1995 dickinson et al 2004 in the current study we introduce dimensionless response time τ to represent τ p which equals ω π 2 3 solution of hydraulic head under the quasi steady condition in hydrogeological studies when the transient state can be approximated through a succession of steady states the quasi steady state assumption can be employed zecharias and brutsaert 1988 zhang and neuman 1996 in the current study when τ is small the flow system can be assumed to have an instantaneous response to water table oscillation i e the quasi steady state approximation is acceptable the analytical solution of hydraulic head under the quasi steady state condition is derived in this section for a homogenous and isotropic basin the governing equation for quasi steady state groundwater flow can be written as 12 2 h x 2 2 h z 2 0 by utilizing the separation variable method the solution of hydraulic head can be derived as 13 h x z t h r h l 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 α t 1 cos π x cosh π z cosh π z 0 eq 13 can be regarded as an extreme condition that the water table perturbation can penetrate the basin instantly although the second term to the right side of eq 13 differs greatly in mathematical form from eq 10 they lead to the same flow field when τ is small 3 results and discussion according to eq 11b the ratios of basin depth to basin width z 0 l and response time to period τ p both influence the transient hydraulic head distribution as discussed in tóth 1963 the development of nested flow systems in steady state conditions is dependent on ratios of z 0 l and hr hl to exclude the influence of z 0 l we limit our discussion on the effect of dimensionless response time τ on the transient behavior of nested flow systems to insure that local middle and regional flow system all develop when water table approaches to the topography we use l 7000m z 0 2500m hr 50m and hl 50m m 7 we choose a series of hydraulic diffusivity k ss ranging between 104 and 107 m2 d assuming that the period is 1year i e the seasonally fluctuating water table is considered the corresponding τ ranges from 0 013 to 13 note that a small τ can also be found when fluctuating period is long or the dimension of a basin is small based on eq 11a the transient hydraulic head in a period under different τ can be obtained here we examine the evolutions of flow fields internal stagnant points and zone with flowing wells and the magnitude of relative hydraulic head under different τ we also calculate the recharge discharge flux across the top boundary when water table falls and rises 3 1 the evolution of flow fields and internal stagnation points fig 2 shows the evolution of flow field when τ equals 13 and 0 013 a major difference caused by τ is the distribution of nested flow systems which is symmetric with respect to the mid line when τ equals 0 013 but is asymmetric due to the increasing τ because each internal stagnation point divides four flow systems we also show the evolution of internal stagnation points sp1 sp2 and sp3 under four different τ fig 3 note that a stagnation point was originally defined as the point with zero velocity in a steady state flow field however in transient conditions there are also positions with zero velocity which still divide the flow systems anderson and munter 1981 jin and steward 1999 therefore it is worthwhile to study the evolution of internal stagnation points in our study to represent the evolution processes of nested flow systems when τ is small fig 2a2 d2 the local flow systems have the largest penetration depths when α 1 as α decreases the smoothed water table undulation leads to decreases in the penetration depths and the sizes of local flow systems which further lead to an expansion in the size of the regional flow system when α decreases to 0 there is no local undulation of water table thus both local and intermediate flow systems diminish the weakening of local flow systems with decreasing α can be explained by the ratio of amplitude of local water table undulation αhl versus the amplitude of regional water table undulation hr i e αhl hr which is in accordance with tóth s 1963 and jiang et al s 2011 findings on the effect of water table relief on the development of local versus regional flow systems therefore fig 2a2 and c2 represents two extreme cases of the dynamically changing groundwater flow systems however it is worthwhile to note that the internal stagnation points disappear before α h l h r reaches 0 we found sp 2 disappears when α h l h r equals 1 m we also found the distribution of flow systems and internal stagnation points is only dependent on α t this is illustrated by the same flow fields as shown in fig 2a2 and d2 with different t but the same α and the coincidence of internal stagnation points with the same α but different t as shown in fig 3d this is a direct result of the instantaneous response of the flow field to the fluctuating water table when τ is large fig 2a1 d1 the distribution of hydraulic head is severely distorted and the flow patterns are more complicated due to the long response time to the fluctuating water table although water table is the highest with the largest αhl hr when α 1 the penetration depths of local flow systems have not reached the deepest yet instead sp 1 and sp 2 reach their deepest when α 0 9 and sp 3 reaches its deepest when α 0 6 fig 3a as α decreases the three internal stagnation points disappear at different t fig 2c1 shows that when α 0 there is an upward component of groundwater flow over the whole basin whose flow field is significantly different from other cases when α increases to 0 3 at t 0 68p the three internal stagnation points and the nested structure of the flow field appear again at t 0 75p α increases to 0 5 which is the same as that at t 0 25p the flow fields shown in fig 2b1 and d1 differ when α increases back to 1 the pattern of nested flow systems is identical to the initial flow field of the period fig 2a1 fig 3a clearly shows that the movement of internal stagnation points in one period has the form of a loop which is non enclosed in the shallow part due to the disappearance of internal stagnation points as τ decreases the non enclosed loops of stagnation points become narrower and approach to a line fig 3 we also note that the locations for disappearance and reappearance of internal stagnation points do not coincide when τ is large fig 3a c fig 2 also shows the distribution of the magnitude of velocity the zones in rose are trapped by velocity contour v 0 005m d which can be regarded as stagnant zones when τ is small the areas of stagnant zones change little with the fluctuating water table when τ is large however the sizes of both internal and basin bottom stagnant zones are found to be sensitive to the fluctuating water table as shown in fig 2c1 with α 0 the basin bottom stagnant zone at the divide is so large that it reaches the land surface 3 2 the magnitude of head fluctuation in the field it is difficult to obtain the accurate distribution of nested flow systems and the internal stagnant zones instead the fluctuations of water table in shallow wells and water level in deep wells are routinely monitored in many basins which are direct observations of the dynamically changing groundwater flow fields here the distribution and influencing factors of the magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation in the tόthian basin are discussed the difference between the maximum and the minimum hydraulic head in one period is denoted as h according to eq 3 each divide has the largest h equaling 2hl and each valley has the lowest h equaling 0 fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation δ h which is defined as h 2hl the divides and valleys separate the rectangle domain into seven symmetric parts in the shallow portion of the basin under each τ δ h shows a decreasing trend from 1 at the divide to 0 at the neighboring valley which can be explained by the decaying driving force of groundwater flow from water table highs to lows in the deep portion of the basin δ h below water table highs and lows has little difference under each τ however δ h in the deep part of the basin is found to be highly dependent on τ when τ 13 δ h in the basin bottom approaches to 0 1 indicating that the fluctuating water table has limited effect on the hydraulic head in the deep part when τ 0 013 δ h in the basin bottom approaches to 0 5 indicating that the fluctuating water table has strong effect on the hydraulic head in the deep part under the quasi steady state condition if we assume that the thickness of the basin is infinite i e z 0 δ h can be expressed as 14 δ h x z 1 cos m π x exp m π z 2 this equation confirms that δ h approaches to 0 5 in the basin bottom when τ is small fig 5 shows the profiles of δ h through a divide profile a and a valley profile b which clearly illustrates the different patterns of vertical changes in hydraulic head fluctuation in water table highs and lows note that although only one divide and one valley are labeled in each of the basins in fig 4 the pattern of vertical changes in hydraulic head fluctuation for each of the four divides is the same and that for each of the four valleys is also the same for the profiles in the divide δ h decreases nonlinearly from 1 to a threshold dependent on τ fig 5a for the profiles in the valleys δ h increases nonlinearly from 0 to a threshold when τ is small and increases nonlinearly from 0 to a maximum value and then decrease to a threshold when τ is large fig 5a the τ dependent pattern of vertical change in δ h in the valley is a result of fact that the head perturbation in the top boundary is hard to penetrate to the basin bottom under large τ according to eq 14 based on the quasi steady state model δ h increases almost exponentially from 0 to 0 5 in the valley and decreases almost negative exponentially from 1 to 0 5 in the valley fig 5 also shows that when τ is as small as 0 13 the profiles of δ h in both the divide and the valley coincide with those with τ 0 013 and ss 0 this confirms that when τ is small the quasi steady state model could be employed to characterize the transient behavior of groundwater flow 3 3 the evolution of zones with flowing wells based on the concept of gravity driven groundwater flow freeze and cherry 1979 proposed that flowing wells could develop in the discharge area of a groundwater basin without the existence of confining beds in the field the development of seasonal flowing wells or seasonal variations of head or flux in flowing wells are quite common therefore it is interesting to relate the dynamic phenomena of flowing wells to the periodically changing flow systems wang et al 2015 defined head exceeding land surface hf i e the hydraulic head at a specific point in the flow domain minus the corresponding elevation of land surface to delineate the flowing conditions in basins flowing wells could develop in the zones with positive hf but not in zones with negative hf to examine the transient behavior of zones with flowing wells in the tόthian basin we calculate the h f by using the following equation 15 h f x z t h x z t z s x where z s x is the dimensionless form of zs by substituting eq 11a into 15 we obtain the evolution of h f in the homogeneous and isotropic tόthian basin under different τ fig 6 the contour lines with h f 0 which constitute the boundaries between zones with flowing wells and non flowing wells are in bold there are four zones with flowing wells labeled as a b c and d which are all located in the topographic lows of the basin fig 6 shows that the response of zones with flowing wells to the periodically fluctuating water table is also dependent on τ when τ is small the highest water table at the initial time leads to the maximum area of zones with flowing wells as well as the highest h f in each zone with flowing wells fig 6a2 as α decreases the area of zones with flowing wells shrinks and when α 0 the lowest water table without local undulation results in the minimum area of zones with flowing wells even disappearance of zones with flowing wells c and d in the upper reaches of the basin fig 6c2 as the water table rises zones with flowing wells c and d will appear again fig 6d2 similar to the phenomenon of dependence of flow field on α t the distribution of zones with flowing wells is also dependent on α t instead of t when τ is large the distribution of h f lags to the changing water table and is more complicated than that under the quasi steady state condition due to the long response time to the fluctuating water table the largest area of zones with flowing wells occurs at t 0 15p with α 0 8 fig 6b1 instead of at t 0 with α 1 with the highest water table fig 6a1 as α decreases further the decreasing water table also leads to shrinkage of zones with flowing wells at t 0 5p with α 0 although water table is the lowest the area of zones with flowing wells does not reach the minimum fig 6c1 due to the time lag the area of zones with flowing wells decreases further even though water table rises after t 0 5p at t 0 65p with α 0 2 fig 6d1 the area of zones with flowing wells reaches its minimum and zones with flowing wells c and d still exist as water table rises further the area of zones with flowing wells increases with α therefore the distribution of zones with flowing wells is dependent not only on α t but also on t due to the lag of response to the fluctuating water table inside the basin which differs from the situation with small τ the dependences of zones with flowing wells and h f on α t well explains the existence of seasonal flowing wells in arid regions which could not flow out in seasons with insignificant undulation of water table 3 4 the evolution of recharge discharge fluxes at the top boundary according to freeze and witherspoon 1968 the vertical flux across the top boundary q z k h z based on the steady state flow field induced by the mean water table undulation represents spatial distribution of recharge discharge flux at the land surface in the steady state case the total recharge flux equals the total discharge flux in transient cases the recharge discharge flux should include not only the vertical flux across the top boundary but also the changes in water storage as reflected in the fluctuating water table zijl 1999 mathematically the recharge discharge flux r at the top boundary can be expressed as 16 r s y h t q z where sy is specific yield in the shallow part of the basin a positive r indicates recharge at the land surface while a negative r indicates groundwater discharge assuming that specific yield equals 0 1 we show the change in dimensionless recharge discharge flux r r khl with time in fig 7 a and b when t equals 0 0 5p and p r equals qz because h t equals 0 during the process of water table decline r is smaller than qz while during the process of water table rise r is larger than qz fig 7a and b also show that the distribution of recharge and discharge areas changes with time at t 0 the distribution of recharge and discharge areas is associated with water table highs and lows as water table declines most parts of the top boundary behave as discharge areas as water table rises the area of recharge areas is greater than that of discharge areas the evolution of total recharge flux versus total discharge flux during a period is shown in fig 7c it is clear that groundwater discharge dominates during the process of water table decline while groundwater recharge dominates during the process of water table rise which is in accordance with the relationship between water table change and groundwater recharge discharge healy and cook 2002 4 conclusions periodically changing water table is a widely observed phenomenon in the field to study its impact on basin scale groundwater flow the combination of a time independent regional undulation and a time dependent local undulation is used to represent the fluctuating water table in a tόthian basin following vandenberg s 1980 study on transient flow in a unit basin we derived the analytical solution of hydraulic head under periodically changing water table and found two critical parameters z 0 l and τ largely controls the spatial distribution of transient hydraulic head thus the evolution of nested flow systems when τ is small enough hydraulic head distribution is the same as that obtained by the analytical solution under the quasi steady state condition when τ is large the nested flow systems distort severely due to the effect of specific storage in each period internal stagnation points move in a loop which is non enclosed near the land surface due to disappearance of internal stagnation points in the shallow part and the size of stagnant zones changes greatly as τ deceases the hydraulic head perturbation can diffuse easier and the non enclosed loop becomes narrower when τ is small enough internal stagnation points move nearly vertically therefore in arid climate the nested flow systems could not necessarily develop even if the undulation of topography is significant and the stagnant zones which are critical to accumulation of transported matter might be unstable because the water table has the largest magnitude of fluctuation in the divides and is fixed in the valleys the magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation decreases with the distance away from the divide the magnitude of head fluctuation is also found to be depth dependent throughout the basin which increases to a threshold near the valley and decreases to a threshold near the divide the threshold value of the relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation in the deep part of the basin is found to be highly dependent on τ the threshold value approaches to 0 5 when τ is 0 013 or 0 13 i e approximates to the quasi steady state condition and approaches to 0 1 when τ is 13 this indicates that a high τ could lead to a less fluctuating hydraulic head field but a more fluctuating flow field we also examined the development of zones with flowing wells under periodically changing water table when τ is small the instant response of hydraulic head leads to instant response of zones with flowing wells to the fluctuating water table the zones with flowing wells reach their maximum areas when water table is the highest and reach their minimum even disappear when water table is the lowest when τ is large the lag of hydraulic head response to the fluctuating water table leads to a complicated evolution of zones with flowing wells the zones with flowing wells reach their maximum when water table declines from α 1 to α 0 8 and reach their minimum when water table rises from α 0 to α 0 2 these findings well explain the development of seasonal flowing wells in the field and could provide guidelines for well drilling in large scale basins in our model of transient groundwater flow controlled by the time dependent specified head top boundary we found groundwater discharge dominates during water table decline and groundwater recharge dominates during water table rise this is in agreement with field observations of the relationship between the fluctuating water table and groundwater recharge discharge therefore although fluxes across the top boundary have not been assigned the spatial and temporal variabilities in recharge and discharge fluxes at the top boundary have been implicitly accounted for acknowledgement this study is supported by the national young talents support program the national natural science foundation of china 41522205 the
