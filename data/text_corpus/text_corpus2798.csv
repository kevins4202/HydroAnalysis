13990,this study investigated the electrokinetic ek treatment of cr from chromite ore processing residue copr using rhamnolipid as the electrolyte chemical fractions were analyzed to better understand the transformation and migration of cr from copr with different electrolytes and time the results showed the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ was enhanced to 90 04 with a concentration of rhamnolipid at 15 g l and the total cr increased to 19 65 at 20 g l the above values are higher than 65 74 and 9 52 when using deionized water respectively after the ek treatment the concentrations of cr in the form of exchangeable exc carbonates car fe mn oxides fm and residual res decreased while the organic matter oc form increased rhamnolipid greatly promoted a transformation between the chemical fractions and the migration of cr the transformation was most effective on the third day and the removal efficiency gradually increased until reaching the best result on the fifth day however a further extension of time was detrimental to the transformation and migration of cr after the controlled experiment the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr decreased as the cr in the high risk fraction was effectively removed keywords chromite ore processing residue rhamnolipid electrolyte chemical fraction environmental toxicity 1 introduction chromite ore processing residue copr is classified as hazardous waste due to its high concentration of chromium cr and cr leachate from copr especially cr ⅵ is toxic and carcinogenic which is a great threat to human bodies and the environment 1 2 it has been reported that cr is the third most important toxic pollution problem among the top 10 worldwide in japan about 14 of the contaminated sites exceeding environmental quality standards are polluted by cr ⅵ and approximately 0 21 of arable sites in china are abandoned because of serious cr pollution 3 the high risk to human health and the environment is usually linked to the excessive disposal and improper treatment of copr 4 5 therefore effective techniques should be used to treat copr by lowering the highly soluble and unstable fraction of cr before disposal or recycling as a secondary material recently many techniques such as physical separation chemical washing solidification stabilization and ek remediation have been used to treat heavy metals in soil sludge and residue 6 7 in particular ek remediation capable of removing heavy metals for in situ treatment is believed to be a promising technique 8 9 in the ek process the anode generates h and the cathode generates oh as a function of water electrolysis which results in a ph decrease in the anolyte and a ph increase in the catholyte 5 10 in general low ph leads to the desorption of heavy metal ions while high ph leads to precipitation 3 interestingly cr ⅵ desorption is significant at high ph whereas cr ⅲ desorption is significant at low ph 11 cr ⅲ is relatively stable with low toxicity whereas cr ⅵ is highly mobile and toxic cr ⅵ and cr ⅲ can be converted into each other under different conditions 3 therefore the removal of cr from the copr is not easy and the effects of ph and ion migration during the ek treatment of cr need further investigation to improve the removal effectiveness many applications have been conducted including acid pretreatments 12 ion selective membranes 13 different electrolytes 14 15 and approaching electrodes 16 17 and so on 8 18 these methods may improve the removal of heavy metals but processing costs and high power consumption are often required during the process moreover additional chemical reagents may result in secondary pollution 10 in addition the removal efficiency is always used to evaluate the removal capacity of heavy metals which is unable to reflect the process of removal and the environmental toxicity of remaining heavy metals thus alternatives that are environmentally friendly inexpensive and biodegradable are urgently needed to improve the removal efficiency and studies on effective evaluation indicators and potential environmental toxicity of remaining heavy metals are imperative it has been demonstrated that applications of biosurfactants for water and sediment treatment are promising due to their strong surface activity favorable biodegradation low toxicity and ecological safety 19 comparing with other surfactants biosurfactants possess larger molecular structures and more functional groups which can form micelles effectively solubilizing dispersing and desorbing heavy metals and organic compounds 20 21 especially rhamnolipid is considered as a representative biosurfactant which has proved to reduce the solid liquid surface tension complex heavy metals and further increase the removal rate of pollutants 19 20 22 although many previous studies have indicated that biosurfactants are widely used individually in soil washing or coupled with other chelating agents e g citric acid and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta 21 23 few scientific papers have reported rhamnolipid as an electrolyte in the ek process to obtain better removal performance permeable reactive barrier prb technology was employed which is an emerging in situ remediation technique widely used in groundwater and soil treatment the prb is an artificial medium of reactive materials and contaminants are removed or degraded by reacting with reactive materials as they go through the system 24 zeolite is a good adsorbent playing a major role in water purification acidified zeolite possesses larger pore structures which can enhance the function of adsorption ion exchange and control of ph in alkaline conditions to some extent 25 thus acidified zeolite is selected as the reactive material in the prb although many studies have investigated the ek treatment of heavy metals both rhamnolipid and acidified zeolite have rarely been applied to enhance removal to effectively evaluate the removal process understanding the transformation of fractions and the migration process of heavy metals is necessary thus electrode capture ability eca is proposed to describe the ability of electrodes trapping heavy metals which considers the chemical fractions of heavy metals in the solid liquid system during the ek experiment moreover the potential environmental toxicity of heavy metals cannot be presented by the concentration of heavy metals since it is not merely related to the total concentration but also to the chemical speciation 26 28 therefore chemical fractions may be available to assess the environmental toxicity of heavy metals there are few systematic studies on this topic in this study rhamnolipid was selected as the electrolyte and acidified zeolite was used as the reactive material in the prb the objectives of the study are to investigate the transformation of chemical fractions and migration of cr to better understand the influences of rhamnolipid during the ek treatment as listed below 1 the factors affecting ph and electric current 2 cr ⅵ and total cr removal with different electrolytes and time 3 the variations in the cr fractions in different sections the transformation of chemical fractions and the migration process of cr with respect to time and 4 the eca and remaining environmental toxicity of cr 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and pretreatment the copr samples were obtained from a chromic salt production enterprise located in chongqing china the samples were dried and followed by grinding and sieving through a 200 mesh sieve 75 μm before analysis then the sieved samples were collected at room temperature table 1 shows the elemental composition of the copr determined by x ray fluorescence xrf and the main characteristics of copr are summarized in table 2 the xrf is a qualitative and semi quantitative analysis method to determine the elements and the relative content of each element in copr while the concentration of total cr in table 2 is quantitatively determined by a general method thus the data in table 2 are confirmed to use in subsequent experiments 100 mesh natural zeolite purchased from hengxin water purification co ltd henan china was acidified by 10 nitric acid for 3 h 29 the copr samples were pretreated with 1 2 mol l nitric acid in a solid to liquid ratio of 3 1 mass volume for 12 h based on the results of a single factor experiment regarding concentration 2 2 rhamnolipid characteristics the rhamnolipid used in the experiments was purchased from xi an ruijie biotechnology co ltd shanxi china it was a brown liquid with a purity of 80 2 and the critical micelle concentration cmc of rhamnolipid was 0 03 g l it was mainly composed of rhac10c10 c26h48o9 504 g mol and rharhac10c10 c32h58o13 650 g mol and the structures of rhamnolipid mixtures were shown in fig 1 19 2 3 experimental procedures the setup fig 2 used in this study was made of plexiglass and comprised of three compartments a copr compartment l w h 10 cm 7 cm 8 cm and two electrode compartments l w h 8 cm 7 cm 8 cm a graphite electrode l w h 8 cm 1 cm 8 cm was used as the anode while a stainless steel electrode l w h 8 cm 2 mm 8 cm was used as the cathode a dc power supply was connected to electrodes at specific constant voltage gradients via an aluminum wire two pieces of 200 mesh nylon filter paper were placed between the sample cell and the electrode compartments to avoid residue leaking all experiments were conducted at room temperature and under a constant voltage gradient 1 5 vcm 1 the controlled experimental conditions are shown in table 3 in addition different concentrations of rhamnolipid 5 g l 10 g l 15 g l 20 g l 25 g l were used as electrolytes and investigated to determine the effect on cr removal based on the optimum concentration of rhamnolipid 15 g l different durations 1 d 3 d 5 d 7 d 9 d was carried out to explore the transformation of fractions and the migration of cr each sample cell was filled with approximately 300 g of pretreated copr and was equally divided into three sections from the anode to the cathode t1 t2 t3 a prb filled with 10 g of acidified zeolite was placed between t2 and t3 at the end of each experiment the treated copr was removed from the reactor and each section was analyzed for ph cr ⅵ and total cr concentrations leaching toxicity of cr ⅵ and chemical fractions of cr the removal efficiency of cr and leaching efficiency of cr ⅵ are calculated according to the following formula 1 1 r c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 and c g kg are concentrations of cr before and after the ek treatment respectively 2 4 analytical method the ph of copr was determined by us epa method 9045d soil and waste ph and was measured by a ph meter phs 3c leica china the electric current was determined by a dc power supply ps 1503d longwei a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas aa 6300c japan was used to measure the concentration of cr ⅵ and total cr the difference between cr ⅵ and total cr is the concentration of cr ⅲ the leaching toxicity of cr ⅵ was extracted according to the chinese standard hj t299 2007 solid waste leaching toxicity of sulfuric and nitric acid method and was analyzed by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 2100 japan chemical fractions of cr from copr before and after the experiment were determined by tessier s sequential extraction method 30 five chemical fractions can be obtained exc containing exchangeable and soluble fractions car tightly adsorbed pollutants associated with carbonates fm contaminants combining with fe mn oxides oc associated with readily oxidizable solids or compounds involving organic matter and res strongly bound complexes the sequential extraction procedure was as follows step 1 8 ml of 1 mol l mgcl2 ph 7 25 c agitated for 1 h step 2 8 ml of 1 mol l naoac ph 5 25 c agitated for 8 h step 3 20 ml of 0 04 mol l nh2oh hcl in 25 v v hac 96 3 c agitated for 4 h step 4 3 ml of 0 02 mol l hno3 and 5 ml of 30 h2o2 ph 2 85 2 c intermittently agitated for 2 h adding 3 ml of 30 h2o2 ph 2 85 2 c intermittently agitated for 3 h 25 c adding 5 ml of 3 2 mol l nh4oac in 20 hno4 diluted to 20 ml agitated for 30 min step 5 residual from step 4 was digested with an hcl hno3 hf hclo4 mixture at each step the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 r min for 10 min and then the supernatant was filtered and measured the residue obtained was rinsed by deionized water and was used in the next step 2 5 eca and environmental toxicity 2 5 1 eca the ek treatment is a dynamic process in the solid liquid system which contains the transformation of heavy metal fractions ion exchange and migration of heavy metal ions eca is introduced to describe the above three processes from the sample areas to the electrode chambers the eca is determined by the transformation ability of chemical fractions exchange ability and migration ability of cr which are quantified by the changes in concentration of the chemical fractions including the transformation amount ta g kg exchange amount ea g kg and migration amount ma g kg respectively the specific formulas are as follows 2 t a s δ m s 3 t a e x c δ m s where δ m s is the difference in cr speciation res oc fm and car in the sample area before and after the ek treatment a positive value indicates the transformation from other forms to this form and vice versa for the transformation of this form to other forms 4 e a δ m s m e x c 0 where m e x c 0 is the initial amount of exc form before the ek treatment 5 m a δ m t where δ m t is the total decrease in the cr concentration after the ek treatment 2 5 2 environmental toxicity of cr previous studies have demonstrated that the remaining toxicity of heavy metals is closely related to chemical fractions 26 27 during the ek treatment the transformation of cr fractions is mainly from more difficult extraction forms to easier extraction forms however easier extraction forms are connected with higher environmental toxicity which means that the transformation may increase the environmental toxicity after the ek tests 31 generally eca can be used to qualitatively describe the environmental toxicity of cr the ma is greater than the ta and is equivalent to the ea implying that the high risk form of cr can be effectively removed thus the environmental toxicity of cr from copr will decrease after the ek test otherwise fractions of cr with high risk will accumulate in the copr and the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr may increase 3 results and discussion 3 1 controlled experiment 3 1 1 electric current and ph the electric current changed with time is demonstrated in fig 3 the electric current in ek1 3 had a similar variation which showed a sharp increase during the first 12 h and gradually decreased afterwards in the beginning the current was low because of the small number of free ions then the current increased to a maximum value possibly because the mobile ions in the electrolyte and the dissolved metal ions in the sample zone migrated under an electric field after 48 h the current slowly decreased and stabilized because the cations and anions migrated to the cathode and anode respectively moreover the electrolyte consumption non conductive solid particles and metal hydroxides precipitation also led to a current reduction 3 a slight fluctuation occurred after 48 h was due to the injection of electrolyte per day in addition the maximum current was found in the order of ek3 ek2 ek1 which indicated that the prb filled with acidified zeolite improved the electric current to some extent besides ek3 with rhamnolipid as the electrolyte had a higher current than ek1 and ek2 which was attributed to the increased migration of charged particles promoted by rhamnolipid generally rhamnolipid can enhance the desorption of heavy metal ions and form rhamnolipid complexes that can hold the electric current 21 22 fig 4 indicates the distribution of electrolyte and the residue ph after the ek treatment the ph in ek1 3 had a similar variation in the beginning the ph of copr was approximately 5 40 and the ph of the electrolyte was 8 10 in ek1 2 and 7 97 in ek3 after the experiments the ph of the anolyte and t1 near the anode dropped to under 2 0 while the ph of the catholyte and t3 near the cathode increased to over 13 0 because the electrolysis of water generated h and oh at the anode and cathode respectively migrating to the opposite electrode 10 as shown in fig 4 the ph of t2 in ek2 and ek3 was lower than that in ek1 showing that the acidified zeolite controlled the ph of t2 to some extent moreover compared with ek1 and ek2 the ph of ek3 was lower in both the t1 t3 regions and the electrolyte due to the released h from special functional groups cooh of rhamnolipid which neutralized the oh near the cathode and caused acidification near the anode 19 generally the ph of anolytes followed the order of ek1 ek2 ek3 and the ph of catholytes was ek2 ek1 ek3 while the current changed the tread of ek3 ek2 ek1 fig 3 which indicated that the current had a partial effect on the ph values during electrolysis in some ways the higher the current was the greater the intensity of electrolysis which resulted in more significant variations in the ph values of the anolyte and catholyte 3 2 removal of cr the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ total cr and leaching efficiency of cr ⅵ in the controlled experiment are recorded in table 4 the average removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ in ek1 3 were 65 74 69 18 and 90 03 respectively and the leaching efficiency improved from 63 62 to 88 95 the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ gradually increased from t1 to t3 in the ek1 3 experiments and the same trend was observed for the leaching efficiency indicating that the accumulation of cr ⅵ was at the maximum value in t1 this phenomenon was caused by cr ⅵ migrating towards the anode in the form of oxyanions e g cro4 2 cr2o7 2 hcro4 and accumulating near the anode 32 in addition the low ph near the anode could result in cr ⅵ adsorption thus hindering cr ⅵ migration which was also unfavorable for cr ⅵ removal 11 33 therefore the accumulation and adsorption of cr ⅵ near the anode caused a lower removal rate compared with the other sections the average removal efficiency of total cr in ek3 was significantly enhanced to 19 65 compared with ek1 9 52 and ek2 9 73 to some extent the prb filled with acidified zeolite was expected to release h near the cathode and adsorb heavy metal cations it can be observed in fig 4 and table 4 a lower ph and larger removal efficiency were achieved in ek2 compared with ek1 implying that the prb promoted the desorption and migration of cr for ek3 the highest removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr were obtained when rhamnolipid was used possibly because rhamnolipid could form micelles effectively reducing the interfacial tension improving the wettability and solubility of the residue and form rhamnolipid complexes 24 34 additionally rhamnolipid is an anionic surfactant with the ability to anion exchange and possesses the superiority of nonionic ones for instance low cmc and hydrophile lipophile features 35 the highest removal efficiency of total cr appeared to be near the anode for ek1 and ek2 and near the cathode for ek3 while the lowest removal rate occurred in the middle of the reaction chamber this was a result of electromigration and precipitation in the ek process firstly rhamnolipid complexes were negatively charged migrating towards the anode 19 which decreased the concentration of cr ⅲ near the cathode in addition the zeolite increased the migration resistance of cr ⅲ and the maximum accumulation in t2 may be due to the precipitation of cr ⅲ in alkaline conditions 33 the proportion of cr ⅵ in the total cr was 2 8 and 0 32 1 33 before and after the experiments respectively showing that cr mainly existed as cr ⅲ in the copr the concentration of cr ⅵ decreased by 1 04 1 42 g kg while the total cr decreased by 5 39 11 12 g kg from the data above it was not possible to determine whether the transformation between cr ⅲ and cr ⅵ occurred in the process since the content of cr ⅵ was quite low the removal of total cr was greatly dependent on cr ⅲ so the distribution of total cr was mainly attributed to the transport of different cr ⅲ fractions under an electric field 3 3 single factor experiments 3 3 1 effect of electrolyte concentration on removal efficiency fig 5 shows the removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr with different concentrations of rhamnolipid the removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr had a similar variation which increased to the maximum value and then decreased as the electrolyte concentration increased from 5 g l to 25 g l initially a gradual increase in removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr were obtained when the concentration was 5 15 g l a possible explanation is that the micelles produced by rhamnolipid gradually increase when the concentration is above cmc which is beneficial for heavy metal ions to directly incorporate into micelles or by metal bridging mechanisms thus reaching the goal of increasing wettability and migration ability 24 however 25 g l of rhamnolipid was detrimental to cr ⅵ and total cr removal possibly because micelle macromolecules aggregated in the system which blocked the pore channels and hindered the effective combination between micelles and cr resulting in a waste of resources 20 therefore 15 g l rhamnolipid was used as the optimal concentration based on the conservation of resources in the ek treatment of cr from copr in fact the mechanisms of rhamnolipid could be summarized in two aspects firstly rhamnolipid a kind of biosurfactant has hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups possessing larger molecular structures and ligand groups than other surfactants 19 36 thus rhamnolipid had significant surface activity and could replace bulk molecules with higher energy to reduce the free energy of the system 35 secondly micelles consisting of hydrophobic kernels and hydrophilic surfaces were formed in aqueous solution 37 the hydrophobic groups were able to wrap the non polar binding heavy metals into the hydrophobic kernel of the micelles and apparently promoted the transformation of hydrophobic compounds from the solid phase into the liquid phase 38 hydrophilic surfaces have hydrophilic groups carboxyl and hydroxyl which can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and hydrophilic groups 35 therefore the surface tension was reduced through the combination of forces in the opposite direction additionally enhancing the desorption and migration of heavy metals was obtained in the process 3 3 2 effect of time on removal efficiency fig 6 demonstrates the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ and total cr over a period of 1 9 d the removal efficiency of total cr increased to reach the maximum value of 19 22 within 5 d and then decreased while cr ⅵ increased to the highest removal ratio of 88 19 within 9 d the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ and total cr obviously increased in the first 5 d especially within 3 5 d which may be because rhamnolipid significantly promoted the transformation from difficult extraction fractions to highly soluble fractions and free ions effectively migrated to electrodes under an electric field nevertheless the decrease in total cr removal within 5 9 d may be due to the formation of a focusing phenomenon as oh generated by the electrolysis of water gradually increased besides the acidified zeolite was able to adsorb heavy metal ions until the adsorption equilibrium was obtained on approximately the fifth day 33 thus the time significantly affected cr removal and a time period of 5 d was the optimum condition for the ek treatment 3 4 distribution of cr chemical fractions 3 4 1 distribution of cr chemical fractions in the controlled experiment fig 7 shows the distribution of cr chemical fractions before and after the ek tests in the initial value about 66 of the cr existed in the form of res while the exc and car states were less than 7 in total after the nitric acid modification the res state was still the main form at approximately 65 the concentration of the car fraction decreased and obviously increased in the exc fraction accounting for 7 2 the above results indicated that acidification promoted the release of cr in the car form and was transformed to the exc form which was beneficial for cr removal through the ek treatment the changes in the fm and oc forms were not significant in summary heavy metal fractions were in dynamic equilibrium in the process of modification and the car fraction was transformed into the exc fraction 26 after the ek treatment the concentrations of cr chemical fractions followed the trend res fm oc car exc in ek1 3 most of the cr remained in the res state possibly because the cr of the res fraction was chemically stable and was not easily removed the concentrations of cr in the exc and car forms were very low the exc fraction was reduced to 0 05 0 63 g kg and the car fraction was reduced to 0 30 0 69 g kg moreover the concentration of cr in the form of oc increased by 0 60 5 12 g kg and the fm form decreased by 0 21 4 88 g kg furthermore the res form in some sections clearly decreased which demonstrated that cr in the form of res was transformed to the oc form during the ek treatment the above results provided important evidence for the transformation of heavy metal speciation compared with ek1 and ek2 the res fraction significantly decreased and the fm fraction increased in ek3 demonstrating that more cr of the res fraction was transformed to the fm fraction consequently the removal efficiency of cr in ek3 increased by approximately 10 showing that rhamnolipid effectively enhanced cr removal and the transformation of the res form played a significant role as shown in fig 7 the res fraction was mainly transformed into fm and oc under an electric field thus the transformation between chemical fractions was mainly from a more difficult extraction state to an easier extraction state 3 4 2 transformation of chemical fractions and the migration process of cr over time to explore the specific transformation of chemical fractions and the migration process of cr during the ek treatment the distribution of cr fractions is shown over time in fig 8 a the distribution of cr fractions followed the trend res fm oc car exc after the ek treatment the cr of the exc and car fractions decreased significantly with values of 1 51 2 20 g kg and 0 66 0 89 g kg respectively the concentrations of cr in the form of oc clearly increased while the fractions of res and fm decreased overall demonstrating that a transformation occurred between the cr fractions the transformation was most effective on the third day since the maximum variation of fractions was observed as time went by the best result for the removal efficiency gradually increased until the fifth day after which the distribution of cr fractions remained constant in summary time had a significant influence on the transformation of chemical fractions and cr removal fig 8 b f indicates the concentrations of cr in exc car fm oc res fractions in the t1t3 regions over time the changes of cr in the exc form are shown in fig 8 b the cr of the exc fraction decreased in the first 5 d and maintained a low constant possibly because the amount of the exc form to the electrode chamber was greater than that of other forms to the exc form the concentrations of cr rapidly decreased in t2 and t3 but slightly decreased in t1 within 1 d showing that the cr of the exc form migrated to the anode from the cathode thus it could be concluded that the cr of the exc fraction mainly existed as cr ⅵ moreover within 1 5 d the cr of the exc form in t1 decreased gradually since it migrated to the anode region under an electric field in summary the cr of the exc fraction mainly existed as cr ⅵ migrating to the anode and accumulated near the anode which agreed with the previous analysis fig 8 c demonstrates the changes of cr in the form of car over time the concentrations of cr decreased significantly within 1 d possibly because the car fraction was further released after acidification and was transformed into other fractions however the cr of the car form in t1 increased within 1 3 d the possible reason is a large number of other fractions were transformed to the car form and the transformation mainly occurred at a low ph at the end of the third day the concentration of cr in t1 rapidly decreased since the structure of the car form was destroyed by h generated by the electrolysis of water in t1 and similar findings have been reported in previous studies 39 moreover the car form in t2 and t3 slightly increased 3 d later a possible explanation is that the high ph near the cathode increased the adsorption of cr 11 it was concluded that the concentrations of the car fraction were significantly affected by ph variations the changes of cr in the fm fraction are indicated in fig 8 d which shows a fluctuation over time the concentration of cr in t1 increased constantly within 3 d while decreasing and stabilizing in t2 and t3 which may be due to the cr ⅵ of the fm fraction and rhamnolipid complexes migrating from the cathode to the anode within 3 5 d the concentrations of cr increased slightly in both t2 and t3 this phenomenon might be caused by the transformation from the res form to the fm form as discussed earlier however the concentration of cr in t1 decreased rapidly as the cr ⅵ migrated out of the sample cell and the cr of the fm form was transformed to more easily extracted fractions in the later part of the experiment all three sections showed a similar trend increasing first and then stabilizing therefore the transformation from more difficult extraction fractions into easier extraction fractions and the migration of cr were consistent under an electric field fig 8 e shows the distribution of cr in the form of oc over time as discussed earlier the res form was transformed into the oc form and the transformation mainly occurred in t1 possibly because more ions were desorbed and more physicochemical reactions occurred in acidic conditions finally the concentrations of cr in the oc fraction were higher than the initial value in t1 t3 as the rhamnolipid was able to transform cr into the oc fraction by the formation of complexes or micelles 36 fig 8 f shows the changes of cr in the res fraction over time as time went by concentrations of cr in the res form decreased gradually demonstrating that the res form was transformed into other fractions moreover a gradually increasing removal efficiency of cr was observed in fig 6 within 1 5 d the results above implied that the removal efficiency of cr was concerned with the transformation of the res form after the seventh day the concentration of the res fraction slightly increased however a decrease in the removal efficiency of cr was also indicated in fig 6 the above results showed that a further extension of time was detrimental to the transformation of the res fraction and cr removal thus the transformation from the res fraction into other fractions was a key factor in promoting the removal efficiency of cr in the ek treatment 3 5 eca and environmental toxicity of the remaining cr 3 5 1 eca table 5 shows the eca of cr in the ek treatment including ta ea and ma as can be observed the concentrations of cr in the form of res fm and car decreased while the oc fraction increased after the ek experiment as discussed earlier chemical fractions of cr were transformed into each other under an electric field while the exc fraction mainly migrated in the liquid phase rather than transformed to other fractions the ta of the exc fraction in ek1 3 was 2 87 3 04 and 8 26 g kg respectively indicating that the rhamnolipid used as electrolyte significantly enhanced the ta in the solid phase in addition the ma was equivalent to the ea in all three experiments demonstrating that the ea in the liquid phase was almost removed the larger the ta of the exc fraction was the larger the ma of cr implying that the restrictive factor of cr removal was the transformation between chemical speciation in solid phase rather than the migration in the liquid phase especially the transformation of the res fraction 3 5 2 environmental toxicity of the remaining cr the environmental toxicity of cr was closely related to the concentration and speciation of cr 26 27 the exc fraction of cr mainly existed as highly toxic cr ⅵ which is directly toxic to the environment 22 the res fraction of cr had low potential toxicity to the environment as it mainly existed as cr ⅲ which is relatively stable and low toxic the toxicity of cr in the form of car fm and oc was between the exc and res fractions 22 nevertheless the cr of the car fm oc and res fractions were able to transform to the exc form 26 as can be observed in table 5 the ma was greater than the ta in the exc fraction in ek1 3 which showed that the exc fraction of cr transformed from other fractions was removed besides the ma was equivalent to the ea demonstrating that cr in the highly toxic fraction was effectively removed and that the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr was reduced compared with ek1 and ek2 the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr did not increase as the removal efficiency was significantly promoted in ek3 which indicated that the enhanced electrolyte effectively optimized the ek treatment of cr 4 conclusions the rhamnolipid used as electrolyte effectively enhanced the cr ⅵ and total cr removal efficiency compared with unenhanced experiments most of the exc and car fractions and part of the fm and res fractions were removed after the ek experiment the transformation between chemical fractions was mainly from a more difficult extraction form to an easier extraction form under an electric field rhamnolipid significantly promoted the transformation of chemical fractions and the limiting factor of cr removal was the transformation of chemical fractions in the solid phase rather than the migration in the liquid phase especially the transformation of the res form in addition the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr decreased after the ek treatment as the exc fraction with direct toxicity to the environment was effectively removed declaration of competing interest this research did not receive any specific grant funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors acknowledgements this

13990,this study investigated the electrokinetic ek treatment of cr from chromite ore processing residue copr using rhamnolipid as the electrolyte chemical fractions were analyzed to better understand the transformation and migration of cr from copr with different electrolytes and time the results showed the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ was enhanced to 90 04 with a concentration of rhamnolipid at 15 g l and the total cr increased to 19 65 at 20 g l the above values are higher than 65 74 and 9 52 when using deionized water respectively after the ek treatment the concentrations of cr in the form of exchangeable exc carbonates car fe mn oxides fm and residual res decreased while the organic matter oc form increased rhamnolipid greatly promoted a transformation between the chemical fractions and the migration of cr the transformation was most effective on the third day and the removal efficiency gradually increased until reaching the best result on the fifth day however a further extension of time was detrimental to the transformation and migration of cr after the controlled experiment the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr decreased as the cr in the high risk fraction was effectively removed keywords chromite ore processing residue rhamnolipid electrolyte chemical fraction environmental toxicity 1 introduction chromite ore processing residue copr is classified as hazardous waste due to its high concentration of chromium cr and cr leachate from copr especially cr ⅵ is toxic and carcinogenic which is a great threat to human bodies and the environment 1 2 it has been reported that cr is the third most important toxic pollution problem among the top 10 worldwide in japan about 14 of the contaminated sites exceeding environmental quality standards are polluted by cr ⅵ and approximately 0 21 of arable sites in china are abandoned because of serious cr pollution 3 the high risk to human health and the environment is usually linked to the excessive disposal and improper treatment of copr 4 5 therefore effective techniques should be used to treat copr by lowering the highly soluble and unstable fraction of cr before disposal or recycling as a secondary material recently many techniques such as physical separation chemical washing solidification stabilization and ek remediation have been used to treat heavy metals in soil sludge and residue 6 7 in particular ek remediation capable of removing heavy metals for in situ treatment is believed to be a promising technique 8 9 in the ek process the anode generates h and the cathode generates oh as a function of water electrolysis which results in a ph decrease in the anolyte and a ph increase in the catholyte 5 10 in general low ph leads to the desorption of heavy metal ions while high ph leads to precipitation 3 interestingly cr ⅵ desorption is significant at high ph whereas cr ⅲ desorption is significant at low ph 11 cr ⅲ is relatively stable with low toxicity whereas cr ⅵ is highly mobile and toxic cr ⅵ and cr ⅲ can be converted into each other under different conditions 3 therefore the removal of cr from the copr is not easy and the effects of ph and ion migration during the ek treatment of cr need further investigation to improve the removal effectiveness many applications have been conducted including acid pretreatments 12 ion selective membranes 13 different electrolytes 14 15 and approaching electrodes 16 17 and so on 8 18 these methods may improve the removal of heavy metals but processing costs and high power consumption are often required during the process moreover additional chemical reagents may result in secondary pollution 10 in addition the removal efficiency is always used to evaluate the removal capacity of heavy metals which is unable to reflect the process of removal and the environmental toxicity of remaining heavy metals thus alternatives that are environmentally friendly inexpensive and biodegradable are urgently needed to improve the removal efficiency and studies on effective evaluation indicators and potential environmental toxicity of remaining heavy metals are imperative it has been demonstrated that applications of biosurfactants for water and sediment treatment are promising due to their strong surface activity favorable biodegradation low toxicity and ecological safety 19 comparing with other surfactants biosurfactants possess larger molecular structures and more functional groups which can form micelles effectively solubilizing dispersing and desorbing heavy metals and organic compounds 20 21 especially rhamnolipid is considered as a representative biosurfactant which has proved to reduce the solid liquid surface tension complex heavy metals and further increase the removal rate of pollutants 19 20 22 although many previous studies have indicated that biosurfactants are widely used individually in soil washing or coupled with other chelating agents e g citric acid and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta 21 23 few scientific papers have reported rhamnolipid as an electrolyte in the ek process to obtain better removal performance permeable reactive barrier prb technology was employed which is an emerging in situ remediation technique widely used in groundwater and soil treatment the prb is an artificial medium of reactive materials and contaminants are removed or degraded by reacting with reactive materials as they go through the system 24 zeolite is a good adsorbent playing a major role in water purification acidified zeolite possesses larger pore structures which can enhance the function of adsorption ion exchange and control of ph in alkaline conditions to some extent 25 thus acidified zeolite is selected as the reactive material in the prb although many studies have investigated the ek treatment of heavy metals both rhamnolipid and acidified zeolite have rarely been applied to enhance removal to effectively evaluate the removal process understanding the transformation of fractions and the migration process of heavy metals is necessary thus electrode capture ability eca is proposed to describe the ability of electrodes trapping heavy metals which considers the chemical fractions of heavy metals in the solid liquid system during the ek experiment moreover the potential environmental toxicity of heavy metals cannot be presented by the concentration of heavy metals since it is not merely related to the total concentration but also to the chemical speciation 26 28 therefore chemical fractions may be available to assess the environmental toxicity of heavy metals there are few systematic studies on this topic in this study rhamnolipid was selected as the electrolyte and acidified zeolite was used as the reactive material in the prb the objectives of the study are to investigate the transformation of chemical fractions and migration of cr to better understand the influences of rhamnolipid during the ek treatment as listed below 1 the factors affecting ph and electric current 2 cr ⅵ and total cr removal with different electrolytes and time 3 the variations in the cr fractions in different sections the transformation of chemical fractions and the migration process of cr with respect to time and 4 the eca and remaining environmental toxicity of cr 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and pretreatment the copr samples were obtained from a chromic salt production enterprise located in chongqing china the samples were dried and followed by grinding and sieving through a 200 mesh sieve 75 μm before analysis then the sieved samples were collected at room temperature table 1 shows the elemental composition of the copr determined by x ray fluorescence xrf and the main characteristics of copr are summarized in table 2 the xrf is a qualitative and semi quantitative analysis method to determine the elements and the relative content of each element in copr while the concentration of total cr in table 2 is quantitatively determined by a general method thus the data in table 2 are confirmed to use in subsequent experiments 100 mesh natural zeolite purchased from hengxin water purification co ltd henan china was acidified by 10 nitric acid for 3 h 29 the copr samples were pretreated with 1 2 mol l nitric acid in a solid to liquid ratio of 3 1 mass volume for 12 h based on the results of a single factor experiment regarding concentration 2 2 rhamnolipid characteristics the rhamnolipid used in the experiments was purchased from xi an ruijie biotechnology co ltd shanxi china it was a brown liquid with a purity of 80 2 and the critical micelle concentration cmc of rhamnolipid was 0 03 g l it was mainly composed of rhac10c10 c26h48o9 504 g mol and rharhac10c10 c32h58o13 650 g mol and the structures of rhamnolipid mixtures were shown in fig 1 19 2 3 experimental procedures the setup fig 2 used in this study was made of plexiglass and comprised of three compartments a copr compartment l w h 10 cm 7 cm 8 cm and two electrode compartments l w h 8 cm 7 cm 8 cm a graphite electrode l w h 8 cm 1 cm 8 cm was used as the anode while a stainless steel electrode l w h 8 cm 2 mm 8 cm was used as the cathode a dc power supply was connected to electrodes at specific constant voltage gradients via an aluminum wire two pieces of 200 mesh nylon filter paper were placed between the sample cell and the electrode compartments to avoid residue leaking all experiments were conducted at room temperature and under a constant voltage gradient 1 5 vcm 1 the controlled experimental conditions are shown in table 3 in addition different concentrations of rhamnolipid 5 g l 10 g l 15 g l 20 g l 25 g l were used as electrolytes and investigated to determine the effect on cr removal based on the optimum concentration of rhamnolipid 15 g l different durations 1 d 3 d 5 d 7 d 9 d was carried out to explore the transformation of fractions and the migration of cr each sample cell was filled with approximately 300 g of pretreated copr and was equally divided into three sections from the anode to the cathode t1 t2 t3 a prb filled with 10 g of acidified zeolite was placed between t2 and t3 at the end of each experiment the treated copr was removed from the reactor and each section was analyzed for ph cr ⅵ and total cr concentrations leaching toxicity of cr ⅵ and chemical fractions of cr the removal efficiency of cr and leaching efficiency of cr ⅵ are calculated according to the following formula 1 1 r c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 and c g kg are concentrations of cr before and after the ek treatment respectively 2 4 analytical method the ph of copr was determined by us epa method 9045d soil and waste ph and was measured by a ph meter phs 3c leica china the electric current was determined by a dc power supply ps 1503d longwei a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas aa 6300c japan was used to measure the concentration of cr ⅵ and total cr the difference between cr ⅵ and total cr is the concentration of cr ⅲ the leaching toxicity of cr ⅵ was extracted according to the chinese standard hj t299 2007 solid waste leaching toxicity of sulfuric and nitric acid method and was analyzed by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 2100 japan chemical fractions of cr from copr before and after the experiment were determined by tessier s sequential extraction method 30 five chemical fractions can be obtained exc containing exchangeable and soluble fractions car tightly adsorbed pollutants associated with carbonates fm contaminants combining with fe mn oxides oc associated with readily oxidizable solids or compounds involving organic matter and res strongly bound complexes the sequential extraction procedure was as follows step

to 20 ml agitated for 30 min step 5 residual from step 4 was digested with an hcl hno3 hf hclo4 mixture at each step the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 r min for 10 min and then the supernatant was filtered and measured the residue obtained was rinsed by deionized water and was used in the next step 2 5 eca and environmental toxicity 2 5 1 eca the ek treatment is a dynamic process in the solid liquid system which contains the transformation of heavy metal fractions ion exchange and migration of heavy metal ions eca is introduced to describe the above three processes from the sample areas to the electrode chambers the eca is determined by the transformation ability of chemical fractions exchange ability and migration ability of cr which are quantified by the changes in concentration of the chemical fractions including the transformation amount ta g kg exchange amount ea g kg and migration amount ma g kg respectively the specific formulas are as follows 2 t a s δ m s 3 t a e x c δ m s where δ m s is the difference in cr speciation res oc fm and car in the sample area before and after the ek treatment a positive value indicates the transformation from other forms to this form and vice versa for the transformation of this form to other forms 4 e a δ m s m e x c 0 where m e x c 0 is the initial amount of exc form before the ek treatment 5 m a δ m t where δ m t is the total decrease in the cr concentration after the ek treatment 2 5 2 environmental toxicity of cr previous studies have demonstrated that the remaining toxicity of heavy metals is closely related to chemical fractions 26 27 during the ek treatment the transformation of cr fractions is mainly from more difficult extraction forms to easier extraction forms however easier extraction forms are connected with higher environmental toxicity which means that the transformation may increase the environmental toxicity after the ek tests 31 generally eca can be used to qualitatively describe the environmental toxicity of cr the ma is greater than the ta and is equivalent to the ea implying that the high risk form of cr can be effectively removed thus the environmental toxicity of cr from copr will decrease after the ek test otherwise fractions of cr with high risk will accumulate in the copr and the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr may increase 3 results and discussion 3 1 controlled experiment 3 1 1 electric current and ph the electric current changed with time is demonstrated in fig 3 the electric current in ek1 3 had a similar variation which showed a sharp increase during the first 12 h and gradually decreased afterwards in the beginning the current was low because of the small number of free ions then the current increased to a maximum value possibly because the mobile ions in the electrolyte and the dissolved metal ions in the sample zone migrated under an electric field after 48 h the current slowly decreased and stabilized because the cations and anions migrated to the cathode and anode respectively moreover the electrolyte consumption non conductive solid particles and metal hydroxides precipitation also led to a current reduction 3 a slight fluctuation occurred after 48 h was due to the injection of electrolyte per day in addition the maximum current was found in the order of ek3 ek2 ek1 which indicated that the prb filled with acidified zeolite improved the electric current to some extent besides ek3 with rhamnolipid as the electrolyte had a higher current than ek1 and ek2 which was attributed to the increased migration of charged particles promoted by rhamnolipid generally rhamnolipid can enhance the desorption of heavy metal ions and form rhamnolipid complexes that can hold the electric current 21 22 fig 4 indicates the distribution of electrolyte and the residue ph after the ek treatment the ph in ek1 3 had a similar variation in the beginning the ph of copr was approximately 5 40 and the ph of the electrolyte was 8 10 in ek1 2 and 7 97 in ek3 after the experiments the ph of the anolyte and t1 near the anode dropped to under 2 0 while the ph of the catholyte and t3 near the cathode increased to over 13 0 because the electrolysis of water generated h and oh at the anode and cathode respectively migrating to the opposite electrode 10 as shown in fig 4 the ph of t2 in ek2 and ek3 was lower than that in ek1 showing that the acidified zeolite controlled the ph of t2 to some extent moreover compared with ek1 and ek2 the ph of ek3 was lower in both the t1 t3 regions and the electrolyte due to the released h from special functional groups cooh of rhamnolipid which neutralized the oh near the cathode and caused acidification near the anode 19 generally the ph of anolytes followed the order of ek1 ek2 ek3 and the ph of catholytes was ek2 ek1 ek3 while the current changed the tread of ek3 ek2 ek1 fig 3 which indicated that the current had a partial effect on the ph values during electrolysis in some ways the higher the current was the greater the intensity of electrolysis which resulted in more significant variations in the ph values of the anolyte and catholyte 3 2 removal of cr the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ total cr and leaching efficiency of cr ⅵ in the controlled experiment are recorded in table 4 the average removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ in ek1 3 were 65 74 69 18 and 90 03 respectively and the leaching efficiency improved from 63 62 to 88 95 the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ gradually increased from t1 to t3 in the ek1 3 experiments and the same trend was observed for the leaching efficiency indicating that the accumulation of cr ⅵ was at the maximum value in t1 this phenomenon was caused by cr ⅵ migrating towards the anode in the form of oxyanions e g cro4 2 cr2o7 2 hcro4 and accumulating near the anode 32 in addition the low ph near the anode could result in cr ⅵ adsorption thus hindering cr ⅵ migration which was also unfavorable for cr ⅵ removal 11 33 therefore the accumulation and adsorption of cr ⅵ near the anode caused a lower removal rate compared with the other sections the average removal efficiency of total cr in ek3 was significantly enhanced to 19 65 compared with ek1 9 52 and ek2 9 73 to some extent the prb filled with acidified zeolite was expected to release h near the cathode and adsorb heavy metal cations it can be observed in fig 4 and table 4 a lower ph and larger removal efficiency were achieved in ek2 compared with ek1 implying that the prb promoted the desorption and migration of cr for ek3 the highest removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr were obtained when rhamnolipid was used possibly because rhamnolipid could form micelles effectively reducing the interfacial tension improving the wettability and solubility of the residue and form rhamnolipid complexes 24 34 additionally rhamnolipid is an anionic surfactant with the ability to anion exchange and possesses the superiority of nonionic ones for instance low cmc and hydrophile lipophile features 35 the highest removal efficiency of total cr appeared to be near the anode for ek1 and ek2 and near the cathode for ek3 while the lowest removal rate occurred in the middle of the reaction chamber this was a result of electromigration and precipitation in the ek process firstly rhamnolipid complexes were negatively charged migrating towards the anode 19 which decreased the concentration of cr ⅲ near the cathode in addition the zeolite increased the migration resistance of cr ⅲ and the maximum accumulation in t2 may be due to the precipitation of cr ⅲ in alkaline conditions 33 the proportion of cr ⅵ in the total cr was 2 8 and 0 32 1 33 before and after the experiments respectively showing that cr mainly existed as cr ⅲ in the copr the concentration of cr ⅵ decreased by 1 04 1 42 g kg while the total cr decreased by 5 39 11 12 g kg from the data above it was not possible to determine whether the transformation between cr ⅲ and cr ⅵ occurred in the process since the content of cr ⅵ was quite low the removal of total cr was greatly dependent on cr ⅲ so the distribution of total cr was mainly attributed to the transport of different cr ⅲ fractions under an electric field 3 3 single factor experiments 3 3 1 effect of electrolyte concentration on removal efficiency fig 5 shows the removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr with different concentrations of rhamnolipid the removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr had a similar variation which increased to the maximum value and then decreased as the electrolyte concentration increased from 5 g l to 25 g l initially a gradual increase in removal efficiencies of cr ⅵ and total cr were obtained when the concentration was 5 15 g l a possible explanation is that the micelles produced by rhamnolipid gradually increase when the concentration is above cmc which is beneficial for heavy metal ions to directly incorporate into micelles or by metal bridging mechanisms thus reaching the goal of increasing wettability and migration ability 24 however 25 g l of rhamnolipid was detrimental to cr ⅵ and total cr removal possibly because micelle macromolecules aggregated in the system which blocked the pore channels and hindered the effective combination between micelles and cr resulting in a waste of resources 20 therefore 15 g l rhamnolipid was used as the optimal concentration based on the conservation of resources in the ek treatment of cr from copr in fact the mechanisms of rhamnolipid could be summarized in two aspects firstly rhamnolipid a kind of biosurfactant has hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups possessing larger molecular structures and ligand groups than other surfactants 19 36 thus rhamnolipid had significant surface activity and could replace bulk molecules with higher energy to reduce the free energy of the system 35 secondly micelles consisting of hydrophobic kernels and hydrophilic surfaces were formed in aqueous solution 37 the hydrophobic groups were able to wrap the non polar binding heavy metals into the hydrophobic kernel of the micelles and apparently promoted the transformation of hydrophobic compounds from the solid phase into the liquid phase 38 hydrophilic surfaces have hydrophilic groups carboxyl and hydroxyl which can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and hydrophilic groups 35 therefore the surface tension was reduced through the combination of forces in the opposite direction additionally enhancing the desorption and migration of heavy metals was obtained in the process 3 3 2 effect of time on removal efficiency fig 6 demonstrates the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ and total cr over a period of 1 9 d the removal efficiency of total cr increased to reach the maximum value of 19 22 within 5 d and then decreased while cr ⅵ increased to the highest removal ratio of 88 19 within 9 d the removal efficiency of cr ⅵ and total cr obviously increased in the first 5 d especially within 3 5 d which may be because rhamnolipid significantly promoted the transformation from difficult extraction fractions to highly soluble fractions and free ions effectively migrated to electrodes under an electric field nevertheless the decrease in total cr removal within 5 9 d may be due to the formation of a focusing phenomenon as oh generated by the electrolysis of water gradually increased besides the acidified zeolite was able to adsorb heavy metal ions until the adsorption equilibrium was obtained on approximately the fifth day 33 thus the time significantly affected cr removal and a time period of 5 d was the optimum condition for the ek treatment 3 4 distribution of cr chemical fractions 3 4 1 distribution of cr chemical fractions in the controlled experiment fig 7 shows the distribution of cr chemical fractions before and after the ek tests in the initial value about 66 of the cr existed in the form of res while the exc and car states were less than 7 in total after the nitric acid modification the res state was still the main form at approximately 65 the concentration of the car fraction decreased and obviously increased in the exc fraction accounting for 7 2 the above results indicated that acidification promoted the release of cr in the car form and was transformed to the exc form which was beneficial for cr removal through the ek treatment the changes in the fm and oc forms were not significant in summary heavy metal fractions were in dynamic equilibrium in the process of modification and the car fraction was transformed into the exc fraction 26 after the ek treatment the concentrations of cr chemical fractions followed the trend res fm oc car exc in ek1 3 most of the cr remained in the res state possibly because the cr of the res fraction was chemically stable and was not easily removed the concentrations of cr in the exc and car forms were very low the exc fraction was reduced to 0 05 0 63 g kg and the car fraction was reduced to 0 30 0 69 g kg moreover the concentration of cr in the form of oc increased by 0 60 5 12 g kg and the fm form decreased by 0 21 4 88 g kg furthermore the res form in some sections clearly decreased which demonstrated that cr in the form of res was transformed to the oc form during the ek treatment the above results provided important evidence for the transformation of heavy metal speciation compared with ek1 and ek2 the res fraction significantly decreased and the fm fraction increased in ek3 demonstrating that more cr of the res fraction was transformed to the fm fraction consequently the removal efficiency of cr in ek3 increased by approximately 10 showing that rhamnolipid effectively enhanced cr removal and the transformation of the res form played a significant role as shown in fig 7 the res fraction was mainly transformed into fm and oc under an electric field thus the transformation between chemical fractions was mainly from a more difficult extraction state to an easier extraction state 3 4 2 transformation of chemical fractions and the migration process of cr over time to explore the specific transformation of chemical fractions and the migration process of cr during the ek treatment the distribution of cr fractions is shown over time in fig 8 a the distribution of cr fractions followed the trend res fm oc car exc after the ek treatment the cr of the exc and car fractions decreased significantly with values of 1 51 2 20 g kg and 0 66 0 89 g kg respectively the concentrations of cr in the form of oc clearly increased while the fractions of res and fm decreased overall demonstrating that a transformation occurred between the cr fractions the transformation was most effective on the third day since the maximum variation of fractions was observed as time went by the best result for the removal efficiency gradually increased until the fifth day after which the distribution of cr fractions remained constant in summary time had a significant influence on the transformation of chemical fractions and cr removal fig 8 b f indicates the concentrations of cr in exc car fm oc res fractions in the t1t3 regions over time the changes of cr in the exc form are shown in fig 8 b the cr of the exc fraction decreased in the first 5 d and maintained a low constant possibly because the amount of the exc form to the electrode chamber was greater than that of other forms to the exc form the concentrations of cr rapidly decreased in t2 and t3 but slightly decreased in t1 within 1 d showing that the cr of the exc form migrated to the anode from the cathode thus it could be concluded that the cr of the exc fraction mainly existed as cr ⅵ moreover within 1 5 d the cr of the exc form in t1 decreased gradually since it migrated to the anode region under an electric field in summary the cr of the exc fraction mainly existed as cr ⅵ migrating to the anode and accumulated near the anode which agreed with the previous analysis fig 8 c demonstrates the changes of cr in the form of car over time the concentrations of cr decreased significantly within 1 d possibly because the car fraction was further released after acidification and was transformed into other fractions however the cr of the car form in t1 increased within 1 3 d the possible reason is a large number of other fractions were transformed to the car form and the transformation mainly occurred at a low ph at the end of the third day the concentration of cr in t1 rapidly decreased since the structure of the car form was destroyed by h generated by the electrolysis of water in t1 and similar findings have been reported in previous studies 39 moreover the car form in t2 and t3 slightly increased 3 d later a possible explanation is that the high ph near the cathode increased the adsorption of cr 11 it was concluded that the concentrations of the car fraction were significantly affected by ph variations the changes of cr in the fm fraction are indicated in fig 8 d which shows a fluctuation over time the concentration of cr in t1 increased constantly within 3 d while decreasing and stabilizing in t2 and t3 which may be due to the cr ⅵ of the fm fraction and rhamnolipid complexes migrating from the cathode to the anode within 3 5 d the concentrations of cr increased slightly in both t2 and t3 this phenomenon might be caused by the transformation from the res form to the fm form as discussed earlier however the concentration of cr in t1 decreased rapidly as the cr ⅵ migrated out of the sample cell and the cr of the fm form was transformed to more easily extracted fractions in the later part of the experiment all three sections showed a similar trend increasing first and then stabilizing therefore the transformation from more difficult extraction fractions into easier extraction fractions and the migration of cr were consistent under an electric field fig 8 e shows the distribution of cr in the form of oc over time as discussed earlier the res form was transformed into the oc form and the transformation mainly occurred in t1 possibly because more ions were desorbed and more physicochemical reactions occurred in acidic conditions finally the concentrations of cr in the oc fraction were higher than the initial value in t1 t3 as the rhamnolipid was able to transform cr into the oc fraction by the formation of complexes or micelles 36 fig 8 f shows the changes of cr in the res fraction over time as time went by concentrations of cr in the res form decreased gradually demonstrating that the res form was transformed into other fractions moreover a gradually increasing removal efficiency of cr was observed in fig 6 within 1 5 d the results above implied that the removal efficiency of cr was concerned with the transformation of the res form after the seventh day the concentration of the res fraction slightly increased however a decrease in the removal efficiency of cr was also indicated in fig 6 the above results showed that a further extension of time was detrimental to the transformation of the res fraction and cr removal thus the transformation from the res fraction into other fractions was a key factor in promoting the removal efficiency of cr in the ek treatment 3 5 eca and environmental toxicity of the remaining cr 3 5 1 eca table 5 shows the eca of cr in the ek treatment including ta ea and ma as can be observed the concentrations of cr in the form of res fm and car decreased while the oc fraction increased after the ek experiment as discussed earlier chemical fractions of cr were transformed into each other under an electric field while the exc fraction mainly migrated in the liquid phase rather than transformed to other fractions the ta of the exc fraction in ek1 3 was 2 87 3 04 and 8 26 g kg respectively indicating that the rhamnolipid used as electrolyte significantly enhanced the ta in the solid phase in addition the ma was equivalent to the ea in all three experiments demonstrating that the ea in the liquid phase was almost removed the larger the ta of the exc fraction was the larger the ma of cr implying that the restrictive factor of cr removal was the transformation between chemical speciation in solid phase rather than the migration in the liquid phase especially the transformation of the res fraction 3 5 2 environmental toxicity of the remaining cr the environmental toxicity of cr was closely related to the concentration and speciation of cr 26 27 the exc fraction of cr mainly existed as highly toxic cr ⅵ which is directly toxic to the environment 22 the res fraction of cr had low potential toxicity to the environment as it mainly existed as cr ⅲ which is relatively stable and low toxic the toxicity of cr in the form of car fm and oc was between the exc and res fractions 22 nevertheless the cr of the car fm oc and res fractions were able to transform to the exc form 26 as can be observed in table 5 the ma was greater than the ta in the exc fraction in ek1 3 which showed that the exc fraction of cr transformed from other fractions was removed besides the ma was equivalent to the ea demonstrating that cr in the highly toxic fraction was effectively removed and that the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr was reduced compared with ek1 and ek2 the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr did not increase as the removal efficiency was significantly promoted in ek3 which indicated that the enhanced electrolyte effectively optimized the ek treatment of cr 4 conclusions the rhamnolipid used as electrolyte effectively enhanced the cr ⅵ and total cr removal efficiency compared with unenhanced experiments most of the exc and car fractions and part of the fm and res fractions were removed after the ek experiment the transformation between chemical fractions was mainly from a more difficult extraction form to an easier extraction form under an electric field rhamnolipid significantly promoted the transformation of chemical fractions and the limiting factor of cr removal was the transformation of chemical fractions in the solid phase rather than the migration in the liquid phase especially the transformation of the res form in addition the environmental toxicity of the remaining cr decreased after the ek treatment as the exc fraction with direct toxicity to the environment was effectively removed declaration of competing interest this research did not receive any specific grant funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors acknowledgements this

13991,landfill leachate is categorized as recalcitrant wastewater and its treatment is a necessary measure for environmental protection recently photocatalytic treatment of recalcitrant wastewaters using n p and n p type tio2 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation has attracted researchers attention this study aims at investigating the photocatalytic removal efficiency of leachate chemical oxygen demand cod using tungsten w carbon c codoped titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation a cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles was applied to overcome the limitations of mass transfer and aeration in immobilized photocatalytic treatment processes the effect of operating parameters such as coating surface density light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod on the cod removal efficiency was experimentally investigated based on the results 84 of leachate cod was removed after 40 h treatment under the conditions of 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod 40 w light intensity 10 59 g m 2 coating surface density and 1 l min 1 leachate flow rate in addition the cod removal efficiency of leachate with 550 mg l 1 initial cod under 40 h sunlight irradiation which was 46 was equal to that under 40 w light irradiation the photocatalytic cod removal efficiency of leachate with high initial cod 10 100 mg l 1 was 32 after 60 h treatment the findings of this research offer new insights about efficient photocatalytic treatment of landfill leachate using cascade photoreactor under visible light irradiation on a modest and large scale keywords w c codoped tio2 landfill leachate cascade photoreactor sunlight langmuir hinshelwood 1 introduction leachate is a type of wastewater that is generated in landfills solid waste transfer stations and composting processes landfill leachate treatment is a key measure for environmental protection and sustainable development 1 as leachate contains a wide range of organic pollutants e g fatty acids and alcohols inorganic pollutants e g heavy metals and ammonium nitrogen and pathogens it is categorized into the group of recalcitrant wastewaters 2 3 in recent years a photocatalytic treatment method using titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles under uv light irradiation has drawn considerable attention for the treatment of recalcitrant wastewaters 4 8 tio2 nanoparticles possess the unique features of nontoxicity environmental benignity inexpensiveness chemical stability excellent optical and electronic properties 9 10 the synergic effects of tio2 nanoparticles and uv light in aqueous solution produce highly reactive species such as hydroxyl o h and superoxide o 2 radicals which are responsible for the degradation of pollutants 4 8 11 12 recently researchers have proposed the idea of doping the nanoparticles with foreign transition metallic or non metallic elements in order to improve the photocatalytic treatment process using tio2 nanoparticles and excite the nanoparticles even under the visible light and sunlight irradiation 13 14 if the nanoparticles are doped with a transition metal that has a d orbital energy lower than titanium ti a new band called donor level will be induced at the bottom of the conduction band and additional electrons will be placed on it 15 17 the electrons in this band can move to the conduction band under the visible light irradiation and create o 2 radicals in contact with oxygen molecules since electrons are the majority of carriers at this level the nanoparticles are called negative type n type tio2 18 if the nanoparticles are doped with a non metal that has a p orbital energy higher than oxygen o a new band called acceptor level will be induced above the valence band and additional holes will be placed on it 15 17 19 the holes in this band create o h radicals in contact with water molecules since holes are the majority of carriers at this level the nanoparticles are called positive type p type tio2 18 if two elements are added in the doping process one of which has a different 3d orbital than ti and the other has a different 2p orbital than o the created nanoparticles are called n p type tio2 these nanoparticles can produce both o h and o 2 radicals during the treatment process various studies have been conducted on the decolorization of dye wastewaters using doped tio2 nanoparticles 14 so far only two studies have been performed on the leachate treatment using n type tio2 nanoparticles under the visible light irradiation on a small scale azadi et al used tungsten doped tio2 nanoparticles for the treatment of 250 ml leachate with 600 mg l 1 initial cod they achieved 47 cod removal efficiency after 34 h 20 21 elleuch et al 2020 used a combination of biological pretreatment with kefir grains and photocatalytic process using silver doped tio2 nanoparticles for the treatment of leachate with 24 000 mg l 1 initial cod initially they achieved 83 cod removal efficiency using biological pretreatment finally they increased the removal efficiency to 96 using silver doped tio2 nanoparticles 2 since the generated reactive species in n and n p type tio2 nanoparticles are different it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of leachate treatment using n p type tio2 nanoparticles under the visible light irradiation a photoreactor which creates a proper contact between pollutants nanoparticles and light irradiation is essential in order to apply photocatalytic treatment process using tio2 nanoparticles on a modest and large scale 22 so far different photoreactors with suspended slurry or immobilized nanoparticles such as continuous flow reactors spinning disc reactors flat plate reactors baffled photocatalytic reactors and fiber optic reactors have been applied for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water 5 14 23 24 due to the need for catalyst separation and settling units photoreactors with suspension nanoparticles have not drawn much attention for large scale wastewater treatment 14 25 26 for instance chemlal et al 2013 used a photocatalytic reactor with immobilized tio2 nanoparticles and three 15 w uvc lamps for the treatment of leachate with the cod concentration of about 26 000 3 000 mg l 1 based on their results the cod removal efficiency for the initial leachate cod of 26 000 mg l 1 and 3 000 mg l 1 was 76 and 92 respectively within 54 h at the optimal ph of about 5 27 in immobilized photocatalytic reactors the efficiency of the photocatalytic process largely depends on operating parameters such as mass transfer rate initial pollutant concentration recirculation flow rate nanoparticle surface density and light intensity 22 27 30 so these parameters must be optimized to achieve maximum efficiency in the photocatalytic treatment process in the previous studies the light source was uvc that has safety risks and operating capital and maintenance costs 4 and so far no study has been conducted on the treatment of leachate using the immobilized bed photoreactor under the visible light irradiation therefore in this study tio2 nanoparticles were codoped by carbon and tungsten w c codoped tio2 to be excited under the visible light irradiation the reason for choosing c was that both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that c dopant can significantly enhance the optical absorption of tio2 nanoparticles for visible light 15 31 32 in addition w dopant induces ferromagnetism and shifts the absorption spectra to visible light region 33 34 among different types a photoreactor with high mass transfer rate high photon absorption and low energy consumption is needed for better performance of nanoparticles in the leachate treatment under the visible light irradiation therefore a cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 was applied in this study the cascade photoreactor overcomes the limitations of mass transfer in immobilized photocatalytic processes and spontaneous oxygenation due to its flow geometry 35 to improve the performance of the selected reactor the effect of coating surface density light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod was investigated and the best value of each one was determined to achieve the highest cod removal efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 w c codoped tio2 synthesis w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol gel method based on pretests the optimum weight percentage wt of tungsten and carbon was 1 5 and 0 06 respectively therefore for the synthesis of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles 878 g glucose was first dissolved in 120 ml deionized water to provide solution a then 10 g titanium butoxide ti oc4h8 4 aldrich was added dropwise to the solution a under an intense mixing at this stage ti oc4h8 4 was hydrolyzed and a water alcohol solution with white sediments of tio2 was produced then 250 ml deionized water was added to the white sediments to prepare solution b next 48 mg tungstic acid h2wo4 was dissolved in 2 ml hydrogen peroxide h2o2 both from merk at 90 c and then this solution was poured into 40 ml h2o2 to prepare solution c after that solution c was added dropwise to the solution b under an intense mixing the obtained orange solution was stirred for 3 h to become an orange viscose solution the viscose solution was kept at room temperature for 1 d to provide the 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 gel the gel was then dried at 80 c for 2 d finally the solid was grinded well and calcined at 570 c for 2 h 2 2 characterization of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles five methods of x ray diffraction xrd field emission scanning electron microscope fesem x ray spectroscopy eds particle size analysis psa and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs were used to describe the characteristics of the synthesized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles the xrd patterns of the nanoparticles were determined using scattering detector bruker d8 advanced at a voltage of 40 kv and 45 ma using radiation cukα λ 1 5406 å the xrd pattern data were collected for the 2θ values between 10 and 90 and a scanning rate of 0 02 degrees per second fesem analysis was accomplished with a mira 3 xmu instrument to observe the morphology of the nanoparticles the eds analysis was conducted with a mira 3 xmu instrument at the accelerating voltage of 20 kv to determine the percentage of different elements in the surface layer of the sample the psa test was conducted with a vasco device based on dynamic light scattering to determine the size distribution of the nanoparticles the band gap energy eg and absorption properties of the samples were determined using uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 2 3 applied photoreactor a cascade photoreactor was used for the photocatalytic treatment of landfill leachate plexiglas plates were used to construct the photoreactor these plates were cut by laser in accordance with the dimensions shown in fig 1 a cut pieces were connected using chemical chloroform finally the photoreactor was sealed using aquarium glue the designed cascade photoreactor consisted of four 10 15 cm2steps and the height of each step was 7 5 cm on each step a glass plate coated with w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles was placed therefore the contact area of the leachate with the nanoparticles was 600 cm2 the photoreactor contained two reservoirs one at the bottom and the other at the top with the volume of 1 8 and 0 125 l respectively fig 1b the leachate was recirculated using a magnetic pump with a maximum flow rate of 5 l min 1 between the two reservoirs 2 4 immobilization of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles were immobilized on the glass plates by doctor blade method first about 0 6 g of freshly calcined nanoparticles was uniformly dispersed in 20 ml deionized water to provide suspension a then the suspension a was gradually added to 100 ml w c codoped tio2 gel under an intense mixing then the viscose mixture was vigorously stirred for about 15 min to make it uniform glass plate was first thoroughly washed with concentrated acid and then deionized water after drying the plate weight was recorded the viscose mixture was spread well on the glass surface after a few seconds the plate was moved under a metal blade to form a thin film of viscose mixture then the glass was placed in an oven at 80 c to dry the thin film the process of thin film coating on the glass surface was repeated several times until the difference between the weight of glass before and after coating reaches the expected value finally the coated glass plate was placed inside a furnace the furnace temperature was brought to 110 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 and the plates remained at this temperature for 1 h the furnace temperature was then brought to 570 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 and the glass plate remained at this temperature for 2 h afterwards the glass plate was given time to slowly reach the ambient temperature fesem analysis was applied to observe the morphology of the coated nanoparticles this analysis was accomplished with a mira 3 xmu instrument 2 5 photocatalytic leachate treatment a landfill leachate sample was collected from the barmshoor landfill site in shiraz city fars province iran which has been in operation for 19 yr about 1 5 l of leachate was poured into the bottom tank of the photoreactor the coated glass plates were placed on the steps of the cascade photoreactor a pump was applied to recirculate the leachate through the photoreactor four 10 w led lamps were placed over the steps and parallel to the slope fig 2 a the effect of coating surface density of the nanoparticles on plates light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod parameters on the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal was investigated as one factor at a time table 1 indicates the levels of each parameter which were determined based on pretests and practical limitations after conducting all experiments in three replications the photoreactor was placed under the direct sunlight irradiation fig 2b and the temporal cod removal efficiency under sunlight irradiation was compared with that under led light irradiation 2 6 kinematic modeling of langmuir hinshelwood reaction kinetic provides information on reaction rates and pollutant removal mechanisms langmuir hinshelwood model is a commonly used model in the kinetic study of heterogeneous reactions such as photocatalytic processes using tio2 nanoparticles the general form of the model is as eq 1 1 r d c l d t k l h k a d s c l 1 k a d s c l where c l represents the leachate cod concentration at each time k l h is the langmuir hinshelwood reaction constant for the cod removal and k a d s is the equilibrium constant of organic matter adsorption to the tio2 nanoparticles for photocatalytic removal of organic matters using tio2 nanoparticles a competitive adsorption by intermediates and pollutants must be considered 36 37 therefore eq 1 is rewritten as eq 2 2 r d c l d t k l h k a d s c l 1 k a d s c l k i c i where c i and k i represent the cod of intermediates and reaction rate of their cod removal respectively assuming that the intermediates significantly affect the process kinetic the relation between intermediate cod concentration and initial leachate cod is as eq 3 36 3 k a d s c l k i c i k a d s c 0 l where c 0 l is the initial leachate cod by combining the eqs 2 and 3 the langmuir hinshelwood reaction rate is as eqs 4 and 5 4 r d c l d t k l h k a d s c l 1 k a d s c 0 l k a p c l 5 k a p p k l h k a d s 1 k a d s c 0 l eq 4 represents the general form of the pseudo first order reaction equation in general the calculation of k a p p is a basic measure in pilot studies because it provides a simple equation to estimate the temporal leachate cod during the photocatalytic treatment of leachates with different initial cod concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles fig 3 a shows the xrd pattern of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles based on the results the phase of w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles was just anatase at the calcination temperature of 570 c the diffraction peaks of the anatase phase of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles observed at 2θ 25 41 37 86 48 04 53 95 55 21 62 84 70 32 75 16 and 82 75 with the minimum significance of 2 0 are consistent with anatase 1 0 1 0 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 5 2 1 1 2 0 4 2 2 0 2 1 5 and 2 2 4 lattice planes respectively no diffraction peak of w and c was found in the xrd pattern of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles which indicated that the w and c ions were well dispersed however fig 3b indicates that doping the tio2 with w and c elements leads to broadening the strongest 1 0 1 peak and a slight shift to bigger angles 25 3 xrd peak broadening is due to the decrease in crystallite size 38 however the peak shift shows a contribution of the lattice strain to the peak broadening 38 the average crystallite size of the w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles was estimated by the scherrer equation as follows eq 6 6 d 0 9 λ β c o s θ where β is the full width at half maximum of the 1 0 1 peak in radian λ is the wavelength of the x ray in nm λ 0 154 nm θ is the diffraction angle in degree and d is the average crystallite size in nm based on the xrd analysis result the average crystallite size of the w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles without correction for the lattice strain was found to be about 17 and 23 nm respectively the reason for reduction in crystallite size is that dopant elements at the grain boundary restrict the direct contact of grains and inhibit the grain growth 39 the lattice parameters of w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles a and c were calculated as follows eq 7 7 1 d 2 h 2 k 2 a 2 l 2 c 2 where h k and l are miller s indices and d is the interplane spacing based on the xrd results the lattice parameters for pure tio2 were a 3 758 a and c 9 452 a and for w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles were a 3 770 a and c 9 504 a the a b and c axis lattice parameters of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles is a slight larger than that of pure tio2 indicating a lattice increase along the a b and c axis due to the w and c dopants a b since the xrd analysis illustrates no sign of w and c ions existence eds analysis was applied to prove the presence of them in the sample fig 4 a shows the eds analysis of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles as observed the peaks of the ti o c and w elements are seen in the sample and the intensity of each peak is proportional to the weight percentage of atoms fig 4b indicates the fesem image of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles which was applied to achieve a better view of the nanoparticles as shown the particles are almost spherical and about 20 nm in diameter fig 5 illustrates the result of psa test which was applied to achieve more precise information about the nanoparticle dimensions based on the results 10 and 90 of particles were smaller than about 23 and 27 nm in diameter respectively therefore nano sized particles were produced during the synthesis process fig 6 a shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles as observed w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles have a higher optical absorption in the visible and uv light region than pure tio2 nanoparticles in fact doping the tio2 nanoparticles with w and c elements results in a slight red shift of absorption edge to longer wavelengths and increase in the tio2 photocatalytic activity in the presence of visible light irradiation the band gap energy eg is calculated according to tauc s relationship which is as follows for w c codoped tio2 as indirect semiconductor eq 8 8 h c λ α 0 5 a h c λ e g where h c λ 1239 84 λ is the energy of a photon with λ wavelength nm α is the absorption constant a is a constant and e g is the energy of the indirect band gap ev eg is determined by extrapolating the linear part of the h c λ α 0 5 versus h c λ plot to the h c λ α 0 5 0 based on the fig 6b the band gap energy of the pure tio2 and 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles is about 3 2 and 3 0 ev respectively 3 2 comparison between the photocatalytic activity of codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles for landfill leachate treatment the performance of pure and w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles for leachate photocatalytic treatment was compared to ensure that the doping process was successfully conducted this comparison was conducted under the conditions of 10 59 g m 2 coating surface density 6 l min 1 leachate flow rate and 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod as observed in fig 7 w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles show much better performance than the pure tio2 nanoparticles paired t test was applied to evaluate the statistical significance of this improvement according to the sig value in the paired t test which was zero and less than 0 05 there is a significant difference between the performance of pure and w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles therefore doping the tio2 nanoparticles with w and c elements causes a significant improvement in the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation 3 3 determination of coating characteristics and durability of photocatalytic efficiency fesem analysis was performed on the coated glass plates to determine the status of the immobilized nanoparticles fig 8 a shows the top view of a coated glass plate with a magnification of 250 kx as observed the nanoparticles are fixed in a perfectly uniform and compact manner fig 8b shows a cross section view of the coated glass plate with a magnification of 250 kx as observed the thickness of the coated layer is about 400 nm and the nanoparticles are perfectly arranged and layered together the durability of photocatalytic efficiency in different cycles of operation was evaluated by conducting an experiment under the conditions of 10 59 g m 2 coating surface density 6 l min 1 recirculation flow rate 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod and 40 w light intensity the experiment was repeated three times without changing the plates and the photoreactor was operated for 60 h at each time fig 9 illustrates the results of the cod removal efficiency in three cycles according to the results the cod removal efficiency after 60 h photocatalytic treatment was 67 55 and 52 for first second and third cycle respectively therefore there is a good durability of photocatalytic efficiency in this coating method the photocatalytic efficiency of nanoparticles is reduced about 15 after 180 h the reason for this phenomenon is that some of the intermediates are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles and affect the adsorption ability of nanoparticles 40 41 3 4 investigating the effect of coating surface density on the efficiency of leachate cod removal different coating surface densities of nanoparticles including 2 65 10 59 16 77 and 21 18 g m 2 were coated on glass plates to investigate the effect of coating surface density in the experiments of this stage the initial leachate cod leachate recirculaton flow rate and light intensity were 550 mg l 1 6 l min 1 and four 10 w led lamps respectively as observed in fig 10 the cod removal efficiency for coating surface densities of 2 65 7 9 10 59 16 77 and 21 18 g m 2 after 60 h photocatalytic treatment is 28 57 67 81 and 82 respectively as the coating surface density increases the number of active sites on the surface and consequently the process efficiency increases by increasing the coating dose of immobilized nanoparticles from 2 65 to 16 77 g m 2 the thickness of the photocatalyst film changed from 62 2 nm to 400 nm in the presence of nanoparticles two simultaneous processes of adsorption and photocatalytic occur the increase in the photocatalyst layer thickness reduces the adsorption mechanism for the nanoparticles in the bottom layers 28 however if the photocatalyst layer thickness exceeds an optimum value the surface porosity of nanoparticles in the bottom layers will be reduced the nanoparticles will be compacted and consequently internal mass transfer rate will decrease according to fig 10b when the coating surface density increases from 16 77 to 21 18 g m 2 the increase in the cod removal efficiency is not significant therefore the optimum coating is 16 77 g m 2 the results of the present study are comparable to those of other researchers nawi et al showed that by increasing the coating surface density of photocatalyst from 3 3 16 4 g m 2 the photocatalyst layer thickness varies from 8 17 0 32 27 1 11 μm they found that as the catalyst surface density increased the catalyst thickness increased and the efficiency did not change significantly 42 43 3 5 investigating the effect of light intensity on the cod removal efficiency fig 11 indicates the effect of light intensity on the efficiency of leachate cod removal as observed the cod removal efficiency for the light intensity of 10 20 and 40 w after about 60 h photocatalytic treatment is 53 64 and 67 respectively therefore the cod removal efficiency increases with light intensity as the light intensity increases the nanoparticles absorb more photons resulting in more production of electron hole pairs on their surface 44 this causes the increase in the concentration of o h and o 2 and consequently the degradation rate of organic pollutants however as the light intensity increases the transfer rate of electrons and holes to the nanoparticles leachate interface decreases relative to the electron hole recombination rate since interfacial electron hole transfer is a first order process while the electron hole recombination is a second order process 44 due to a slight difference in process efficiency for the light intensity of 20 and 40 w the light intensity of 20 w is better to use the effect of sunlight irradiation on the photocatalytic activity of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles was investigated by conducting an experiment under the conditions of 6 l min 1 recirculation flow rate 7 g m 2 coating surface density and 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod and the results were compared with a similar experiment in which the light source was four 10 w led lamps as seen in fig 12 the cod removal efficiency was about 46 after 40 h photocatalytic treatment under the sunlight irradiation which is approximately the same as the performance of the process under the four 10 w led lamps irradiation 3 6 investigating the effect of leachate recirculation flow rate fig 13 shows the effect of leachate recirculation flow rate on the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal as observed the cod removal efficiency and reaction rate increase with a decrease in the leachate recirculation flow rate according to the observations the thickness of the leachate on glass plates increases and the amount of light transmission to nanoparticles decreases with an increase in recirculation flow rate 28 as a result lower electron hole pairs are produced on the nanoparticles surface this causes the increase in the concentration of o h and o 2 and consequently the degradation rate of organic pollutants based on the observations the thickness of leachate layer on the glass plates is 0 1 cm for the minimum flow rate and 1 5 cm for the maximum flow rate in addition interaction time among leachate and immobilized nanoparticles and consequently photocatalytic removal efficiency increases with a decrease in the flow rate 29 45 3 7 investigating the effect of initial leachate cod fig 14 illustrates the effect of initial leachate cod on the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal as observed the removal efficiency and reaction rate decrease with an increase in the initial leachate cod the reason is that as the initial leachate cod increases 1 the ratio of active particles to leachate molecules decreases 2 fewer photons reach the nanoparticle surface and consequently the generation of reactive species decreases 3 additional leachate molecules are adsorbed to the nanoparticle surface cover active surface sites and suppress the generation of reactive species 46 when the initial leachate cod increases from 550 to 10 100 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency after 60 h visible light irradiation decreases from 67 to 32 fig 15 shows the effect of initial leachate cod on the amount of removed cod during the photocatalytic treatment the amount of removed cod increases with initial cod because more pollutants are available to nanoparticles 3 8 langmuir hinshelwood kinetic modeling the apparent reaction rate was calculated by plotting the logarithmic changes in the leachate cod concentration versus the exposure time for leachates with different initial cod concentrations fig 16 a the slope of fitted regression line on the points represents the apparent rate of reaction kapp for each initial cod as seen the kapp decreases with an increase in the initial concentration of leachate cod in order to determine a model to estimate the temporal leachate cod during the photocatalytic treatment of leachate using cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles the graph of kapp value versus initial cod concentration was plotted then an equation in the form of eq 5 was fitted on the points fig 16b the equation of fitted line on the points of fig 16b is as eq 9 9 r d c l d t 0 01772 c l 1 0 000263 c 0 l k a p p c l using eq 9 temporal leachate cod during aforementioned process can be estimated with a correlation coefficient of 0 83 the kl h and kads for the process are 67 376 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 000263 mg l 1 respectively 4 conclusion the photocatalytic treatment efficiency of landfill leachate was studied using cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles the nanoparticles were immobilized on four glass plates by doctor blade method and plates were placed on the steps the effect of four parameters of coating surface density light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod was experimentally investigated in addition the effect of using sunlight and visible light as a light source on the cod removal efficiency was compared based on the results the cod removal efficiency increased with increase in coating surface density in the range investigated 2 65 21 18 g m 2 the increase in the cod removal efficiency was higher when the coating surface density increased from 2 65 to 16 77 g m2 above 16 77 g m2 no significant enhancement was observed the cod removal efficiency increased with light intensity for the values investigated 10 20 and 40 w since a slight difference was observed between the process efficiency for the light intensity of 20 and 40 w a 20 w light intensity is better to use the cod removal efficiency and reaction rate increased with decrease in the leachate recirculation flow rate from 6 to 1 l min 1 increase of the initial leachate cod from 550 to 10 100 mg l 1 resulted in increase in the removed cod but decrease in the cod removal efficiency the effect of initial leachate cod on the reaction rate showed that the photocatalytic degradation of landfill leachate in the cascade photoreactor obeys the langmuir hinshelwood model the obtained values for k l h and k a d s were 67 376 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 000263 mg l 1 respectively the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal under sunlight irradiation was approximately equal to that under a 40 w light irradiation the cod removal of 46 was achieved after 40 h treatment for leachate with 550 mg l 1 initial cod the cod removal efficiency after 60 h irradiation of 40 w visible light for leachate with initial cod of 550 and 10 100 mg l 1 was 67 and 32 respectively the findings of this research offer new insights about determining optimum conditions for photocatalytic treatment of landfill leachate using cascade photoreactor under visible light irradiation on a modest and large scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13991,landfill leachate is categorized as recalcitrant wastewater and its treatment is a necessary measure for environmental protection recently photocatalytic treatment of recalcitrant wastewaters using n p and n p type tio2 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation has attracted researchers attention this study aims at investigating the photocatalytic removal efficiency of leachate chemical oxygen demand cod using tungsten w carbon c codoped titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation a cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles was applied to overcome the limitations of mass transfer and aeration in immobilized photocatalytic treatment processes the effect of operating parameters such as coating surface density light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod on the cod removal efficiency was experimentally investigated based on the results 84 of leachate cod was removed after 40 h treatment under the conditions of 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod 40 w light intensity 10 59 g m 2 coating surface density and 1 l min 1 leachate flow rate in addition the cod removal efficiency of leachate with 550 mg l 1 initial cod under 40 h sunlight irradiation which was 46 was equal to that under 40 w light irradiation the photocatalytic cod removal efficiency of leachate with high initial cod 10 100 mg l 1 was 32 after 60 h treatment the findings of this research offer new insights about efficient photocatalytic treatment of landfill leachate using cascade photoreactor under visible light irradiation on a modest and large scale keywords w c codoped tio2 landfill leachate cascade photoreactor sunlight langmuir hinshelwood 1 introduction leachate is a type of wastewater that is generated in landfills solid waste transfer stations and composting processes landfill leachate treatment is a key measure for environmental protection and sustainable development 1 as leachate contains a wide range of organic pollutants e g fatty acids and alcohols inorganic pollutants e g heavy metals and ammonium nitrogen and pathogens it is categorized into the group of recalcitrant wastewaters 2 3 in recent years a photocatalytic treatment method using titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles under uv light irradiation has drawn considerable attention for the treatment of recalcitrant wastewaters 4 8 tio2 nanoparticles possess the unique features of nontoxicity environmental benignity inexpensiveness chemical stability excellent optical and electronic properties 9 10 the synergic effects of tio2 nanoparticles and uv light in aqueous solution produce highly reactive species such as hydroxyl o h and superoxide o 2 radicals which are responsible for the degradation of pollutants 4 8 11 12 recently researchers have proposed the idea of doping the nanoparticles with foreign transition metallic or non metallic elements in order to improve the photocatalytic treatment process using tio2 nanoparticles and excite the nanoparticles even under the visible light and sunlight irradiation 13 14 if the nanoparticles are doped with a transition metal that has a d orbital energy lower than titanium ti a new band called donor level will be induced at the bottom of the conduction band and additional electrons will be placed on it 15 17 the electrons in this band can move to the conduction band under the visible light irradiation and create o 2 radicals in contact with oxygen molecules since electrons are the majority of carriers at this level the nanoparticles are called negative type n type tio2 18 if the nanoparticles are doped with a non metal that has a p orbital energy higher than oxygen o a new band called acceptor level will be induced above the valence band and additional holes will be placed on it 15 17 19 the holes in this band create o h radicals in contact with water molecules since holes are the majority of carriers at this level the nanoparticles are called positive type p type tio2 18 if two elements are added in the doping process one of which has a different 3d orbital than ti and the other has a different 2p orbital than o the created nanoparticles are called n p type tio2 these nanoparticles can produce both o h and o 2 radicals during the treatment process various studies have been conducted on the decolorization of dye wastewaters using doped tio2 nanoparticles 14 so far only two studies have been performed on the leachate treatment using n type tio2 nanoparticles under the visible light irradiation on a small scale azadi et al used tungsten doped tio2 nanoparticles for the treatment of 250 ml leachate with 600 mg l 1 initial cod they achieved 47 cod removal efficiency after 34 h 20 21 elleuch et al 2020 used a combination of biological pretreatment with kefir grains and photocatalytic process using silver doped tio2 nanoparticles for the treatment of leachate with 24 000 mg l 1 initial cod initially they achieved 83 cod removal efficiency using biological pretreatment finally they increased the removal efficiency to 96 using silver doped tio2 nanoparticles 2 since the generated reactive species in n and n p type tio2 nanoparticles are different it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of leachate treatment using n p type tio2 nanoparticles under the visible light irradiation a photoreactor which creates a proper contact between pollutants nanoparticles and light irradiation is essential in order to apply photocatalytic treatment process using tio2 nanoparticles on a modest and large scale 22 so far different photoreactors with suspended slurry or immobilized nanoparticles such as continuous flow reactors spinning disc reactors flat plate reactors baffled photocatalytic reactors and fiber optic reactors have been applied for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water 5 14 23 24 due to the need for catalyst separation and settling units photoreactors with suspension nanoparticles have not drawn much attention for large scale wastewater treatment 14 25 26 for instance chemlal et al 2013 used a photocatalytic reactor with immobilized tio2 nanoparticles and three 15 w uvc lamps for the treatment of leachate with the cod concentration of about 26 000 3 000 mg l 1 based on their results the cod removal efficiency for the initial leachate cod of 26 000 mg l 1 and 3 000 mg l 1 was 76 and 92 respectively within 54 h at the optimal ph of about 5 27 in immobilized photocatalytic reactors the efficiency of the photocatalytic process largely depends on operating parameters such as mass transfer rate initial pollutant concentration recirculation flow rate nanoparticle surface density and light intensity 22 27 30 so these parameters must be optimized to achieve maximum efficiency in the photocatalytic treatment process in the previous studies the light source was uvc that has safety risks and operating capital and maintenance costs 4 and so far no study has been conducted on the treatment of leachate using the immobilized bed photoreactor under the visible light irradiation therefore in this study tio2 nanoparticles were codoped by carbon and tungsten w c codoped tio2 to be excited under the visible light irradiation the reason for choosing c was that both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that c dopant can significantly enhance the optical absorption of tio2 nanoparticles for visible light 15 31 32 in addition w dopant induces ferromagnetism and shifts the absorption spectra to visible light region 33 34 among different types a photoreactor with high mass transfer rate high photon absorption and low energy consumption is needed for better performance of nanoparticles in the leachate treatment under the visible light irradiation therefore a cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 was applied in this study the cascade photoreactor overcomes the limitations of mass transfer in immobilized photocatalytic processes and spontaneous oxygenation due to its flow geometry 35 to improve the performance of the selected reactor the effect of coating surface density light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod was investigated and the best value of each one was determined to achieve the highest cod removal efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 w c codoped tio2 synthesis w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol gel method based on pretests the optimum weight percentage wt of tungsten and carbon was 1 5 and 0 06 respectively therefore for the synthesis of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles 878 g glucose was first dissolved in 120 ml deionized water to provide solution a then 10 g titanium butoxide ti oc4h8 4 aldrich was added dropwise to the solution a under an intense mixing at this stage ti oc4h8 4 was hydrolyzed and a water alcohol solution with white sediments of tio2 was produced then 250 ml deionized water was added to the white sediments to prepare solution b next 48 mg tungstic acid h2wo4 was dissolved in 2 ml hydrogen peroxide h2o2 both from merk at 90 c and then this solution was poured into 40 ml h2o2 to prepare solution c after that solution c was added dropwise to the solution b under an intense mixing the obtained orange solution was stirred for 3 h to become an orange viscose solution the viscose solution was kept at room temperature for 1 d to provide the 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 gel the gel was then dried at 80 c for 2 d finally the solid was grinded well and calcined at 570 c for 2 h 2 2 characterization of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles five methods of x ray diffraction xrd field emission scanning electron microscope fesem x ray spectroscopy eds particle size analysis psa and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs were used to describe the characteristics of the synthesized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles the xrd patterns of the nanoparticles were determined using scattering detector bruker d8 advanced at a voltage of 40 kv and 45 ma using radiation cukα λ 1 5406 å the xrd pattern data were collected for the 2θ values between 10 and 90 and a scanning rate of 0 02 degrees per second fesem analysis was accomplished with a mira 3 xmu instrument to observe the morphology of the nanoparticles the eds analysis was conducted with a mira 3 xmu instrument at the accelerating voltage of 20 kv to determine the percentage of different elements in the surface layer of the sample the psa test was conducted with a vasco device based on dynamic light scattering to determine the size distribution of the nanoparticles the band gap energy eg and absorption properties of the samples were determined using uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 2 3 applied photoreactor a cascade photoreactor was used for the photocatalytic treatment of landfill leachate plexiglas plates were used to construct the photoreactor these plates were cut by laser in accordance with the dimensions shown in fig 1 a cut pieces were connected using chemical chloroform finally the photoreactor was sealed using aquarium glue the designed cascade photoreactor consisted of four 10 15 cm2steps and the height of each step was 7 5 cm on each step a glass plate coated with w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles was placed therefore the contact area of the leachate with the nanoparticles was 600 cm2 the photoreactor contained two reservoirs one at the bottom and the other at the top with the volume of 1 8 and 0 125 l respectively fig 1b the leachate was recirculated using a magnetic pump with a maximum flow rate of 5 l min 1 between the two reservoirs 2 4 immobilization of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles were immobilized on the glass plates by doctor blade method first about 0 6 g of freshly calcined nanoparticles was uniformly dispersed in 20 ml deionized water to provide suspension a then the suspension a was gradually added to 100 ml w c codoped tio2 gel under an intense mixing then the viscose mixture was vigorously stirred for about 15 min to make it uniform glass plate was first thoroughly washed with concentrated acid and then deionized water after drying the plate weight was recorded the viscose mixture was spread well on the glass surface after a few seconds the plate was moved under a metal blade to form a thin film of viscose mixture then the glass was placed in an oven at 80 c to dry the thin film the process of thin film coating on the glass surface was repeated several times until the difference between the weight of glass before and after coating reaches the expected value finally the coated glass plate was placed inside a furnace the furnace temperature was brought to 110 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 and the plates remained at this temperature for 1 h the furnace temperature was then brought to 570 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 and the glass plate remained at this temperature for 2 h afterwards the glass plate was given time to slowly reach the ambient temperature fesem analysis was applied to observe the morphology of the coated nanoparticles this analysis was accomplished with a mira 3 xmu instrument 2 5 photocatalytic leachate treatment a landfill leachate sample was collected from the barmshoor landfill site in shiraz city fars province iran which has been in operation for 19 yr about 1 5 l of leachate was poured into the bottom tank of the photoreactor the coated glass plates were placed on the steps of the cascade photoreactor a pump was applied to recirculate the leachate through the photoreactor four 10 w led lamps were placed over the steps and parallel to the slope fig 2 a the effect of coating surface density of the nanoparticles on plates light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod parameters on the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal was investigated as one factor at a time table 1 indicates the levels of each parameter which were determined based on pretests and practical limitations after conducting all experiments in three replications the photoreactor was placed under the direct sunlight irradiation fig 2b and the temporal cod removal efficiency under sunlight irradiation was compared with that under led light irradiation 2 6 kinematic modeling of langmuir hinshelwood reaction kinetic provides information on reaction rates and pollutant removal mechanisms langmuir hinshelwood model is a commonly used model in the kinetic study of heterogeneous reactions such as photocatalytic processes using tio2 nanoparticles the general form of the model is as eq 1 1 r d c l d t k l h k a d s c l 1 k a d s c l where c l represents the leachate cod concentration at each time k l h is the langmuir hinshelwood reaction constant for the cod removal and k a d s is the equilibrium constant of organic matter adsorption to the tio2 nanoparticles for photocatalytic removal of organic matters using tio2 nanoparticles a competitive adsorption by intermediates and pollutants must be considered 36 37 therefore eq 1 is rewritten as eq 2 2 r d c l d t k l h k a d s c l 1 k a d s c l k i c i where c i and k i represent the cod of intermediates and reaction rate of their cod removal respectively assuming that the intermediates significantly affect the process kinetic the relation between intermediate cod concentration and initial leachate cod is as eq 3 36 3 k a d s c l k i c i k a d s c 0 l where c 0 l is the initial leachate cod by combining the eqs 2 and 3 the langmuir hinshelwood reaction rate is as eqs 4 and 5 4 r d c l d t k l h k a d s c l 1 k a d s c 0 l k a p c l 5 k a p p k l h k a d s 1 k a d s c 0 l eq 4 represents the general form of the pseudo first order reaction equation in general the calculation of k a p p is a basic measure in pilot studies because it provides a simple equation to estimate the temporal leachate cod during the photocatalytic treatment of leachates with different initial cod concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles fig 3 a shows the xrd pattern of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles based on the results the phase of w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles was just anatase at the calcination temperature of 570 c the diffraction peaks of the anatase phase of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles observed at 2θ 25 41 37 86 48 04 53 95 55 21 62 84 70 32 75 16 and 82 75 with the minimum significance of 2 0 are consistent with anatase 1 0 1 0 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 5 2 1 1 2 0 4 2 2 0 2 1 5 and 2 2 4 lattice planes respectively no diffraction peak of w and c was found in the xrd pattern of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles which indicated that the w and c ions were well dispersed however fig 3b indicates that doping the tio2 with w and c elements leads to broadening the strongest 1 0 1 peak and a slight shift to bigger angles 25 3 xrd peak broadening is due to the decrease in crystallite size 38 however the peak shift shows a contribution of the lattice strain to the peak broadening 38 the average crystallite size of the w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles was estimated by the scherrer equation as follows eq 6 6 d 0 9 λ β c o s θ where β is the full width at half maximum of the 1 0 1 peak in radian λ is the wavelength of the x ray in nm λ 0 154 nm θ is the diffraction angle in degree and d is the average crystallite size in nm based on the xrd analysis result the average crystallite size of the w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles without correction for the lattice strain was found to be about 17 and 23 nm respectively the reason for reduction in crystallite size is that dopant elements at the grain boundary restrict the direct contact of grains and inhibit the grain growth 39 the lattice parameters of w c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles a and c were calculated as follows eq 7 7 1 d 2 h 2 k 2 a 2 l 2 c 2 where h k and l are miller s indices and d is the interplane spacing based on the xrd results the lattice parameters for pure tio2 were a 3 758 a and c 9 452 a and for w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles were a 3 770 a and c 9 504 a the a b and c axis lattice parameters of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles is a slight larger than that of pure tio2 indicating a lattice increase along the a b and c axis due to the w and c dopants a b since the xrd analysis illustrates no sign of w and c ions existence eds analysis was applied to prove the presence of them in the sample fig 4 a shows the eds analysis of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles as observed the peaks of the ti o c and w elements are seen in the sample and the intensity of each peak is proportional to the weight percentage of atoms fig 4b indicates the fesem image of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles which was applied to achieve a better view of the nanoparticles as shown the particles are almost spherical and about 20 nm in diameter fig 5 illustrates the result of psa test which was applied to achieve more precise information about the nanoparticle dimensions based on the results 10 and 90 of particles were smaller than about 23 and 27 nm in diameter respectively therefore nano sized particles were produced during the synthesis process fig 6 a shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles as observed w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles have a higher optical absorption in the visible and uv light region than pure tio2 nanoparticles in fact doping the tio2 nanoparticles with w and c elements results in a slight red shift of absorption edge to longer wavelengths and increase in the tio2 photocatalytic activity in the presence of visible light irradiation the band gap energy eg is calculated according to tauc s relationship which is as follows for w c codoped tio2 as indirect semiconductor eq 8 8 h c λ α 0 5 a h c λ e g where h c λ 1239 84 λ is the energy of a photon with λ wavelength nm α is the absorption constant a is a constant and e g is the energy of the indirect band gap ev eg is determined by extrapolating the linear part of the h c λ α 0 5 versus h c λ plot to the h c λ α 0 5 0 based on the fig 6b the band gap energy of the pure tio2 and 1 5 wt w 0 06 wt c codoped tio2 nanoparticles is about 3 2 and 3 0 ev respectively 3 2 comparison between the photocatalytic activity of codoped and pure tio2 nanoparticles for landfill leachate treatment the performance of pure and w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles for leachate photocatalytic treatment was compared to ensure that the doping process was successfully conducted this comparison was conducted under the conditions of 10 59 g m 2 coating surface density 6 l min 1 leachate flow rate and 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod as observed in fig 7 w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles show much better performance than the pure tio2 nanoparticles paired t test was applied to evaluate the statistical significance of this improvement according to the sig value in the paired t test which was zero and less than 0 05 there is a significant difference between the performance of pure and w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles therefore doping the tio2 nanoparticles with w and c elements causes a significant improvement in the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation 3 3 determination of coating characteristics and durability of photocatalytic efficiency fesem analysis was performed on the coated glass plates to determine the status of the immobilized nanoparticles fig 8 a shows the top view of a coated glass plate with a magnification of 250 kx as observed the nanoparticles are fixed in a perfectly uniform and compact manner fig 8b shows a cross section view of the coated glass plate with a magnification of 250 kx as observed the thickness of the coated layer is about 400 nm and the nanoparticles are perfectly arranged and layered together the durability of photocatalytic efficiency in different cycles of operation was evaluated by conducting an experiment under the conditions of 10 59 g m 2 coating surface density 6 l min 1 recirculation flow rate 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod and 40 w light intensity the experiment was repeated three times without changing the plates and the photoreactor was operated for 60 h at each time fig 9 illustrates the results of the cod removal efficiency in three cycles according to the results the cod removal efficiency after 60 h photocatalytic treatment was 67 55 and 52 for first second and third cycle respectively therefore there is a good durability of photocatalytic efficiency in this coating method the photocatalytic efficiency of nanoparticles is reduced about 15 after 180 h the reason for this phenomenon is that some of the intermediates are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles and affect the adsorption ability of nanoparticles 40 41 3 4 investigating the effect of coating surface density on the efficiency of leachate cod removal different coating surface densities of nanoparticles including 2 65 10 59 16 77 and 21 18 g m 2 were coated on glass plates to investigate the effect of coating surface density in the experiments of this stage the initial leachate cod leachate recirculaton flow rate and light intensity were 550 mg l 1 6 l min 1 and four 10 w led lamps respectively as observed in fig 10 the cod removal efficiency for coating surface densities of 2 65 7 9 10 59 16 77 and 21 18 g m 2 after 60 h photocatalytic treatment is 28 57 67 81 and 82 respectively as the coating surface density increases the number of active sites on the surface and consequently the process efficiency increases by increasing the coating dose of immobilized nanoparticles from 2 65 to 16 77 g m 2 the thickness of the photocatalyst film changed from 62 2 nm to 400 nm in the presence of nanoparticles two simultaneous processes of adsorption and photocatalytic occur the increase in the photocatalyst layer thickness reduces the adsorption mechanism for the nanoparticles in the bottom layers 28 however if the photocatalyst layer thickness exceeds an optimum value the surface porosity of nanoparticles in the bottom layers will be reduced the nanoparticles will be compacted and consequently internal mass transfer rate will decrease according to fig 10b when the coating surface density increases from 16 77 to 21 18 g m 2 the increase in the cod removal efficiency is not significant therefore the optimum coating is 16 77 g m 2 the results of the present study are comparable to those of other researchers nawi et al showed that by increasing the coating surface density of photocatalyst from 3 3 16 4 g m 2 the photocatalyst layer thickness varies from 8 17 0 32 27 1 11 μm they found that as the catalyst surface density increased the catalyst thickness increased and the efficiency did not change significantly 42 43 3 5 investigating the effect of light intensity on the cod removal efficiency fig 11 indicates the effect of light intensity on the efficiency of leachate cod removal as observed the cod removal efficiency for the light intensity of 10 20 and 40 w after about 60 h photocatalytic treatment is 53 64 and 67 respectively therefore the cod removal efficiency increases with light intensity as the light intensity increases the nanoparticles absorb more photons resulting in more production of electron hole pairs on their surface 44 this causes the increase in the concentration of o h and o 2 and consequently the degradation rate of organic pollutants however as the light intensity increases the transfer rate of electrons and holes to the nanoparticles leachate interface decreases relative to the electron hole recombination rate since interfacial electron hole transfer is a first order process while the electron hole recombination is a second order process 44 due to a slight difference in process efficiency for the light intensity of 20 and 40 w the light intensity of 20 w is better to use the effect of sunlight irradiation on the photocatalytic activity of w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles was investigated by conducting an experiment under the conditions of 6 l min 1 recirculation flow rate 7 g m 2 coating surface density and 550 mg l 1 initial leachate cod and the results were compared with a similar experiment in which the light source was four 10 w led lamps as seen in fig 12 the cod removal efficiency was about 46 after 40 h photocatalytic treatment under the sunlight irradiation which is approximately the same as the performance of the process under the four 10 w led lamps irradiation 3 6 investigating the effect of leachate recirculation flow rate fig 13 shows the effect of leachate recirculation flow rate on the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal as observed the cod removal efficiency and reaction rate increase with a decrease in the leachate recirculation flow rate according to the observations the thickness of the leachate on glass plates increases and the amount of light transmission to nanoparticles decreases with an increase in recirculation flow rate 28 as a result lower electron hole pairs are produced on the nanoparticles surface this causes the increase in the concentration of o h and o 2 and consequently the degradation rate of organic pollutants based on the observations the thickness of leachate layer on the glass plates is 0 1 cm for the minimum flow rate and 1 5 cm for the maximum flow rate in addition interaction time among leachate and immobilized nanoparticles and consequently photocatalytic removal efficiency increases with a decrease in the flow rate 29 45 3 7 investigating the effect of initial leachate cod fig 14 illustrates the effect of initial leachate cod on the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal as observed the removal efficiency and reaction rate decrease with an increase in the initial leachate cod the reason is that as the initial leachate cod increases 1 the ratio of active particles to leachate molecules decreases 2 fewer photons reach the nanoparticle surface and consequently the generation of reactive species decreases 3 additional leachate molecules are adsorbed to the nanoparticle surface cover active surface sites and suppress the generation of reactive species 46 when the initial leachate cod increases from 550 to 10 100 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency after 60 h visible light irradiation decreases from 67 to 32 fig 15 shows the effect of initial leachate cod on the amount of removed cod during the photocatalytic treatment the amount of removed cod increases with initial cod because more pollutants are available to nanoparticles 3 8 langmuir hinshelwood kinetic modeling the apparent reaction rate was calculated by plotting the logarithmic changes in the leachate cod concentration versus the exposure time for leachates with different initial cod concentrations fig 16 a the slope of fitted regression line on the points represents the apparent rate of reaction kapp for each initial cod as seen the kapp decreases with an increase in the initial concentration of leachate cod in order to determine a model to estimate the temporal leachate cod during the photocatalytic treatment of leachate using cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles the graph of kapp value versus initial cod concentration was plotted then an equation in the form of eq 5 was fitted on the points fig 16b the equation of fitted line on the points of fig 16b is as eq 9 9 r d c l d t 0 01772 c l 1 0 000263 c 0 l k a p p c l using eq 9 temporal leachate cod during aforementioned process can be estimated with a correlation coefficient of 0 83 the kl h and kads for the process are 67 376 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 000263 mg l 1 respectively 4 conclusion the photocatalytic treatment efficiency of landfill leachate was studied using cascade photoreactor with immobilized w c codoped tio2 nanoparticles the nanoparticles were immobilized on four glass plates by doctor blade method and plates were placed on the steps the effect of four parameters of coating surface density light intensity leachate recirculation flow rate and initial leachate cod was experimentally investigated in addition the effect of using sunlight and visible light as a light source on the cod removal efficiency was compared based on the results the cod removal efficiency increased with increase in coating surface density in the range investigated 2 65 21 18 g m 2 the increase in the cod removal efficiency was higher when the coating surface density increased from 2 65 to 16 77 g m2 above 16 77 g m2 no significant enhancement was observed the cod removal efficiency increased with light intensity for the values investigated 10 20 and 40 w since a slight difference was observed between the process efficiency for the light intensity of 20 and 40 w a 20 w light intensity is better to use the cod removal efficiency and reaction rate increased with decrease in the leachate recirculation flow rate from 6 to 1 l min 1 increase of the initial leachate cod from 550 to 10 100 mg l 1 resulted in increase in the removed cod but decrease in the cod removal efficiency the effect of initial leachate cod on the reaction rate showed that the photocatalytic degradation of landfill leachate in the cascade photoreactor obeys the langmuir hinshelwood model the obtained values for k l h and k a d s were 67 376 mg l 1 h 1 and 0 000263 mg l 1 respectively the photocatalytic efficiency of leachate cod removal under sunlight irradiation was approximately equal to that under a 40 w light irradiation the cod removal of 46 was achieved after 40 h treatment for leachate with 550 mg l 1 initial cod the cod removal efficiency after 60 h irradiation of 40 w visible light for leachate with initial cod of 550 and 10 100 mg l 1 was 67 and 32 respectively the findings of this research offer new insights about determining optimum conditions for photocatalytic treatment of landfill leachate using cascade photoreactor under visible light irradiation on a modest and large scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13992,mixture of sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate contaminated effluent is produced by sodium dithionite industry which was treated by electrochemical oxidation process platinised titanium ti pt mesh and titanium ti mesh were used as anode and cathode respectively nafion 961 cation exchange membrane was used as ion exchanger and acted as separator in the membrane cell the investigation was done by potentiostatic mode 3 0 v the cyclic voltammetry cv study revealed the oxidation potential of thiosulfate and formate about 95 44 of sulfate conversion was achieved and 70 formate was mineralised by this new route dispersed sulfur particles were noticed in anolyte compartment and complete thiosulfate conversation was confirmed using uv vis spectroscopy and volumetric estimation besides caustic was recovered by this process keywords thiosulfate formate platinized titanium sulfate potentiostatic mode 1 introduction sodium dithionite industries produce effluent which consists of thiosulfate and formate as major components freezing and boiling methods are used for separation of thiosulfate and formate respectively in dithionite industries where both the compounds cannot be separated effectively the wastages of thiosulfate and formate increase the value of chemical oxygen demand and spoil soil environment therefore it is a need to treat effluent with respect to environmental concerns feng et al 1 reported that thiosulfate oxidation process has two stages and produces different intermediates at different potentials the first stage s2o3 2 was converted into s4o6 2 at 1 0 v vs saturated calomel electrode sce and tetrathionate was converted into sulfate molecules without formation of sulfur particles at 1 6 v vs sce ragauskas et al 2 observed two stages electro oxidation of thiosulfate for photography waste fixed solution using graphite electrodes bi et al 3 investigated thiosulfate anodic oxidation using oscillatory gold electrode at ph 6 5 buffer solution and observed two different types of intermediates such as s3o6 2 and s4o6 2 during electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate pikaar et al 4 suggested that oxidation by aeration is a better option for conversion of thiosulfate to sulfate some of the researchers did formate oxidation and converts into co2 by electrochemical methods 5 6 john et al 6 performed hcoo oxidation in alkaline medium using polycrystalline platinum electrode he reported that volatile co2 is the only oxidation product obtained in formate oxidation formate is also an important product in co2 reduction process karthikeyan et al 7 also reported conversion of co2 to formate effectively by electrochemical membrane process electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater with suitable electrodes was extensively studied by many researchers 8 11 decontamination of wastewater with synthetic organic dyes by electrochemical method was studied by brillas and huitle 12 subba rao and venkatarangaiah 13 reviewed the performance of metal oxides coated anodes sno2 pbo2 iro2 and ruo2 in wastewater treatment viz synthetic water phenol methamidophos real wastewater sample containing reactive yellow 160 alphazurine dye 2 4 dichlrophenol methyl red nitrophenol car wash wastewater methyl green sulfamethoxazole perfluorocarboxylic acid and oxalicacid etc however they concluded that the electrochemical oxidation involving metal oxides electrodes for the abatement of organics in wastewater is an effective tool to keep up aesthetic and environmental health the effective anodes viz pure platinum and titanium supported platinum anodes in electrochemical process for organics were noted by some investigators 14 17 electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate oxidation separately was studied by many investigators using different anode materials such as gold electrode glassy carbon graphite doped pbo2 and platinum 1 2 6 18 20 lamy and leger 21 studied the formic acid oxidation using pt electrode du et al 22 investigated the electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate using polycrystalline platinum disk recently selvaraj et al 23 reported the separation of thiosulfate and formate collected from dithionite industrial effluent using four compartment electrochemical membrane cell mono selective anion exchange membrane was used to separate thiosulfate and formate by selective electro dialysis process with ti tio2 ruo2 iro2 coated electrode they observed maximum efficiency at 30 ma cm2 current density where initial cell voltage was about 13 v vs sce since cell voltage was high in this study a new route was initiated to conversion of thiosulfate into sulfate besides platinum coated electrode was selected for oxidation of mixed thiosulfate and formate effluent in literature oxidation of thiosulfate and formate have been reported separately in different conditions despite that electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate from sodium dithionite industrial effluent have not been reported so far this is the first time a new route by electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate containing real industrial effluent using platinised titanium electrode for recovering useful products was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the effluent was collected from a sodium dithionite processing industry in tamil nadu india the collected effluent was stored at 4 c to avoid unwanted chemical and biological reactions for further study 2 2 experimental the collected effluent was diluted 10 times with distilled water which is used as anolyte and 2 g l of sodium hydroxide solution was used as catholyte in double compartment electrochemical membrane cell fig 1 the cell volume was about 250 ml two compartment electrochemical membrane cell was used in the present study 5 5 cm2 area of standard titanium mesh and 5 mm thick commercial platinised titanium mesh ti fab engineering chennai tamilnadu india were used as cathode and anode respectively nafion 961 cation exchange membrane was used as cation exchanger in the electrochemical cell the constant cell potential of 3 0 v was applied between the electrodes using dc power supply l6405 the potential of the electrodes and current density were measured frequently using data logger k pas electrolytes ph was monitored frequently using ph meter eutech the concentration of thiosulfate formate and sodium hydroxide were estimated every 30 min volumetric titration was used to estimate the concentration of sodium hydroxide and sulfite iodimetric titration method was used to estimate sodium thiosulfate concentration 24 sodium formate was estimated using standard method is 13475 1992 method a the anolyte was characterized using uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 between 200 800 nm the standard equation was used to calculate the energy consumption of the process 25 2 3 electrochemical study cyclic voltammogram study was used to determine the thiosulfate and sodium formate oxidation potential the studies were carried out with three electrode system using computer controlled autolab pgstat 302 potentiostat which which contains platinum pt mesh was used as working and counter electrode sce as a reference electrode the anodic oxidation potential window was fixed about 0 2 0 v with low scan rate about 20 mv s 0 1 n of sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate solutions were prepared before experiment using double distilled water freshly prepared solutions and diluted effluent were used as electrolytes in this study the experiments were repeated three times with freshly prepared solutions with fresh electrode 3 results and discussion the electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate along with recovery of caustic using two chambered electrochemical membrane cell was investigated the effluent contains 370 g l sodium formate and 300 g l of thiosulfate with ph of 12 the viscous nature of the effluent was 60 cp while starting the experiment the effluent was diluted the high concentration of the thiosulfate leads to the formation of colloidal sulfur particles at low ph and also affects the formate oxidation process hence the dilution is needed to oxidize thiosulfate into sulfate without sulfur formation the effluent was diluted 10 times 6 6 cp with distilled water where the diluted effluent contains 37 2 g l of sodium formate and 30 2 g l of sodium thiosulfate the ph of the diluted effluent was about 10 5 table 1 3 1 electrochemical oxidation using membrane cell in the present study potential was fixed for electrochemical oxidation process to improve the efficiency of oxidation of thiosulfate and formate platinised titanium was chosen hence potentiostatic mode was chosen to get better efficiency of oxidation of thiosulfate and formate hosimin et al and pikaar et al 26 27 noticed sulfur deposition on anode ti tio2 iro2 ruo2 during electrochemical oxidation of sodium sulfide at ph 7 carlos and huitle 12 reported that the poor oxidation action of pt o h in sulfate or acidic media was improved using nacl as supporting electrolyte or by adding a known amount of sodium chloride to the solution which gave much better performance due to the additional oxidation of organics with active chlorine species here no chloride was added due to alkaline nature ph 10 5 of the dithionite industrial effluent panizza and cerisola 8 also reported that the over potential for oxygen evolution of pt anodes is not very high when compared to ruo2 coated electrodes i e 1 6 v vs she in 0 5 m h2so4 therefore its behaviour for organic oxidation is similar to that of ru or ir based anodes it permits only selective conversion of pollutants with low current efficiency for mineralization hence platinised titanium mesh was used as an anode for combined electro oxidation of sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate where thiosulfate got oxidized into sulfate ions about 1 5 v vs sce where dispersed sulfur particles were also noticed fig 2 a b shows the concentration variation in anolyte and catholyte at anode compartment thiosulfate and formate concentration gradually decreased during electrolysis thiosulfate decreased from 30 g l to 1 37 g l at the end of the reaction the formate concentration reduced from 37 0 10 9 g l which indicates that 95 44 of thiosulfate and 70 of formate were oxidized by the electro chemical process within 9 h in cathode compartment the sodium hydroxide concentration gradually increased up to 44 4 g l 3 2 ph variation fig 3 shows the ph variation in electrolytes during the course of the electrochemical oxidation the anolyte ph gradually decreased from 10 9 to 5 2 due to increasing h ion concentration in the anolyte compartment which indicates that thiosulfate was oxidized effectively during the thiosulfate oxidation anolyte colour was changed which indicated the oxidation of formate and thiosulfate converted into various intermediates the initial colour of the diluted effluent was reddish yellow during electrochemical oxidation the colour was changed to light yellow pale yellow white and finally colourless initially catholyte ph slightly decreased due to leakage of h and ph gradually increased due to na ions move towards cathode compartment via cationic exchange membrane nafion 961 in cathode compartment water dissociation reaction occurred and formed as oh ions which reacted with na ions and increased the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the cathode compartment the slight decrease in the catholyte ph in double compartment membrane cell is due to h ions leakages from the anode compartment 26 fig 4 shows uv vis spectrum of sodium dithionite industry effluent and pure chemicals viz sodium formate sodium thiosulfate and formic acid initially the two different peaks were observed at 223 nm and 235 nm which represented sodium formate and sodium thiosulfate the peaks were exactly match with the mixture of pure sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate after electro chemical process thiosulfate peak disappeared and a peak at 223 nm indicated the presence of formate in the effluent which indicated that 95 44 thiosulfate was oxidized and converted as sulfate ion 70 of formate was reduced by electrochemical oxidation process here the formate couldn t be converted as formic acid in the effluent due to 70 of formate reduction co2 liberation also noticed the liberated carbon dioxide can be captured and converted into useful product using bio electrochemical process 7 the energy consumption was about 29 029 kw h g 3 3 oxidation of thiosulfate and formate it was noticed that electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate cannot be done by galvanostatic mode because the production of h ions where current creates low ph which converts thiosulfate into sulfur particles the formation of sulfur particles may hinder the electrochemical activity of the electrode hence potentiostatic mode was adopted for this study fig 5 shows cv curve of thiosulfate and formate oxidation potential using platinised titanium electrode the oxidation potential of sodium formate was between 0 4 v and 0 8 v vs sce and thiosulfate peak was observed at 1 2 1 6 v vs sce similarly while using the diluted sodium dithionite industry effluent for cv studies the above similar broad peaks were observed at the same potentials here the observed anodic oxidation peaks are representing the irreversible electrochemical reaction of the thiosulfate and formate based on the cv studies the electrochemical oxidation was done by potentiostatic mode during the electrolysis two different peaks were observed which are representing that thiosulfate to sulfate conversion at 1 0 v s2o3 2 got oxidized into s4o6 2 and at 1 5 v s4o6 2 was oxidized into so4 2 1 during the electrochemical oxidation the anolyte ph gradually decreased up to 5 2 therefore the formate oxidation was continuously occurred in the anolyte compartment john et al 6 reported that formate can be oxidized by two pathways direct and indirect pathways in direct pathway the hcoo oxidation occurs and converted into co2 gas reaction 1 and reactive intermediate was pt cooh in indirect pathway carbon monoxide was formed as intermediate and involved in further oxidation to form co2 molecules the oxidation potential was about 200 700 mv vs rhe for formate electro oxidation process 28 29 in the present study carbon dioxide was also liberated from formate oxidation at 400 mv vs sce during electrolysis thiosulfate was oxidized into sulfate where sulfur deposition could not be noticed on the electrode surface in this study sulfate concentration was not quantified in anolyte after electrochemical process during estimation of sulfate by gravimetric analysis the anolyte was acidified with aq hcl to below ph 3 at acid ph the sulfur particles also interfere with sulfate present in the anolyte therefore the sulfate estimation cannot be done quantitatively hence the indirect measurement of sulfate concentration was measured by estimating the initial and final concentration of thiosulfate present in the anolyte fig 6 shows the variation of the current density at constant potential during the electrochemical oxidation the current density gradually decreased due to low ionic concentration oxidation of thiosulfate formate and liberation of co2 based on the above observations a hypothesis can be proposed for thiosulfate and formate oxidation over the platinum surface fig 7 at alkaline ph and at 1 5 v vs sce the water gets oxidized and forms oh radicals which may involve in indirect thiosulfate oxidation process and converted into sulfate at 1 2 v vs sce eq 2 shows that the oh radical combined with s2o3 and involved

13992,mixture of sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate contaminated effluent is produced by sodium dithionite industry which was treated by electrochemical oxidation process platinised titanium ti pt mesh and titanium ti mesh were used as anode and cathode respectively nafion 961 cation exchange membrane was used as ion exchanger and acted as separator in the membrane cell the investigation was done by potentiostatic mode 3 0 v the cyclic voltammetry cv study revealed the oxidation potential of thiosulfate and formate about 95 44 of sulfate conversion was achieved and 70 formate was mineralised by this new route dispersed sulfur particles were noticed in anolyte compartment and complete thiosulfate conversation was confirmed using uv vis spectroscopy and volumetric estimation besides caustic was recovered by this process keywords thiosulfate formate platinized titanium sulfate potentiostatic mode 1 introduction sodium dithionite industries produce effluent which consists of thiosulfate and formate as major components freezing and boiling methods are used for separation of thiosulfate and formate respectively in dithionite industries where both the compounds cannot be separated effectively the wastages of thiosulfate and formate increase the value of chemical oxygen demand and spoil soil environment therefore it is a need to treat effluent with respect to environmental concerns feng et al 1 reported that thiosulfate oxidation process has two stages and produces different intermediates at different potentials the first stage s2o3 2 was converted into s4o6 2 at 1 0 v vs saturated calomel electrode sce and tetrathionate was converted into sulfate molecules without formation of sulfur particles at 1 6 v vs sce ragauskas et al 2 observed two stages electro oxidation of thiosulfate for photography waste fixed solution using graphite electrodes bi et al 3 investigated thiosulfate anodic oxidation using oscillatory gold electrode at ph 6 5 buffer solution and observed two different types of intermediates such as s3o6 2 and s4o6 2 during electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate pikaar et al 4 suggested that oxidation by aeration is a better option for conversion of thiosulfate to sulfate some of the researchers did formate oxidation and converts into co2 by electrochemical methods 5 6 john et al 6 performed hcoo oxidation in alkaline medium using polycrystalline platinum electrode he reported that volatile co2 is the only oxidation product obtained in formate oxidation formate is also an important product in co2 reduction process karthikeyan et al 7 also reported conversion of co2 to formate effectively by electrochemical membrane process electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater with suitable electrodes was extensively studied by many researchers 8 11 decontamination of wastewater with synthetic organic dyes by electrochemical method was studied by brillas and huitle 12 subba rao and venkatarangaiah 13 reviewed the performance of metal oxides coated anodes sno2 pbo2 iro2 and ruo2 in wastewater treatment viz synthetic water phenol methamidophos real wastewater sample containing reactive yellow 160 alphazurine dye 2 4 dichlrophenol methyl red nitrophenol car wash wastewater methyl green sulfamethoxazole perfluorocarboxylic acid and oxalicacid etc however they concluded that the electrochemical oxidation involving metal oxides electrodes for the abatement of organics in wastewater is an effective tool to keep up aesthetic and environmental health the effective anodes viz pure platinum and titanium supported platinum anodes in electrochemical process for organics were noted by some investigators 14 17 electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate oxidation separately was studied by many investigators using different anode materials such as gold electrode glassy carbon graphite doped pbo2 and platinum 1 2 6 18 20 lamy and leger 21 studied the formic acid oxidation using pt electrode du et al 22 investigated the electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate using polycrystalline platinum disk recently selvaraj et al 23 reported the separation of thiosulfate and formate collected from dithionite industrial effluent using four compartment electrochemical membrane cell mono selective anion exchange membrane was used to separate thiosulfate and formate by selective electro dialysis process with ti tio2 ruo2 iro2 coated electrode they observed maximum efficiency at 30 ma cm2 current density where initial cell voltage was about 13 v vs sce since cell voltage was high in this study a new route was initiated to conversion of thiosulfate into sulfate besides platinum coated electrode was selected for oxidation of mixed thiosulfate and formate effluent in literature oxidation of thiosulfate and formate have been reported separately in different conditions despite that electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate from sodium dithionite industrial effluent have not been reported so far this is the first time a new route by electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate containing real industrial effluent using platinised titanium electrode for recovering useful products was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the effluent was collected from a sodium dithionite processing industry in tamil nadu india the collected effluent was stored at 4 c to avoid unwanted chemical and biological reactions for further study 2 2 experimental the collected effluent was diluted 10 times with distilled water which is used as anolyte and 2 g l of sodium hydroxide solution was used as catholyte in double compartment electrochemical membrane cell fig 1 the cell volume was about 250 ml two compartment electrochemical membrane cell was used in the present study 5 5 cm2 area of standard titanium mesh and 5 mm thick commercial platinised titanium mesh ti fab engineering chennai tamilnadu india were used as cathode and anode respectively nafion 961 cation exchange membrane was used as cation exchanger in the electrochemical cell the constant cell potential of 3 0 v was applied between the electrodes using dc power supply l6405 the potential of the electrodes and current density were measured frequently using data logger k pas electrolytes ph was monitored frequently using ph meter eutech the concentration of thiosulfate formate and sodium hydroxide were estimated every 30 min volumetric titration was used to estimate the concentration of sodium hydroxide and sulfite iodimetric titration method was used to estimate sodium thiosulfate concentration 24 sodium formate was estimated using standard method is 13475 1992 method a the anolyte was characterized using uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 between 200 800 nm the standard equation was used to calculate the energy consumption of the process 25 2 3 electrochemical study cyclic voltammogram study was used to determine the thiosulfate and sodium formate oxidation potential the studies were carried out with three electrode system using computer controlled autolab pgstat 302 potentiostat which which contains platinum pt mesh was used as working and counter electrode sce as a reference electrode the anodic oxidation potential window was fixed about 0 2 0 v with low scan rate about 20 mv s 0 1 n of sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate solutions were prepared before experiment using double distilled water freshly prepared solutions and diluted effluent were used as electrolytes in this study the experiments were repeated three times with freshly prepared solutions with fresh electrode 3 results and discussion the electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate and formate along with recovery of caustic using two chambered electrochemical membrane cell was investigated the effluent contains 370 g l sodium formate and 300 g l of thiosulfate with ph of 12 the viscous nature of the effluent was 60 cp while starting the experiment the effluent was diluted the high concentration of the thiosulfate leads to the formation of colloidal sulfur particles at low ph and also affects the formate oxidation process hence the dilution is needed to oxidize thiosulfate into sulfate without sulfur formation the effluent was diluted 10 times 6 6 cp with distilled water where the diluted effluent contains 37 2 g l of sodium formate and 30 2 g l of sodium thiosulfate the ph of the diluted effluent was about 10 5 table 1 3 1 electrochemical oxidation using membrane cell in the present study potential was fixed for electrochemical oxidation process to improve the efficiency of oxidation of thiosulfate and formate platinised titanium was chosen hence potentiostatic mode was chosen to get better efficiency of oxidation of thiosulfate and formate hosimin et al and pikaar et al 26 27 noticed sulfur deposition on anode ti tio2 iro2 ruo2 during electrochemical oxidation of sodium sulfide at ph 7 carlos and huitle 12 reported that the poor oxidation action of pt o h in sulfate or acidic media was improved using nacl as supporting electrolyte or by adding a known amount of sodium chloride to the solution which gave much better performance due to the additional oxidation of organics with active chlorine species here no chloride was added due to alkaline nature ph 10 5 of the dithionite industrial effluent panizza and cerisola 8 also reported that the over potential for oxygen evolution of pt anodes is not very high when compared to ruo2 coated electrodes i e 1 6 v vs she in 0 5 m h2so4 therefore its behaviour for organic oxidation is similar to that of ru or ir based anodes it permits only selective conversion of pollutants with low current efficiency for mineralization hence platinised titanium mesh was used as an anode for combined electro oxidation of sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate where thiosulfate got oxidized into sulfate ions about 1 5 v vs sce where dispersed sulfur particles were also noticed fig 2 a b shows the concentration variation in anolyte and catholyte at anode compartment thiosulfate and formate concentration gradually decreased during electrolysis thiosulfate decreased from 30 g l to 1 37 g l at the end of the reaction the formate concentration reduced from 37 0 10 9 g l which indicates that 95 44 of thiosulfate and 70 of formate were oxidized by the electro chemical process within 9 h in cathode compartment the sodium hydroxide concentration gradually increased up to 44 4 g l 3 2 ph variation fig 3 shows the ph variation in electrolytes during the course of the electrochemical oxidation the anolyte ph gradually decreased from 10 9 to 5 2 due to increasing h ion concentration in the anolyte compartment which indicates that thiosulfate was oxidized effectively during the thiosulfate oxidation anolyte colour was changed which indicated the oxidation of formate and thiosulfate converted into various intermediates the initial colour of the diluted effluent was reddish yellow during electrochemical oxidation the colour was changed to light yellow pale yellow white and finally colourless initially catholyte ph slightly decreased due to leakage of h and ph gradually increased due to na ions move towards cathode compartment via cationic exchange membrane nafion 961 in cathode compartment water dissociation reaction occurred and formed as oh ions which reacted with na ions and increased the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the cathode compartment the slight decrease in the catholyte ph in double compartment membrane cell is due to h ions leakages from the anode compartment 26 fig 4 shows uv vis spectrum of sodium dithionite industry effluent and pure chemicals viz sodium formate sodium thiosulfate and formic acid initially the two different peaks were observed at 223 nm and 235 nm which represented sodium formate and sodium thiosulfate the peaks were exactly match with the mixture of pure sodium thiosulfate and sodium formate after electro chemical process thiosulfate peak disappeared and a peak at 223 nm indicated the presence of formate in the effluent which indicated that 95 44 thiosulfate was oxidized and converted as sulfate ion 70 of formate was reduced by electrochemical oxidation process here the formate couldn t be converted as formic acid in the effluent due to 70 of formate reduction co2 liberation also noticed the liberated carbon dioxide can be captured and converted into useful product using bio electrochemical process 7 the energy consumption was about 29 029 kw h g 3 3 oxidation of thiosulfate and formate it was noticed that electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate cannot be done by galvanostatic mode because the production of h ions where current creates low ph which converts thiosulfate into sulfur particles the formation of sulfur particles may hinder the electrochemical activity of the electrode hence potentiostatic mode was adopted for this study fig 5 shows cv curve of thiosulfate and formate oxidation potential using platinised titanium electrode the oxidation potential of sodium formate was between 0 4 v and 0 8 v vs sce and thiosulfate peak was observed at 1 2 1 6 v vs sce similarly while using the diluted sodium dithionite industry effluent for cv studies the above similar broad peaks were observed at the same potentials here the observed anodic oxidation peaks are representing the irreversible electrochemical reaction of the thiosulfate and formate based on the cv studies the electrochemical oxidation was done by potentiostatic mode during the electrolysis two different peaks were observed which are representing that thiosulfate to sulfate conversion at 1 0 v s2o3 2 got oxidized into s4o6 2 and at 1 5 v s4o6 2 was oxidized into so4 2 1 during the electrochemical oxidation the anolyte ph gradually decreased up to 5 2 therefore the formate oxidation was continuously occurred in the anolyte

13993,drying and storing of aerobic granules present a promising solution to the long startup period required for the cultivation of aerobic granular sludge this work investigated the influence of drying of aerobic granules on the degradation of organic substances and nutrients removal after reactivation mature aerobic granules were dehydrated air dried and inoculated to a different reactor after one day storage the reactor was operated for two months to examine the effect of the drying process on the performance of the reactivated granules in terms of organics and nutrients removal settling properties and structural stability the reactor was fed with a synthetic substrate at olr of 3 g cod l day results indicated that the stored and dried granules were rapidly reactivated achieving cod removal efficiency and ammonia nitrogen removal of over 90 after one day and was maintained until the end of the experiment the granules were able to restore the original performance after reactivation with specific removal rates of 1 2 g scod g mlss day 39 5 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 7 4 mg po4 p g mlss day in terms of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively which is comparable to that of the granule cultivating reactor with specific removal rates for cod ammonia and phosphorus of 0 7 g scod g mlss day 34 1 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 3 9 mg po4 p g mlss day the reactivated granules showed excellent settleability as indicated by svi30 below 60 ml g and granulation percentage of over 90 these results demonstrated the practical potential of drying of aerobic granules for the fast startup of granular sludge reactors further testing is required to determine the dried granule shelf life and the survival of important strains responsible for organics and nutrients removal keywords dried aerobic granular sludge fast startup nutrients removal organics removal re cultivation 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge technology has received growing attention as a promising wastewater treatment system in comparison with the conventional activated sludge process the new system exhibits outstanding settling simultaneous removal of organic substrates and nutrients in the same tank which leads to a smaller footprint lower capital and operational cost and higher removal efficiency 1 3 however slow granule formation unpredictable granule morphology granule disintegration and inefficient nutrients removal remain major challenges impeding the widespread of this technology in full scale applications 4 several months are required to cultivate the granules at a real wwtp from activated sludge 5 7 the use of stored granular inoculum was experimented for the fast startup of a pilot scale reactor by liu et al 8 where granules fully recovered after 2 days operation and new granules started to grow after 5 days the key point of storing granules is prolonging the granule stability by preventing the activity of proteolytic bacteria from causing intragranular protein hydrolysis 9 drying of granules has been proposed to allow convenient storage and handling of granules for use as inoculums for rapid startup and as granule supplement to enhance the treatment efficiency of bioreactors 10 granule drying was investigated using two methods acetone gradient to moisture content 1 with storage at room temperature and freezing at 20 c 11 12 granules were stored under these conditions for 40 days after the reinoculation of the dried granules similar results were found where granules in both methods recovered their full degradation capacity in terms of cod removal in 5 days however granules in the acetone gradient method experienced volume and weight losses by 80 during drying and recovery 11 out of the many suggested methods for storing the granules like freezing thawing method 12 and wet medium methods 13 17 the drying method is the most feasible most microbial activities are ceased in dried condition so prolonged storage is possible additionally dried granules are recoverable in a short time and with minimal loss of structural integrity 18 the drying process makes it easy to store and transport granules because the dehydration of sludge leads to tremendous volume and weight reduction therefore it would extremely reduce handling and transportation costs besides compared with the freezing method dried granules do not require to be stored at subfreezing temperatures which saves on energy costs 19 in previous studies however the drying process was not fully developed to allow for successful reactivation of the dried granules most of the published drying methods include an initial step of removal of surface moisture by adsorbent papers however this step can lead to deterioration of granule integrity and it is not practical for large scale applications besides the chemical methods published so far usually involves the use of a series of dehydration solutions with gradually increased organic portion and preserved in a liquid medium which is time and manpower consuming if applied in the industry moreover the characteristics of the reactivated granules in terms of their settleability along with their performance in terms of organics and nutrients removal were not established besides it is required to know the adaptability of dried granules for inoculation therefore in this study the drying procedures were simplified and preserved in a sealed bag at room temperature which is convenient for large quantity production the granules were reinoculated at different conditions from that of cultivation in the reactivation phase in order to assess the adaptability of dried granules for real application and determine the performance during long operational periods the objectives of this work are to 1 asses the feasibility of the air drying method for drying of aerobic granules 2 determine the settling properties of reactivated granules 3 investigate the performance of dried granules in terms of organics and nutrients removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 aerobic granular sludge cultivation aerobic granules were cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 20 l and an internal diameter of 15 cm labeled as the granulator reactor gr the reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h and fed with an influent chemical oxygen demand cod of 1500 mg l aeration was provided from the bottom of the reactor via fine bubble diffuser and the airflow velocity was set as 2 4 cm s the influent was fed through a port placed at the bottom of the reactor and the effluent was discharged through the outlet port located at the middle of the reactor resulting in a 50 volumetric exchange ratio ver the reactor was operated sequentially with a cycle time of 4 h influent feeding for 40 min aeration for 192 min settling for 3 min and decanting for 5 min the characteristics of the gr is shown in table 1 2 2 drying process of granular sludge mature granules were collected from the gr and those with a size greater than 1 mm were selected for dehydration for 2 h using dehydration solution which consists of acetone isopropanol 95 5 v v afterwards the granules were air dried while mixing accelerated by using an electric fan fig 1 shows the flowchart of the drying process with the photos being illustrated in fig 2 the average dehydration rate of dried granules was 98 the dried granules were stored at room temperature in a sealed plastic bag to prevent moisture until being used after a one day storage period for the experimental campaign 2 3 reactivation of dried granules a cylindrical acrylic reactor with an internal diameter of 8 9 cm and a working volume of 4 4 l labeled r1 was operated in sbr mode for the reactivation of the dried granules the ver was 35 resulting in hrt of 11 4 h the dried granules stored for one day were used as seed sludge the operation strategy for the reactivation reactor followed the same schedule as that of gr the weight of the seed dried granules was adjusted to have an initial food to microorganisms ratio f m of 1 g cod g mlvss day 2 4 wastewater composition synthetic wastewater with sodium acetate as the main carbon source was used in this study macro and micro nutrients were also added to the influent including nh4cl kh2po4 cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o feso4 7h2o and microelements as described by tay et al 20 the composition of synthetic wastewater is summarized in table 2 the initial substrate cod concentration in the influent was adjusted to achieve an organic loading rate olr of 3 kg cod m3 day with a cod n ratio of 3 2 5 analytical methods biomass characteristics such as mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and svi30 were analyzed according to the standard methods 21 influent and effluent samples were collected and filtered through 0 45 μm membranes soluble cod scod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were measured using hach dr 2400 hach company with hach kits following the usepa reactor digestion method cod lr and hr and salicylate method tnt plus 830 831 and 832 ulr lr hr respectively phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p was measured using metrohm compact ic granule images were taken using ipad pro 9 7 inch and particle size was determined using motic image plus 2 35 software version 2 3 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance and treatment efficiency fig 3 a shows the scod removal efficiency by the reactor during the operational period of 2 months the reactor removed over 90 of scod after day 1 and kept this stable removal efficiency till the end of the experiment table 3 summarizes the comparison of reactivation time with previous literature dried granules were able to reach their original treatment performance much quicker than other storage methods indicated in the literature compared to the removal performance after 1 day of reactivation using the wet medium and freezing storage methods 14 15 17 the drying method proposed in this paper showed higher removal rates the removal rates for wet medium and freezing storage methods were 13 90 8 27 and 23 in terms of cod ammonia phosphorus respectively whereas in this work the removal efficiency for r1 was 97 in terms of cod and neither ammonia nor phosphorus was detected in the effluents these results indicate that the proposed drying methods could lead to efficient reactivation therefore the wet medium method takes 4 16 days and the freezing method takes 1 5 days until removal performance reaches the original performance or becomes stable 13 17 on the other hand the drying method needs 1 2 days 11 22 23 from these results the combination of drying and dehydration methods adopted in this study showed shorter or similar recovery time for heterotrophs to regain their original bioactivities this observation suggested that the dried granules could restore the organic degradation ability in a very short time after undergoing the dehydration and air drying process fig 3 b demonstrates the profiles of influent and effluent ammonia nitrogen effluent nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations and the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency during the operational period the reactor showed over 90 ammonium nitrogen removal from the beginning and continued to the end of the experiment these results indicate that the drying process does not negatively affect the aob activity and survival for starting up in addition complete nitrogen removal was observed since neither nitrates nor nitrites were detected in the effluents throughout the experimental period which suggested that denitrification occurred as for other storage methods 14 15 the ammonia removal rates after 1 day of reactivation were in the range of 8 27 and it took about 5 11 days for ammonia removal performance to stabilize around 80 in this study after 1 day the reactor recovered the original performance before undergoing drying table 3 fig 3 c showed the profile of phosphate po4 removal efficiency by the reactor r1 removed over 90 of po4 p after one day reactivation and the removal efficiency remained stable until the end of the experiment yuan et al 15 reported that the removal efficiency of phosphate phosphorus after 1 day reactivation was around 20 and it took 7 days to restore phosphorus removal completely when 12 months of storage granules under wet medium condition kept at ambient temperature in order to compare the performance of the granules after reactivation to that of the cultivation reactor gr the specific substrate removal rates in terms of cod ammonia and phosphorus were calculated the results showed that the specific removal rates for gr were 0 7 g scod g mlss day 34 1 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 3 9 mg po4 p g mlss day in terms of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively and that for r1 were 1 2 g scod g mlss day 39 5 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 7 4 mg po4 p g mlss day based on this analysis dried granules were able to restore the original performance after reactivation when comparing the results from this work with other previous studies table 3 some differences were noticed especially in the required recovery time for stored granules among the different storage methods under stress conditions such as nutrient starvation cells can transfer to a dormant state where the growth rate is almost zero with neither proliferates nor kills 24 himeoka and kaneko 25 reported that the lag time for cells at dormant state to resume their growth depends not only on the starvation time but also on the starvation process i e the speed of substrate reduction with a slow environmental change the production speed of component a which represents the active components or molecules that contribute to autocatalytic growth becomes slow as the external substrate decrease and the component b which represents waste products or other molecules that are produced with the aid of component a but do not facilitate growth accumulates and the chemical reaction would cease because the ratio of component b to that of component a is increased along with a decrease in the external substrate concentration for example in wet medium storage under ambient temperature 16 it takes 2 months for stored granules to reach the lowest activity by that time almost all the component a molecules are arrested and their catalytic activity is inhibited through a complex formation with component b the ratio of component b to component a inside granule is high by the time as a result when the external substrate is reintroduced cell growth will be halted by the lack of component a and requires a long time for functional recovery on the other hand under a quick environmental change in which the concentration of external substrate decreases faster than the internal chemical reaction the reaction would stop on condition that component a is abundant due to the lack of reaction time therefore it can be considered that the dried granules are stored in a state that the activity can be resumed immediately upon exposure to a substrate rich environment since component a is ready to work by removing available substrate outside quickly through the drying process besides the lag time needed for the recovery of bacterial growth is also affected due to the difference in the growth rate of each bacteria himeoka and kaneko 25 also highlighted that the lag time is inversely related to the maximal growth rate of bacteria the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is usually higher than that of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos thus cod removal performance can be recovered within a shorter time than nutrients removal in terms of quick startup for the bioreactor especially on nutrients removal the difference in the required recovery time is promising besides it is also worth mentioning that despite the change in the operational conditions between the cultivation gr and the operation r1 the dried granules showed a high capability to acclimate quickly to the new conditions this observation implies the high flexibility and the adaptability nature of the dried granules which opens the door for the dried granules towards different applications in practice 3 2 characteristics of granules after reactivation fig 4 a shows the variation of mlss concentration in the reactors during the operation time the mlss concentration showed an increasing trend indicating that the dried granules can resume their biomass growth after going through the drying process the decline in the biomass concentration at the beginning was a result of a temporary foaming issue due to the chemicals used during the granule desiccation process resulting in the washout of granules from the reactors during the initial few hours the seed dried granules that were discharged out of the reactor due to foaming were collected and returned to the reactor after 1 day of operation the foaming issue was solved without any intervention self remediated the foaming issue might be due to the dehydration chemicals used during the drying process as shown in fig 4 b the svi30 and sv30 sv5 values in the reactor showed that the biomass had good settleability with sv30 sv5 over 90 initially the svi30 was high due to the washout of granules which was attributed to foaming issues as detailed earlier this led to an apparent increase in svi due to the decline in mlss concentration however as foaming was resolved the svi decreases with the recovery of mlss concentration fig 4 c shows the size distribution of granules in the reactor the initial average diameter was 1 95 mm since mature granules were selected for drying after reactivation the percentage of granules larger than 2 0 mm increased from 42 at the beginning of the experimental period to 77 on day 7 and 95 on day 13 and the average diameter stabilized around 2 7 2 9 mm at a percentage of 88 93 until the end of the experiment moreover the granules maintained its structural integrity and smooth surface morphology after reactivation and throughout the experimental period as shown in fig 5 3 3 changes in the appearance of granules during the reactivation process to sustain the high settleability the granular sludge is required to hold a distinct structure of spherical shape particles throughout the drying process and after reinoculation for that purpose granule selection based on size was adopted which ensured the elimination of filaments and small flocs and led to retaining only

13993,drying and storing of aerobic granules present a promising solution to the long startup period required for the cultivation of aerobic granular sludge this work investigated the influence of drying of aerobic granules on the degradation of organic substances and nutrients removal after reactivation mature aerobic granules were dehydrated air dried and inoculated to a different reactor after one day storage the reactor was operated for two months to examine the effect of the drying process on the performance of the reactivated granules in terms of organics and nutrients removal settling properties and structural stability the reactor was fed with a synthetic substrate at olr of 3 g cod l day results indicated that the stored and dried granules were rapidly reactivated achieving cod removal efficiency and ammonia nitrogen removal of over 90 after one day and was maintained until the end of the experiment the granules were able to restore the original performance after reactivation with specific removal rates of 1 2 g scod g mlss day 39 5 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 7 4 mg po4 p g mlss day in terms of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively which is comparable to that of the granule cultivating reactor with specific removal rates for cod ammonia and phosphorus of 0 7 g scod g mlss day 34 1 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 3 9 mg po4 p g mlss day the reactivated granules showed excellent settleability as indicated by svi30 below 60 ml g and granulation percentage of over 90 these results demonstrated the practical potential of drying of aerobic granules for the fast startup of granular sludge reactors further testing is required to determine the dried granule shelf life and the survival of important strains responsible for organics and nutrients removal keywords dried aerobic granular sludge fast startup nutrients removal organics removal re cultivation 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge technology has received growing attention as a promising wastewater treatment system in comparison with the conventional activated sludge process the new system exhibits outstanding settling simultaneous removal of organic substrates and nutrients in the same tank which leads to a smaller footprint lower capital and operational cost and higher removal efficiency 1 3 however slow granule formation unpredictable granule morphology granule disintegration and inefficient nutrients removal remain major challenges impeding the widespread of this technology in full scale applications 4 several months are required to cultivate the granules at a real wwtp from activated sludge 5 7 the use of stored granular inoculum was experimented for the fast startup of a pilot scale reactor by liu et al 8 where granules fully recovered after 2 days operation and new granules started to grow after 5 days the key point of storing granules is prolonging the granule stability by preventing the activity of proteolytic bacteria from causing intragranular protein hydrolysis 9 drying of granules has been proposed to allow convenient storage and handling of granules for use as inoculums for rapid startup and as granule supplement to enhance the treatment efficiency of bioreactors 10 granule drying was investigated using two methods acetone gradient to moisture content 1 with storage at room temperature and freezing at 20 c 11 12 granules were stored under these conditions for 40 days after the reinoculation of the dried granules similar results were found where granules in both methods recovered their full degradation capacity in terms of cod removal in 5 days however granules in the acetone gradient method experienced volume and weight losses by 80 during drying and recovery 11 out of the many suggested methods for storing the granules like freezing thawing method 12 and wet medium methods 13 17 the drying method is the most feasible most microbial activities are ceased in dried condition so prolonged storage is possible additionally dried granules are recoverable in a short time and with minimal loss of structural integrity 18 the drying process makes it easy to store and transport granules because the dehydration of sludge leads to tremendous volume and weight reduction therefore it would extremely reduce handling and transportation costs besides compared with the freezing method dried granules do not require to be stored at subfreezing temperatures which saves on energy costs 19 in previous studies however the drying process was not fully developed to allow for successful reactivation of the dried granules most of the published drying methods include an initial step of removal of surface moisture by adsorbent papers however this step can lead to deterioration of granule integrity and it is not practical for large scale applications besides the chemical methods published so far usually involves the use of a series of dehydration solutions with gradually increased organic portion and preserved in a liquid medium which is time and manpower consuming if applied in the industry moreover the characteristics of the reactivated granules in terms of their settleability along with their performance in terms of organics and nutrients removal were not established besides it is required to know the adaptability of dried granules for inoculation therefore in this study the drying procedures were simplified and preserved in a sealed bag at room temperature which is convenient for large quantity production the granules were reinoculated at different conditions from that of cultivation in the reactivation phase in order to assess the adaptability of dried granules for real application and determine the performance during long operational periods the objectives of this work are to 1 asses the feasibility of the air drying method for drying of aerobic granules 2 determine the settling properties of reactivated granules 3 investigate the performance of dried granules in terms of organics and nutrients removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 aerobic granular sludge cultivation aerobic granules were cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 20 l and an internal diameter of 15 cm labeled as the granulator reactor gr the reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h and fed with an influent chemical oxygen demand cod of 1500 mg l aeration was provided from the bottom of the reactor via fine bubble diffuser and the airflow velocity was set as 2 4 cm s the influent was fed through a port placed at the bottom of the reactor and the effluent was discharged through the outlet port located at the middle of the reactor resulting in a 50 volumetric exchange ratio ver the reactor was operated sequentially with a cycle time of 4 h influent feeding for 40 min aeration for 192 min settling for 3 min and decanting for 5 min the characteristics of the gr is shown in table 1 2 2 drying process of granular sludge mature granules were collected from the gr and those with a size greater than 1 mm were selected for dehydration for 2 h using dehydration solution which consists of acetone isopropanol 95 5 v v afterwards the granules were air dried while mixing accelerated by using an electric fan fig 1 shows the flowchart of the drying process with the photos being illustrated in fig 2 the average dehydration rate of dried granules was 98 the dried granules were stored at room temperature in a sealed plastic bag to prevent moisture until being used after a one day storage period for the experimental campaign 2 3 reactivation of dried granules a cylindrical acrylic reactor with an internal diameter of 8 9 cm and a working volume of 4 4 l labeled r1 was operated in sbr mode for the reactivation of the dried granules the ver was 35 resulting in hrt of 11 4 h the dried granules stored for one day were used as seed sludge the operation strategy for the reactivation reactor followed the same schedule as that of gr the weight of the seed dried granules was adjusted to have an initial food to microorganisms ratio f m of 1 g cod g mlvss day 2 4 wastewater composition synthetic wastewater with sodium acetate as the main carbon source was used in this study macro and micro nutrients were also added to the influent including nh4cl kh2po4 cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o feso4 7h2o and microelements as described by tay et al 20 the composition of synthetic wastewater is summarized in table 2 the initial substrate cod concentration in the influent was adjusted to achieve an organic loading rate olr of 3 kg cod m3 day with a cod n ratio of 3 2 5 analytical methods biomass characteristics such as mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and svi30 were analyzed according to the standard methods 21 influent and effluent samples were collected and filtered through 0 45 μm membranes soluble cod scod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were measured using hach dr 2400 hach company with hach kits following the usepa reactor digestion method cod lr and hr and salicylate method tnt plus 830 831 and 832 ulr lr hr respectively phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p was measured using metrohm compact ic granule images were taken using ipad pro 9 7 inch and particle size was determined using motic image plus 2 35 software version 2 3 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance and treatment efficiency fig 3 a shows the scod removal efficiency by the reactor during the operational period of 2 months the reactor removed over 90 of scod after day 1 and kept this stable removal efficiency till the end of the experiment table 3 summarizes the comparison of reactivation time with previous literature dried granules were able to reach their original treatment performance much quicker than other storage methods indicated in the literature compared to the removal performance after 1 day of reactivation using the wet medium and freezing storage methods 14 15 17 the drying method proposed in this paper showed higher removal rates the removal rates for wet medium and freezing storage methods were 13 90 8 27 and 23 in terms of cod ammonia phosphorus respectively whereas in this work the removal efficiency for r1 was 97 in terms of cod and neither ammonia nor phosphorus was detected in the effluents these results indicate that the proposed drying methods could lead to efficient reactivation therefore the wet medium method takes 4 16 days and the freezing method takes 1 5 days until removal performance reaches the original performance or becomes stable 13 17 on the other hand the drying method needs 1 2 days 11 22 23 from these results the combination of drying and dehydration methods adopted in this study showed shorter or similar recovery time for heterotrophs to regain their original bioactivities this observation suggested that the dried granules could restore the organic degradation ability in a very short time after undergoing the dehydration and air drying process fig 3 b demonstrates the profiles of influent and effluent ammonia nitrogen effluent nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations and the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency during the operational period the reactor showed over 90 ammonium nitrogen removal from the beginning and continued to the end of the experiment these results indicate that the drying process does not negatively affect the aob activity and survival for starting up in addition complete nitrogen removal was observed since neither nitrates nor nitrites were detected in the effluents throughout the experimental period which suggested that denitrification occurred as for other storage methods 14 15 the ammonia removal rates after 1 day of reactivation were in the range of 8 27 and it took about 5 11 days for ammonia removal performance to stabilize around 80 in this study after 1 day the reactor recovered the original performance before undergoing drying table 3 fig 3 c showed the profile of phosphate po4 removal efficiency by the reactor r1 removed over 90 of po4 p after one day reactivation and the removal efficiency remained stable until the end of the experiment yuan et al 15 reported that the removal efficiency of phosphate phosphorus after 1 day reactivation was around 20 and it took 7 days to restore phosphorus removal completely when 12 months of storage granules under wet medium condition kept at ambient temperature in order to compare the performance of the granules after reactivation to that of the cultivation reactor gr the specific substrate removal rates in terms of cod ammonia and phosphorus were calculated the results showed that the specific removal rates for gr were 0 7 g scod g mlss day 34 1 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 3 9 mg po4 p g mlss day in terms of cod ammonia and phosphorus respectively and that for r1 were 1 2 g scod g mlss day 39 5 mg nh3 n g mlss day and 7 4 mg po4 p g mlss day based on this analysis dried granules were able to restore the original performance after reactivation when comparing the results from this work with other previous studies table 3 some differences were noticed especially in the required recovery time for stored granules among the different storage methods under stress conditions such as nutrient starvation cells can transfer to a dormant state where the growth rate is almost zero with neither proliferates nor kills 24 himeoka and kaneko 25 reported that the lag time for cells at dormant state to resume their growth depends not only on the starvation time but also on the starvation process i e the speed of substrate reduction with a slow environmental change the production speed of component a which represents the active components or molecules that contribute to autocatalytic growth becomes slow as the external substrate decrease and the component b which represents waste products or other molecules that are produced with the aid of component a but do not facilitate growth accumulates and the chemical reaction would cease because the ratio of component b to that of component a is increased along with a decrease in the external substrate concentration for example in wet medium storage under ambient temperature 16 it takes 2 months for stored granules to reach the lowest activity by that time almost all the component a molecules are arrested and their catalytic activity is inhibited through a complex formation with component b the ratio of component b to component a inside granule is high by the time as a result when the external substrate is reintroduced cell growth will be halted by the lack of component a and requires a long time for functional recovery on the other hand under a quick environmental change in which the concentration of external substrate decreases faster than the internal chemical reaction the reaction would stop on condition that component a is abundant due to the lack of reaction time therefore it can be considered that the dried granules are stored in a state that the activity can be resumed immediately upon exposure to a substrate rich environment since component a is ready to work by removing available substrate outside quickly through the drying process besides the lag time needed for the recovery of bacterial growth is also affected due to the difference in the growth rate of each bacteria himeoka and kaneko 25 also highlighted that the lag time is inversely related to the maximal growth rate of bacteria the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is usually higher than that of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos thus cod removal performance can be recovered within a shorter time than nutrients removal in terms of quick startup for the bioreactor especially on nutrients removal the difference in the required recovery time is promising besides it is also worth mentioning that despite the change in the operational conditions between the cultivation gr and the operation r1 the dried granules showed a high capability to acclimate quickly to the new conditions this observation implies the high flexibility and the adaptability nature of the dried granules which opens the door for the dried granules towards different applications in practice 3 2 characteristics of granules after reactivation fig 4 a shows the variation of mlss concentration in the reactors during the operation time the mlss concentration showed an increasing trend indicating that the dried granules can resume their biomass growth after going through the drying process the decline in the biomass concentration at the beginning was a result of a temporary foaming issue due to the chemicals used during the granule desiccation process resulting in the washout of granules from the reactors during the initial few hours the seed dried granules that were discharged out of the reactor due to foaming were collected and returned to the reactor after 1 day of operation the foaming issue was solved without any intervention self remediated the foaming issue might be due to the dehydration chemicals used during the drying process as shown in fig 4 b the svi30 and sv30 sv5 values in the reactor showed that the biomass had good settleability with sv30 sv5 over 90 initially the svi30 was high due to the washout of granules which was attributed to foaming issues as detailed earlier this led to an apparent increase in svi due to the decline in mlss concentration however as foaming was resolved the svi decreases with the recovery of mlss concentration fig 4 c shows the size distribution of granules in the reactor the initial average diameter was 1 95 mm since mature granules were selected for drying after reactivation the percentage of granules larger than 2 0 mm increased from 42 at the beginning of the experimental period to 77 on day 7 and 95 on day 13 and the average diameter stabilized around 2 7 2 9 mm at a percentage of 88 93 until the end of the experiment moreover the granules maintained its structural integrity and smooth surface morphology after reactivation and throughout the experimental period as shown in fig 5 3 3 changes in the appearance of granules during the reactivation process to sustain the high settleability the granular sludge is required to hold a distinct structure of spherical shape particles throughout the drying process and after reinoculation for that purpose granule selection based on size was adopted which ensured the elimination of filaments and small flocs and led to retaining only granules of distinct and clear surface morphology for the subsequent drying process in addition quick dehydration by both chemical drying agents and air drying helped in ceasing or minimizing the extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion which is the main factor responsible for granules aggregation clumping fig 5a1 a4 illustrates the digital images of the dried granules through dehydrating drying and reactivation as seen through the drying and reactivation the tested granules maintained their sphericity besides the reinoculated dried granules showed distinct and smooth surface morphology and mostly following discrete particle settling with very little interaction among granules after reactivation fig 5b1 c4 due to the ability to avoid granules clumping together or aggregating and extreme volume reduction during drying 4 conclusion the drying and reactivation process is considered a promising solution for the rapid startup of ags systems which can promote the use of ags in real full scale wastewater treatment applications this work investigated granule drying and recovery after reactivation for organic substrates and nutrients removal capacity under operational conditions and reactor hydrodynamics different from that of cultivation for the first time it proved the stable performance and durability for long term operation in terms of organics and

13994,sludge floating generally occurred in different anammox reactors while the microbial difference between settling and floating sludge still unclear in this study the comprehensive investigation of microbial features between floating sludge and size fractionated settling sludge was conducted in a stably operated anammox reactor firstly scanning electron microscope image showed that mounts of long filament and a few gas tunnels were found in floating sludge while cocci and bacilli were stacked in settling sludge microbial diversity was gradually decreased as the sludge aggregation the microbial community structure and composition of floating sludge fg were more similar to large size fractionated sludge sg l and away from the small size fractionated sludge sg s anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia tended to enrich in small size fractionated sludge accounting for 46 3 while the large particle size feature and starved condition of floating sludge induced the decrease of candidatus jettenia accounting for 23 5 meanwhile denitrifying bacteria dok59 rapidly enriched in large size fractionated sludge and floating sludge accounting for 8 9 and 9 8 respectively network analysis showed that complex microbial interrelationships bring a robust microbial community in the sg l sample while the fg sample in the anammox reactor obtained an unstable microbial community moreover the microbial community of fg has narrow niche breadths based on the low betweenness and node transitivity these results obtained in this study extended our understanding of sludge floating in the anammox reactor and emphasized the crucial role of microorganisms keywords anammox granular sludge sludge floating size fractionated sludge community structure microbial interrelationship 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process gradually applied to the mainstream wastewater treatment plants with the energy saving 1 3 as the core microorganisms anammox bacteria has long generation time and low proliferation rate 4 and anammox biomass is the critical factor for high efficiency operation 5 in multiple anammox reactors granular sludge was used as the effective cultivation system for anammox bacteria 6 8 however the sludge floating phenomenon in anammox reactor is prevalently occurred with the long term operation resulting in the serious loss of anammox biomass 9 10 moreover the floating problem usually inevitably and cannot be ignored 11 due to the universality of sludge floating numerous studies have focused to elucidate the mechanisms of sludge floating 12 14 lu et al 13 combined with previous results on the structure density and sedimentation of anammox granular sludge in high load up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors proposed a hypothetical mechanism of sludge floating the sludge floating divided into three steps 13 15 16 1 the necessary gas channels are formed due to the microbial gas production during the anammox process 2 with the granular sludge size increase the nitrogen generated inside the granular sludge needs to be released over a longer distance and requires more pressure inside the particles which makes the cell gap become looser and subsequently forming a balloon 3 anammox granular sludge produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric substance eps under high nitrogen load 9 17 blocking the gas channel 18 as the trapped nitrogen gas exceeds the critical value 5 7 the density of granular sludge was less than water inducing the sludge floating although previous studies have investigated the causes and mechanisms of sludge floating in anammox reactors most were focused on the reactor operating conditions and physicochemical parameters of the granular sludge e g influent nitrogen loading rate 10 reactor temperature 15 particle size 12 19 granular sludge density 13 gas channel and airbag volume 13 20 the microbial community structure and composition played a critical role in the bioreactor have not been comprehensively explored regarding the floating anammox sludge as for the floating sludge in other reactors such as anaerobic methanogenic reactor the different microbial community structure between floating granular sludge and settling granular sludge was found in previous studies 21 22 thus it is necessary to characterize the microbial features of both floating and settling sludge in an anammox reactor and elucidate the microbial mechanisms of sludge floating in addition the hypothetical mechanism of sludge floating indicated that the increased size of the granular sludge appeared to be a necessary process before the granular sludge floated 13 20 it has also been observed in lab scale anammox reactors that floating sludge generally possessed a large particle size while the particle size of settling sludge was widely distributed 23 therefore it is important to investigate the increase process of particle size during sludge aggregation and may track the direct source of floating sludge in this study different size fractionated settling sludge and floating sludge in a lab scale anammox reactor were comprehensively investigated the sludge morphological features were preliminarily surveyed using scanning electron microscope sem high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to characterize the difference of microbial diversity community structure and composition between settling and floating sludge meanwhile interspecies relationship network analysis was also explored through to track sludge floating probable reasons from a microbial interaction perspective through the compared analysis among different size fractionated settling sludge and floating sludge this study may provide direct data for sludge floating research and extend our knowledge regarding the microbial roles in the floating process 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of the anammox reactor in this study a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 5 8 l was adopted to achieve the anammox process fig s1 the reactor was operated in continuous mode with the combined activated sludge and biofilm system and used the non woven as the biomass carriers synthetic wastewater containing nh4 2so4 nano2 k2hpo mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml l of trace element as described by van de graaf et al 24 with a molar ratio of ammonium and nitrite at 1 details are shown in table s1 was fed into the reactor the operation temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt of anammox reactor were adjusted to 35 c and 10 h respectively under the anaerobic condition without aeration the dissolved oxygen in the reactor measured during the operation was maintained at 0 2 0 4 mg l before the experiment the reactor has been stably operated for more than one year with total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 77 05 details are shown in table s2 2 2 sample collection and chemical analyses the mixed granular sludge collected from the anammox reactor was firstly washed three times with deionized water and then stood for 3 5 min in a 500 ml glass beaker the floating granular sludge fg was picked up with a mesh pocket diameter 0 2 mm 19 after the floating granular sludge drained this study collected a portion of the mixed settling granular sludge sg the settling granular sludge was classified on basis of grain size through wet sieving which produced three different size groups including less than 0 1 mm sg s 0 1 2 mm sg m and above 2 mm sg l the collection process above was conducted in quintuplicate from the reactor after collected all sludge samples were separately mixed with ethanol with the volume ratio at 1 1 and then frozen at 20 c prior to dna extraction during the operation of the anammox reactor the influent and effluent were sampled and then immediately filtered through disposable millipore filters 0 45 μm pore size the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were determined according to standard methods 25 scanning electron microscope sem images of fg and sg samples were obtained using a scanning electron microscope quanta 400 fei usa and the sample pretreatment followed the protocol described by a previous study 26 raw

order to evaluate the microbial community the v4 v5 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primer set 519f 5 cagccgccgcggtaa 3 with error correcting tag and 915r 5 gtgctcccccgccaattcct 3 27 pcr amplification was conducted in triplicate with 60 μl reaction system under following 31 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 52 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 45 s with a final extension at 72 c for 10 min pcr products were equimolar pooled and purified together with a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen chatsworth ca usa according to the standard protocols a mixture of the amplicons was sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa raw sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database with the bio project accession number prjna593167 2 4 bioinformatics and statistics analyses raw sequencing data were processed following the pipelines of qiime and mothur software package 28 29 only the first 250 bp after the proximal pcr primer was used for further analysis the barcode and primer sequences were removed 30 paired end reads were assigned to samples on the base of their unique barcode and merged with mothur software once removing the barcode and primer sequences sequences were classified into operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity 31 the taxonomic information of each representative sequence was annotated using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier algorithm via the silva ssu database with a confidence threshold of 80 32 in addition the numbers of sequencing read of each sample were normalized at the same sequencing depth 20 000 reads each to avoid biases during the comparison alpha diversity indices were calculated using qiime software to measure the microbial diversity including observed species pd whole tree chao1 simpson and shannon indexes to evaluate the changes in the microbial community of granular sludge non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds was conducted with unweighted unifrac distance through qiime pipeline meanwhile the analysis of group similarities permanova was calculated to evaluate the difference in community composition using the software past moreover in order to further explore the difference in community structure between anammox granule samples the t test statistical analysis method was used to test the difference in microbial composition between groups in addition the biomarkers among different groups were identified using the filtered data with linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse as described 33 the threshold on the logarithmic lda score for the discriminative feature was set to 3 5 in this study the microbial interactions in floating granular sludge fg and large size fractionated settling granular sludge sg l were also revealed through network analysis two groups of phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens constructed via random

the number of nodes number of edges average degree avgk average cluster coefficient avgcc and modularity 3 results and discussion 3 1 anammox reactor performance and sludge morphological features before the sludge sample collection the influent and effluent were monitored for three months n 21 to confirm the stable performance of the anammox reactor as shown in table s2 a stable tn removal was achieved and corresponding to the removal efficiency of 77 05 3 26 considering the working volume and hrt of the reactor the obtained tn loading removal rate in the reactor reached 0 4 kg n m 3 d 1 similar to other anammox systems with combined granular sludge and biofilm 36 37 meanwhile the effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations decreased to 10 0 5 7 and 4 7 4 4 mg l respectively in addition high nitrate accumulation was detected in the reactor and the effluent concentration reached 38 1 8 6 mg l before sludge sampling with the long term operation the diameters of anammox granular sludge varied from 0 1 mm to 20 mm and an obvious sludge floating occurred in the reactor fig s1 sludge floating generally observed in the anammox reactor and thus this study classified the granular sludge into two types i e fg and sg shown in fig 1 a after the detecting of particle size this study found that fg generally presented a large morphology particle size mostly more than 2 mm which was also observed in the previous study that higher eps contents in fg could promote the formation of larger particles 38 in comparison sg exhibited a wide range of particle size distribution including 0 1 mm and 2 mm granular sludge it has frequently reported that gas pockets would be formed inside the sludge along with the enlarge of granules and induced the decrease in density 9 13 hence the small particle size evidently observed in sg and the large size sludge inevitably floated in the reactor in this study sem images were used to distinguish the morphological difference between fg and sg fig 1b the fg image represented that floating sludge mainly composed of the meshes between filamentous bacteria and the cavities in the inner layers meanwhile a few typically coccoid and bacilliform cells was also found in the floating sludge indicating the existence of anammox bacteria 39 however the coccoid and bacilliform cell was found as the predominant microorganism in the settling sludge and filamentous bacteria were seldom detected in the sg sample as previous studies reported 13 38 40 looser structure with gas tunnels was also observed on the surface of the settling sludge promoting the gas bubbles diffusion to the surface based on the above results the morphological difference between floating and settling sludge not only included the gas tunnels but also inflected in the microorganism configuration e g cocci bacilli and long filament 3 2 the obvious difference in microbial communities of floating and settling sludge sludge morphological features and previous study both revealed that microbial composition evidently changed in floating and settling sludge 38 thus 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was also used in this study to assess microbial diversity and community structure of fg and sg samples as shown in fig 2 a the microbial richness observed species chao1 and pd whole tree indexes and evenness shannon index of fg sample decreased significantly in comparison with that of sg sample the significant decrease of the microbial diversity in fg sample suggested that sludge floating inhibited the enrichment of most microorganisms 41 furthermore the microbial community structure of fg and sg was analyzed as shown in fig 2b six phyla with relative abundance 1 were detected in both samples and the remaining sequences were assigned to a cluster named others the results showed that planctomycetes accounting for 43 0 51 1 was identified as the predominant microorganisms in the reactor followed by chloroflexi 11 8 21 1 proteobacteria 13 8 18 5 chlorobi 5 5 18 0 and bacteroidetes 2 0 15 0 a similar microbial structure composition has also reported in another anammox reactor 42 indicating the stable microbial community of anammox sludge however the significant difference between fg and sg was only identified in bacteroidetes relative abundance ranged from 2 0 to 15 0 this result together with the microbial diversity indicated that sludge floating slightly affects the microbial composition consisting of the previous study reported 38 it should be noticed that the low parallelism of the microbial community was confirmed in the settling sludge which may result from the widespread of particle size distribution previous study has proved that obvious changes in the microbial community occurred in size fractionated sludge 42 leading to large differences among the quintuplicate sg parallel samples in this work thus it is necessary to separately investigate the changes in the microbial community between size fractionated sg and fg samples 3 3 a comprehensive comparison of microbial community structure between size fractionated settling and floating sludge in this study three different size fractionated sg samples sg s sg m and sg l were separately compared with the fg sample through 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing as shown in fig 3 a the alpha diversity indexes indicated that no significant difference in microbial richness chao 1 and observed species was found between sg l and fg samples while microbial richness evidently increased in sg m and sg s samples this study accurately revealed that microbial richness decreased accompanied by sludge aggregation process 43 and anammox sludge floating generally associated with low microbial richness in addition the microbial evenness shannon and simpson was also decreased as the sludge aggregation but a little recovery was observed in the fg sample compared with sg l further demonstrating the slight changes of microbial diversity along with sludge floating interestingly the decreased microbial diversity occurred as the sludge aggregation which was also indicated in the previous studies that the microorganism enrichment could become faster through reducing sludge aggregation and increasing biomass specific electron transfer capacity 42 44 45 in this study a total of 432 351 271 and 275 otus were detected in sg s sg m sg l and fg samples respectively fig s2 further showing the high microbial diversity of sg s and sg m samples the unique otus in sg l and fg samples separately reached 60 and 64 while that in sg s and fg samples separately reached 209 and 52 these results indicated that the difference in microbial diversity was more remarkable between floating sludge and small size granular sludge microbial community composition was further identified at the phylum and genus levels in this study as shown in fig 3b the relative abundance of planctomycetes gradually decreased with the sludge aggregation ranging from 56 12 to 20 07 in the anammox reactor not only anammox bacteria affiliated to planctomycetes but also the phycisphaerae playing important roles in autotrophic nitrogen removal system park et al 2010 in addition the relative abundance of chlorobi obviously increased in the floating sludge ranging from 21 5 to 57 7 previous study revealed that chlorobi micro organisms were the predominant degraders of extracellular proteins 46 47 and thus higher eps contents in fg promote the enrichment of chlorobi in addition the high enrichment of bacteria in fg was mainly associated with ignavibacteriaceae cytophagaceae cryomorphaceae unclassified genera and dok59 while others high abundant bacteria enriched in sg s granular sludge fig 3c meanwhile the differential microorganisms were associated with nitrogen removal bacteria such as candidatus jettenia suggesting that functional bacteria responsible for nitrogen removal obviously varied in different size fractionated sludge 42 this phenomenon will particularly be discussed in the next section further the differential microbial biomarkers were identified in the four group granular sludge through lefse analysis fig 3d the lefse result showed that numerous different taxonomic clades were validated as active biomarkers with the lda scores higher than 3 5 fig s3 interestingly multiple representative biomarkers enriched in sg s and fg such as planctomycetes chloroflexi anaerolineae phycisphaerae and ignavibacteria while only gammaproteobacteria and phyciaphaerales were identified as biomarkers in sg m and sg l respectively this result proved that the remarkable difference in microbial composition between floating sludge and small size granular sludge similarly it has been demonstrated that sludge type significantly affects the microbial community composition in bioreactors 48 including the anammox reactor 49 one the other hand this study suggested that a significant difference in microbial community structure was also found between sg s and fg samples and between sg m and fg samples through permanova analysis p 0 05 nmds results based on the abundance of otus showed that obviously succession in the microbial community occurred accompanied by sludge aggregating and floating fig 3e moreover the microbial community structure from sg s to fg showed a distinct succession process suggesting the highly similar microbial community between fg and sg l p permanova 0 05 in addition this result implied that most floating sludges were direct sourced from high size fractionated sludge overall microbial diversity composition and structure were all significantly changed in the floating sludge and the high size fractionated sludge more easily floated than small size fractionated sludge meanwhile due to the inevitable of sludge floating with the sludge aggregation in the anammox reactor further control strategies should be conducted to alleviate sludge floating or utilize floating sludge to achieve high efficiency nitrogen removal 3 4 variations among functional bacteria responsible for nitrogen removal in this study multiple nitrogen removal functional bacteria were discussed in floating and settling sludge including anammox bacteria ammonium oxidation bacteria aob nitrite oxidation bacteria nob and denitrifying bacteria fig 4 only two genera of anammox bacteria were detected in the reactor i e candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia candidatus jettenia was the predominant anammox bacteria in sg s 46 3 sg m 28 7 sg l 21 8 and fg 23 5 samples while the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia increased from 0 1 to 0 3 with the sludge aggregation hence the relative abundance of anammox bacteria greatly decreased in floating sludge indicating the inappropriate conditions in floating sludge this phenomenon disagreed with the previous study which reported that the starvation of anammox bacteria in floating sludge inducing a bit lower abundance than that in settling sludge 38 meanwhile this study found a continuous decrease in the relative abundance of anammox bacteria with sludge aggregation demonstrating that sludge particle size may be played an important role in an anammox reactor 50 it has also been elucidated that anammox bacteria priorly enriched in intermediate particle size sludge 51 i e particle size ranging from 0 5 mm to 0 9 mm however anammox bacteria presented a high enriched efficiency in small size fractionated sludge in this study the above results associated with previous studies revealed that not only the lack of substance starvation 38 but also the sludge morphological features mainly particle size 51 determined the enrichment of anammox bacteria the investigative anammox reactor in this study was operated with the combined activated sludge and biofilm system and the biofilm and floccular features facilitated the enrichment of anammox bacteria whereas the framework of high size fractionated granular sludge was mainly composed of heterotrophic bacteria 52 resulting in the low abundance of anammox bacteria overall the starved condition and large particle size feature of floating sludge simultaneous induced the decrease of anammox bacteria although the anammox reactor was operated without aeration aob genus nitrosomonas and nob nitrospira were detected in the four groups corresponding to the relative abundance lower than 1 fig 4a in numerous anammox systems anammox bacteria generally coexisted with aob and nob which could be involved in the nitrogen removal process 49 53 this study revealed that a high relative abundance of aob and nob were detected in sg s samples which may result from the residual oxygen in influent since the low mass transfer resistance and oxygen osmotic pressure in small size fractionated sludge 54 aob and nob were more inclined to grow in sg s samples which was consistent with the previous study that nitrification achieved a high activity in flocs 49 in this autotrophic system dok59 which are known to have denitrification capabilities 55 was identified as the predominant denitrifying bacteria in fg 9 8 sg l 8 9 sg m 5 5 and sg s 3 6 fig 3c and others denitrifying bacteria were possessed low relative abundance in the four groups fig 4a without the external carbon source the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria presented a continuously increase with the sludge aggregation moreover floating sludge possessed the highest abundance of dok59 which may result from the adequate organic substance mainly dead cell for denitrifying bacteria to reduce nitrate and nitrite 56 in addition other low abundance of denitrifying bacteria e g thauera and dechloromonas were enriched in sg s samples indicating that large size fractionated sludge was more beneficial for the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria dok59 moreover the changes in the microbial community of floating sludge produced amounts of dead cells as an internal carbon source and the multiple extracellular polymeric substances in granular sludge further benefited denitrifying bacteria in conclusion the functional bacteria composition of fg was different from that of sg especially for sg s samples and the sludge aggregation features i e from small size sg s increased to large size sg l were primary factors that caused these differences 3 5 network associations in fg and sg l microbial communities numerous studies have verified that microbial diversity community structure and composition obviously changed between floating and settling sludge 21 22 however the interspecies relationship played an important role in the wastewater treatment system 57 determining the co occurrence patterns due to the similarly microbial structure and composition between fg and sg l samples this study further characterized the interspecies relationships to track probable microbial reasons for sludge floating as shown in fig 5 two overall networks of the whole microbial communities were constructed producing 159 nodes and 379 edges in fg and 149 nodes and 678 edges in sg l this result suggested that a stronger association found in the large size fractionated sludge instead of floating sludge it has been accepted that more complex interspecies relationships bring a robust microbial community 58 and thus floating sludge in the anammox reactor may obtain an unstable microbial community based on the topological features of networks tables s3 s4 and s5 ignavibacteriaceae cytophagaceae cryomorphaceae and comamonadaceae showed a higher degree of centrality in fg whereas in sg l were gemmataceae piscirickettsiaceae aby1 and cryomorphaceae indicating the forceful association with other species in contrast comamonadaceae fimbriimonadaceae gemmataceae and ignavibacteriaceae had a higher betweenness centrality than other microorganisms in the fg whereas in sg l sample were opb56 cakdilineaceae chlorobi and sja 36 suggesting that these microorganisms may affect the interactions within the microbial community in this study 16 and 13 potential functional modules were separately generated in fg and sg l based on the strength of association among different nodes the link of intra associations between modules in fg was greater than that in sg l suggesting the intensive distribution of nodes in fg however the modules were dispersedly in the sg l network and the values of betweenness and node transitivity were higher than that in fg indicating the wide distribution of nodes in sg l thus the microbial community of settling sludge had a wider niche breadth than that of fg 4 conclusion the main conclusions of this work are as follows 1 gas tunnels and microorganism configuration e g cocci bacilli and long filament were mainly morphological differences between floating and settling sludge 2 the decreased microbial diversity occurred as the sludge aggregation and the microbial community structure and composition of floating sludge were more similar to large size fractionated sludge 3 the starved condition and large particle size feature of floating sludge simultaneous induced the decrease of candidatus jettenia while denitrifying bacteria dok59 rapidly enriched in large size fractionated sludge and floating sludge 4 complex microbial interrelationships bring a robust microbial community

13994,sludge floating generally occurred in different anammox reactors while the microbial difference between settling and floating sludge still unclear in this study the comprehensive investigation of microbial features between floating sludge and size fractionated settling sludge was conducted in a stably operated anammox reactor firstly scanning electron microscope image showed that mounts of long filament and a few gas tunnels were found in floating sludge while cocci and bacilli were stacked in settling sludge microbial diversity was gradually decreased as the sludge aggregation the microbial community structure and composition of floating sludge fg were more similar to large size fractionated sludge sg l and away from the small size fractionated sludge sg s anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia tended to enrich in small size fractionated sludge accounting for 46 3 while the large particle size feature and starved condition of floating sludge induced the decrease of candidatus jettenia accounting for 23 5 meanwhile denitrifying bacteria dok59 rapidly enriched in large size fractionated sludge and floating sludge accounting for 8 9 and 9 8 respectively network analysis showed that complex microbial interrelationships bring a robust microbial community in the sg l sample while the fg sample in the anammox reactor obtained an unstable microbial community moreover the microbial community of fg has narrow niche breadths based on the low betweenness and node transitivity these results obtained in this study extended our understanding of sludge floating in the anammox reactor and emphasized the crucial role of microorganisms keywords anammox granular sludge sludge floating size fractionated sludge community structure microbial interrelationship 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process gradually applied to the mainstream wastewater treatment plants with the energy saving 1 3 as the core microorganisms anammox bacteria has long generation time and low proliferation rate 4 and anammox biomass is the critical factor for high efficiency operation 5 in multiple anammox reactors granular sludge was used as the effective cultivation system for anammox bacteria 6 8 however the sludge floating phenomenon in anammox reactor is prevalently occurred with the long term operation resulting in the serious loss of anammox biomass 9 10 moreover the floating problem usually inevitably and cannot be ignored 11 due to the universality of sludge floating numerous studies have focused to elucidate the mechanisms of sludge floating 12 14 lu et al 13 combined with previous results on the structure density and sedimentation of anammox granular sludge in high load up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors proposed a hypothetical mechanism of sludge floating the sludge floating divided into three steps 13 15 16 1 the necessary gas channels are formed due to the microbial gas production during the anammox process 2 with the granular sludge size increase the nitrogen generated inside the granular sludge needs to be released over a longer distance and requires more pressure inside the particles which makes the cell gap become looser and subsequently forming a balloon 3 anammox granular sludge produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric substance eps under high nitrogen load 9 17 blocking the gas channel 18 as the trapped nitrogen gas exceeds the critical value 5 7 the density of granular sludge was less than water inducing the sludge floating although previous studies have investigated the causes and mechanisms of sludge floating in anammox reactors most were focused on the reactor operating conditions and physicochemical parameters of the granular sludge e g influent nitrogen loading rate 10 reactor temperature 15 particle size 12 19 granular sludge density 13 gas channel and airbag volume 13 20 the microbial community structure and composition played a critical role in the bioreactor have not been comprehensively explored regarding the floating anammox sludge as for the floating sludge in other reactors such as anaerobic methanogenic reactor the different microbial community structure between floating granular sludge and settling granular sludge was found in previous studies 21 22 thus it is necessary to characterize the microbial features of both floating and settling sludge in an anammox reactor and elucidate the microbial mechanisms of sludge floating in addition the hypothetical mechanism of sludge floating indicated that the increased size of the granular sludge appeared to be a necessary process before the granular sludge floated 13 20 it has also been observed in lab scale anammox reactors that floating sludge generally possessed a large particle size while the particle size of settling sludge was widely distributed 23 therefore it is important to investigate the increase process of particle size during sludge aggregation and may track the direct source of floating sludge in this study different size fractionated settling sludge and floating sludge in a lab scale anammox reactor were comprehensively investigated the sludge morphological features were preliminarily surveyed using scanning electron microscope sem high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to characterize the difference of microbial diversity community structure and composition between settling and floating sludge meanwhile interspecies relationship network analysis was also explored through to track sludge floating probable reasons from a microbial interaction perspective through the compared analysis among different size fractionated settling sludge and floating sludge this study may provide direct data for sludge floating research and extend our knowledge regarding the microbial roles in the floating process 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of the anammox reactor in this study a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 5 8 l was adopted to achieve the anammox process fig s1 the reactor was operated in continuous mode with the combined activated sludge and biofilm system and used the non woven as the biomass carriers

table s1 was fed into the reactor the operation temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt of anammox reactor were adjusted to 35 c and 10 h respectively under the anaerobic condition without aeration the dissolved oxygen in the reactor measured during the operation was maintained at 0 2 0 4 mg l before the experiment the reactor has been stably operated for more than one year with total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 77 05 details are shown in table s2 2 2 sample collection and chemical analyses the mixed granular sludge collected from the anammox reactor was firstly washed three times with deionized water and then stood for 3 5 min in a 500 ml glass beaker the floating granular sludge fg was picked up with a mesh pocket diameter 0 2 mm 19 after the floating granular sludge drained this study collected a portion of the mixed settling granular sludge sg the settling granular sludge was classified on basis of grain size through wet sieving which produced three different size groups including less than 0 1 mm sg s 0 1 2 mm sg m and above 2 mm sg l the collection process above was conducted in quintuplicate from the reactor after collected all sludge samples were separately mixed with ethanol with the volume ratio at 1 1 and then frozen at 20 c prior to dna extraction during the operation of the anammox reactor the influent and effluent were sampled and then immediately filtered through disposable millipore filters 0 45 μm pore size the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were determined according to standard methods 25 scanning electron microscope sem images of fg and sg samples were obtained using a scanning electron microscope quanta 400 fei usa and the sample pretreatment followed the protocol described by a previous study 26 raw sludge was firstly washed with deionized water for several times and then fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c for 12 h after being washed five times 20 min for each time with 0 1 mol l phosphate

sem analysis 2 3 dna extraction and 16s rrna sequencing the total dna was extracted from 0 25 g wet sludge using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the instruction of the manufacturer dna quality and concentration were confirmed using a 2 agarose gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa in order to evaluate the microbial community the v4 v5 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primer set 519f 5 cagccgccgcggtaa 3 with error correcting tag and 915r 5 gtgctcccccgccaattcct 3 27 pcr amplification was conducted in triplicate with 60 μl reaction system under following 31 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 52 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 45 s with a final extension at 72 c for 10 min pcr products were equimolar pooled and purified together with a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen chatsworth ca usa according to the standard protocols a mixture of the amplicons was sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa raw sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database with the bio project accession number prjna593167 2 4 bioinformatics and statistics analyses raw sequencing data were processed following the pipelines of qiime and mothur software package 28 29 only the first 250 bp after the proximal pcr primer was used for further analysis the barcode and primer sequences were removed 30 paired end reads were assigned to samples on the base of their unique barcode and merged with mothur software once removing the barcode and primer sequences sequences were classified into operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity 31 the taxonomic information of each representative sequence was annotated using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier algorithm via the silva ssu database with a confidence threshold of 80 32 in addition the numbers of sequencing read of each sample were normalized at the same sequencing depth 20 000 reads each to avoid biases during the comparison alpha diversity indices were calculated using qiime software to measure the microbial diversity including observed species pd whole tree chao1 simpson and shannon indexes to evaluate the changes in the microbial community of granular sludge non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds was conducted with unweighted unifrac distance through qiime pipeline meanwhile the analysis of group similarities permanova was calculated to evaluate the difference in community composition using the software past moreover in order to further explore the difference in community structure between anammox granule samples the t test statistical analysis method was used to test the difference in microbial composition between groups in addition the biomarkers among different groups were identified using the filtered data with linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse as described 33 the threshold on the logarithmic lda score for the discriminative feature was set to 3 5 in this study the microbial interactions in floating granular sludge fg and large size fractionated settling granular sludge sg l were also revealed through network analysis two groups of phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens constructed via random matrix theory based rmt interface approach in molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena according to previous studies 34 35 subsequently the network visualized using gephi

the number of nodes number of edges average degree avgk average cluster coefficient avgcc and modularity 3 results and discussion 3 1 anammox reactor performance and sludge morphological features before the sludge sample collection the influent and effluent were monitored for three months n 21 to confirm the stable performance of the anammox reactor as shown in table s2 a stable tn removal was achieved and corresponding to the removal efficiency of 77 05 3 26 considering the working volume and hrt of the reactor the obtained tn loading removal rate in the reactor reached 0 4 kg n m 3 d 1 similar to other anammox systems with combined granular sludge and biofilm 36 37 meanwhile the effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations decreased to 10 0 5 7 and 4 7 4 4 mg l respectively in addition high nitrate accumulation was detected in the reactor and the effluent concentration reached 38 1 8 6 mg l before sludge sampling with the long term operation the diameters of anammox granular sludge varied from 0 1 mm to 20 mm and an obvious sludge floating occurred in the reactor fig s1 sludge floating generally observed in the anammox reactor and thus this study classified the granular sludge into two types i e fg and sg shown in fig 1 a after the detecting of particle size this study found that fg generally presented a large morphology particle size mostly more than 2 mm which was also observed in the previous study that higher eps contents in fg could promote the formation of larger particles 38 in comparison sg exhibited a wide range of particle size distribution including 0 1 mm and 2 mm granular sludge it has frequently reported that gas pockets would be formed inside the sludge along with the enlarge of granules and induced the decrease in density 9 13 hence the small particle size evidently observed in sg and the large size sludge inevitably floated in the reactor in this study sem images were used to distinguish the morphological difference between fg and sg fig 1b the fg image represented that floating sludge mainly composed of the meshes between filamentous bacteria and the cavities in the inner layers meanwhile a few typically coccoid and bacilliform cells was also found in the floating sludge indicating the existence of anammox bacteria 39 however the coccoid and bacilliform cell was found as the predominant microorganism in the settling sludge and filamentous bacteria were seldom detected in the sg sample as previous studies reported 13 38 40 looser structure with gas tunnels was also observed on the surface of the settling sludge promoting the gas bubbles diffusion to the surface based on the above results the morphological difference between floating and settling sludge not only included the gas tunnels but also inflected in the microorganism configuration e g cocci bacilli and long filament 3 2 the obvious difference in microbial communities of floating and settling sludge sludge morphological features and previous study both revealed that microbial composition evidently changed in floating and settling sludge 38 thus 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was also used in this study to assess microbial diversity and community structure of fg and sg samples as shown in fig 2 a the microbial richness observed species chao1 and pd whole tree indexes and evenness shannon index of fg sample decreased significantly in comparison with that of sg sample the significant decrease of the microbial diversity in fg sample suggested that sludge floating inhibited the enrichment of most microorganisms 41 furthermore the microbial community structure of fg and sg was analyzed as shown in fig 2b six phyla with relative abundance 1 were detected in both samples and the remaining sequences were assigned to a cluster named others the results showed that planctomycetes accounting for 43 0 51 1 was identified as the predominant microorganisms in the reactor followed by chloroflexi 11 8 21 1 proteobacteria 13 8 18 5 chlorobi 5 5 18 0 and bacteroidetes 2 0 15 0 a similar microbial structure composition has also reported in another anammox reactor 42 indicating the stable microbial community of anammox sludge however the significant difference between fg and sg was only identified in bacteroidetes relative abundance ranged from 2 0 to 15 0 this result together with the microbial diversity indicated that sludge floating slightly affects the microbial composition consisting of the previous study reported 38 it should be noticed that the low parallelism of the microbial community was confirmed in the settling sludge which may result from the widespread of particle size distribution previous study has proved that obvious changes in the microbial community occurred in size fractionated sludge 42 leading to large differences among the quintuplicate sg parallel samples in this work thus it is necessary to separately investigate the changes in the microbial community between size fractionated sg and fg samples 3 3 a comprehensive comparison of microbial community structure between size fractionated settling and floating sludge in this study three different size fractionated sg samples sg s sg m and sg l were separately compared with the fg sample through 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing as shown in fig 3 a the alpha diversity

were detected in sg s sg m sg l and fg samples respectively fig s2 further showing the high microbial diversity of sg s and sg m samples the unique otus in sg l and fg samples separately reached 60 and 64 while that in sg s and fg samples separately reached 209 and 52 these results indicated that the difference in microbial diversity was more remarkable between floating sludge and small size

that large size fractionated sludge was more beneficial for the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria dok59 moreover the changes in the microbial community of floating sludge produced amounts of dead cells as an internal carbon source and the multiple extracellular polymeric substances in granular sludge further benefited denitrifying bacteria in conclusion the functional bacteria composition of fg was different from that of sg especially for sg s samples and the sludge aggregation features i e from small size sg s increased to large size sg l were primary factors that caused these differences 3 5 network associations in fg and sg l microbial communities numerous studies have verified that microbial diversity community structure and composition obviously changed between floating and settling sludge 21 22 however the interspecies relationship played an important role in the wastewater treatment system 57 determining the co occurrence patterns due to the similarly microbial structure and composition between fg and sg l samples this study further characterized the interspecies relationships to track probable microbial reasons for sludge floating as shown in fig 5 two overall networks of the whole microbial communities were constructed producing 159 nodes and 379 edges in fg and 149 nodes and 678 edges in sg l this result suggested that a stronger association found in the large size fractionated sludge instead of floating sludge it has been accepted that more complex interspecies relationships bring a robust microbial community 58 and thus floating sludge in the anammox reactor may obtain an unstable microbial community based on the topological features of networks tables s3 s4 and s5 ignavibacteriaceae cytophagaceae cryomorphaceae and comamonadaceae showed a higher degree of centrality in fg whereas in sg l were gemmataceae piscirickettsiaceae aby1 and cryomorphaceae indicating the forceful association with other species in contrast comamonadaceae fimbriimonadaceae gemmataceae and ignavibacteriaceae had a higher betweenness centrality than other microorganisms in the fg whereas in sg l sample were opb56 cakdilineaceae chlorobi and sja 36 suggesting that these microorganisms may affect the interactions within the microbial community in this study 16 and 13 potential functional modules were separately generated in fg and sg l based on the strength of association among different nodes the link of intra associations between modules in fg was greater than that in sg l suggesting the intensive distribution of nodes in fg however the modules were dispersedly in the sg l network and the values of betweenness and node transitivity were higher than that in fg indicating the wide distribution of nodes in sg l thus the microbial community of settling sludge had a wider niche breadth than that of fg 4 conclusion the main conclusions of this work are as follows 1 gas tunnels and microorganism configuration e g cocci bacilli and long filament were mainly morphological differences between floating and settling sludge 2 the decreased microbial diversity occurred as the sludge aggregation and the microbial community structure and composition of floating sludge were more similar to large size fractionated sludge 3 the starved condition and large particle size feature of floating sludge simultaneous induced the decrease of candidatus jettenia while denitrifying bacteria dok59 rapidly enriched in large size fractionated sludge and floating sludge 4 complex microbial interrelationships bring a robust microbial community of large size fractionated sludge sg l while floating sludge in the anammox reactor obtained an unstable microbial community declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of
