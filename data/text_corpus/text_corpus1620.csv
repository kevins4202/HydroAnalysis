8100,study region the peace athabasca delta a ramsar wetland of international importance in northeastern alberta is protected within wood buffalo national park and contributes to its unesco world heritage status yet is threatened by climate change and upstream energy projects study focus recent drawdown of the delta s abundant shallow lakes and rivers has deteriorated vital habitat for wildlife and impaired navigation routes here we report continuous measurements at 50 lakes during open water seasons of 2018 and 2019 to improve understanding of hydrological processes causing lake level variation new hydrological insights for the region analyses reveal four patterns of lake level variation attributable to influential hydrological processes which provide the basis for a new lake classification scheme 1 drawdown 15 cm decline by evaporation and or outflow after ice jam floods 2 stable lake levels 15 cm change sustained by rainfall 3 gradual rise by inundation from the open drainage network and 4 rapid rise by input of river floodwater river flooding during the open water season is an under recognized recharge mechanism yet occurred extensively in the athabasca sector and appears to be a common occurrence based on the athabasca river hydrometric record lake level loggers show strong ability to track shifts in hydrological processes and can be integrated with other methods to decipher their causes and ecological consequences across water rich landscapes keywords floodplain lakes shallow lakes lake level variation lake monitoring open water season flooding peace athabasca delta 1 introduction water security is a rising concern in western canada where climate warming has reduced snowpack and glacier volumes and altered the timing and amount of streamflow to downstream ecosystems bonsal et al 2019 debeer and sharp 2007 hugonnet et al 2021 sauchyn et al 2015 tennant and menounos 2013 wolfe et al 2008 at the peace athabasca delta pad in northeastern alberta major energy projects upstream pose additional potential threats to security of water supply lebel et al 2011 prowse and conly 2000 prowse et al 2006 schindler and donahue 2006 these include regulation of peace river flow for hydroelectric production which alters the seasonal distribution of discharge peters and prowse 2001 and withdrawal of athabasca river water within the alberta oil sands region which reduces discharge mannix et al 2010 the delta s waterways provide important access to traditional territory of indigenous people and the hundreds of small 1 km2 shallow lakes furnish productive habitat for a diversity of wildlife where lake level fluctuations influence population density hood 2020 straka et al 2018 vannini and vannini 2019 ward et al 2018 2020 eighty percent of the pad is protected within wood buffalo national park wbnp a unesco world heritage site and the delta is a ramsar wetland of international importance much of the remaining area is the traditional territory of the athabasca chipewyan first nation ir 201 recent observations of lake drying and decline of river levels have led to a petition to include wbnp on unesco s list of world heritage in danger mcfn 2014 recommendations to improve understanding and causes of lake level variations over space and time whc iucn 2017 and an action plan to implement research and monitoring approaches to assess cumulative impacts and inform decision making by stakeholders wbnp 2019 the abundant shallow lakes of the pad have been distinguished into three main hydrological categories open drainage restricted drainage closed drainage based on differences in their connectivity to the river channel network which exerts strong control on lake water balance in the low relief terrain padpg 1973 peters et al 2006 pietroniro et al 1999 prowse and demuth 1996 timoney 2013 wolfe et al 2007 open drainage lakes occur at the lowest elevations and receive continuous to near continuous river through flow closed drainage lakes occupy the highest elevations are isolated from the channel network and are thought to receive floodwaters only during episodic rise of water to extreme levels caused by ice jam events on the peace and athabasca rivers and their distributaries during intervals between ice jam floods maintenance of their water levels relies on input from snowmelt and rainfall to the lake and catchment to offset losses by evaporation restricted drainage lakes have been characterized as occurring at intermediate elevations and they experience more frequent connectivity to rivers during ice jam floods as well as periods of open water elevated river flow that promote intermittent reconnection to distributary channels the restricted drainage category thus includes a broad lake class between the extremes of open and closed drainage lakes and are presumed to be less prone to desiccation than closed drainage lakes perched basin is a frequently used term that includes both restricted and closed drainage lakes to distinguish isolated lakes in the landscape from open drainage lakes connected to the river network and to acknowledge a hydrological continuum exists a hydro limnological survey by wolfe et al 2007 further defined a subset of shallow perched basins as rainfall influenced based on their shallow depth and small water volume that promotes rapid desiccation by evaporation and refilling by rainfall events the three main hydrological categories described above were established decades ago during initial field surveys of the pad when understanding of the hydrology of the landscape was incomplete systematic sampling of water isotope composition during spring mid summer and fall of a recent 5 year period 2015 2019 at a network of 60 lakes and 9 river sites across the pad has vastly improved our knowledge of hydrological processes regulating lake water balance and provided information on spatio temporal patterns of variation in the influence of river floodwaters precipitation and evaporation on lake water balance remmer et al 2020a results demonstrate greater heterogeneity of lake water balance than can be captured by the conventional use of the three hydrological lake categories for example water balance of restricted drainage lakes can vary across the delta from positive to negative at the same time and this also occurs for closed drainage lakes seasonal and inter annual variation is sufficiently high that perched basins may exhibit water balance characteristic of the closed drainage category in some seasons and years and characteristics of the restricted drainage category in other seasons and years notably the systematic water isotope monitoring during summers of 2017 2019 captured recurring evidence of strongly positive lake water balance across central and southern athabasca sector portions of the pad due to input of river floodwaters during the open water season among the extensive body of hydrological literature on the pad this mechanism of lake replenishment has rarely been reported except for peters et al 2006 2021 who also identified the effectiveness of high river level events during the open water season in recharging slightly elevated lakes in the athabasca sector classification of lakes into open restricted and closed drainage categories thus does not explicitly distinguish lakes that are strongly influenced by open water flooding from those influenced by ice jam flooding or lateral connectivity stemming from other hydrological processes associated with the river channel network knowledge of open water flooding in the athabasca sector and influence of other hydrological processes on the delta s lakes may be advanced by using water level loggers to obtain continuous real time measurements of lake level fluctuations such continuous measurements may be used to pinpoint the timing magnitude and extent of open water flooding and its influence on lake levels metrics that cannot easily be captured using snapshot measurements of water isotope tracers alone when periodic sample collection does not coincide with influential hydrological processes and events fergus et al 2020 demonstrated the value of supplementing water isotope tracer information with singular measurements of lake level drawdown based on high water marks to develop a national scale hydrological baseline for lakes across the conterminous united states to our knowledge however water level loggers have not been deployed for continuous lake level measurements at multiple sites across a floodplain landscape as dynamic as the pad yet they present an approach that can broaden and enhance our understanding of influential hydrological processes and contribute useful information for lake monitoring programs here we utilize continuous hourly lake level measurements at 48 lakes in 2018 and 53 lakes in 2019 across the pad to elucidate the timing and magnitude of lake level responses to key hydrological processes during the open water season the knowledge gained is used to refine hydrological categorization of lakes in the pad we also integrate the lake level measurements with river hydrometric data and a digital elevation model to define the geographical area of the pad inundated by open water flooding in 2018 and 2019 thus improving upon estimates reported in remmer et al 2020a based on three spot measurements of water isotope composition per year we also use long term river hydrometric data to speculate on the frequency of open water season lake flooding by the athabasca river during the past four decades finally we assess the utility of water level loggers as a complementary lake monitoring tool to water isotope tracers and other approaches 2 study area 2 1 peace athabasca delta spanning an area of 6000 km2 the pad is the world s largest freshwater boreal delta fig 1 peters et al 2006 elevational differences between lakes and rivers and the complex hydrological pathways connecting them create three distinctive hydrological regions across the pad the northern relic peace sector the southern active athabasca sector and the central area occupied by large open drainage lakes lake claire mamawi lake padpg 1973 wolfe et al 2007 based on the canadian digital elevation model cdem accuracy 0 10 m for the region the light blue region spanning the central area of the delta in fig 1 represents areas between 205 and 210 masl and broadly corresponds with the spatial extent of the open drainage network this includes lakes claire mamawi and richardson pad 38 and the channels that connect them with the athabasca and peace rivers and the western end of lake athabasca timoney 2013 the peace sector has greater topographic relief than the athabasca sector and possesses numerous bedrock inliers 225 masl that occur in the catchments of many lakes comparatively only a narrow area of land in the southern margin of the athabasca sector along the athabasca river is elevated above 220 masl the directional movement of water in the delta is influenced by variation in water levels of the athabasca and peace rivers and lake athabasca fig 1 water enters the southern athabasca sector via the north flowing athabasca river and its distributaries including the embarras river that carries water northward via cree mamawi creek into mamawi lake or via fletcher channel into lake athabasca the athabasca river and lake athabasca are typically at a higher elevation than the peace river thus for most of the time channels in the peace sector rivière des rochers chenal des quatre fourches revillon coupé carry outflow from lake athabasca northward to the peace river and ultimately to the slave river in early spring southward flow reversals can occur in these channels when peace river water levels rise and more typically when ice jams form 2 2 study lakes the lakes from which water level loggers i e pressure transducers were retrieved at the end of the open water seasons n2018 48 n2019 53 span surface areas from approximately 1 km2 to 38 km2 richardson lake pad 38 and are roughly divided between the peace sector n2018 22 n2019 24 and the athabasca sector n2018 26 n2019 29 fig 1 table 1 most 36 53 of the lake sites studied were included in a survey conducted in fall 2000 by wolfe et al 2007 the other 17 lakes lakes m1 to m19 are a subset also sampled by community based monitoring groups to track variation in muskrat abundance the entire lake set is largely equivalent to that reported in remmer et al 2020a and spans the range of lake hydrological conditions in the delta 2 3 meteorological conditions and spring ice jam flooding in 2018 and 2019 based on the 1981 2010 climate normal measured at the fort chipewyan airport station mean monthly air temperatures range from 20 c to 15 c and average annual precipitation is 365 mm fig 2 monthly temperatures during the two study years were similar to the climate normal with the following exceptions in may june 2018 average monthly air temperatures were warmer than the climate normal this was followed by cooler than average air temperature in september in 2019 air temperature was colder in february and warmer in march than the climate normal cumulative precipitation in 2018 345 mm was 20 mm less than the climate normal cumulative precipitation in 2019 443 mm exceeded the annual climate normal by late september during the open water season substantial rainfall occurred in june 2018 61 mm and august 2019 106 mm approximately 45 mm of rain was measured on august 14 2019 which is far more than any other single day and unusual for the region widespread ice jam flooding in late april early may 2018 delivered river floodwaters to nearly half of all lake sites table 1 the extent of river floodwaters was delineated by remmer et al 2020b and includes a large central area within the athabasca sector and small areas of the northern peace sector of the lakes where we deployed water level loggers this event flooded 19 lakes 73 in the athabasca sector and 8 lakes 36 in the peace sector spring flooding was more limited in 2019 and was detected in 8 28 of the athabasca sector lakes and no lakes in the peace sector where loggers were deployed table 1 remmer et al 2020a 3 methods 3 1 field methods water level loggers onset hobo pressure transducers model u20 001 01 4 m range 0 3 cm accuracy were installed at a central location of each lake in mid may 2018 and 2019 shortly after ice off fig 1 most study lakes have a simple bathymetry where maximum depth occurs near the center of the lake exceptions include oxbow lakes pad 15 54 which are remnant river channels and where the thalweg is likely closer to the outer bank for these two lakes we deployed loggers equidistant from the shorelines on one of the arms which are not at their deepest location each logger was attached to a rock sock anchor by zip tie and a wooden float by nylon rope water pressure psi and temperature c were recorded every hour until removed in mid september of each year gps coordinates were logged immediately after each device was deployed to aid their retrieval and guide re deployment at a consistent location the following year in both years a single logger was also deployed outside the field house in fort chipewyan to measure variation in local atmospheric pressure and air temperature these data were used to convert water pressure readings at each lake to water depth m using the barometric compensation data assistant in the hoboware software rstudio v1 3 1073 r core team 2019 software and external packages pracma lubridate ggplot2 were used to calculate and graph daily 24 hour running means borchers 2019 grolemund and wickham 2011 wickham 2016 from this point forward we simply refer to the water depth measurements as lake level or lake level patterns or variation 3 2 river hydrometric data and canadian digital elevation model water level data were obtained from hydrometric stations maintained by the water survey of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca for river sites athabasca river 07d001 07dd011 peace river 07k005 rivière des rochers 07na007 lake claire 07kf002 mamawi lake 07kf003 and lake athabasca 07kf003 to compare to our lake level data fig 1 hydrometric data for the peace river were unavailable during early spring 2018 because river ice damaged the hydrometric station a canada wide digital elevation model cdem was included as a map layer in arcmap 10 7 1 to explore and visualize relations between elevation and spatial distribution of lake level patterns the cdem was created in 2016 by the department of natural resources canada and is accessible online at https maps canada ca czs index en html the coverage and resolution of the cdem varies according to latitude and uses the north american datum 1983 as a reference system for horizontal coordinates elevations are orthometric and expressed relative to mean sea level canadian geodetic vertical datum 1928 for the study region the cdem offers a spatial base resolution of 0 75 x 0 75 arc seconds and a measured altimetric accuracy of 0 10 m 3 3 classification of lake level patterns based on visual observation of individual lake level patterns geographical location and simple numerical analyses study lakes were sorted into the following four categories for 2018 and 2019 1 drawdown 15 cm decline 2 stable 15 cm decline 3 gradual rise and 4 sharp rise lake level decline was calculated as the minimum lake level subtracted by the initial lake level at the time of logger deployment table 1 initial lake level was selected as the benchmark rather than maximum lake level because the latter is time dependent and varies from lake to lake the threshold used to separate lakes into the drawdown versus stable categories 15 cm was based on approximation of the median drawdown for lakes in 2018 and 2019 17 0 cm and 16 2 cm respectively fig 3 temporal patterns of gradual rise and sharp rise were visually discernable as lake levels that increased slowly or rapidly respectively for study lakes located adjacent to large open drainage lakes i e claire and mamawi we also visually assessed for lake level correlation between the study lake and adjacent open drainage lake as evidence of gradual rise due to inundation by rising levels in the open drainage network estimates of maximum lake level change for gradual and sharp rise lakes table 1 were obtained from the lake level maximum subtracted by the lake level measured on june 14th for both years june 14th was selected to minimize the potential effects from spring flooding and is 24 h before the earliest lake level rise associated with open water flooding 4 results lakes in both sectors of the pad displayed lake level variations of the stable drawdown and gradual rise categories during 2018 and 2019 figs 4 5 however only lakes in the athabasca sector exhibited the sharp rise pattern in lake levels during 2018 and 2019 figs 4 5 given this difference and previous research demonstrating lake water balances contrast greatly between the peace and athabasca sectors wolfe et al 2007 remmer et al 2020a we present and describe the results separately for each sector we also report spatial distribution of lake level patterns with respect to land surface elevations and proximity to active river channels 4 1 peace sector including both study years 25 lakes in the peace sector fell into the drawdown category which is more than any of the other categories fig 4a b ten lakes 45 5 pad 2 3 4 5 12 50 52 53 57 58 displayed drawdown in 2018 and 15 lakes 68 2 pad 1 4 12 13 14 15 17 50 52 53 57 58 m16 m17 m18 in 2019 seven of the lakes fell into the drawdown category in both years all but one of the drawdown lakes is elevated above 210 masl fig 6 baril lake pad 53 is the sole exception located within the 205 210 masl range baril lake also shows higher frequency variation compared to other lakes in this category possibly due to its larger fetch that generates greater wind driven lake level fluctuation in 2018 lake level decline began at lakes in this category in early july and continued until loggers were retrieved in mid september in contrast lake level decline began earlier in 2019 mid may and ended earlier mid august when substantial rainfall coincided with a sudden small rise in lake levels 4 8 1 2 cm among the lakes in this category pad 50 drew down sufficiently to expose the logger to the atmosphere after mid july 2019 two of the 10 drawdown lakes in 2018 shifted to the stable category in 2019 pad 3 5 the next most common lake level category in the peace sector was stable fig 4c d in 2018 11 lakes 50 0 pad 1 6 13 15 17 54 65 m15 m17 m18 m19 exhibited this behaviour of these four lakes pad 15 54 m17 m18 received ice jam floodwaters in the spring remmer et al 2020b eight lakes 33 3 pad 3 5 6 16 54 65 m15 m19 fell in this category in 2019 when spring flooding was less extensive lakes in the stable category are situated east of the chenal des quatre fourches and span a range of elevations 205 225 masl fig 6 lakes in the stable category displayed a sudden small rise 5 0 0 9 cm coincident with the major rain event in mid august 2019 as observed for lakes in the drawdown category six of the 11 stable lakes in 2018 shifted to the drawdown category in 2019 pad 1 13 15 17 m17 m18 one lake in the peace sector pad 8 exhibited a gradual rise in lake level which coincided with the rise and fall of lake athabasca and its outlet channel the rivière des rochers but not with variation of peace river levels fig 4e h this lake is connected to the rivière des rochers via a single distributary channel chilloney s creek which serves as both an inflow or outflow depending on relative water levels of pad 8 and the rivière des rochers none of the lakes in the peace sector displayed a sharp rise in lake level in 2018 and 2019 and temporal patterns of lake level variation in the three other categories show little to no association with variation of peace river levels during the open water season fig 4g h 4 2 athabasca sector similar to the peace sector drawdown was the most common lake level pattern in the athabasca sector during the two study years fig 5a b eleven lakes fell in this category in 2018 42 3 pad 19 20 23 24 32 36 39 m1 m3 m4 m6 and 10 lakes in 2019 34 5 pad 19 20 21 23 32 m4 m6 m8 m9 six lakes fell into this category in both study years the timing and duration of lake level decline was comparable to that observed in the peace sector in both study years of the 11 drawdown lakes in 2018 8 received floodwaters during the spring prior to logger deployment lakes in the drawdown category in 2018 and 2019 are situated across a wide range of elevations 205 225 masl fig 6 three of the drawdown lakes in 2018 displayed a different lake level pattern in 2019 one was classified as stable and two as sharp rise in contrast to the peace sector relatively few lakes fell into the stable category in the athabasca sector in 2018 and 2019 fig 5c d this includes 3 lakes in 2018 11 5 pad 22 m5 m11 and 7 lakes in 2019 24 1 pad 22 27 36 39 m5 m6 m11 all but one of these lakes are situated above 215 masl fig 6 the exception m11 is located southeast of mamawi lake at 205 210 masl all three of the lakes in 2018 remained in the stable category in 2019 five lakes 19 2 m8 m9 m10 m12 m14 displayed gradual rise of lake level in 2018 and one lake 3 4 m10 fell in this category in 2019 fig 5e f lake level variations in these lakes coincided with those of the open drainage network lakes claire mamawi and athabasca fig 5e f fewer lakes with gradual rise in 2019 compared to 2018 corresponds with 0 5 m lower peak lake levels in the open drainage network fig 5e f in 2019 lake level at m10 declined gradually between mid may and early august similar to lakes in the drawdown category and then rose gradually after mid august when adjacent lake claire reached maximum lake level lakes in the gradual rise category are situated at elevations between 205 and 210 masl and occur south east of lake claire m8 m9 m10 and along the southern edge of mamawi lake pad m12 m14 fig 6 in 2019 m12 and m14 shifted to the sharp rise category and m8 and m9 exhibited the drawdown pattern several lakes in the athabasca sector displayed sharp rises of lake level which was not observed in lakes of the peace sector fig 5g h in 2018 7 lakes 26 9 pad 26 30 31 33 38 46 m7 fell into this category with two to four sharp rises evident in late june early july mid july and early august these same 7 lakes plus 5 others 41 4 pad 24 25 m1 m12 m14 displayed sharp rises in early july mid july late july and early august in 2019 in most instances lake levels declined markedly after each rise and coincided with sharp rise and fall in athabasca river levels during both years suggesting open water river flooding is the cause of these lake level variations fig 5i j exceptions to this include three lakes where lake level did not decline markedly after a sharp rise pad 46 in 2018 m1 and m12 in 2019 prolonged high lake levels in pad 46 and m12 may reflect inundation by rising levels of adjacent mamawi lake after input of river floodwaters in july m1 lacks an adjacent open drainage lake which suggests the peak river levels in early july 2019 only briefly exceeded the sill elevation for this lake on one occasion and the lake remained bank full thereafter maximum rise of lake level ranged from 31 to 170 cm with a mean of 73 cm in 2018 and 104 cm in 2019 table 1 river floodwaters reached more lakes in 2019 when the athabasca river at embarras airport reached a maximum level of 216 5 masl 1 1 m higher than the maximum level in 2018 215 4 masl fig 5 in both years open water flooding occurred south of the athabasca river and along downstream portions of cree mamawi creek and adjacent to mamawi lake fig 6 5 discussion continuous hourly lake level measurements at 50 lakes across the peace athabasca delta during two open water seasons 2018 2019 revealed four distinctive patterns of lake level variation drawdown 15 cm decline stable 15 cm decline gradual rise and sharp rise the number of lakes that displayed each lake level pattern differed between years and sectors of the pad in the peace sector drawdown and stable patterns were equally prevalent in 2018 n 10 and 11 respectively but drawdown was more common than stable in 2019 15 and 8 respectively in the athabasca sector drawdown was the most prevalent pattern in 2018 10 followed by sharp rise 7 and gradual rise 5 in 2019 sharp rise 12 was most common followed by drawdown and stable 9 and 7 respectively lakes in the stable and drawdown categories consistently occur at elevations greater than 215 masl in the peace sector in contrast to the athabasca sector where lakes with these lake level patterns were located across a range of elevations 205 220 masl gradual rise lakes consistently occur at low elevations 205 210 masl and are situated adjacent to lake claire and mamawi lake in the athabasca sector whereas the sole gradual rise lake in the peace sector possesses a connection to the rivière des rochers via chilloney s creek lakes that had a sharp rise of lake level were only found within the athabasca sector at low elevations 205 215 masl and adjacent to active river channels athabasca and embarras rivers cree mamawi creek lakes in the pad have long been recognized to span a broad hydrological spectrum and be potentially influenced by several processes including snowmelt ice jam flooding rainfall open water flooding water level fluctuations in the open drainage network and evaporation padpg 1973 peters et al 2006 pietroniro et al 1999 prowse and demuth 1996 remmer et al 2018 2020a 2020b wolfe et al 2007 2008 lake level variations are a sensitive measure and a direct consequence of the relative influence of many of these hydrological processes based on systematic lake level patterns figs 4 5 and their spatial distribution fig 6 we propose a new hydrological classification system for lakes in the pad defined by key hydrological processes table 2 5 1 hydrological processes that define a new lake categorization system for the pad during the open water season we identify a singular dominant hydrological process among the several processes operating across the pad that defines each of the four new lake hydrological categories table 2 1 drawdown lakes are strongly influenced by evaporation as reflected by their consistent gradual lake level declines throughout the summer that exceed 15 cm however because ice jam floodwaters in 2018 raised lake levels of several drawdown lakes in the athabasca sector surface outflow also may have contributed to their lake level decline early during the open water season 2 stable lakes did not experience substantial drawdown 15 cm because of summer rainfall that offset evaporation lake morphology and catchment characteristics including watershed to lake area and surface area to volume ratios and localized rainfall events may explain the differing relative influence of rainfall its associated runoff and evaporation on drawdown and stable lakes these factors are difficult to quantify because of the low relief terrain and there is only one meteorological station fort chipewyan airport in this remote region 3 gradual rise lakes are characterized by inflow due to hydrological connectivity with adjacent large open drainage lakes principally lakes claire and mamawi and distributary channels of the open drainage network 4 sharp rise lakes correspond with rise of the athabasca river beyond its flood stage identifying open water season flooding as the main hydrological process that characterizes these lakes ice jam flooding and snowmelt can influence all lakes across the delta during the early open water season padpg 1973 prowse and conly 1998 timoney 2013 however these hydrological processes are not readily identified in the lake level records because loggers cannot be installed until after ice off and thus after snowmelt and ice jam flooding have occurred the new lake hydrological classification scheme offers distinct advantages over the conventional closed restricted and open drainage categories table 2 lists the number of lakes in our study set that fall into the former drainage categories based on water isotope and water chemistry data from 2001 wolfe et al 2007 closed drainage lakes and their subset of rainfall influenced lakes have now been partitioned into drawdown and stable lakes based on the prevailing influence of evaporation and rainfall respectively the broad spectrum of restricted drainage lakes is reflected by distribution among all four of the new categories further demonstrating that restricted drainage lakes are influenced by a wide range of hydrological processes a distinct advantage is that the new categories distinguish formally restricted drainage lakes that receive open water flooding via direct inflow of athabasca river water i e sharp rise lakes versus inundation or connection with the open drainage network i e gradual rise lakes conventionally three lakes have been identified as open drainage claire mamawi richardson timoney 2013 but they span two of the four new categories proposed here lakes claire and mamawi displayed gradual rise of lake levels as would be expected of large through flow lakes in flat terrain that receive inflow from rivers with sharply rising lake levels however lake levels rose sharply at richardson lake pad 38 during open water seasons of 2018 and 2019 lake levels at pad 25 26 and 46 identified as open drainage by wolfe et al 2007 also rose sharply thus the new lake classification system identifies the non uniform influence of hydrological processes in this previously defined category of open drainage lakes it also reveals that a broad suite of hydrological processes influence lake levels in the delta and shifts in several of these processes can lead to lake level drawdown these include climate induced increase in duration of the open water season and increased evaporation reduced open water flooding and decline of precipitation 5 2 characterization of open water flooding recently substantial open water flooding was detected in the athabasca sector using seasonal measurement of water isotope compositions remmer et al 2020a and remote sensing peters et al 2021 hourly lake level data improves our understanding of the influence of this hydrological process by capturing the precise timing that floodwaters enter a lake the magnitude of lake level rise and the spatial extent of flooding in 2018 open water flooding of sharp rise lakes coincided with increases in the water level of the athabasca river during 2 3 intervals in mid june mid july and late july which raised levels by 0 33 1 41 m fig 4 table 1 in 2019 open water flooding occurred during 3 5 intervals including three in july and two in early august which raised levels of sharp rise lakes by 0 31 1 79 m fig 5 table 1 each one of these flood events occurred during an interval of one to two weeks continuous lake level measurements demonstrate that multiple pulses of river floodwater may enter lakes in the athabasca sector during the open water season potentially resulting in lake level increases exceeding 1 5 m given that most lakes are 1 m deep and some are less than 0 5 m deep open water flooding is clearly an important recharge mechanism for lakes in the athabasca sector high levels of the athabasca river in 2018 and 2019 also promoted gradual rise of water levels at mamawi lake and lake claire which inundated nearby basins gradual rise lakes figs 4 5 although the athabasca river peaked at 216 5 masl in 2019 more than 1 m higher than in 2018 215 4 masl spatial extent of floodwaters was similar fig 6 flooded regions captured by sharp rise lakes include along the southern margin of the delta and the cree mamawi creek corridor in the athabasca sector and likely define the areas most susceptible to the direct effects of open water flooding our interpretation of the spatial extent of open water flooding includes gradual rise lakes fig 6 which were indirectly influenced by the high discharge on the athabasca river via the open drainage network notably open water flooding did not extend to the terminus region of the athabasca river which includes the traditional territory of the athabasca chipewyan first nation located adjacent to the wbnp boundary at the southeastern edge of the pad likely due to diversion of flow through cree mamawi creek caused by the embarras breakthrough in 1982 kay et al 2019 wolfe et al 2008 indeed the lake depth data reveal that drawdown is common among lakes at the athabasca river terminus in the absence of open water flooding e g m1 m3 m4 m6 figs 5 6 this is an important finding because it identifies systematic lake level drawdown which has negative consequences for land users and access to traditional lands we consider the spatial extent of open water flooding depicted in fig 6 to be more accurate than that approximated in fig 4 of remmer et al 2020a in part because the latter is influenced by the timing of water sample collection for isotope analysis periodic ice jam flooding in spring is well known as an important source of replenishment for lakes in the pad prowse and conly 2000 prowse and lalonde 1996 timoney et al 1997 and causes of reduced frequency of this hydrological process have been subject to much debate given concerns of lake level drawdown during recent decades e g beltaos 2018 wolfe et al 2020 less attention has been placed on the frequency of open water flood events probably because unlike ice jam floods they are difficult to predict or observe as they typically generate smaller more localized flooding and can occur at any time during the open water season we examined the athabasca river hydrometric record at the old fort gauging station id 07dd011 fig 1 to assess the frequency of potential open water flood events equivalent to or greater than 2018 and 2019 since the embarras breakthrough in 1982 table 3 fig 7 we utilized data recorded at old fort hydrometric station because the station at embarras airport only reports water levels since 2014 at old fort station peak water level was 214 5 masl during 2018 and 215 4 masl during 2019 the water level record of the athabasca river at this station shows that the 2018 threshold has been exceeded during 16 years since 1982 42 of years demonstrating that open water flooding of similar or greater magnitude as 2018 has been a common occurrence during the past 38 years given that peak water levels of the athabasca river have exceeded the 2019 threshold during only 8 of those years 21 it is likely that open water flooding has infrequently extended to the athabasca river terminus during this time this interpretation is consistent with paleolimnological records that depict reduced influence of river floodwaters in this region of the athabasca sector since 1982 kay et al 2019 the record at old fort station also shows an extended interval of low peak summer river levels during 1998 2010 since then peak river levels have exceeded the 2018 threshold in at least 6 years since 2011 note missing data for 2014 and 2015 we also note that the timing of peak water level at old fort station in any given year may span a 6 week interval such marked seasonal and annual temporal variation in peak river levels of the athabasca river and associated open water flooding highlights the importance of monitoring the frequency of these important recharge events using continuous lake level recorders 5 3 implications for monitoring given projected declines in summer discharge of east flowing rivers fed by high elevation glaciers and snowpack in the rocky mountains chernos et al 2020 debeer and sharp 2007 hugonnet et al 2021 tennant and menounos 2013 peak summer levels in the athabasca river and associated open water flooding at the pad are likely to decline in coming decades if so frequency of lakes in the sharp rise and gradual rise categories will decrease and shift to the stable and or drawdown categories depending on amount of rainfall runoff and evaporative water loss combined with predicted declines in ice jam flood frequency beltaos and bonsal 2021 lamontagne et al 2021 and longer duration of the open water season promoting greater evaporative water loss barnett et al 2005 schindler and donahue 2006 lake levels are likely to decline across broad areas of the pad ongoing monitoring of lake levels can inform stewardship decisions for wood buffalo national park a priority of the federal action plan wbnp 2019 and ensure long term sustainability of the delta s ecosystems during the ongoing climate crisis for example lake level monitoring has become an effective management tool for the north saskatchewan watershed alliance to track long term water level trends at 33 lakes across the province of alberta islam and seneka 2015 nswa 2017 analogous to fig 1a in nswa 2017 we summarize the number of lakes in each hydrological category using pie charts to demonstrate how these data can be used to track the influence of shifting hydrological conditions across sectors and years fig 8 this end product highlights the importance of open water flooding sharp rise lakes in the athabasca sector and evaporation drawdown lakes in the peace sector the approach captured marked increase of drawdown lakes in the peace sector and sharp rise lakes in the athabasca sector between 2018 and 2019 which suggests strong potential for ongoing lake level monitoring we recommend lake level monitoring be integrated with other hydrological monitoring tools such as water isotope tracers and remote sensing imagery to quantify relative importance of ice jam flooding snowmelt and evaporation on lake water balance remmer et al 2020a 2020b and to corroborate the spatial extent of river flooding and lake drying pavelsky and smith 2008 peters et al 2021 töyrä and pietroniro 2005 combined use of these approaches can strengthen monitoring of dynamic lake rich landscapes such as the pad and better characterize the varying influence of hydrological processes and the timescales at which they operate given sufficient financial resources transferability of this approach to similar remote freshwater landscapes is possible such as the nearby slave river delta brock et al 2007 and saskatchewan river delta mackinnon et al 2015 although there may be site specific hydrological processes to consider such as the influence of seiche events on great slave lake on the former at the pad wildlife abundance aquatic habitat and limnological conditions are strongly regulated by hydrological processes that cause changes in lake levels muskrat for example is a culturally important and keystone species used to track aquatic habitat availability and ecological integrity of shallow lakes in the pad straka et al 2018 ward et al 2018 2020 muskrat abundance has been shown to respond rapidly to changes in freeze up water levels as they rely on vegetation under ice to survive throughout winter virgil and messier 1997 density of muskrat houses increased by two orders of magnitude after spring flooding in 2014 and slowly declined during subsequent drier years as water depth declined straka et al 2018 lake level rise caused by input of turbid floodwater dramatically reduces water clarity concentrations of dissolved nutrients organic carbon and ions and biomass of phytoplankton and macrophytes at seasonal timescales or longer wiklund et al 2012 flooding that causes rapid rise of lake levels is likely to result in greater reductions in these variables than flooding that causes gradual rise absence of recent flooding on the other hand leads to higher concentration of nutrients and ions higher ph and greater penetration of solar radiation to the bottom of shallow lakes leading to higher production of macrophytes phytoplankton and their consumers such conditions characterize lakes in the stable and drawdown categories wiklund et al 2012 persistent drawdown of water levels eventually results in loss of littoral habitat and encroachment of terrestrial vegetation such as willow which impedes mobility of large wildlife e g bison and land users timoney 2013 spatio temporal variation in lake types across the pad supports an abundance and diversity of aquatic and semi aquatic biota yet climate change is predicted to increase proportions of lakes in the drawdown and stable categories at the expense of lakes in the gradual rise and rapid rise categories clearly continued monitoring of lake level variation coupled with research on links with the ecological structure and function of the lakes is important to inform about ongoing hydroecological changes in response to climate trends and other stressors credit authorship contribution statement l k neary

8100,study region the peace athabasca delta a ramsar wetland of international importance in northeastern alberta is protected within wood buffalo national park and contributes to its unesco world heritage status yet is threatened by climate change and upstream energy projects study focus recent drawdown of the delta s abundant shallow lakes and rivers has deteriorated vital habitat for wildlife and impaired navigation routes here we report continuous measurements at 50 lakes during open water seasons of 2018 and 2019 to improve understanding of hydrological processes causing lake level variation new hydrological insights for the region analyses reveal four patterns of lake level variation attributable to influential hydrological processes which provide the basis for a new lake classification scheme 1 drawdown 15 cm decline by evaporation and or outflow after ice jam floods 2 stable lake levels 15 cm change sustained by rainfall 3 gradual rise by inundation from the open drainage network and 4 rapid rise by input of river floodwater river flooding during the open water season is an under recognized recharge mechanism yet occurred extensively in the athabasca sector and appears to be a common occurrence based on the athabasca river hydrometric record lake level loggers show strong ability to track shifts in hydrological processes and can be integrated with other methods to decipher their causes and ecological consequences across water rich landscapes keywords floodplain lakes shallow lakes lake level variation lake monitoring open water season flooding peace athabasca delta 1 introduction water security is a rising concern in western canada where climate warming has reduced snowpack and glacier volumes and altered the timing and amount of streamflow to downstream ecosystems bonsal et al 2019 debeer and sharp 2007 hugonnet et al 2021 sauchyn et al 2015 tennant and menounos 2013 wolfe et al 2008 at the peace athabasca delta pad in northeastern alberta major energy projects upstream pose additional potential threats to security of water supply lebel et al 2011 prowse and conly 2000 prowse et al 2006 schindler and donahue 2006 these include regulation of peace river flow for hydroelectric production which alters the seasonal distribution of discharge peters and prowse 2001 and withdrawal of athabasca river water within the alberta oil sands region which reduces discharge mannix et al 2010 the delta s waterways provide important access to traditional territory of indigenous people and the hundreds of small 1 km2 shallow lakes furnish productive habitat for a diversity of wildlife where lake level fluctuations influence population density hood 2020 straka et al 2018 vannini and vannini 2019 ward et al 2018 2020 eighty percent of the pad is protected within wood buffalo national park wbnp a unesco world heritage site and the delta is a ramsar wetland of international importance much of the remaining area is the traditional territory of the athabasca chipewyan first nation ir 201 recent observations of lake drying and decline of river levels have led to a petition to include wbnp on unesco s list of world heritage in danger mcfn 2014 recommendations to improve understanding and causes of lake level variations over space and time whc iucn 2017 and an action plan to implement research and monitoring approaches to assess cumulative impacts and inform decision making by stakeholders wbnp 2019 the abundant shallow lakes of the pad have been distinguished into three main hydrological categories open drainage restricted drainage closed drainage based on differences in their connectivity to the river channel network which exerts strong control on lake water balance in the low relief terrain padpg 1973 peters et al 2006 pietroniro et al 1999 prowse and demuth 1996 timoney 2013 wolfe et al 2007 open drainage lakes occur at the lowest elevations and receive continuous to near continuous river through flow closed drainage lakes occupy the highest elevations are isolated from the channel network and are thought to receive floodwaters only during episodic rise of water to extreme levels caused by ice jam events on the peace and athabasca rivers and their distributaries during intervals between ice jam floods maintenance of their water levels relies on input from snowmelt and rainfall to the lake and catchment to offset losses by evaporation restricted drainage lakes have been characterized as occurring at intermediate elevations and they experience more frequent connectivity to rivers during ice jam floods as well as periods of open water elevated river flow that promote intermittent reconnection to distributary channels the restricted drainage category thus includes a broad lake class between the extremes of open and closed drainage lakes and are presumed to be less prone to desiccation than closed drainage lakes perched basin is a frequently used term that includes both restricted and closed drainage lakes to distinguish isolated lakes in the landscape from open drainage lakes connected to the river network and to acknowledge a hydrological continuum exists a hydro limnological survey by wolfe et al 2007 further defined a subset of shallow perched basins as rainfall influenced based on their shallow depth and small water volume that promotes rapid desiccation by evaporation and refilling by rainfall events the three main hydrological categories described above were established decades ago during initial field surveys of the pad when understanding of the hydrology of the landscape was incomplete systematic sampling of water isotope composition during spring mid summer and fall of a recent 5 year period 2015 2019 at a network of 60 lakes and 9 river sites across the pad has vastly improved our knowledge of hydrological processes regulating lake water balance and provided information on spatio temporal patterns of variation in the influence of river floodwaters precipitation and evaporation on lake water balance remmer et al 2020a results demonstrate greater heterogeneity of lake water balance than can be captured by the conventional use of the three hydrological lake categories for example water balance of restricted drainage lakes can vary across the delta from positive to negative at the same time and this also occurs for closed drainage lakes seasonal and inter annual variation is sufficiently high that perched basins may exhibit water balance characteristic of the closed drainage category in some seasons and years and characteristics of the restricted drainage category in other seasons and years notably the systematic water isotope monitoring during summers of 2017 2019 captured recurring evidence of strongly positive lake water balance across central and southern athabasca sector portions of the pad due to input of river floodwaters during the open water season among the extensive body of hydrological literature on the pad this mechanism of lake replenishment has rarely been reported except for peters et al 2006 2021 who also identified the effectiveness of high river level events during the open water season in recharging slightly elevated lakes in the athabasca sector classification of lakes into open restricted and closed drainage categories thus does not explicitly distinguish lakes that are strongly influenced by open water flooding from those influenced by ice jam flooding or lateral connectivity stemming from other hydrological processes associated with the river channel network knowledge of open water flooding in the athabasca sector and influence of other hydrological processes on the delta s lakes may be advanced by using water level loggers to obtain continuous real time measurements of lake level fluctuations such continuous measurements may be used to pinpoint the timing magnitude and extent of open water flooding and its influence on lake levels metrics that cannot easily be captured using snapshot measurements of water isotope tracers alone when periodic sample collection does not coincide with influential hydrological processes and events fergus et al 2020 demonstrated the value of supplementing water isotope tracer information with singular measurements of lake level drawdown based on high water marks to develop a national scale hydrological baseline for lakes across the conterminous united states to our knowledge however water level loggers have not been deployed for continuous lake level measurements at multiple sites across a floodplain landscape as dynamic as the pad yet they present an approach that can broaden and enhance our understanding of influential hydrological processes and contribute useful information for lake monitoring programs here we utilize continuous hourly lake level measurements at 48 lakes in 2018 and 53 lakes in 2019 across the pad to elucidate the timing and magnitude of lake level responses to key hydrological processes during the open water season the knowledge gained is used to refine hydrological categorization of lakes in the pad we also integrate the lake level measurements with river hydrometric data and a digital elevation model to define the geographical area of the pad inundated by open water flooding in 2018 and 2019 thus improving upon estimates reported in remmer et al 2020a based on three spot measurements of water isotope composition per year we also use long term river hydrometric data to speculate on the frequency of open water season lake flooding by the athabasca river during the past four decades finally we assess the utility of water level loggers as a complementary lake monitoring tool to water isotope tracers and other approaches 2 study area 2 1 peace athabasca delta spanning an area of 6000 km2 the pad is the world s largest freshwater boreal delta fig 1 peters et al 2006 elevational differences between lakes and rivers and the complex hydrological pathways connecting them create three distinctive hydrological regions across the pad the northern relic peace sector the southern active athabasca sector and the central area occupied by large open drainage lakes lake claire mamawi lake padpg 1973 wolfe et al 2007 based on the canadian digital elevation model cdem accuracy 0 10 m for the region the light blue region spanning the central area of the delta in fig 1 represents areas between 205 and 210 masl and broadly corresponds with the spatial extent of the open drainage network this includes lakes claire mamawi and richardson pad 38 and the channels that connect them with the athabasca and peace rivers and the western end of lake athabasca timoney 2013 the peace sector has greater topographic relief than the athabasca sector and possesses numerous bedrock inliers 225 masl that occur in the catchments of many lakes comparatively only a narrow area of land in the southern margin of the athabasca sector along the athabasca river is elevated above 220 masl the directional movement of water in the delta is influenced by variation in water levels of the athabasca and peace rivers and lake athabasca fig 1 water enters the southern athabasca sector via the north flowing athabasca river and its distributaries including the embarras river that carries water northward via cree mamawi creek into mamawi lake or via fletcher channel into lake athabasca the athabasca river and lake athabasca are typically at a higher elevation than the peace river thus for most of the time channels in the peace sector rivière des rochers chenal des quatre fourches revillon coupé carry outflow from lake athabasca northward to the peace river and ultimately to the slave river in early spring southward flow reversals can occur in these channels when peace river water levels rise and more typically when ice jams form 2 2 study lakes the lakes from which water level loggers i e pressure transducers were retrieved at the end of the open water seasons n2018 48 n2019 53 span surface areas from approximately 1 km2 to 38 km2 richardson lake pad 38 and are roughly divided between the peace sector n2018 22 n2019 24 and the athabasca sector n2018 26 n2019 29 fig 1 table 1 most 36 53 of the lake sites studied were included in a survey conducted in fall 2000 by wolfe et al 2007 the other 17 lakes lakes m1 to m19 are a subset also sampled by community based monitoring groups to track variation in muskrat abundance the entire lake set is largely equivalent to that reported in remmer et al 2020a and spans the range of lake hydrological conditions in the delta 2 3 meteorological conditions and spring ice jam flooding in 2018 and 2019 based on the 1981 2010 climate normal measured at the fort chipewyan airport station mean monthly air temperatures range from 20 c to 15 c and average annual precipitation is 365 mm fig 2 monthly temperatures during the two study years were similar to the climate normal with the following exceptions in may june 2018 average monthly air temperatures were warmer than the climate normal this was followed by cooler than average air temperature in september in 2019 air temperature was colder in february and warmer in march than the climate normal cumulative precipitation in 2018 345 mm was 20 mm less than the climate normal cumulative precipitation in 2019 443 mm exceeded the annual climate normal by late september during the open water season substantial rainfall occurred in june 2018 61 mm and august 2019 106 mm approximately 45 mm of rain was measured on august 14 2019 which is far more than any other single day and unusual for the region widespread ice jam flooding in late april early may 2018 delivered river floodwaters to nearly half of all lake sites table 1 the extent of river floodwaters was delineated by remmer et al 2020b and includes a large central area within the athabasca sector and small areas of the northern peace sector of the lakes where we deployed water level loggers this event flooded 19 lakes 73 in the athabasca sector and 8 lakes 36 in the peace sector spring flooding was more limited in 2019 and was detected in 8 28 of the athabasca sector lakes and no lakes in the peace sector where loggers were deployed table 1 remmer et al 2020a 3 methods 3 1 field methods water level loggers onset hobo pressure transducers model u20 001 01 4 m range 0 3 cm accuracy were installed at a central location of each lake in mid may 2018 and 2019 shortly after ice off fig 1 most study lakes have a simple bathymetry where maximum depth occurs near the center of the lake exceptions include oxbow lakes pad 15 54 which are remnant river channels and where the thalweg is likely closer to the outer bank for these two lakes we deployed loggers equidistant from the shorelines on one of the arms which are not at their deepest location each logger was attached to a rock sock anchor by zip tie and a wooden float by nylon rope water pressure psi and temperature c were recorded every hour until removed in mid september of each year gps coordinates were logged immediately after each device was deployed to aid their retrieval and guide re deployment at a consistent location the following year in both years a single logger was also deployed outside the field house in fort chipewyan to measure variation in local atmospheric pressure and air temperature these data were used to convert water pressure readings at each lake to water depth m using the barometric compensation data assistant in the hoboware software rstudio v1 3 1073 r core team 2019 software and external packages pracma lubridate ggplot2 were used to calculate and graph daily 24 hour running means borchers 2019 grolemund and wickham 2011 wickham 2016 from this point forward we simply refer to the water depth measurements as lake level or lake level patterns or variation 3 2 river hydrometric data and canadian digital elevation model water level data were obtained from hydrometric stations maintained by the water survey of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca for river sites athabasca river 07d001 07dd011 peace river 07k005 rivière des rochers 07na007 lake claire 07kf002 mamawi lake 07kf003 and lake athabasca 07kf003 to compare to our lake level data fig 1 hydrometric data for the peace river were unavailable during early spring 2018 because river ice damaged the hydrometric station a canada wide digital elevation model cdem was included as a map layer in arcmap 10 7 1 to explore and visualize relations between elevation and spatial distribution of lake level patterns the cdem was created in 2016 by the department of natural resources canada and is accessible online at https maps canada ca czs index en html the coverage and resolution of the cdem varies according to latitude and uses the north american datum 1983 as a reference system for horizontal coordinates elevations are orthometric and expressed relative to mean sea level canadian geodetic vertical datum 1928 for the study region the cdem offers a spatial base resolution of 0 75 x 0 75 arc seconds and a measured altimetric accuracy of 0 10 m 3 3 classification of lake level patterns based on visual observation of individual lake level patterns geographical location and simple numerical analyses study lakes were sorted into the following four categories for 2018 and 2019 1 drawdown 15 cm decline 2 stable 15 cm decline 3 gradual rise and 4 sharp rise lake level decline was calculated as the minimum lake level subtracted by the initial lake level at the time of logger deployment table 1 initial lake level was selected as the benchmark rather than maximum lake level because the latter is time dependent and varies from lake to lake the threshold used to separate lakes into the drawdown versus stable categories 15 cm was based on approximation of the median drawdown for lakes in 2018 and 2019 17 0 cm and 16 2 cm respectively fig 3 temporal patterns of gradual rise and sharp rise were visually discernable as lake levels that increased slowly or rapidly respectively for study lakes located adjacent to large open drainage lakes i e claire and mamawi we also visually assessed for lake level correlation between the study lake and adjacent open drainage lake as evidence of gradual rise due to inundation by rising levels in the open drainage network estimates of maximum lake level change for gradual and sharp rise lakes table 1 were obtained from the lake level maximum subtracted by the lake level measured on june 14th for both years june 14th was selected to minimize the potential effects from spring flooding and is 24 h before the earliest lake level rise associated with open water flooding 4 results lakes in both sectors of the pad displayed lake level variations of the stable drawdown and gradual rise categories during 2018 and 2019 figs 4 5 however only lakes in the athabasca sector exhibited the sharp rise pattern in lake levels during 2018 and 2019 figs 4 5 given this difference and previous research demonstrating lake water balances contrast greatly between the peace and athabasca sectors wolfe et al 2007 remmer et al 2020a we present and describe the results separately for each sector we also report spatial distribution of lake level patterns with respect to land surface elevations and proximity to active river channels 4 1 peace sector including both study years 25 lakes in the peace sector fell into the drawdown category which is more than any of the other categories fig 4a b ten lakes 45 5 pad 2 3 4 5 12 50 52 53 57 58 displayed drawdown in 2018 and 15 lakes 68 2 pad 1 4 12 13 14 15 17 50 52 53 57 58 m16 m17 m18 in 2019 seven of the lakes fell into the drawdown category in both years all but one of the drawdown lakes is elevated above 210 masl fig 6 baril lake pad 53 is the sole exception located within the 205 210 masl range baril lake also shows higher frequency variation compared to other lakes in this category possibly due to its larger fetch that generates greater wind driven lake level fluctuation in 2018 lake level decline began at lakes in this category in early july and continued until loggers were retrieved in mid september in contrast lake level decline began earlier in 2019 mid may and ended earlier mid august when substantial rainfall coincided with a sudden small rise in lake levels 4 8 1 2 cm among the lakes in this category pad 50 drew down sufficiently to expose the logger to the atmosphere after mid july 2019 two of the 10 drawdown lakes in 2018 shifted to the stable category in 2019 pad 3 5 the next most common lake level category in the peace sector was stable fig 4c d in 2018 11 lakes 50 0 pad 1 6 13 15 17 54 65 m15 m17 m18 m19 exhibited this behaviour of these four lakes pad 15 54 m17 m18 received ice jam floodwaters in the spring remmer et al 2020b eight lakes 33 3 pad 3 5 6 16 54 65 m15 m19 fell in this category in 2019 when spring flooding was less extensive lakes in the stable category are situated east of the chenal des quatre fourches and span a range of elevations 205 225 masl fig 6 lakes in the stable category displayed a sudden small rise 5 0 0 9 cm coincident with the major rain event in mid august 2019 as observed for lakes in the drawdown category six of the 11 stable lakes in 2018 shifted to the drawdown category in 2019 pad 1 13 15 17 m17 m18 one lake in the peace sector pad 8 exhibited a gradual rise in lake level which coincided with the rise and fall of lake athabasca and its outlet channel the rivière des rochers but not with variation of peace river levels fig 4e h this lake is connected to the rivière des rochers via a single distributary channel chilloney s creek which serves as both an inflow or outflow depending on relative water levels of pad 8 and the rivière des rochers none of the lakes in the peace sector displayed a sharp rise in lake level in 2018 and 2019 and temporal patterns of lake level variation in the three other categories show little to no association with variation of peace river levels during the open water season fig 4g h 4 2 athabasca sector similar to the peace sector drawdown was the most common lake level pattern in the athabasca sector during the two study years fig 5a b eleven lakes fell in this category in 2018 42 3 pad 19 20 23 24 32 36 39 m1 m3 m4 m6 and 10 lakes in 2019 34 5 pad 19 20 21 23 32 m4 m6 m8 m9 six lakes fell into this category in both study years the timing and duration of lake level decline was comparable to that observed in the peace sector in both study years of the 11 drawdown lakes in 2018 8 received floodwaters during the spring prior to logger deployment lakes in the drawdown category in 2018 and 2019 are situated across a wide range of elevations 205 225 masl fig 6 three of the drawdown lakes in 2018 displayed a different lake level pattern in 2019 one was classified as stable and two as sharp rise in contrast to the peace sector relatively few lakes fell into the stable category in the athabasca sector in 2018 and 2019 fig 5c d this includes 3 lakes in 2018 11 5 pad 22 m5 m11 and 7 lakes in 2019 24 1 pad 22 27 36 39 m5 m6 m11 all but one of these lakes are situated above 215 masl fig 6 the exception m11 is located southeast of mamawi lake at 205 210 masl all three of the lakes in 2018 remained in the stable category in 2019 five lakes 19 2 m8 m9 m10 m12 m14 displayed gradual rise of lake level in 2018 and one lake 3 4 m10 fell in this category in 2019 fig 5e f lake level variations in these lakes coincided with those of the open drainage network lakes claire mamawi and athabasca fig 5e f fewer lakes with gradual rise in 2019 compared to 2018 corresponds with 0 5 m lower peak lake levels in the open drainage network fig 5e f in 2019 lake level at m10 declined gradually between mid may and early august similar to lakes in the drawdown category and then rose gradually after mid august when adjacent lake claire reached maximum lake level lakes in the gradual rise category are situated at elevations between 205 and 210 masl and occur south east of lake claire m8 m9 m10 and along the southern edge of mamawi lake pad m12 m14 fig 6 in 2019 m12 and m14 shifted to the sharp rise category and m8 and m9 exhibited the drawdown pattern several lakes in the athabasca sector displayed sharp rises of lake level which was not observed in lakes of the peace sector fig 5g h in 2018 7 lakes 26 9 pad 26 30 31 33 38 46 m7 fell into this category with two to four sharp rises evident in late june early july mid july and early august these same 7 lakes plus 5 others 41 4 pad 24 25 m1 m12 m14 displayed sharp rises in early july mid july late july and early august in 2019 in most instances lake levels declined markedly after each rise and coincided with sharp rise and fall in athabasca river levels during both years suggesting open water river flooding is the cause of these lake level variations fig 5i j exceptions to this include three lakes where lake level did not decline markedly after a sharp rise pad 46 in 2018 m1 and m12 in 2019 prolonged high lake levels in pad 46 and m12 may reflect inundation by rising levels of adjacent mamawi lake after input of river floodwaters in july m1 lacks an adjacent open drainage lake which suggests the peak river levels in early july 2019 only briefly exceeded the sill elevation for this lake on one occasion and the lake remained bank full thereafter maximum rise of lake level ranged from 31 to 170 cm with a mean of 73 cm in 2018 and 104 cm in 2019 table 1 river floodwaters reached more lakes in 2019 when the athabasca river at embarras airport reached a maximum level of 216 5 masl 1 1 m higher than the maximum level in 2018 215 4 masl fig 5 in both years open water flooding occurred south of the athabasca river and along downstream portions of cree mamawi creek and adjacent to mamawi lake fig 6 5 discussion continuous hourly lake level measurements at 50 lakes across the peace athabasca delta during two open water seasons 2018 2019 revealed four distinctive patterns of lake level variation drawdown 15 cm decline stable 15 cm decline gradual rise and sharp rise the number of lakes that displayed each lake level pattern differed between years and sectors of the pad in the peace sector drawdown and stable patterns were equally prevalent in 2018 n 10 and 11 respectively but drawdown was more common than stable in 2019 15 and 8 respectively in the athabasca sector drawdown was the most prevalent pattern in 2018 10 followed by sharp rise 7 and gradual rise 5 in 2019 sharp rise 12 was most common followed by drawdown and stable 9 and 7 respectively lakes in the stable and drawdown categories consistently occur at elevations greater than 215 masl in the peace sector in contrast to the athabasca sector where lakes with these lake level patterns were located across a range of elevations 205 220 masl gradual rise lakes consistently occur at low elevations 205 210 masl and are situated adjacent to lake claire and mamawi lake in the athabasca sector whereas the sole gradual rise lake in the peace sector possesses a connection to the rivière des rochers via chilloney s creek lakes that had a sharp rise of lake level were only found within the athabasca sector at low elevations 205 215 masl and adjacent to active river channels athabasca and embarras rivers cree mamawi creek lakes in the pad have long been recognized to span a broad hydrological spectrum and be potentially influenced by several processes including snowmelt ice jam flooding rainfall open water flooding water level fluctuations in the open drainage network and evaporation padpg 1973 peters et al 2006 pietroniro et al 1999 prowse and demuth 1996 remmer et al 2018 2020a 2020b wolfe et al 2007 2008 lake level variations are a sensitive measure and a direct consequence of the relative influence of many of these hydrological processes based on systematic lake level patterns figs 4 5 and their spatial distribution fig 6 we propose a new hydrological classification system for lakes in the pad defined by key hydrological processes table 2 5 1 hydrological processes that define a new lake categorization system for the pad during the open water season we identify a singular dominant hydrological process among the several processes operating across the pad that defines each of the four new lake hydrological categories table 2 1 drawdown lakes are strongly influenced by evaporation as reflected by their consistent gradual lake level declines throughout the summer that exceed 15 cm however because ice jam floodwaters in 2018 raised lake levels of several drawdown lakes in the athabasca sector surface outflow also may have contributed to their lake level decline early during the open water season 2 stable lakes did not experience substantial drawdown 15 cm because of summer rainfall that offset evaporation lake morphology and catchment characteristics including watershed to lake area and surface area to volume ratios and localized rainfall events may explain the differing relative influence of rainfall its associated runoff and evaporation on drawdown and stable lakes these factors are difficult to quantify because of the low relief terrain and there is only one meteorological station fort chipewyan airport in this remote region 3 gradual rise lakes are characterized by inflow due to hydrological connectivity with adjacent large open drainage lakes principally lakes claire and mamawi and distributary channels of the open drainage network 4 sharp rise lakes correspond with rise of the athabasca river beyond its flood stage identifying open water season flooding as the main hydrological process that characterizes these lakes ice jam flooding and snowmelt can influence all lakes across the delta during the early open water season padpg 1973 prowse and conly 1998 timoney 2013 however these hydrological processes are not readily identified in the lake level records because loggers cannot be installed until after ice off and thus after snowmelt and ice jam flooding have occurred the new lake hydrological classification scheme offers distinct advantages over the conventional closed restricted and open drainage categories table 2 lists the number of lakes in our study set that fall into the former drainage categories based on water isotope and water chemistry data from 2001 wolfe et al 2007 closed drainage lakes and their subset of rainfall influenced lakes have now been partitioned into drawdown and stable lakes based on the prevailing influence of evaporation and rainfall respectively the broad spectrum of restricted drainage lakes is reflected by distribution among all four of the new categories further demonstrating that restricted drainage lakes are influenced by a wide range of hydrological processes a distinct advantage is that the new categories distinguish formally restricted drainage lakes that receive open water flooding via direct inflow of athabasca river water i e sharp rise lakes versus inundation or connection with the open drainage network i e gradual rise lakes conventionally three lakes have been identified as open drainage claire mamawi richardson timoney 2013 but they span two of the four new categories proposed here lakes claire and mamawi displayed gradual rise of lake levels as would be expected of large through flow lakes in flat terrain that receive inflow from rivers with sharply rising lake levels however lake levels rose sharply at richardson lake pad 38 during open water seasons of 2018 and 2019 lake levels at pad 25 26 and 46 identified as open drainage by wolfe et al 2007 also rose sharply thus the new lake classification system identifies the non uniform influence of hydrological processes in this previously defined category of open drainage lakes it also reveals that a broad suite of hydrological processes influence lake levels in the delta and shifts in several of these processes can lead to lake level drawdown these include climate induced increase in duration of the open water season and increased evaporation reduced open water flooding and decline of precipitation 5 2 characterization of open water flooding recently substantial open water flooding was detected in the athabasca sector using seasonal measurement of water isotope compositions remmer et al 2020a and remote sensing peters et al 2021 hourly lake level data improves our understanding of the influence of this hydrological process by capturing the precise timing that floodwaters enter a lake the magnitude of lake level rise and the spatial extent of flooding in 2018 open water flooding of sharp rise lakes coincided with increases in the water level of the athabasca river during 2 3 intervals in mid june mid july and late july which raised levels by 0 33 1 41 m fig 4 table 1 in 2019 open water flooding occurred during 3 5 intervals including three in july and two in early august which raised levels of sharp rise lakes by 0 31 1 79 m fig 5 table 1 each one of these flood events occurred during an interval of one to two weeks continuous lake level measurements demonstrate that multiple pulses of river floodwater may enter lakes in the athabasca sector during the open water season potentially resulting in lake level increases exceeding 1 5 m given that most lakes are 1 m deep and some are less than 0 5 m deep open water flooding is clearly an important recharge mechanism for lakes in the athabasca sector high levels of the athabasca river in 2018 and 2019 also promoted gradual rise of water levels at mamawi lake and lake claire which inundated nearby basins gradual rise lakes figs 4 5 although the athabasca river peaked at 216 5 masl in 2019 more than 1 m higher than in 2018 215 4 masl spatial extent of floodwaters was similar fig 6 flooded regions captured by sharp rise lakes include along the southern margin of the delta and the cree mamawi creek corridor in the athabasca sector and likely define the areas most susceptible to the direct effects of open water flooding our interpretation of the spatial extent of open water flooding includes gradual rise lakes fig 6 which were indirectly influenced by the high discharge on the athabasca river via the open drainage network notably open water flooding did not extend to the terminus region of the athabasca river which includes the traditional territory of the athabasca chipewyan first nation located adjacent to the wbnp boundary at the southeastern edge of the pad likely due to diversion of flow through cree mamawi creek caused by the embarras breakthrough in 1982 kay et al 2019 wolfe et al 2008 indeed the lake depth data reveal that drawdown is common among lakes at the athabasca river terminus in the absence of open water flooding e g m1 m3 m4 m6 figs 5 6 this is an important finding because it identifies systematic lake level drawdown which has negative consequences for land users and access to traditional lands we consider the spatial extent of open water flooding depicted in fig 6 to be more accurate than that approximated in fig 4 of remmer et al 2020a in part because the latter is influenced by the timing of water sample collection for isotope analysis periodic ice jam flooding in spring is well known as an important source of replenishment for lakes in the pad prowse and conly 2000 prowse and lalonde 1996 timoney et al 1997 and causes of reduced frequency of this hydrological process have been subject to much debate given concerns of lake level drawdown during recent decades e g beltaos 2018 wolfe et al 2020 less attention has been placed on the frequency of open water flood events probably because unlike ice jam floods they are difficult to predict or observe as they typically generate smaller more localized flooding and can occur at any time during the open water season we examined the athabasca river hydrometric record at the old fort gauging station id 07dd011 fig 1 to assess the frequency of potential open water flood events equivalent to or greater than 2018 and 2019 since the embarras breakthrough in 1982 table 3 fig 7 we utilized data recorded at old fort hydrometric station because the station at embarras airport only reports water levels since 2014 at old fort station peak water level was 214 5 masl during 2018 and 215 4 masl during 2019 the water level record of the athabasca river at this station shows that the 2018 threshold has been exceeded during 16 years since 1982 42 of years demonstrating that open water flooding of similar or greater magnitude as 2018 has been a common occurrence during the past 38 years given that peak water levels of the athabasca river have exceeded the 2019 threshold during only 8 of those years 21 it is likely that open water flooding has infrequently extended to the athabasca river terminus during this time this interpretation is consistent with paleolimnological records that depict reduced influence of river floodwaters in this region of the athabasca sector since 1982 kay et al 2019 the record at old fort station also shows an extended interval of low peak summer river levels during 1998 2010 since then peak river levels have exceeded the 2018 threshold in at least 6 years since 2011 note missing data for 2014 and 2015 we also note that the timing of peak water level at old fort station in any given year may span a 6 week interval such marked seasonal and annual temporal variation in peak river levels of the athabasca river and associated open water flooding highlights the importance of monitoring the frequency of these important recharge events using continuous lake level recorders 5 3 implications for monitoring given projected declines in summer discharge of east flowing rivers fed by high elevation glaciers and snowpack in the rocky mountains chernos et al 2020 debeer and sharp 2007 hugonnet et al 2021 tennant and menounos 2013 peak summer levels in the athabasca river and associated open water flooding at the pad are likely to decline in coming decades if so frequency of lakes in the sharp rise and gradual rise categories will decrease and shift to the stable and or drawdown categories depending on amount of rainfall runoff and evaporative water loss combined with predicted declines in ice jam flood frequency beltaos and bonsal 2021 lamontagne et al 2021 and longer duration of the open water season promoting greater evaporative water loss barnett et al 2005 schindler and donahue 2006 lake levels are likely to decline across broad areas of the pad ongoing monitoring of lake levels can inform stewardship decisions for wood buffalo national park a priority of the federal action plan wbnp 2019 and ensure long term sustainability of the delta s ecosystems during the ongoing climate crisis for example lake level monitoring has become an effective management tool for the north saskatchewan watershed alliance to track long term water level trends at 33 lakes across the province of alberta islam and seneka 2015 nswa 2017 analogous to fig 1a in nswa 2017 we summarize the number of lakes in each hydrological category using pie charts to demonstrate how these data can be used to track the influence of shifting hydrological conditions across sectors and years fig 8 this end product highlights the importance of open water flooding sharp rise lakes in the athabasca sector and evaporation drawdown lakes in the peace sector the approach captured marked increase of drawdown lakes in the peace sector and sharp rise lakes in the athabasca sector between 2018 and 2019 which suggests strong potential for ongoing lake level monitoring we recommend lake level monitoring be integrated with other hydrological monitoring tools such as water isotope tracers and remote sensing imagery to quantify relative importance of ice jam flooding snowmelt and evaporation on lake water balance remmer et al 2020a 2020b and to corroborate the spatial extent of river flooding and lake drying pavelsky and smith 2008 peters et al 2021 töyrä and pietroniro 2005 combined use of these approaches can strengthen monitoring of dynamic lake rich landscapes such as the pad and better characterize the varying influence of hydrological processes and the timescales at which they operate given sufficient financial resources transferability of this approach to similar remote freshwater landscapes is possible such as the nearby slave river delta brock et al 2007 and saskatchewan river delta mackinnon et al 2015 although there may be site specific hydrological processes to consider such as the influence of seiche events on great slave lake on the former at the pad wildlife abundance aquatic habitat and limnological conditions are strongly regulated by hydrological processes that cause changes in lake levels muskrat for example is a culturally important and keystone species used to track aquatic habitat availability and ecological integrity of shallow lakes in the pad straka et al 2018 ward et al 2018 2020 muskrat abundance has been shown to respond rapidly to changes in freeze up water levels as they rely on vegetation under ice to survive throughout winter virgil and messier 1997 density of muskrat houses increased by two orders of magnitude after spring flooding in 2014 and slowly declined during subsequent drier years as water depth declined straka et al 2018 lake level rise caused by input of turbid floodwater dramatically reduces water clarity concentrations of dissolved nutrients organic carbon and ions and biomass of phytoplankton and macrophytes at seasonal timescales or longer wiklund et al 2012 flooding that causes rapid rise of lake levels is likely to result in greater reductions in these variables than flooding that causes gradual rise absence of recent flooding on the other hand leads to higher concentration of nutrients and ions higher ph and greater penetration of solar radiation to the bottom of shallow lakes leading to higher production of macrophytes phytoplankton and their consumers such conditions characterize lakes in the stable and drawdown categories wiklund et al 2012 persistent drawdown of water levels eventually results in loss of littoral habitat and encroachment of terrestrial vegetation such as willow which impedes mobility of large wildlife e g bison and land users timoney 2013 spatio temporal variation in lake types across the pad supports an abundance and diversity of aquatic and semi aquatic biota yet climate change is predicted to increase proportions of lakes in the drawdown and stable categories at the expense of lakes in the gradual rise and rapid rise categories clearly continued monitoring of lake level variation coupled with research on links with the ecological structure and function of the lakes is important to inform about ongoing hydroecological changes in response to climate trends and other stressors credit authorship contribution statement l k neary

8101,study region arogbo community ondo state nigeria study focus in this study groundwater and subsoil contamination within the coastal aquifers of arogbo was investigated in order to determine the nature and sources of contamination and its variation with season in dry and wet seasons water samples were analysed for their physico chemical and bacteriological properties while soil samples were collected at depths of 0 0 5 and 0 5 1 0 m to determine the elemental concentration of heavy metals and their variation with depth new hydrological insights for the region the data obtained showed that the aquifer is shallow with a depth to water table ranging from 0 37 to 1 20 m the hydro chemical results revealed that the quality of water have been greatly impaired by the presence of contaminants such as fe mn and brackish water while the bacterial analysis showed that only few water samples were fit for human consumption the results of soil analysis revealed the presence of anthropogenic contaminants such as cd cu and zn this study concluded that the soil contaminants had no significant impact on the contamination level of water within the study area rather terrestrial sources of iron and manganese were the major contaminants responsible for the high level of colouration of surface water and groundwater within the study area these contaminants could pose serious health hazards to residents of the community keywords groundwater contamination soil contamination heavy metals saline water coastal aquifer physico chemical properties 1 introduction water is vital

or groundwater e g hand dug wells boreholes and springs groundwater storage and aquifer productivity is usually high within sedimentary basins oteze 1981 albertsson 2014 however the availability of groundwater is not a universal solution to the deterioration of water quality macdonald et al 2012 according to todd 1980 the quality of groundwater is as important as its immense quantity drinking water should not only be safe but also acceptable in terms of its appearance odour and taste though drinking water standards may differ with country and region groundwater considered as safe for drinking should not pose a health risk to its consumers over a lifetime of consumption who 2017 currently nigeria is faced with several environmental challenges particularly with respect to groundwater albertsson 2014 in the coastal regions of nigeria it is usually less difficult to site hand dug wells and boreholes for groundwater abstraction however there is the challenge of water contamination arising from anthropogenic activities or natural geologic processes when these contaminants enter the subsurface they persist sometimes for longer periods within the soil and aquifer system causing serious health problems when ingested by humans beyond the prescribed permissible limit who 2017 abstraction of contaminated groundwater for drinking purposes have been linked with cancer arsenic asbestos liver and kidney diseases lead mercury cadmium pregnancy risks and neurological damage and lower iq lead arsenic and skeletal and bone diseases lead fluoride cadmium while others could pose a serious threat to vegetation fish habitat and wildlife gbadebo 2005 ezekwe et al 2012 who 2017 seawater intrusion into fresh water aquifers is also a major reason for water quality degradation in coastal aquifers akujieze et al 2003 ayolabi et al 2013 rahaman and bhattacharya 2014 this could be due to sea level rise invasion of low lying shore by seawater overflow which leads to the percolation of sea water into the shallow aquifer or over exploitation of fresh groundwater for local use oteri 1988 werner and simmons 2009 sathish et al 2011 generally these contaminants increase the rate of mortality and morbidity for plants animals and humans in the coastal regions of ondo state nigeria there is widespread aquifer productivity faleye and olorunfemi 2015 to an extent that water is easily accessed from shallow wells this could be attributed to the geology geomorphology and effective rainfall within the region however groundwater contamination and soil degradation within the region remains a source of great concern oloruntegbe et al 2009 olotu et al 2009 using simple time analysis and composite index approaches to compute the water poverty index wpi values for ondo state showed that ese odo local government lg is the most water stressed region in ondo state a reconnaissance survey of ese odo lg revealed that arogbo community is one of the most impacted community within the lg with evidence of high level of colouration from surface and groundwater which is an indication of some form of contamination within the community currently very few studies have been carried out within arogbo community on groundwater contamination while none has been carried out on soil contamination this could be due to difficulty in accessing the riverine community and security challenges emanating from militancy in the region adeyemo et al 2015 in their study of groundwater quality in the eastern section of dahomey basin reported from analyses of only one water sample from arogbo community that the concentration of iron 32 mg l was above the who acceptable limit however this sampling is inadequate to make conclusions on groundwater and sub soil contamination within the community hence this study was carried out to determine the nature possible sources and variation of groundwater and sub soil contamination with season within arogbo community 2 description of the study area 2 1 location and accessibility the study area arogbo community fig 1 is located within ese odo lg area of ondo state at the eastern edge of the dahomey basin about two third of ese odo lg is made up of creeks lagoons and rivers arogbo community lies within latitudes 06o15 05 and 06o16 02 n and longitudes 04o59 15 and 05o00 42 e on land covering a total area of 2 5 km2 the community is surrounded by rivers and swamps arogbo community is strategic because it is the headquarters of the ijaw speaking tribes in the riverine communities it can only be accessed by water transportation through agadagba obon community which is connected to upland by road and is a few hundreds of metres away from arogbo community on water entrance into arogbo community by water transportation is majorly through water side where jetties have been constructed to receive people 2 2 climate and vegetation the study area falls within the equatorial evergreen swampy forest region of nigeria where it rains from march to october and is relatively dry from november to february its mean annual total rainfall exceeds 2000 mm year ondo state diagnostic survey report 2009 arogbo community is drained by rivers arogbo and pankumo and the neighbouring swamps river arogbo being the major river flows southward from the benin axis and takes a detour towards the west connecting other rivers which flow in the direction of the atlantic ocean the mean monthly temperature is 27 with a mean monthly deviation of 2 while mean relative humidity is over 75 ondo state diagnostic survey report 2009 there is little or no agricultural activity in arogbo residents of the community majorly engage in fishing timber felling and palm wine tapping in neighbouring swamps rivers and forest regions 2 3 hydro geological setting of the study area the study area falls within the eastern section of the dahomey basin in southwestern nigeria the stratigraphic sequence of the dahomey basin has been well documented by several authors omatsola and adegoke 1981 agagu 1985 billman 1992 they include the cretaceous abeokuta group made up of ise afowo and araromi formations jones and hockey 1964 omatsola and adegoke 1981 the paleocene ewekoro formation the late paleocene to early eocene akinbo shale the eocene oshosun and ilaro formations the pleistocene to recent benin formation coastal plain sands and the coastal alluvium formation omatsola and adegoke 1981 nevertheless the benin and the recent coastal alluvium formations represent the most important formations for groundwater development nwankwoala and walter 2012 albertsson 2014 within the basin the benin formation also known as the coastal plain sands jones and hockey 1964 has the most extensive sedimentary outcrop within the dahomey basin with a total surface area of about 5000 km2 it predominantly consists of unconsolidated medium to coarse grained sands 80 with minor clays 15 and lignites 5 occurring occasionally nwankwor et al 1979 a thickness of about 400 m has been reported towards the coast agagu 1985 the coastal alluvium sediment deposited along the shore oyeyemi et al 2015 consists mostly of interlayered sand silt clay and plant debris the sand being well sorted varies from fine to coarse grained the thickness of the alluvium sediments has been reported to be at least 153 m nwankwor et al 1979 agagu 1985 within these formations groundwater is housed in thick and extensive sand aquifers which are highly permeable and productive to maintain numerous streams all year round nwankwor et al 1979 nwankwoala and walter 2012 aladejana et al 2020 reported that the static water level swl within the dahomey basin varies from 0 2 to 67 m in dry season and 0 3 123 m in wet season within the basin aquifer exists locally in confined and semi confined conditions with water flowing from the north east section of the basin towards the southwest and southern directions nwankwor et al 1979 within the study area fig 1 the topsoil is made up of white beach sand at agwobiri ayubabiri egbesubiri itebu tolukiribo and abedgnigo zion while at waterside and part of erubiri the topsoil is made up of clay and sandy clay sediments the long wet season characterised by high rainfall every year recharges the major streams and rivers within the study area 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analytical procedure thirty water samples b 01 b 10 r 01 r 02 and w 01 w18 table 1 were collected in dry season february 2020 and while twenty eight 28 of these water samples were collected in wet season august 2020 for analysis of their physico chemical parameters water pumps from boreholes b 02 and b 04 were faulty in wet season and were therefore not analysed na in wet season the water samples were collected into sterilized 2 l polyethylene bottles for anion and cation analyses and mccartney bottles for bacterial analysis before collection the bottles for anions and cations were rinsed twice with the water sample to be collected on site the taste odour and colour of each water samples were recorded while the electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and ph were measured with the aid of calibrated ele conductivity and ph metres for each sample the accuracy of the measured tds and ec values were determined by ensuring that the tds ec ratio was within 0 55 0 75 hem 1985 samples for the determination of cations were preserved with 3 ml of 70 nitric acid hno3 on collection while those of anions were refrigerated between 1 and 4 to minimize precipitation of solutes and escape of dissolved gases thereafter the samples were transported to the laboratory analysed for several parameters following applicable standard methods golterman et al 1978 ademoroti 1996 apha 2005 within the recommended time frame the apparent colour and turbidity of the water samples were determined using a colorimeter with measurements taken at 430 and 540 nm wavelength of the colorimeter respectively total alkalinity and chloride were determined by titrimetric method nitrate was determined quantitatively by the brucine method prior to cation analyses water samples were filtered using the whatman grade 1 filter paper thereafter the chemical concentration of cations of fe mn cu and zn were determined with the use of the atomic absorption spectrophotometer mertz 1987 the chemical concentrations of each element was compared with the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended standards to determine the quality of water and major groundwater contaminants within the study area a loopful of the water samples for microbial analysis were streaked on already prepared sterile nutrient agar plates deepesh et al 2013 also a 10 fold serial dilution was performed and 0 1 ml from the 10 2 dilution was plated using spread plate method on already prepared sterile nutrient agar plates the plates were incubated at 37 for 24 hrs and thereafter examined for growth who 1984 deepesh et al 2013 thereafter samples that yielded low bacterial colony counts on agar plates were chosen as representative samples to conduct a most probable number mpn analysis with the sole aim to detect coliform bacteria per ml of the samples at a depth of 0 0 5 m twenty five 25 soil samples sb 01 sb 03 sb 05 sb 08 sb 10 sr 01 sr 02 sw 01 sw 14 sw 17 sw 18 were collected with hand auger at their corresponding water sampling locations at five 5 of these locations with dense population soil samples sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 sw 18 were collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m in order to determine the variation of soil heavy metal concentration with increased depth and its possible implication for groundwater quality in wet season few soil samples sb 02 sr 01 sb 18 could not be accessed and were not analysed in all thirty soil samples were collected in dry season while twenty seven 27 soil samples were collected in wet season in cases were soil samples collected were below the vadoze zone the samples were tilted to allow substantial amount of water to drain off after collection thereafter all soil samples were broken down into smaller aggregates spread evenly on polyethlene nylons and air dried at ambient temperatures in order to reduce the soil moisture content the soil samples were sieved through a 2 m mesh and one 1 gram of each soil sample was selected for extraction the extraction process was achieved by adding 10 ml of aqua regia solution hydrochloric acid and nitric acid in the ratio 3 1 to the soil samples in a beaker and heated at a controlled temperature for few hours based on the iso standard 11466 the extracts were filtered into a bottle and brought up to 50 ml with distilled water after extraction the metal concentrations in each soil sample were measured with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas mertz 1987 and interpreted using various indices of soil contamination 3 2 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analyses such as the pearson correlation matrix analysis and cluster analysis were independently used to correlate and classify the groundwater samples based on their variables physico chemical parameters the pearson correlation matrix pcm measures the degree of linear relationship between any two variables the correlation coefficient varies from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates a strongly negative correlation 0 no linear correlation and 1 a strongly positive correlation liu et al 2003 cluster analysis ca reveals natural clusters within a given set of data it classifies variables based on the similarities of their chemical properties rahman et al 2014 and heterogeneity between their classes ca was performed based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering usually illustrated by a dendrogram mckenna 2003 using a combination of the ward s linkage method and squared euclidean distances to measure the similarity between samples and or variables 3 3 indices of soil contamination 3 3 1 index of geo accumulation the index of geo accumulation was originally designed to assess the level of heavy metal contamination in aquatic sediments mueller 1969 over time it has also been utilized to measure the level of soil contamination arising from toxic elements gemici and tarcam 2007 çolak 2012 it is computed by the equation 1 i geo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where c n is the measured elemental concentration in the pellitic fraction of the sediment 2 μ m and b n is the average geochemical background value average shale value taylor and mclennan 1995 for the element the constant 1 5 is introduced to accommodate possible variations of the background value arising from lithologic variations based on the i geo scheme mueller 1969 and colak 2012 classified soils into 7 categories table 2 3 3 2 contamination factor cf and pollution load index pli contamination factor cf is used to determine the level of sediment contamination by heavy metals the mean concentration c n of a given element from several sampling sites is divided by the average geochemical background value b n recorded in the upper earth s crust it is expressed by the equation edokpayi et al 2017 2 cf n c n mean b n cf n represents the contamination factor cf for each heavy metal the study area was divided into five axis the western axis was made up of samples sb 01 sb 10 sw 01 sw 02 and sw 03 the central southern axis made up of samples sb 08 sb 09 sw 04 sw 05 and sw 06 the south eastern axis made up of sb 02 sb 03 sw 07 sw 08 and sw 09 the north eastern axis made up of sb 05 sw 10 sw 11 sw 12 and sr 01 and the northern axis made up of sw 13 sw s14 sw 17 and sw 18 for uniformity only samples taken at a depth of 0 0 5 m were used to calculate the cf the pollution load index pli was originally proposed by tomlinson et al 1980 to assess the risk of all heavy metals in sediments it is expressed by the equation 3 pli cf 1 cf 2 cf 3 cf 4 cf n n the classification of results for cf and pli are given in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 on site auditing of groundwater quality the quality of groundwater is a function of its physical chemical and biological characteristics nwankwoala 2011 on site assessment of the quality of water samples in terms of their odour taste and colour is given in table 1 the depth of the boreholes could not be ascertained from residents of the community but an approximate depth of 20 m is assumed the hand dug wells were shallow with a maximum depth of 3 m and a depth to water table ranging from 0 37 to 1 20 m in the dry season most of the hand dug ringed wells within the study area had no covering over them except for w 05 w 08 w 12 and w 13 on site inspection of the water samples revealed that most samples from boreholes wells and river had an objectionable swampy odour which is a possible indication of surface water swamps rivers tributaries interaction with groundwater most of the water samples were tasteless while some were salty b 02 b 03 b 04 b 06 b 08 and sharp b 04 b 06 b 09 to the taste bud about 80 of the water appeared coloured while the rest were either colourless or slightly coloured the colouration of water samples from boreholes wells and river arogbo could be a possible indication that the quality of water within the study area have been impaired by contaminants such as humic acid fulvic acid and other colour imparting organic and inorganic substances in the soil 4 2 physico chemical parameters of water samples the physico chemical parameters of the analysed water samples and their respective concentration are documented in appendix 1 the ph of natural waters is often in the slightly acidic state owing to the presence of dissolved co2 and organic acids from decay and leaching of plant materials langmuir 1997 within the study area the ph of the water samples ranged from 2 7 to 6 8 in dry season while in wet season it increased in range from 4 to 8 5 fig 2a the variation of ph was greater in dry season 20 54 compared to wet season 16 66 the results revealed that only about 80 dry season and 20 wet season of the water samples were outside the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended range of 6 5 8 5 in drinking water most of the water samples were acidic in dry season while in wet season they were alkaline in nature across both seasons the ph of water from borehole samples 2 9 8 5 were more acidic compared to those from well 5 6 8 4 and river 5 8 7 8 samples fig 2a this suggests that well and river samples may share similar characteristics the pearson correlation matrix pcm table 3 revealed that ph had a strong positive correlation with alkalinity r 0 485 d 0 501 w p 0 01 while it had a strong negative correlation with ec r 0 435 d 0 395 w p 0 05 tds r 0 435 d 0 395 w p 0 05 cl r 0 587 d 0 415 w p 0 01 fe r 0 511 d p 0 01 mn r 0 739 d 0 512 w p 0 01 cu r 0 484 d 0 592 w p 0 01 and zn r 0 516 d 0 665w p 0 01 this shows that ph is greatly influenced by alkalinity and heavy metals such as fe mn zn and cu in the aquifer system this implies that water samples in the acidic domain especially those across both seasons could be associated with elevated levels of heavy metals such as fe mn zn and cu thus since water samples from boreholes are from greater depth compared to those from shallow wells there is the likelihood of increased metal concentration at greater depth within the aquifer their low ph values could cause gastrointestinal disorders such as hyper acidity ulcers and stomach pain the cloudiness of the water samples referred to as turbidity ranged from 4 92 to 179 71 ntu in dry season while in wet season it ranged from 1 35 to 137 25 ntu fig 2b the turbidity values were highly variable as indicated by the cv values about 96 dry season and 93 wet season of the water samples were above the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended standard of 5 ntu in drinking water for turbidity this is an indication that almost all samples within the study area were highly turbid suggesting similar conditions among all sample types high turbidity values are usually associated with poor water quality which may arise from chemical precipitates such as fe or mn organic particles and organisms or suspended particles such as clay or silts who 2017 highly turbid waters usually give off a milky white muddy red brown or black suspension who 2017 which reduces its acceptability for drinking purposes these assertions are supported by the pcm table 3 which showed that turbidity is strongly correlated with apparent colour r 0 812 d 0 944 w p 0 01 fe r 0 585 d 0 850 w p 0 01 and mn r 0 505 d p 0 01 the apparent colour ac of the water samples ranged from 3 17 to 257 33 hu in dry season and 0 225 24 hu in wet season fig 2b samples b 06 and b 08 had the lowest apparent colour of 3 17 hu each in the dry season while samples b 01 b 06 b 08 and w 18 had the lowest value of 0 hu in the wet season in both seasons sample w 09 had the highest value of 257 33 and 225 24 hu across seasons the apparent colour of samples b 01 b 06 b 08 w 17 and w 18 were within the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended standard 15 hu in drinking water ac showed a strong positive correlation with turbidity r 0 812 d 0 944 w p 0 01 and fe r 0 538 d 0 872 w p 0 01 table 3 this implies that the coloured water samples may have been greatly influenced by the presence of fe and or coloured organic matter in the aquifer system the electrical conductivity ec of water is a measure of its salt ionic content in terms of its ability to conduct electric current marandi et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 the electrical conductivity of the river and well samples ranged from 13 to 638 µs cm in dry season while in wet season it ranged from 33 to 715 µs cm for boreholes the ec value ranged from 511 to 1988 µs cm in dry season while in wet season it ranged from 134 to 1859 µs cm fig 2c generally most borehole samples exhibited higher ec values than well and river samples which is an indication of increased ionic content in the aquifer with increased depth low ec values are safer for drinking and domestic purposes laluraj and gopinath 2006 at the south eastern region of the study area samples b03 b04 and b06 had ec values exceeding the nsdwq 2007 standard of 1000 µs cm in drinking water while only sample b 03 was above the who 2017 recommended standard of 1500 µs cm the ec value of borehole samples suggest the possibility of brackish water at greater depth in the south eastern region the pcm table 3 showed that across both seasons tds r 1 00 d 1 00 w p 0 01 and cl r 0 927 d 0 867 w p 0 01 are the major influencers of ec values recorded in the water samples the strong correlation between ec tds and cl is an indication that their ions could be from the same source the total dissolved solids of the analysed water samples ranged from 7 to 1034 mg l in dry season and 17 967 mg l in wet season tds values have been employed by several authors to determine the possibility of saline water intrusion in coastal communities the palatability of drinking water below 600 mg l is generally considered good who 2017 above 1000 mg l its palatability becomes more questionable across both seasons most of the tds values fell within the nsdwq and who recommended value for tds in drinking water except for sample b03 though with a value of 967 mg l in wet season the tds value of sample b 03 suggests the possible presence of brackish water within the aquifer at the south eastern region of the study area across both seasons the tds of borehole samples 70 1034 mg l were greater than those from well and river samples 7 372 mg l which is an indication of increased ionic content with increased depth the alkalinity of the water samples ranged from 0 to 224 mg l in dry season and 0 414 mg l in wet season fig 2b the results revealed that well and river samples had better alkalinity values compared to borehole samples across both seasons water samples w 13 w 14 w 17 w 18 at the northern region of the study area maintained high alkalinity values while borehole samples b 04 b 06 b07 b09 maintained low alkalinity values of 0 mg l alkalinity showed a strong positive correlation with ph r 0 485 d 0 501 w p 0 01 table 3 since the buffering capacity associated with alkalinity of water serves as a ph and metal content regulator samples with very low alkalinity values e g b 04 b 06 b07 b09 may be very susceptible to a change in ph value and elevated levels of metal ions the results obtained for nitrate in the water samples ranged from 0 to 9 49 mg l in dry season and 0 09 21 14 mg l in wet season fig 2a the concentration of nitrate in the analysed water samples fell within the maximum permissible value in drinking water nsdwq 2007 who 2017 and will therefore pose no threat to human or aquatic life this suggests that similar condition exists for nitrate across all water sample types within the study area the low nitrate values may be due to the fact that there is little or no agricultural activities within the immediate environment of the study area chloride is palatable in drinking water at low concentrations but in excess makes water unpleasant for drinking and increases the electrical conductivity of water in dry season the concentration of chloride in the water samples ranged from 6 94 to 545 19 mg l while in wet season it ranged from 3 00 to 471 39 mg l fig 2c possessing higher values in borehole samples across both seasons there is no health based guideline for chloride in drinking water however a maximum permissible limit of 250 mg l has been set by nsdwq 20017 and who 2017 above this value a salty taste and an unpleasant odour is developed and the risk of pipe corrosion increases who 2006 in this study all well and river samples had their chloride concentration below the maximum permissible limit while most boreholes had their chloride concentration above the threshold value boreholes in this category suggests the possible presence of brackish water at greater depths within the coastal aquifers of arogbo chloride showed strong positive correlation with ec tds 0 927d 0 867w p 0 01 mn 0 524d 0 502w p 0 01 and strong negative correlation with ph 0 587d p 0 01 0 415w p 0 05 table 3 this is an indication that at low ph as the case with several boreholes the aquifer may contain high chloride content 4 3 bacterial analysis of water samples in dry season three samples b 03 b 06 and b 10 showed no growth both on the streaked and spread plates even after extending the incubation period to 48 h while other samples showed growth on both plates after 24 h of incubation table 4a the lack of growth could mean that samples b 03 b 06 and b 10 contain no bacterial cells or that they contain very few bacterial cells such that the amount cultured on the agar plates missed them out or that they contain bacterial cells that cannot grow on the general media used in wet season samples b09 and b10 showed no growth both on the streaked and spread plates even after extending the incubation period to 48 h the remaining samples however showed growth on both plates after 24 h of incubation the most probable number mpn results for both seasons table 4b showed that most representative samples tested were unfit for human consumption because more than 10 cfu ml of coliform bacteria were detected in 100 ml of the water samples analyzed samples b 09 b 10 and w 15 showed no colour change and were fit for drinking because they contained at least 3 or fewer coliform cells in 100 ml of the sample by mpn standard they were the best among all the representative samples tested the detection of coliform in the samples suggests a high probability of faecal contamination gaining access to the sample or there was a recent faecal contamination of the sample s in question iron fe is a metal that is widely distributed in geologic materials such as soils rocks and minerals where in it interacts with the groundwater system the pcm table 3 showed that fe strongly influenced the turbidity apparent colour and ph it also suggests that fe is closely associated with mn r 0 582 d 0 500 w p 0 01 iron was not detected nd in few of the water samples within the study area while in those where it was detected it ranged from 0 074 to 57 490 mg l in dry season and 0 080 22 539 mg l in wet season fig 2a the concentration of iron in the water samples was highly variable in both seasons the high concentration of fe in the aquifer may have resulted from the interaction of oxidized fe minerals and organic matter and the subsequent dissolution of fe2co3 at low ph values of the water samples mondal et al 2010 waters of this nature may appear clear when abstracted but suddenly turns brown and becomes cloudy after a short while due to the precipitation of fe oh 3 white et al 1991 the concentration of fe in about 27 dry season and 36 wet season of the water samples were within the maximum permissible limit of 0 3 mg l recommended by nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 for drinking water this is an indication that the quality of water from boreholes wells and river arogbo has been highly impaired by the presence of fe within the aquifer system impacting the taste and colour of water samples intake of iron rich water in excess quantity could damage healthy skin cells reduce birth weight in term born infants increase the risk of hemochromatosis iron overload liver disease and heart failure in humans and give foods and drinks a metallic taste making it less appealing in water systems they serve as host for bacterial growth some of which are harmful to humans perez de nanclares et al 2000 ellervik et al 2001 grazuleviciene et al 2009 who 2017 manganese mn just like fe is an abundant element within the earth s crust occurring naturally in minerals soils and rocks who 2006 an acceptability threshold of 0 1 mg l was set by the who for mn in drinking water however in acidic or anaerobic water mostly groundwater mn has the tendency to exist at higher concentrations who 2017 above this value 0 1 mg l an undesirable taste is induced in beverages while sanitary wares and laundry are stained results obtained for mn in the analysed water samples ranged from 0 021 to 0 487 mg l in dry season and 0 021 0 683 mg l in wet season fig 2 with the borehole samples possessing higher values across both seasons this is an indication that with increased depth as with borehole samples compared to shallow wells and surface waters there is an increase in the concentration of manganese within the aquifer system a health based value of 0 20 mg l was set for mn in drinking water by nsdwq 2007 above this value the risk of neurological disorder and damages to the lungs liver and kidney increases iwami et al 1994 takeda 2003 nsdwq 2007 across both seasons hotspots such as locations b 06 b 07 b 08 b 09 b 10 w 09 and w 12 had values above the health based guideline set by the nsdwq 2007 and therefore may pose a health risk to its consumers the presence of mn and fe above the acceptable threshold value in these water samples could be responsible for the objectionable reddish brown colour they are both considered as contaminants mainly due to their organoleptic properties ellis et al 2000 copper cu is a transition metal primarily found in rocks within the earth s crust it is both an essential nutrient and when in excess a drinking water contaminant in dry season presence of cu was not detected in most water samples except in sample b 06 where it had a value of 0 068 mg l fig 2d in wet season the concentration of cu varied from 0 030 to 0 736 mg l fig 2d these values are within the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 acceptable limit of 1 mg l for cu in drinking water thus there is no groundwater contamination within the study area arising from cu cu showed strong positive correlation with zn r 0 647 d 0 961 w p 0 01 and a strong negative correlation with ph 0 484d 0 592w p 0 01 table 3 these metals occur in significant quantities in rocks and are fairly mobile in soil zinc zn is an essential trace element beneficial for human growth it occurs naturally in small amounts in many rocks and soils as sulphide ores sphalerite zns or carbonates calamine znco3 who 2006 in both seasons the presence of zn was not detected in some of the water samples fig 2d and when they were detected they ranged from 0 010 to 0 065 mg l in dry season and 0 015 0 414 mg l in wet season fig 2d these values are below the maximum permissible limit of 3 mg l set by nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 in drinking water thus will have no negative health implication on its consumers generally the results of water analysis revealed that the quality of surface water and groundwater within the study area have been greatly impaired the apparent colour and turbidity of all water sample types were compromised by contaminants the results of ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids alkalinity manganese copper and zinc of well and river samples were similar in range and more within the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 permissible limits compared to those from boreholes the results of borehole samples showed that they were more acidic with increased ionic and heavy metal concentration compared to well and river samples across all water sample types the results revealed a significant presence of iron and coliform bacteria significant capable of upsetting the quality of water 4 4 spatial similarity and sampling sites grouping the hierarchical cluster analysis of the analysed parameters and sampling sites in dry and wet seasons is presented in the dendrogram fig 3 in both seasons two major clusters were observed for the analysed parameters fig 3a and c in dry season cluster 1 showed relationship among electrical conductivity total dissolved solids chloride copper zinc turbidity apparent colour iron and manganese while cluster 2 showed relationship among ph alkalinity and nitrate in wet season cluster 1 showed relationship among electrical conductivity total dissolved solids chloride manganese copper and zinc while cluster 2 showed close relationship among turbidity apparent colour iron ph alkalinity and nitrate in both seasons cluster 1 are representative of water types rich in ionic content and their associated heavy metals in dry season the association of iron and manganese with turbidity and apparent colour suggests they have a strong influence on the appearance of the water samples in both seasons cluster 2 shows that alkalinity has a strong influence on the ph of water samples within the study area in wet season iron is strongly associated with turbidity and apparent colour which suggests that iron is the major influencer of the appearance of water samples in both seasons the cluster analysis for the analysed water sample locations indicated two major clusters fig 3b and d in dry season cluster 1 showed close clustering relationship among locations b 01 b 10 w 13 w 14 w 15 w 17 and w 18 these locations are associated by their increased ionic content cluster 2 showed close clustering relationship among locations w 01 w 12 and r 01 r 02 water sampling locations w 01 w 12 exists in regions with sandy topsoil which could be the reason why they share similar water characteristics their association confirms that surface water interacts with groundwater during dry season through wells within the sandy topsoil region samples w 01 w 12 and r 01 r 02 are also associated by their low ionic concentration quite evident in fig 2c for the wet season two major clusters were observed cluster 1 showed close relationship among locations b 01 b 03 b 05 b 10 w 01 w 03 w 05 w 06 and w 10 w 18 whiile cluster 2 showed close clustering relationship among locations w 02 w 04 w 07 w 08 w 09 r 01 and r 02 these clusterings are an indication that the sample locations are controlled by similar environmental factors 4 5 heavy metal concentrations of soil samples the concentration of heavy metals in the soil samples and their corresponding index of geo accumulation i geo are tabulated in appendices 2 and 3 respectively soil samples collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m were appended with an asterisk sign to distinguish them from those collected at a depth of 0 0 5 m the concentration of fe in the soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 m ranged from 282 86 to 43 313 60 ppm fig 4a with a corresponding i geo range of 7 54 to 0 28 fig 5a in dry season in wet season it ranged from 29 45 to 42206 05 ppm with a corresponding i geo value of 10 800 to 0 315 across both seasons the i geo values imply that the concentration of fe in the soil samples can be classified as practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources thus iron contamination of the water samples is from terrestrial sources a comparison of the elemental concentration of fe in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 with those collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m fig 4a revealed that except at location sw 09 in wet season the concentration of fe significantly reduced with increased depth 0 5 1 0 m at all locations where they were sampled at varying depths the high fe concentration of the soil samples suggest that the sedimentary rocks are ferrugenized though the values detected in the soil samples are below to slightly higher than the average background value in the upper earth crust they are substantial to upset the quality of water especially in coastal environments this is consistent with the findings of amadi et al 1989 and nwankwoala 2011 which noted that the minerals hematite goethite and limonite of the benin formation and plant debris in the overlying alluvial soils are rich in fe given that the depth to water table within the study area is low 1 3 m an almost open aeration system becomes activated which is responsible for the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 since this process is constant there is a build up of iron at the top soil over time which may be responsible for higher iron concentration at a depth of 0 0 5 m compared to 0 5 1 0 m also leaching of these minerals from the ferruginous sandy formation coupled with the rapid permeability of the soil formation especially the beach sand topsoil will enhance the release and distribution of fe to the aquifer system the concentration of mn in the analysed soil samples ranged from 8 45 to 520 50 ppm fig 4b in dry season with a corresponding i geo range of 6 73 to 0 79 fig 5a while in wet season it ranged from 2 3 to 846 40 ppm fig 4b with a corresponding i geo range of 8 61 to 0 09 fig 5a the i geo value of the soil samples showed that all samples are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources in both seasons thus mn contamination in the water samples is from natural sources a comparison of the concentration of mn in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 m with those collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m revealed a significant drop in concentration at locations sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 in both seasons soil samples sw 13 sw 14 and sw 17 at water side north of the study area had the highest concentration of mn the concentration of ni in the soil samples ranged from 0 75 to 29 8 ppm fig 4c corresponding to an i geo value of 5 32 to 0 01 fig 5b in dry season in wet season in samples where nickel was detected it ranged from 0 25 to 24 75 ppm fig 4c with a corresponding i geo value of 6 91 to 0 28 fig 5b these values imply that the soil samples are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources the main sources of ni contamination in soils are electroplating metal plating industries and combustion of fossil fuels which is on a low within the study area nickel commonly exists in organically bound form in soils with an increased mobility and bioavailability in acidic and neutral conditions loska et al 2004 like fe and mn the concentration of ni reduced with increased depth at all locations where they were sampled at varying depths cd was only detected in the soil samples during the dry season at a depth of 0 0 5 m cd was not detected in samples sb 01 sb 09 sb 10 sr 02 sw 01 sw 12 sw 14 and sw 18 while in other samples it ranged from 0 01 to 0 545 ppm fig 4c with a corresponding i geo range of 3 32 1 86 fig 5b a comparison of the concentration of cd in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 with those at a depth 0 5 1 0 m showed that cd reduced with increased depth at locations sw 02 and sw 13 while it increased with increased depth at locations sw 09 sw 14 and sw 18 at a depth of 0 0 5 m the i geo value of samples sb 02 sb 08 sr 01 sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 suggests that they are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources while samples sb 03 sb 05 sw 04 sw 05 sw 06 sw 07 sw 08 sw 10 and sw 11 in the southern and eastern portion of the study area are in the uncontaminated to moderately contaminated domain cd is very toxic and it is used as pigments in plastics electronics and batteries among others its presence in the soil within the study area may be associated with indiscriminate disposal of cd containing waste and enhanced by leaching through the beach sand topsoil in dry season the concentration of co in the soil samples ranged from 0 05 to 9 6 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo range of 8 23 to 0 64 fig 5c during wet season co ranged from 0 65 to 14 15 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 4 53 to 0 08 fig 5c in dry season at a depth of 0 0 5 and 0 5 1 0 m the concentration of co reduced with increasing depth in samples sw 09 sw 14 and sw 18 while it increased with increasing depth in samples sw 02 and sw 13 nevertheless the values in both cases were in the practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources domain in wet season the concentration of co reduced with increased depth at all locations where they were sampled at varying depths in dry season the concentration of cu in the soil samples ranged from 0 22 to 48 69 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo range of 7 45 0 38 fig 5d signifying a practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources to practically contaminated from anthropogenic sources in wet season in samples were it was detected its value ranged from 0 10 to 32 95 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 8 55 to 0 19 fig 5d which implies that they are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources during dry season only sample sw 14 with a concentration of 48 69 ppm and a corresponding i geo value of 0 38 at a depth of 0 0 5 m fell within the uncontaminated to moderately contaminated domain this value dropped to 4 58 ppm and a corresponding i geo value of 3 03 at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m likewise the concentration of cu at a depth of 0 0 5 m in samples sw 02 sw 13 and sw 18 reduced when measured at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m except for sample sw 09 which showed a slight increment from 0 61 to 1 1 ppm in wet season sample sw 14 also had the highest concentration of 32 95 ppm nevertheless it reduced in value to 7 30 ppm when measured at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m also the concentration of cu at locations w 02 and w 13 reduced with increased depth cu is commonly used in cooking utensils electrical wiring piping various alloys and roofing sheet aboud and nandini 2009 which could be easily introduced into the topsoil by indiscriminate disposal during dry season at a depth of 0 0 5 m zn was not detected in soil samples sb 02 sb 05 sw 01 sw 03 sw 04 sw 05 sw 07 and sw 12 while in other samples the concentration ranged from 0 525 to 350 87 ppm fig 4b with a corresponding i geo range of 7 66 1 72 fig 5c in wet season its concentration ranged from 0 11 to 170 83 ppm fig 4b with a corresponding i geo value of 9 99 0 68 fig 5c at a depth of 0 0 5 m locations r 02 w 08 w 14 and w 17 in dry season and w 13 w 14 and w 17 in wet season seem to be more contaminated a comparison of the concentration of zn in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 with those at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m in samples sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 showed that it reduced drastically with increased depth 0 5 1 0 m except at locations sw 02 and sw 09 in wet season during dry season the concentration of pb in the soil samples ranged from 1 95 to 39 21 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 3 94 0 39 fig 5d signifying a practically uncontaminated to moderately contaminated from anthropogenic sources at a depth of 0 0 5 m location w 17 with an i geo value of 0 39 seem to be more contaminated within the study area samples sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 showed a decrease in concentration at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m compared to their values at a depth of 0 0 5 m except for sample sw 02 which increased in concentration with increased depth 0 5 1 0 m while in wet season it ranged from 0 45 to 25 10 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 6 06 to 0 26 fig 5d signifying they are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources at location sw 02 pb increased with increased depth while at locations sw 13 and sw 14 the concentration in the soil samples reduced with increased sampling depth pb contamination in soil is very toxic for humans and animals alike it leads to anaemia by acceleration of red blood cells destruction and impairment of haemo biosynthesis gupta et al 2014 it also reduces sperm count and damages

026 0 748 in wet season which is an indication of non to moderate pollution within the study area the pli results further revealed that the western and southern to eastern axis of the study area had the lowest pli values of 0 096 and 0 026 in dry and wet seasons respectively while the northern axis had the highest values of 0 657 and 0 748 in dry and wet seasons respectively the low pli values recorded at the western central to southern southern to eastern and north eastern axis during wet season may be associated with the fact that nickel copper and cadmium were not detected compared to dry season the cf results for fe within the study area ranged from 0 029 to 0 360 and 0 005 0 500 in dry and wet seasons respectively which indicates that the likelihood of iron contamination from anthropogenic sources is very low the western and southern to eastern axis recorded the lowest cf fe values in dry and wet seasons respectively while the northern axis had the highest cf fe values in both seasons the cf mn results ranged from 0 063 to 0 540 in dry season and 0 006 0 730 in wet season which is an indication that the likelihood of mn contamination in the soil samples from anthropogenic sources is very low mn recorded it lowest cf values in the north eastern and southern to eastern axis in dry and wet seasons respectively while its highest values across both seasons were recorded in the northern axis of the study area ni had a cf value ranging from 0 086 to 0 755 in dry season and 0 029 0 552 in wet season depicting the likelihood of low ni contamination from anthropogenic sources the lowest cf ni values were recorded in the central to southern and western axis in dry and wet seasons respectively while the highest values were recorded in the northern axis across both seasons the cf cd values within the study area ranged from 0 210 to 2 688 in dry season while no values were calculated in wet season since it was not detected in the soil samples the cf cd values were within the moderate contamination range which suggests that soil samples within the study area may have been enriched by cd inducing anthropogenic contaminants the i geo results further revealed that soil samples sb 03 sw 07 and sw 08 at the southern to eastern axis sw 04 sw 05 and sw 06 at the central to southern axis and sb 05 sw 10 and sw 11 at the north eastern axis have been enriched in cd by anthropogenic contaminants the cf cd results were lowest at the western axis and highest at the southern to eastern axis co had a cf co value ranging from 0 080 to 0 520 in dry season and 0 234 0 862 in wet season which is an indication that the soil samples are not likely to be contaminated by cobalt from anthropogenic sources across both seasons the western axis of the study area had the lowest cf co value while the northern axis had the highest cf co value the cf cu values ranged from 0 050 to 1 027 in dry season which suggests low to moderate contamination from anthropogenic sources while in wet season it ranged from 0 043 to 0 670 signifying low contamination from anthropogenic sources in dry season the i geo value of sample sw 14 for cu 0 38 at the northern axis of the study area suggests that it may have been enriched in copper from anthropogenic sources across both seasons the cf cu results were lowest at the central to southern axis and highest at the northern axis zn had a cf value ranging from 0 023 to 1 907 in dry season and 0 05 1 50 in wet season which is an indication of low to moderate contamination within the study area the cf zn and i geo values for zn revealed that location sw 08 at the southern to eastern axis and locations sw 13 sw 14 and sw 17 at the northern axis is moderately contaminated from anthropogenic sources the cf zn results were lowest at the western and southern to eastern axis in dry and wet seasons respectively while they were highest at the northern axis of the study area across both seasons pb had a cf value ranging from 0 148 to 0 886 in dry season and 0 023 0 753 in wet season which is an indication of low contamination within the study area across both seasons the cf pb results were lowest at the north eastern axis while they were highest at the northern axis generally the lowest cf values for co cu and pb occurred within the same axis in both seasons while those of fe mn zn and ni changed with season also the highest cf values for fe mn zn co cu ni and pb occurred within the northern axis in both seasons this assertion is in agreement with the pli values at the northern axis of the study area the cf results further revealed that contamination from cd and cu dry season and zn both seasons were anthropogenic in nature though in the seasons where they were detected their impact on the water samples were not above the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 permissible limits in drinking water the results from the indices of soil contamination indicate that the northern region of the study area is the most impacted by anthropogenic contamination this is connected to the fact that northern axis of the study area serves as the entrance into the community with the highest population of the inhabitants within the study area it is characterised by a lot of human activities which may have introduced contaminants into the topsoil 5 conclusion a reconnaissance survey of the study area revealed a shallow depth to water table ranging from 0 37 to 1 20 m on site auditing of water samples revealed that the quality of water in terms of its colour and odour have been greatly impaired while some of the boreholes had a sharp salty taste quantitative analysis of the water samples revealed that turbidity apparent colour ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids fe and mn in several water samples were above the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 permissible limits in drinking water across both seasons the results of chloride ec and tds revealed that brackish water is not within the shallow aquifer levels while at greater depths such as those from boreholes the presence of brackish water is evident especially at tolukiribo south east of the study area the result of bacterial analysis showed that only few samples were fit for human consumption the results of soil analysis revealed the presence of contaminants such as cd cu and zn from anthropogenic sources the spatial variation of heavy metals in the soil samples across seasons revealed that the western axis of the study area is the least contaminated while the northern axis is the most contaminated from anthropogenic sources this study concluded that the quality of surface water groundwater and sub soil within arogbo community have been contaminated the results of soil analysis revealed that contamination arising from anthropogenic sources had no significant impact on the contamination level of water within the study area rather terrestrial sources of iron and manganese were the major contaminants responsible for the high level of colouration of surface water and groundwater within the study area funding this study was supported by the tertiary education trust fund tetfund research

8101,study region arogbo community ondo state nigeria study focus in this study groundwater and subsoil contamination within the coastal aquifers of arogbo was investigated in order to determine the nature and sources of contamination and its variation with season in dry and wet seasons water samples were analysed for their physico chemical and bacteriological properties while soil samples were collected at depths of 0 0 5 and 0 5 1 0 m to determine the elemental concentration of heavy metals and their variation with depth new hydrological insights for the region the data obtained showed that the aquifer is shallow with a depth to water table ranging from 0 37 to 1 20 m the hydro chemical results revealed that the quality of water have been greatly impaired by the presence of contaminants such as fe mn and brackish water while the bacterial analysis showed that only few water samples were fit for human consumption the results of soil analysis revealed the presence of anthropogenic contaminants such as cd cu and zn this study concluded that the soil contaminants had no significant impact on the contamination level of water within the study area rather terrestrial sources of iron and manganese were the major contaminants responsible for the high level of colouration of surface water and groundwater within the study area these contaminants could pose serious health hazards to residents of the community keywords groundwater contamination soil contamination heavy metals saline water coastal aquifer physico chemical properties 1 introduction water is vital to the continual existence of all known life form on earth it is a unique resource that cannot be substituted ayoade 1975 it exists inland as surface water e g lakes lagoons ponds streams and rivers or groundwater e g hand dug wells boreholes and springs groundwater storage and aquifer productivity is usually high within sedimentary basins oteze 1981 albertsson 2014 however the availability of groundwater is not a universal solution to the deterioration of water quality macdonald et al 2012 according to todd 1980 the quality of groundwater is as important as its immense quantity drinking water should not only be safe but also acceptable in terms of its appearance odour and taste though drinking water standards may differ with country and region groundwater considered as safe for drinking should not pose a health risk to its consumers over a lifetime of consumption who 2017 currently nigeria is faced with several environmental challenges particularly with respect to groundwater albertsson 2014 in the coastal regions of nigeria it is usually less difficult to site hand dug wells and boreholes for groundwater abstraction however there is the challenge of water contamination arising from anthropogenic activities or natural geologic processes when these contaminants enter the subsurface they persist sometimes for longer periods within the soil and aquifer system causing serious health problems when ingested by humans beyond the prescribed permissible limit who 2017 abstraction of contaminated groundwater for drinking purposes have been linked with cancer arsenic asbestos liver and kidney diseases lead mercury cadmium pregnancy risks and neurological damage and lower iq lead arsenic and skeletal and bone diseases lead fluoride cadmium while others could pose a serious threat to vegetation fish habitat and wildlife gbadebo 2005 ezekwe et al 2012 who 2017 seawater intrusion into fresh water aquifers is also a major reason for water quality degradation in coastal aquifers akujieze et al 2003 ayolabi et al 2013 rahaman and bhattacharya 2014 this could be due to sea level rise invasion of low lying shore by seawater overflow which leads to the percolation of sea water into the shallow aquifer or over exploitation of fresh groundwater for local use oteri 1988 werner and simmons 2009 sathish et al 2011 generally these contaminants increase the rate of mortality and morbidity for plants animals and humans in the coastal regions of ondo state nigeria there is widespread aquifer productivity faleye and olorunfemi 2015 to an extent that water is easily accessed from shallow wells this could be attributed to the geology geomorphology and effective rainfall within the region however groundwater contamination and soil degradation within the region remains a source of great concern oloruntegbe et al 2009 olotu et al 2009 using simple time analysis and composite index approaches to compute the water poverty index wpi values for ondo state showed that ese odo local government lg is the most water stressed region in ondo state a reconnaissance survey of ese odo lg revealed that arogbo community is one of the most impacted community within the lg with evidence of high level of colouration from surface and groundwater which is an indication of some form of contamination within the community currently very few studies have been carried out within arogbo community on groundwater contamination while none has been carried out on soil contamination this could be due to difficulty in accessing the riverine community and security challenges emanating from militancy in the region adeyemo et al 2015 in their study of groundwater quality in the eastern section of dahomey basin reported from analyses of only one water sample from arogbo community that the concentration of iron 32 mg l was above the who acceptable limit however this sampling is inadequate to make conclusions on groundwater and sub soil contamination within the community hence this study was carried out to determine the nature possible sources and variation of groundwater and sub soil contamination with season within arogbo community 2 description of the study area 2 1 location and accessibility the study area arogbo community fig 1 is located within ese odo lg area of ondo state at the eastern edge of the dahomey basin about two third of ese odo lg is made up of creeks lagoons and rivers arogbo community lies within latitudes 06o15 05 and 06o16 02 n and longitudes 04o59 15 and 05o00 42 e on land covering a total area of 2 5 km2 the community is surrounded by rivers and swamps arogbo community is strategic because it is the headquarters of the ijaw speaking tribes in the riverine communities it can only be accessed by water transportation through agadagba obon community which is connected to upland by road and is a few hundreds of metres away from arogbo community on water entrance into arogbo community by water transportation is majorly through water side where jetties have been constructed to receive people 2 2 climate and vegetation the study area falls within the equatorial evergreen swampy forest region of nigeria where it rains from march to october and is relatively dry from november to february its mean annual total rainfall exceeds 2000 mm year ondo state diagnostic survey report 2009 arogbo community is drained by rivers arogbo and pankumo and the neighbouring swamps river arogbo being the major river flows southward from the benin axis and takes a detour towards the west connecting other rivers which flow in the direction of the atlantic ocean the mean monthly temperature is 27 with a mean monthly deviation of 2 while mean relative humidity is over 75 ondo state diagnostic survey report 2009 there is little or no agricultural activity in arogbo residents of the community majorly engage in fishing timber felling and palm wine tapping in neighbouring swamps rivers and forest regions 2 3 hydro geological setting of the study area the study area falls within the eastern section of the dahomey basin in southwestern nigeria the stratigraphic sequence of the dahomey basin has been well documented by several authors omatsola and adegoke 1981 agagu 1985 billman 1992 they include the cretaceous abeokuta group made up of ise afowo and araromi formations jones and hockey 1964 omatsola and adegoke 1981 the paleocene ewekoro formation the late paleocene to early eocene akinbo shale the eocene oshosun and ilaro formations the pleistocene to recent benin formation coastal plain sands and the coastal alluvium formation omatsola and adegoke 1981 nevertheless the benin and the recent coastal alluvium formations represent the most important formations for groundwater development nwankwoala and walter 2012 albertsson 2014 within the basin the benin formation also known as the coastal plain sands jones and hockey 1964 has the most extensive sedimentary outcrop within the dahomey basin with a total surface area of about 5000 km2 it predominantly consists of unconsolidated medium to coarse grained sands 80 with minor clays 15 and lignites 5 occurring occasionally nwankwor et al 1979 a thickness of about 400 m has been reported towards the coast agagu 1985 the coastal alluvium sediment deposited along the shore oyeyemi et al 2015 consists mostly of interlayered sand silt clay and plant debris the sand being well sorted varies from fine to coarse grained the thickness of the alluvium sediments has been reported to be at least 153 m nwankwor et al 1979 agagu 1985 within these formations groundwater is housed in thick and extensive sand aquifers which are highly permeable and productive to maintain numerous streams all year round nwankwor et al 1979 nwankwoala and walter 2012 aladejana et al 2020 reported that the static water level swl within the dahomey basin varies from 0 2 to 67 m in dry season and 0 3 123 m in wet season within the basin aquifer exists locally in confined and semi confined conditions with water flowing from the north east section of the basin towards the southwest and southern directions nwankwor et al 1979 within the study area fig 1 the topsoil is made up of white beach sand at agwobiri ayubabiri egbesubiri itebu tolukiribo and abedgnigo zion while at waterside and part of erubiri the topsoil is made up of clay and sandy clay sediments the long wet season characterised by high rainfall every year recharges the major streams and rivers within the study area 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analytical procedure thirty water samples b 01 b 10 r 01 r 02 and w 01 w18 table 1 were collected in dry season february 2020 and while twenty eight 28 of these water samples were collected in wet season august 2020 for analysis of their physico chemical parameters water pumps from boreholes b 02 and b 04 were faulty in wet season and were therefore not analysed na in wet season the water samples were collected into sterilized 2 l polyethylene bottles for anion and cation analyses and mccartney bottles for bacterial analysis before collection the bottles for anions and cations were rinsed twice with the water sample to be collected on site the taste odour and colour of each water samples were recorded while the electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and ph were measured with the aid of calibrated ele conductivity and ph metres for each sample the accuracy of the measured tds and ec values were determined by ensuring that the tds ec ratio was within 0 55 0 75 hem 1985 samples for the determination of cations were preserved with 3 ml of 70 nitric acid hno3 on collection while those of anions were refrigerated between 1 and 4 to minimize precipitation of solutes and escape of dissolved gases thereafter the samples were transported to the laboratory analysed for several parameters following applicable standard methods golterman et al 1978 ademoroti 1996 apha 2005 within the recommended time frame the apparent colour and turbidity of the water samples were determined using a colorimeter with measurements taken at 430 and 540 nm wavelength of the colorimeter respectively total alkalinity and chloride were determined by titrimetric method nitrate was determined quantitatively by the brucine method prior to cation analyses water samples were filtered using the whatman grade 1 filter paper thereafter the chemical concentration of cations of fe mn cu and zn were determined with the use of the atomic absorption spectrophotometer mertz 1987 the chemical concentrations of each element was compared with the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended standards to determine the quality of water and major groundwater contaminants within the study area a loopful of the water samples for microbial analysis were streaked on already prepared sterile nutrient agar plates deepesh et al 2013 also a 10 fold serial dilution was performed and 0 1 ml from the 10 2 dilution was plated using spread plate method on already prepared sterile nutrient agar plates the plates were incubated at 37 for 24 hrs and thereafter examined for growth who 1984 deepesh et al 2013 thereafter samples that yielded low bacterial colony counts on agar plates were chosen as representative samples to conduct a most probable number mpn analysis with the sole aim to detect coliform bacteria per ml of the samples at a depth of 0 0 5 m twenty five 25 soil samples sb 01 sb 03 sb 05 sb 08 sb 10 sr 01 sr 02 sw 01 sw 14 sw 17 sw 18 were collected with hand auger at their corresponding water sampling locations at five 5 of these locations with dense population soil samples sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 sw 18 were collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m in order to determine the variation of soil heavy metal concentration with increased depth and its possible implication for groundwater quality in wet season few soil samples sb 02 sr 01 sb 18 could not be accessed and were not analysed in all thirty soil samples were collected in dry season while twenty seven 27 soil samples were collected in wet season in cases were soil samples collected were below the vadoze zone the samples were tilted to allow substantial amount of water to drain off after collection thereafter all soil samples were broken down into smaller aggregates spread evenly on polyethlene nylons and air dried at ambient temperatures in order to reduce the soil moisture content the soil samples were sieved through a 2 m mesh and one 1 gram of each soil sample was selected for extraction the extraction process was achieved by adding 10 ml of aqua regia solution hydrochloric acid and nitric acid in the ratio 3 1 to the soil samples in a beaker and heated at a controlled temperature for few hours based on the iso standard 11466 the extracts were filtered into a bottle and brought up to 50 ml with distilled water after extraction the metal concentrations in each soil sample were measured with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas mertz 1987 and interpreted using various indices of soil contamination 3 2 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analyses such as the pearson correlation matrix analysis and cluster analysis were independently used to correlate and classify the groundwater samples based on their variables physico chemical parameters the pearson correlation matrix pcm measures the degree of linear relationship between any two variables the correlation coefficient varies from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates a strongly negative correlation 0 no linear correlation and 1 a strongly positive correlation liu et al 2003 cluster analysis ca reveals natural clusters within a given set of data it classifies variables based on the similarities of their chemical properties rahman et al 2014 and heterogeneity between their classes ca was performed based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering usually illustrated by a dendrogram mckenna 2003 using a combination of the ward s linkage method and squared euclidean distances to measure the similarity between samples and or variables 3 3 indices of soil contamination 3 3 1 index of geo accumulation the index of geo accumulation was originally designed to assess the level of heavy metal contamination in aquatic sediments mueller 1969 over time it has also been utilized to measure the level of soil contamination arising from toxic elements gemici and tarcam 2007 çolak 2012 it is computed by the equation 1 i geo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where c n is the measured elemental concentration in the pellitic fraction of the sediment 2 μ m and b n is the average geochemical background value average shale value taylor and mclennan 1995 for the element the constant 1 5 is introduced to accommodate possible variations of the background value arising from lithologic variations based on the i geo scheme mueller 1969 and colak 2012 classified soils into 7 categories table 2 3 3 2 contamination factor cf and pollution load index pli contamination factor cf is used to determine the level of sediment contamination by heavy metals the mean concentration c n of a given element from several sampling sites is divided by the average geochemical background value b n recorded in the upper earth s crust it is expressed by the equation edokpayi et al 2017 2 cf n c n mean b n cf n represents the contamination factor cf for each heavy metal the study area was divided into five axis the western axis was made up of samples sb 01 sb 10 sw 01 sw 02 and sw 03 the central southern axis made up of samples sb 08 sb 09 sw 04 sw 05 and sw 06 the south eastern axis made up of sb 02 sb 03 sw 07 sw 08 and sw 09 the north eastern axis made up of sb 05 sw 10 sw 11 sw 12 and sr 01 and the northern axis made up of sw 13 sw s14 sw 17 and sw 18 for uniformity only samples taken at a depth of 0 0 5 m were used to calculate the cf the pollution load index pli was originally proposed by tomlinson et al 1980 to assess the risk of all heavy metals in sediments it is expressed by the equation 3 pli cf 1 cf 2 cf 3 cf 4 cf n n the classification of results for cf and pli are given in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 on site auditing of groundwater quality the quality of groundwater is a function of its physical chemical and biological characteristics nwankwoala 2011 on site assessment of the quality of water samples in terms of their odour taste and colour is given in table 1 the depth of the boreholes could not be ascertained from residents of the community but an approximate depth of 20 m is assumed the hand dug wells were shallow with a maximum depth of 3 m and a depth to water table ranging from 0 37 to 1 20 m in the dry season most of the hand dug ringed wells within the study area had no covering over them except for w 05 w 08 w 12 and w 13 on site inspection of the water samples revealed that most samples from boreholes wells and river had an objectionable swampy odour which is a possible indication of surface water swamps rivers tributaries interaction with groundwater most of the water samples were tasteless while some were salty b 02 b 03 b 04 b 06 b 08 and sharp b 04 b 06 b 09 to the taste bud about 80 of the water appeared coloured while the rest were either colourless or slightly coloured the colouration of water samples from boreholes wells and river arogbo could be a possible indication that the quality of water within the study area have been impaired by contaminants such as humic acid fulvic acid and other colour imparting organic and inorganic substances in the soil 4 2 physico chemical parameters of water samples the physico chemical parameters of the analysed water samples and their respective concentration are documented in appendix 1 the ph of natural waters is often in the slightly acidic state owing to the presence of dissolved co2 and organic acids from decay and leaching of plant materials langmuir 1997 within the study area the ph of the water samples ranged from 2 7 to 6 8 in dry season while in wet season it increased in range from 4 to 8 5 fig 2a the variation of ph was greater in dry season 20 54 compared to wet season 16 66 the results revealed that only about 80 dry season and 20 wet season of the water samples were outside the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended range of 6 5 8 5 in drinking water most of the water samples were acidic in dry season while in wet season they were alkaline in nature across both seasons the ph of water from borehole samples 2 9 8 5 were more acidic compared to those from well 5 6 8 4 and river 5 8 7 8 samples fig 2a this suggests that well and river samples may share similar characteristics the pearson correlation matrix pcm table 3 revealed that ph had a strong positive correlation with alkalinity r 0 485 d 0 501 w p 0 01 while it had a strong negative correlation with ec r 0 435 d 0 395 w p 0 05 tds r 0 435 d 0 395 w p 0 05 cl r 0 587 d 0 415 w p 0 01 fe r 0 511 d p 0 01 mn r 0 739 d 0 512 w p 0 01 cu r 0 484 d 0 592 w p 0 01 and zn r 0 516 d 0 665w p 0 01 this shows that ph is greatly influenced by alkalinity and heavy metals such as fe mn zn and cu in the aquifer system this implies that water samples in the acidic domain especially those across both seasons could be associated with elevated levels of heavy metals such as fe mn zn and cu thus since water samples from boreholes are from greater depth compared to those from shallow wells there is the likelihood of increased metal concentration at greater depth within the aquifer their low ph values could cause gastrointestinal disorders such as hyper acidity ulcers and stomach pain the cloudiness of the water samples referred to as turbidity ranged from 4 92 to 179 71 ntu in dry season while in wet season it ranged from 1 35 to 137 25 ntu fig 2b the turbidity values were highly variable as indicated by the cv values about 96 dry season and 93 wet season of the water samples were above the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended standard of 5 ntu in drinking water for turbidity this is an indication that almost all samples within the study area were highly turbid suggesting similar conditions among all sample types high turbidity values are usually associated with poor water quality which may arise from chemical precipitates such as fe or mn organic particles and organisms or suspended particles such as clay or silts who 2017 highly turbid waters usually give off a milky white muddy red brown or black suspension who 2017 which reduces its acceptability for drinking purposes these assertions are supported by the pcm table 3 which showed that turbidity is strongly correlated with apparent colour r 0 812 d 0 944 w p 0 01 fe r 0 585 d 0 850 w p 0 01 and mn r 0 505 d p 0 01 the apparent colour ac of the water samples ranged from 3 17 to 257 33 hu in dry season and 0 225 24 hu in wet season fig 2b samples b 06 and b 08 had the lowest apparent colour of 3 17 hu each in the dry season while samples b 01 b 06 b 08 and w 18 had the lowest value of 0 hu in the wet season in both seasons sample w 09 had the highest value of 257 33 and 225 24 hu across seasons the apparent colour of samples b 01 b 06 b 08 w 17 and w 18 were within the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 recommended standard 15 hu in drinking water ac showed a strong positive correlation with turbidity r 0 812 d 0 944 w p 0 01 and fe r 0 538 d 0 872 w p 0 01 table 3 this implies that the coloured water samples may have been greatly influenced by the presence of fe and or coloured organic matter in the aquifer system the electrical conductivity ec of water is a measure of its salt ionic content in terms of its ability to conduct electric current marandi et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 the electrical conductivity of the river and well samples ranged from 13 to 638 µs cm in dry season while in wet season it ranged from 33 to 715 µs cm for boreholes the ec value ranged from 511 to 1988 µs cm in dry season while in wet season it ranged from 134 to 1859 µs cm fig 2c generally most borehole samples exhibited higher ec values than well and river samples which is an indication of increased ionic content in the aquifer with increased depth low ec values are safer for drinking and domestic purposes laluraj and gopinath 2006 at the south eastern region of the study area samples b03 b04 and b06 had ec values exceeding the nsdwq 2007 standard of 1000 µs cm in drinking water while only sample b 03 was above the who 2017 recommended standard of 1500 µs cm the ec value of borehole samples suggest the possibility of brackish water at greater depth in the south eastern region the pcm table 3 showed that across both seasons tds r 1 00 d 1 00 w p 0 01 and cl r 0 927 d 0 867 w p 0 01 are the major influencers of ec values recorded in the water samples the strong correlation between ec tds and cl is an indication that their ions could be from the same source the total dissolved solids of the analysed water samples ranged from 7 to 1034 mg l in dry season and 17 967 mg l in wet season tds values have been employed by several authors to determine the possibility of saline water intrusion in coastal communities the palatability of drinking water below 600 mg l is generally considered good who 2017 above 1000 mg l its palatability becomes more questionable across both seasons most of the tds values fell within the nsdwq and who recommended value for tds in drinking water except for sample b03 though with a value of 967 mg l in wet season the tds value of sample b 03 suggests the possible presence of brackish water within the aquifer at the south eastern region of the study area across both seasons the tds of borehole samples 70 1034 mg l were greater than those from well and river samples 7 372 mg l which is an indication of increased ionic content with increased depth the alkalinity of the water samples ranged from 0 to 224 mg l in dry season and 0 414 mg l in wet season fig 2b the results revealed that well and river samples had better alkalinity values compared to borehole samples across both seasons water samples w 13 w 14 w 17 w 18 at the northern region of the study area maintained high alkalinity values while borehole samples b 04 b 06 b07 b09 maintained low alkalinity values of 0 mg l alkalinity showed a strong positive correlation with ph r 0 485 d 0 501 w p 0 01 table 3 since the buffering capacity associated with alkalinity of water serves as a ph and metal content regulator samples with very low alkalinity values e g b 04 b 06 b07 b09 may be very susceptible to a change in ph value and elevated levels of metal ions the results obtained for nitrate in the water samples ranged from 0 to 9 49 mg l in dry season and 0 09 21 14 mg l in wet season fig 2a the concentration of nitrate in the analysed water samples fell within the maximum permissible value in drinking water nsdwq 2007 who 2017 and will therefore pose no threat to human or aquatic life this suggests that similar condition exists for nitrate across all water sample types within the study area the low nitrate values may be due to the fact that there is little or no agricultural activities within the immediate environment of the study area chloride is palatable in drinking water at low concentrations but in excess makes water unpleasant for drinking and increases the electrical conductivity of water in dry season the concentration of chloride in the water samples ranged from 6 94 to 545 19 mg l while in wet season it ranged from 3 00 to 471 39 mg l fig 2c possessing higher values in borehole samples across both seasons there is no health based guideline for chloride in drinking water however a maximum permissible limit of 250 mg l has been set by nsdwq 20017 and who 2017 above this value a salty taste and an unpleasant odour is developed and the risk of pipe corrosion increases who 2006 in this study all well and river samples had their chloride concentration below the maximum permissible limit while most boreholes had their chloride concentration above the threshold value boreholes in this category suggests the possible presence of brackish water at greater depths within the coastal aquifers of arogbo chloride showed strong positive correlation with ec tds 0 927d 0 867w p 0 01 mn 0 524d 0 502w p

3 bacterial analysis of water samples in dry season three samples b 03 b 06 and b 10 showed no growth both on the streaked and spread plates even after extending the incubation period to 48 h while other samples showed growth on both plates after 24 h of incubation table 4a the lack of growth could mean that samples b 03 b 06 and b 10 contain no bacterial cells or that they contain very few bacterial cells such that the amount cultured on the agar plates missed them out or that they contain bacterial cells that cannot grow on the general media used in wet season samples b09 and b10 showed no growth both on the streaked and spread plates even after extending the incubation period to 48 h the remaining samples however showed growth on both plates after 24 h of incubation the most probable number mpn results for both seasons table 4b showed that most representative samples tested were unfit for human consumption because more than 10 cfu ml of coliform bacteria were detected in 100 ml of the water samples analyzed samples b 09 b 10 and w 15 showed no colour change and were fit for drinking because they contained at least 3 or fewer coliform cells in 100 ml of the sample by mpn standard they were the best among all the representative samples tested the detection of coliform in the samples suggests a high probability of faecal contamination gaining access to the sample or there was a recent faecal contamination of the sample s in question iron fe is a metal that is widely distributed in geologic materials such as soils rocks and minerals where in it interacts with the groundwater system the pcm table 3 showed that fe strongly influenced the turbidity apparent colour and ph it also suggests that fe is closely associated with mn r 0 582 d 0 500 w p 0 01 iron was not detected nd in few of the water samples within the study area while in those where it was detected it ranged from 0 074 to 57 490 mg l in dry season and 0 080 22 539 mg l in wet season fig 2a the concentration of iron in the water samples was highly variable in both seasons the high concentration of fe in the aquifer may have resulted from the interaction of oxidized fe minerals and organic matter and the subsequent dissolution of fe2co3 at low ph values of the water samples mondal et al 2010 waters of this nature may appear clear when abstracted but suddenly turns brown and becomes cloudy after a short while due to the precipitation of fe oh 3 white et al 1991 the concentration of fe in about 27 dry season and 36 wet season of the water samples were within the maximum permissible limit of 0 3 mg l recommended by nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 for drinking water this is an indication that the quality of water from boreholes wells and river arogbo has been highly impaired by the presence of fe within the aquifer system impacting the taste and colour of water samples intake of iron rich water in excess quantity could damage healthy skin cells reduce birth weight in term born infants increase the risk of hemochromatosis iron overload liver disease and heart failure in humans and give foods and drinks a metallic taste making it less appealing in water systems they serve as host for bacterial growth some of which are harmful to humans perez de nanclares et al 2000 ellervik et al 2001 grazuleviciene et al 2009 who 2017 manganese mn just like fe is an abundant element within the earth s crust occurring naturally in minerals soils and rocks who 2006 an acceptability threshold of 0 1 mg l was set by the who for mn in drinking water however in acidic or anaerobic water mostly groundwater mn has the tendency to exist at higher concentrations who 2017 above this value 0 1 mg l an undesirable taste is induced in beverages while sanitary wares and laundry are stained results obtained for mn in the analysed water samples ranged from 0 021 to 0 487 mg l in dry season and 0 021 0 683 mg l in wet season fig 2 with the borehole samples possessing higher values across both seasons this is an indication that with increased depth as with borehole samples compared to shallow wells and surface waters there is an increase in the concentration of manganese within the aquifer system a health based value of 0 20 mg l was set for mn in drinking water by nsdwq 2007 above this value the risk of neurological disorder and damages to the lungs liver and kidney increases iwami et al 1994 takeda 2003 nsdwq 2007 across both seasons hotspots such as locations b 06 b 07 b 08 b 09 b 10 w 09 and w 12 had values above the health based guideline set by the nsdwq 2007 and therefore may pose a health risk to its consumers the presence of mn and fe above the acceptable threshold value in these water samples could be responsible for the objectionable reddish brown colour they are both considered as contaminants mainly due to their organoleptic properties ellis et al 2000 copper cu is a transition metal primarily found in rocks within the earth s crust it is both an essential nutrient and when in excess a drinking water contaminant in dry season presence of cu was not detected in most water samples except in sample b 06 where it had a value of 0 068 mg l fig 2d in wet season the concentration of cu varied from 0 030 to 0 736 mg l fig 2d these values are within the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 acceptable limit of 1 mg l for cu in drinking water thus there is no groundwater contamination within the study area arising from cu cu showed strong positive correlation with zn r 0 647 d 0 961 w p 0 01 and a strong negative correlation with ph 0 484d 0 592w p 0 01 table 3 these metals occur in significant quantities in rocks and are fairly mobile in soil zinc zn is an essential trace element beneficial for human growth it occurs naturally in small amounts in many rocks and soils as sulphide ores sphalerite zns or carbonates calamine znco3 who 2006 in both seasons the presence of zn was not detected in some of the water samples fig 2d and when they were detected they ranged from 0 010 to 0 065 mg l in dry season and 0 015 0 414 mg l in wet season fig 2d these values are below the maximum permissible limit of 3 mg l set by nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 in drinking water thus will have no negative health implication on its consumers generally the results of water analysis revealed that the quality of surface water and groundwater within the study area have been greatly impaired the apparent colour and turbidity of all water sample types were compromised by contaminants the results of ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids alkalinity manganese copper and zinc of well and river samples were similar in range and more within the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 permissible limits compared to those from boreholes the results of borehole samples showed that they were more acidic with increased ionic and heavy metal concentration compared to well and river samples across all water sample types the results revealed a significant presence of iron and coliform bacteria significant capable of upsetting the quality of water 4 4 spatial similarity and sampling sites grouping the hierarchical cluster analysis of the analysed parameters and sampling sites in dry and wet seasons is presented in the dendrogram fig 3 in both seasons two major clusters were observed for the analysed parameters fig 3a and c in dry season cluster 1 showed relationship among electrical conductivity total dissolved solids chloride copper zinc turbidity apparent colour iron and manganese while cluster 2 showed relationship among ph alkalinity and nitrate in wet season cluster 1 showed relationship among electrical conductivity total dissolved solids chloride manganese copper and zinc while cluster 2 showed close relationship among turbidity apparent colour iron ph alkalinity and nitrate in both seasons cluster 1 are representative of water types rich in ionic content and their associated heavy metals in dry season the association of iron and manganese with turbidity and apparent colour suggests they have a strong influence on the appearance of the water samples in both seasons cluster 2 shows that alkalinity has a strong influence on the ph of water samples within the study area in wet season iron is strongly associated with turbidity and apparent colour which suggests that iron is the major influencer of the appearance of water samples in both seasons the cluster analysis for the analysed water sample locations indicated two major clusters fig 3b and d in dry season cluster 1 showed close clustering relationship among locations b 01 b 10 w 13 w 14 w 15 w 17 and w 18 these locations are associated by their increased ionic content cluster 2 showed close clustering relationship among locations w 01 w 12 and r 01 r 02 water sampling locations w 01 w 12 exists in regions with sandy topsoil which could be the reason why they share similar water characteristics their association confirms that surface water interacts with groundwater during dry season through wells within the sandy topsoil region samples w 01 w 12 and r 01 r 02 are also associated by their low ionic concentration quite evident in fig 2c for the wet season two major clusters were observed cluster 1 showed close relationship among locations b 01 b 03 b 05 b 10 w 01 w 03 w 05 w 06 and w 10 w 18 whiile cluster 2 showed close clustering relationship among locations w 02 w 04 w 07 w 08 w 09 r 01 and r 02 these clusterings are an indication that the sample locations are controlled by similar environmental factors 4 5 heavy metal concentrations of soil samples the concentration of heavy metals in the soil samples and their corresponding index of geo accumulation i geo are tabulated in appendices 2 and 3 respectively soil samples collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m were appended with an asterisk sign to distinguish them from those collected at a depth of 0 0 5 m the concentration of fe in the soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 m ranged from 282 86 to 43 313 60 ppm fig 4a with a corresponding i geo range of 7 54 to 0 28 fig 5a in dry season in wet season it ranged from 29 45 to 42206 05 ppm with a corresponding i geo value of 10 800 to 0 315 across both seasons the i geo values imply that the concentration of fe in the soil samples can be classified as practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources thus iron contamination of the water samples is from terrestrial sources a comparison of the elemental concentration of fe in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 with those collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m fig 4a revealed that except at location sw 09 in wet season the concentration of fe significantly reduced with increased depth 0 5 1 0 m at all locations where they were sampled at varying depths the high fe concentration of the soil samples suggest that the sedimentary rocks are ferrugenized though the values detected in the soil samples are below to slightly higher than the average background value in the upper earth crust they are substantial to upset the quality of water especially in coastal environments this is consistent with the findings of amadi et al 1989 and nwankwoala 2011 which noted that the minerals hematite goethite and limonite of the benin formation and plant debris in the overlying alluvial soils are rich in fe given that the depth to water table within the study area is low 1 3 m an almost open aeration system becomes activated which is responsible for the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 since this process is constant there is a build up of iron at the top soil over time which may be responsible for higher iron concentration at a depth of 0 0 5 m compared to 0 5 1 0 m also leaching of these minerals from the ferruginous sandy formation coupled with the rapid permeability of the soil formation especially the beach sand topsoil will enhance the release and distribution of fe to the aquifer system the concentration of mn in the analysed soil samples ranged from 8 45 to 520 50 ppm fig 4b in dry season with a corresponding i geo range of 6 73 to 0 79 fig 5a while in wet season it ranged from 2 3 to 846 40 ppm fig 4b with a corresponding i geo range of 8 61 to 0 09 fig 5a the i geo value of the soil samples showed that all samples are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources in both seasons thus mn contamination in the water samples is from natural sources a comparison of the concentration of mn in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 m with those collected at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m revealed a significant drop in concentration at locations sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 in both seasons soil samples sw 13 sw 14 and sw 17 at water side north of the study area had the highest concentration of mn the concentration of ni in the soil samples ranged from 0 75 to 29 8 ppm fig 4c corresponding to an i geo value of 5 32 to 0 01 fig 5b in dry season in wet season in samples where nickel was detected it ranged from 0 25 to 24 75 ppm fig 4c with a corresponding i geo value of 6 91 to 0 28 fig 5b these values imply that the soil samples are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources the main sources of ni contamination in soils are electroplating metal plating industries and combustion of fossil fuels which is on a low within the study area nickel commonly exists in organically bound form in soils with an increased mobility and bioavailability in acidic and neutral conditions loska et al 2004 like fe and mn the concentration of ni reduced with increased depth at all locations where they were sampled at varying depths cd was only detected in the soil samples during the dry season at a depth of 0 0 5 m cd was not detected in samples sb 01 sb 09 sb 10 sr 02 sw 01 sw 12 sw 14 and sw 18 while in other samples it ranged from 0 01 to 0 545 ppm fig 4c with a corresponding i geo range of 3 32 1 86 fig 5b a comparison of the concentration of cd in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 with those at a depth 0 5 1 0 m showed that cd reduced with increased depth at locations sw 02 and sw 13 while it increased with increased depth at locations sw 09 sw 14 and sw 18 at a depth of 0 0 5 m the i geo value of samples sb 02 sb 08 sr 01 sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 suggests that they are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources while samples sb 03 sb 05 sw 04 sw 05 sw 06 sw 07 sw 08 sw 10 and sw 11 in the southern and eastern portion of the study area are in the uncontaminated to moderately contaminated domain cd is very toxic and it is used as pigments in plastics electronics and batteries among others its presence in the soil within the study area may be associated with indiscriminate disposal of cd containing waste and enhanced by leaching through the beach sand topsoil in dry season the concentration of co in the soil samples ranged from 0 05 to 9 6 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo range of 8 23 to 0 64 fig 5c during wet season co ranged from 0 65 to 14 15 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 4 53 to 0 08 fig 5c in dry season at a depth of 0 0 5 and 0 5 1 0 m the concentration of co reduced with increasing depth in samples sw 09 sw 14 and sw 18 while it increased with increasing depth in samples sw 02 and sw 13 nevertheless the values in both cases were in the practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources domain in wet season the concentration of co reduced with increased depth at all locations where they were sampled at varying depths in dry season the concentration of cu in the soil samples ranged from 0 22 to 48 69 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo range of 7 45 0 38 fig 5d signifying a practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources to practically contaminated from anthropogenic sources in wet season in samples were it was detected its value ranged from 0 10 to 32 95 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 8 55 to 0 19 fig 5d which implies that they are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources during dry season only sample sw 14 with a concentration of 48 69 ppm and a corresponding i geo value of 0 38 at a depth of 0 0 5 m fell within the uncontaminated to moderately contaminated domain this value dropped to 4 58 ppm and a corresponding i geo value of 3 03 at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m likewise the concentration of cu at a depth of 0 0 5 m in samples sw 02 sw 13 and sw 18 reduced when measured at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m except for sample sw 09 which showed a slight increment from 0 61 to 1 1 ppm in wet season sample sw 14 also had the highest concentration of 32 95 ppm nevertheless it reduced in value to 7 30 ppm when measured at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m also the concentration of cu at locations w 02 and w 13 reduced with increased depth cu is commonly used in cooking utensils electrical wiring piping various alloys and roofing sheet aboud and nandini 2009 which could be easily introduced into the topsoil by indiscriminate disposal during dry season at a depth of 0 0 5 m zn was not detected in soil samples sb 02 sb 05 sw 01 sw 03 sw 04 sw 05 sw 07 and sw 12 while in other samples the concentration ranged from 0 525 to 350 87 ppm fig 4b with a corresponding i geo range of 7 66 1 72 fig 5c in wet season its concentration ranged from 0 11 to 170 83 ppm fig 4b with a corresponding i geo value of 9 99 0 68 fig 5c at a depth of 0 0 5 m locations r 02 w 08 w 14 and w 17 in dry season and w 13 w 14 and w 17 in wet season seem to be more contaminated a comparison of the concentration of zn in soil samples at a depth of 0 0 5 with those at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m in samples sw 02 sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 showed that it reduced drastically with increased depth 0 5 1 0 m except at locations sw 02 and sw 09 in wet season during dry season the concentration of pb in the soil samples ranged from 1 95 to 39 21 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 3 94 0 39 fig 5d signifying a practically uncontaminated to moderately contaminated from anthropogenic sources at a depth of 0 0 5 m location w 17 with an i geo value of 0 39 seem to be more contaminated within the study area samples sw 09 sw 13 sw 14 and sw 18 showed a decrease in concentration at a depth of 0 5 1 0 m compared to their values at a depth of 0 0 5 m except for sample sw 02 which increased in concentration with increased depth 0 5 1 0 m while in wet season it ranged from 0 45 to 25 10 ppm fig 4d with a corresponding i geo value of 6 06 to 0 26 fig 5d signifying they are practically uncontaminated from anthropogenic sources at location sw 02 pb increased with increased depth while at locations sw 13 and sw 14 the concentration in the soil samples reduced with increased sampling depth pb contamination in soil is very toxic for humans and animals alike it leads to anaemia by acceleration of red blood cells destruction and impairment of haemo biosynthesis gupta et al 2014 it also reduces sperm count and damages the liver blood vessels kidney and nervous system anglin brown et al 1995 4 6 spatial variation of soil heavy metal concentration the pli results table 5 ranged from of 0 096 0 657 in dry season and 0 026 0 748 in wet season which is an indication of non to moderate pollution within the study area the pli results further revealed that the western and southern to eastern axis of the study area had the lowest pli values of 0 096 and 0 026 in dry and wet seasons respectively while the northern axis had the highest values of 0 657 and 0 748 in dry and wet seasons respectively the low pli values recorded at the western central to southern southern to eastern and north eastern axis during wet season may be associated with the fact that nickel copper and cadmium were not detected compared to dry season the cf results for fe within the study area ranged from 0 029 to 0 360 and 0 005 0 500 in dry and wet seasons respectively which indicates that the likelihood of iron contamination from anthropogenic sources is very low the western and southern to eastern axis recorded the lowest cf fe values in dry and wet seasons respectively while the northern axis had the highest cf fe values in both seasons the cf mn results ranged from 0 063 to 0 540 in dry season and 0 006 0 730 in wet season which is an indication that the likelihood of mn contamination in the soil samples from anthropogenic sources is very low mn recorded it lowest cf values in the north eastern and southern to eastern axis in dry and wet seasons respectively while its highest values across both seasons were recorded in the northern axis of the study area ni had a cf value ranging from 0 086 to 0 755 in dry season and 0 029 0 552 in wet season depicting the likelihood of low ni contamination from anthropogenic sources the lowest cf ni values were recorded in the central to southern and western axis in dry and wet seasons respectively while the highest values were recorded in the northern axis across both seasons the cf cd values within the study area ranged from 0 210 to 2 688 in dry season while no values were calculated in wet season since it was not detected in the soil samples the cf cd values were within the moderate contamination range which suggests that soil samples within the study area may have been enriched by cd inducing anthropogenic contaminants the i geo results further revealed that soil samples sb 03 sw 07 and sw 08 at the southern to eastern axis sw 04 sw 05 and sw 06 at the central to southern axis and sb 05 sw 10 and sw 11 at the north eastern axis have been enriched in cd by anthropogenic contaminants the cf cd results were lowest at the western axis and highest at the southern to eastern axis co had a cf co value ranging from 0 080 to 0 520 in dry season and 0 234 0 862 in wet season which is an indication that the soil samples are not likely to be contaminated by cobalt from anthropogenic sources across both seasons the western axis of the study area had the lowest cf co value while the northern axis had the highest cf co value the cf cu values ranged from 0 050 to 1 027 in dry season which suggests low to moderate contamination from anthropogenic sources while in wet season it ranged from 0 043 to 0 670 signifying low contamination from anthropogenic sources in dry season the i geo value of sample sw 14 for cu 0 38 at the northern axis of the study area suggests that it may have been enriched in copper from anthropogenic sources across both seasons the cf cu results were lowest at the central to southern axis and highest at the northern axis zn had a cf value ranging from 0 023 to 1 907 in dry season and 0 05 1 50 in wet season which is an indication of low to moderate contamination within the study area the cf zn and i geo values for zn revealed that location sw 08 at the southern to eastern axis and locations sw 13 sw 14 and sw 17 at the northern axis is moderately contaminated from anthropogenic sources the cf zn results were lowest at the western and southern to eastern axis in dry and wet seasons respectively while they were highest at the northern axis of the study area across both seasons pb had a cf value ranging from 0 148 to 0 886 in dry season and 0 023 0 753 in wet season which is an indication of low contamination within the study area across both seasons the cf pb results were lowest at the north eastern axis while they were highest at the northern axis generally the lowest cf values for co cu and pb occurred within the same axis in both seasons while those of fe mn zn and ni changed with season also the highest cf values for fe mn zn co cu ni and pb occurred within the northern axis in both seasons this assertion is in agreement with the pli values at the northern axis of the study area the cf results further revealed that contamination from cd and cu dry season and zn both seasons were anthropogenic in nature though in the seasons where they were detected their impact on the water samples were not above the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 permissible limits in drinking water the results from the indices of soil contamination indicate that the northern region of the study area is the most impacted by anthropogenic contamination this is connected to the fact that northern axis of the study area serves as the entrance into the community with the highest population of the inhabitants within the study area it is characterised by a lot of human activities which may have introduced contaminants into the topsoil 5 conclusion a reconnaissance survey of the study area revealed a shallow depth to water table ranging from 0 37 to 1 20 m on site auditing of water samples revealed that the quality of water in terms of its colour and odour have been greatly impaired while some of the boreholes had a sharp salty taste quantitative analysis of the water samples revealed that turbidity apparent colour ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids fe and mn in several water samples were above the nsdwq 2007 and who 2017 permissible limits in drinking water across both seasons the results of chloride ec and tds revealed that brackish water is not within the shallow aquifer levels while at greater depths such as those from boreholes the presence of brackish water is evident especially at tolukiribo south east of the study area the result of bacterial analysis showed that only few samples were fit for human consumption the results of soil analysis revealed the presence of contaminants such as cd cu and zn from anthropogenic sources the spatial variation of heavy metals in the soil samples across seasons revealed that the western axis of the study area is the least contaminated while the northern axis is the most contaminated from anthropogenic sources this study concluded that the quality of surface water groundwater and sub soil within arogbo community have been contaminated the results of soil analysis revealed that contamination arising from anthropogenic sources had no significant impact on the contamination level of water within the study area rather terrestrial sources of iron and manganese were the major contaminants responsible for the high level of colouration of surface water and groundwater within the study area funding this study was supported by the tertiary education trust fund tetfund research

8102,study region the upper part of the guayllabamba and napo basins 78 2 w 0 3 s 18 500 km2 in the equatorial andes which are vulnerable to stress on the ecosystem services study focus this paper analyses the diurnal cycle of precipitation over a transect from the andes to the amazon the diurnal cycle is estimated as the diurnal distribution of precipitation for 2014 2019 using records from 80 stations cluster analysis performed on the diurnal cycle estimates depicts the spatial association between the diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation new hydrological insights a northwest southeast spatial variation in the diurnal and seasonal cycles is identified with four groups of stations in the western part the seasonal cycles of groups 1 and 2 are bimodal with precipitation maxima in the march april and october november seasons and a short drier season in july august in the eastern part group 3 also presents bimodality but a weaker seasonal cycle conversely group 4 is unimodal with a peak in june distinct diurnal cycles are observed in both drier and wetter seasons of groups 1 3 no marked diurnal cycle is observed in group 4 groups 3 and 4 are the most spatially heterogeneous with an exceptional horizontal variation of 330 mm yr km the analysis of these variations provides insight into the atmospheric dynamics driving precipitation in this zone and may help to better optimize the water supply system keywords precipitation variability diurnal and seasonal cycles equatorial andes 1 introduction the diurnal cycle is the finest scale regular mode of precipitation variability and is an essential aspect of local climate and the hydrological cycle the diurnal cycle results from the interplay between regional mechanisms and complex local atmospheric circulations induced by topography and land atmosphere interactions and is driven mainly by the marked diurnal amplitude of temperature yang and slingo 2001 takahashi et al 2010 junquas et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 espinoza et al 2020 precipitation variations become much more complex in mountainous regions where the topography induces strong horizontal and altitudinal gradients e g immerzeel et al 2014 guo et al 2014 espinoza et al 2015 chavez and takahashi 2017 defining not only diurnal but also contrasted seasonal modes of variability e g oettli and camberlin 2005 takahashi 2010 ilbay yupa et al 2021 in the andean region previous studies used datasets from precipitation stations highlighting the role of the rough topography in modulating the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the northern andes 1 n 11 n colombia poveda et al 2005 used 51 rainfall stations to reveal the heterogeneity of the diurnal cycle even between nearby stations attributing these changes to the interplay of topography with synoptic and local scale circulations more recent research conducted in the medellin andean valley 6 n 6 6 n colombia shows that the diurnal cycle is spatially coherent and varies seasonally depending on the life cycle of deep and large convective systems modulated at diurnal time scales bedoya et al 2019 in the current study the term coherence is also used to describe a common spatial behaviour of precipitation at different time scales diurnal and seasonal the diurnal cycle of precipitation is often used to test physical parameterisations in atmospheric models since its representation is difficult junquas et al 2018 konduru and takahashi 2020 junquas et al 2018 analysed the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the central andes 13 s 17 s peru via mesoscale atmospheric modelling suggesting that thermally driven local scale diurnal circulation patterns control the diurnal precipitation cycle the latter mechanism triggers winds that transport moisture upslope during the day and downslope at night a mechanical channelisation of upslope moisture transport is also described during the day along the eastern andean valleys the sparsity and uneven distribution of networks of meteorological stations in mountain environments make characterising precipitation a challenging task buytaert et al 2006 padrón et al 2015 condom et al 2020 particularly long term hourly

tropical andes are either limited by short observation periods or coarse spatial resolution of satellite retrievals e g bendix et al 2006a campozano et al 2016 ballari et al 2018 campozano et al 2018 for instance bendix et al 2006b examined the diurnal cycle of precipitation in a southern ecuadorian andes amazon valley oriented west to east using a doppler rain radar profiler to recognise two diurnal rainfall maxima peaking around sunrise 05 30 06 30 lt and in the early afternoon 14 30 15 30 lt the first peak is attributed to mesoscale convective systems mcs developed during the nighttime over the amazon plains and extending toward the andes by mid level easterlies and the second one to local thermally driven convection furthermore thermally driven upslope flow contributes to cloud formation in the eastern cordillera range releasing rainfall during the day that can also reach the inter andean valleys mcs are more frequent during the night and their size remains constant throughout the year regardless of their seasonal cycle campozano et al 2018 it can be concluded from the literature that the diurnal cycle displays an afternoon evening peak in andean valleys and a midnight dawn peak in the andes amazon slopes precipitation variability in many cases is the major source of uncertainty in catchment hydrology e g beven 2012 buytaert et al 2006 this is especially true in the high altitude environments of the tropical andes that provide essential ecosystem services like water storage and streamflow regulation for downstream water uses gonzález zeas et al 2019 andean catchments particularly those covered by páramo i e a high altitude neotropical grassland ecosystem respond quickly 24 h to storm precipitation events producing flash floods that cause human losses and damages to water supply systems muñoz et al 2018 in addition partially glacierized catchments 5000 m asl approx undergo continuous ablation and accumulation processes at sub daily time scales throughout the year favier et al 2004 recently seasonal and west east spatial variations of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi have been identified in the ecuadorian andes and greening peaks are generally associated with lower rainfall haro carrión et al 2021 to investigate such processes fundamental knowledge about the diurnal variability of precipitation is required thus this paper aims to examine the spatial variability of precipitation in the andes amazon transition zone of ecuador in order to give insights to investigate atmospheric dynamics driving the diurnal cycle and support water management to that goal the coherence of diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation and its relationship with the topography is analysed thanks to a unique dataset from a dense stations network specifically the paper tackles the concomitant spatial variation of both diurnal and seasonal cycles that has not been reported yet by previous studies in the region the target domain is a rectangular zone in the equatorial andes of 18 500 km2 with an altitude between 400 and 5 750 m a s l this region shows high vulnerability to suffering stress on the ecosystem services due to the progressive increase of the population and urgently requires new strategies for water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climate settings the study zone 78 2 w 0 3 s encompasses the upper guayllabamba basin and the upper napo basin draining respectively to the pacific and amazonas basins it extends over 18 500 km2 and is characterized by steep slopes with an altitude between 400 and 5 750 m a s l fig 1 b this zone is critical because it hosts a vast and currently expanding water infrastructure that supplies water for human consumption in quito the capital of ecuador and other surrounding urban areas gonzález zeas et al 2019 the andes cordillera in the zone exhibits a predominant ne sw orientation and branches into two major mountain ranges the so called cordillera occidental western branch and cordillera central eastern branch both characterized by volcanoes and some summits covered by glaciers fig 1b the annual precipitation in the inter andean valley varies from 400 mm yr in the bottom of the valley and reaches 1500 mm yr on the flanks of the cordillera pouget et al 2017 conversely the upper napo basin displays heterogeneous annual precipitation ranging from 1000 mm yr on the cordillera central ridges and reaching up to 6000 mm yr on the andes amazon foothills laraque et al 2007 indeed similar heterogeneity in the amount of annual precipitation has been observed along the tropical andes amazon slopes 5 n 20 s e g espinoza et al 2009 2015 halladay et al 2012 chavez and takahashi 2017 kumar et al 2020 saavedra et al 2020 the moisture barrier effect of the andes modulates the precipitation regimes on the pacific and amazon sides at multiple time scales which interact on the regional to local spatial scales campozano et al 2018 espinoza et al 2020 the inter annual variability of precipitation is in part modulated by anomalies in the sea surface temperature of the tropical pacific and atlantic oceans vuille et al 2000 among them the el niño southern oscillation enso produces positive precipitation anomalies that are responsible for several socio economic impacts on equatorial andean populations e g vuille et al 2000 rossel and cadier 2009 vicente serrano et al 2017 in addition the madden julian oscillation mjo drives the intra seasonal precipitation variability in ecuador recalde coronel et al 2020 the intertropical convergence zone itcz meridional migration partly modulates precipitation seasonality and inter annual extremes segura et al 2019 the northern pacific slope region is influenced by moisture transported upslope from the eastern pacific during the december may season associated with the southward displacement of the itcz vázquez patiño et al 2020 in the plains along the ecuadorian coast the seasonal cycle of precipitation is generally unimodal with a peak during austral autumn bendix and lauer 1992 vicente serrano et al 2017 corresponding to the southernmost position of the eastern pacific itcz during a normal year mitchell and wallace 1996 garreaud 2009 on the other hand in the eastern part of the andes a different unimodal rainfall regime is observed with a peak during austral winter associated with the advection of water vapour from the amazon basin by enhanced easterlies during this season in addition a bimodal seasonal cycle peaking around march may and october november is documented in the inter andean valleys which is characterized by dry conditions during austral winter related to strong atmospheric subsidence campozano et al 2016 segura et al 2019 consequently only one rainy season december may occurs in the coastal plains with one or two rainy seasons june july or march may and october november in the inter andean valleys and amazon plains e g bendix and lauer 1992 laraque et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009 garreaud 2009 campozano et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2017 two other large scale phenomena are associated with the seasonality of precipitation the east andean low level jet llj and the development of mesoscale convective systems that exhibit varying diurnal features e g marengo 2002 rollenbeck and bendix 2011 montini et al 2019 2 2 hydroclimatic data 2 2 1 precipitation data rainfall data for the study site are provided at an hourly time step by three local manager institutions the empresa pública metropolitana de agua potable y saneamiento epmaps the fondo para la protección de agua fonag the instituto nacional de meteorología e hidrología inamhi and the french national observation service glacioclim les glaciers un observatoire du climat which meticulously collect process and check the precipitation records following the protocols suggested by the world meteorological organization wmo wmo 2007 2015 data from a total of 130 stations 1 glacioclim 23 inamhi 34 fonag and 72 epmaps stations all with tipping bucket rain gauges with an accuracy of 0 2 mm per tip were compiled the data quality and data availability over the 2014 2019 study period were checked in this study to estimate the diurnal cycle thereby reducing the amount of data to 80 rainfall stations table s1 supplementary material only the stations that meet the following conditions were retained 1 a maximum of 20 data gaps in the entire study period and 2 data for any given month must be available during a minimum of four years again using a data gap threshold of 20 one exception is made to the criteria six stations with scarce monthly precipitation values located on the amazonian flank white stars in fig 1b were included in order to use data from these remote areas that are characterized by scarce information and a lack of knowledge notice that only the 80 hourly rainfall stations are used to estimate the diurnal cycle fig 1b 2 2 2 atmospheric data seasonal atmospheric circulation was analysed using both meridional and zonal winds at 850 hpa from the european centre for medium range reanalysis era5 hersbach et al 2020 for the 2014 2019 period the 850 hpa winds u and v in m s 1 are highly relevant to properly describing the atmospheric circulation in south america e g espinoza et al 2009 2012 paccini et al 2017 furthermore low level winds are the major drivers of precipitation variability in the andes amazon transition region since they transport most of the moisture towards the cordillera vázquez patiño et al 2020 figueroa et al 2020 conversely diurnal circulation was analysed using hourly monthly means also from era5 during 2014 2019 the selected months were january april july and october because they are the middle month of each season additionally the hours 14h00 lt and 02h00 lt were selected in order to contrast daytime with nighttime circulations these hours agree with the initiation of precipitation maxima in the daytime locally induced and nighttime regionally induced convection in the zone bendix et al 2006b de angelis et al 2004 the vertical structure of the atmosphere is also described using zonal winds u in m s 1 the vertical velocity omega w in pa s 1 and the specific humidity q in g kg 1 from 1000 hpa to 300 hpa 2 3 diurnal cycle estimation to avoid effects of large differences in the amount of precipitation between stations e g in the amazon plain vs the andean stations we estimated the diurnal cycle as the percent of total daily rainfall instead of the traditional diurnal cycle expressed in terms of precipitation intensity mm h hourly precipitation data was used to estimate the diurnal cycle associated with each station following the formulation published in the literature e g oki and musiake 1994 poveda et al 2005 bedoya et al 2019 that states that the diurnal cycle dc1 can be defined by 1 d c 1 m h p m h 1 24 h 0 23 p m h 100 where p m h mm h is the long term 2014 2019 average of precipitation measured in the time interval h 1 h of the hour h in the month m the index h in eq 1 refers to hours 00 23 h lt d c 1 m h eq 1 can be interpreted as the normalized diurnal cycle of each month or the anomaly of the precipitation at hour h in month m of the year oki and musiake 1994 for clustering purposes and to correct for the non concordance between the peak hours of the diurnal cycle at the nearby stations e g poveda et al 2005 we also calculated the diurnal cycles d c 3 at 3 h and d c 6 at 6 h time steps through the aggregation of d c 1 m h as follows 2 d c 3 m h 3 i h 3 i 3 i 2 d c 1 m h 3 d c 6 m h 6 i h 6 i 6 i 5 d c 1 m h where i 0 7 for d c 3 and i 0 3 for d c 6 this means that d c 3 is the sum of the diurnal cycle dc1 every three hours starting at 00 03 06 09 12 15 18 and 21 h lt similarly d c 6 is the sum of the diurnal cycle dc1 every six hours starting at 00 06 12 and 18 h lt the definitions of diurnal cycle according to eqs 1 3 generate respectively three different datasets of diurnal cycle estimations the 1h 3 h and 6 h dataset fig s 1 each dataset has 80 members diurnal cycles and is used in cluster analysis in order to find dominant modes of diurnal variability in the zone it is assumed that the six years of hourly data used in this study is sufficient to capture the diurnal and seasonal variations of precipitation e g bedoya soto et al 2019 since these modes of variability are regular and closely periodic over time espinoza et al 2020 arias et al 2021 2 4 cluster analysis to detect dominant diurnal cycles and delineate their associated groups we used the unsupervised partitioning around medoids pam clustering method where dissimilarity measures and a number of groups k must be specified in order to cluster the datasets kaufman and rousseeuw 2008 pam is a k medoid based algorithm but uses data points as centers real members or stations instead of a centroid non observable mean representative of a group specifically its advantage relies on the medoid a true spatially localizable station which can describe the diurnal cycle groups through only one observed diurnal cycle the chosen measure of dissimilarity to be minimized in pam is the manhattan distance which is based on the absolute distance between members and diminishes the influence of unusual values outliers which can exaggerate dissimilarities such as in euclidean distances clustering methods have been widely used to regionalize rainfall patterns as demonstrated in several studies e g oki and musiake 1994 rau et al 2016 trachte et al 2018 a more detailed description of pam can be found in trachte et al 2018 the number of groups k was selected using the gap statistic that compares the change in within cluster dispersion with that expected under an appropriate null distribution tibshirani et al 2001 we analysed feasible k groups between 2 and 10 suggested by the gap statistic for each diurnal cycle dataset 1h 3 h and 6 h dataset inspecting visually the spatial pattern displayed over topography and the representation of groups in the principal components space pc1 pc2 we chose both the dataset and k hat do not permit the groups convex hulls to overlap in the pc1 pc2 space 2 5 seasonality assessment with the aim to understand whether precipitation diurnal cycle groups are related to seasonality we calculated the seasonal index si suggested by walsh and lawler 1981 for each precipitation station as follows 4 s i 1 r ˆ m 1 12 x m ˆ r ˆ 12 where r ˆ is the mean annual precipitation and x m ˆ is the mean monthly precipitation of month m table 1 shows the qualitative classification of degrees of seasonality 3 results 3 1 spatial pattern of annual precipitation a clear contrast is observed between precipitation in the inter andean valley in the guayllabamba basin flanks a b and c in fig 1b and on the amazonian slopes flank d in fig 1b in the inter andean valley the lowest precipitation values are observed in the surroundings of the valley s talweg decreasing to 400 mm yr whereas the flanks of the cordillera show higher precipitation values up to approximately 1 200 mm yr in contrast the amazonian slopes show higher values of precipitation towards the foothills of the eastern cordillera with observed values up to 6 060 mm yr at the reventador station fig 1b easternmost white star precipitation values are highly contrasted below 2 500 m a s l and can reach up to 4 000 mm yr precipitation values within the range 400 1 500 mm yr are found in the 2 500 3 500 m a s l range whereas precipitation values within the 600 3 500 mm yr range are observed above 3 500 m a s l fig s 2 an interesting feature of the amazonian slopes is the strong spatial variation in precipitation over short horizontal distances particularly on the eastern ridge of the andes fig 1b cordillera central ridge fig 1c shows a profile that crosses several prominent orographic features in the study zone the maximum of precipitation in the profile section y z is 3660 mm yr and at a nearby station the precipitation decreases to 989 mm yr i e a 73 decrease within a horizontal distance of 8 km these values represent an exceptional spatial variation of 330 mm yr km in comparison with spatial variations of 190 mm yr km identified in the rainfall hot spots in the central andes espinoza et al 2015 and 68 mm yr km in the himalayan region immerzeel et al 2014 in addition the evaluation of altitudinal linear gradients that follow preferential orographic paths such as catchment axes e g trachte et al 2018 or swath profiles e g andermann et al 2011 shows a positive annual gradient of 200 mm per km of altitude in the section x y 3 2 diurnal and seasonal circulations the regional atmospheric circulation influencing the zone is dominated by easterly winds fig 2 a d suggesting that most of the moisture is transported from the atlantic ocean and the amazon basin northwesterly winds fig 2a b transport moisture from the eastern pacific mainly in december may since winds are weak in june august and september october seasons fig 2c d maxima of easterly winds are observed during the june august season fig 2c that are impinged by the cordillera and can transport moisture upslope by main river valleys indeed in june august the maxima of precipitation of the amazon basin are displaced to its northwestern part very close to the ecuadorian amazonia espinoza et al 2009 analysing the vertical structure of the atmosphere on diurnal time scales a clear contrast of upslope fig 2e h and downslope fig 2i l winds are observed between daytime and nighttime during all the months at both sides of the cordillera on the other hand the vertical structure of moisture varies slightly throughout the year during daytime and nighttime in the amazon and the ecuadorian lowlands close to the pacific coast hereafter referred to as pacific plains as is typical of tropical regions however more humid conditions are distinguished at low pressure levels on the amazon compared to the pacific plains the details of circulation in the inter andean valley are not observable at the resolution of the data from era5 the moisture available during december may in the pacific plains is transported upslope towards the inter andean valley probably by thermal induced breezes and mechanical uplift fig 2e f interestingly at nighttime in january fig 2i unlike the other months upslope moisture transport persists suggesting that mechanical uplift is dominant on the other hand moisture in the amazon plains is continuously transported towards the cordillera by low and mid level easterlies easterly winds are intensified in july fig 2g k and the wind pattern suggests a significant moisture transport towards the amazonian slope during both daytime and nighttime however the atmospheric subsidence observed in the mid levels 500 600 hpa acts as a barrier that causes moisture to accumulate on the amazonian slope with dry conditions prevailing in the highlands 3 3 diurnal cycle of precipitation according to the criteria defined in section 2 4 clustering the 6 h dataset in four groups is accurate to regionalize the diurnal cycle of the study zone the two first principal components pc1 pc2 for the 6 h dataset which represent 37 4 and 28 of the total variance respectively satisfy the criteria of non overlapping convex hulls of the groups figs 3 s 3 s 5 based on this result four dominant diurnal cycles are clearly depicted in the study zone these groups present a spatial distribution in the nw se direction perpendicular to the axis of the cordillera figs 4 a and s 6 group 1 gathers most of the stations 34 stations located on flanks a b and c group 2 gathers 13 stations mostly on flank c group 3 gathers 15 stations near the cordillera central ridge and is embedded with stations from group 4 demonstrating the effect of the andes amazon transition zone finally group 4 gathers 18 stations mostly on the eastern side of the cordillera central ridge in order to identify the finest features of the diurnal cycle grouped using the 6 h dataset the following description is provided using the 1h dataset for the diurnal cycle where seasonal shifts and diurnal and semidiurnal cycles can be recognized fig 4 for the sake of convenience we define the diurnal cycle as occurring between 07 00 07 00 lt gmt 5 in order to be consistent with the regional literature e g poveda et al 2005 bedoya et al 2019 the medoids fig 4b e derived from the 6 h dataset are therefore the dominant diurnal cycles found in the study zone and exhibit the following features with regards to phase timing a group 1 fig 4b is characterized by daytime precipitation and concentrates precipitation in the afternoon around 13 00 19 00 lt throughout the year with higher concentrations during april december during february april and november december precipitation is also observed in the night with precipitation occurring until 02 00 lt during july august low precipitation values are also observed in the night around 00 00 01 00 lt b group 2 fig 4c is characterized by a high concentration of precipitation in the afternoon around 13 00 19 00 lt throughout the year in particular in the september march season 100 of the precipitation is observed during 13 00 19 00 lt with peaks around 15 00 16 00 lt in june august precipitation is also observed in the morning and night during this season precipitation shows a better distribution throughout the day with a small peak around 01 00 lt little or a total absence of precipitation is observed around 01 00 08 00 lt c group 3 fig 4d concentrates precipitation around 11 00 18 00 lt throughout the year during the september may season a peak of precipitation is clearly observed around 13 00 16 00 lt during june august precipitation is also observed around 01 00 18 00 with a small peak in the morning around 10 00 11 00 lt d group 4 fig 4e in contrast is characterized by a low precipitation concentration at any one particular time of day which means that precipitation is observed most of the day precipitation is observed during the night and morning 22 00 12 00 lt particularly during the april october season during the november march season precipitation is concentrated around 11 00 18 00 lt with a small peak around 14 00 16 00 lt fig 5 presents the results of a sample of the 19 stations systematically selected to reflect the spatial distribution and particularities of the diurnal cycle in the zone the medoids fig 5 arrows 4 8 11 and 17 are the representative diurnal cycles of the zone as demonstrated by the similarity of the diurnal and seasonal patterns present in the sample for each group group 1 fig 5 arrows 1 14 15 16 17 and 19 group 2 fig 5 arrows 2 6 11 12 and 13 group 3 fig 5 arrows 3 7 and 8 and group 4 fig 5 arrows 4 5 9 and 10 fig 5 also shows that there is not a common pattern in the diurnal cycle for the sample of the 19 stations however given the variety observed in the diurnal cycles it is worth mentioning certain aspects i for some stations diurnal cycles are unimodal diurnal throughout the year e g fig 5 arrows 7 and 13 ii for others diurnal cycles switch from a unimodal diurnal to bimodal pattern semi diurnal throughout the year e g fig 5 arrows 2 and 18 iii very similar patterns exist between nearby stations e g fig 5 arrows 15 16 and 17 also arrows 4 5 iv the timing of the diurnal maxima is similar for some nearby stations e g fig 5 arrows 16 and 17 in april and september both stations peak at 16 00 lt and 18 00 lt respectively and v a slightly different timing for the diurnal maxima for nearby stations can also occur e g fig 5 arrows 15 and 16 in august the stations peak at 17 00 lt and 15 00 16 00 lt respectively an unexpected degree of similarity in is observed for two distal stations fig 5 arrows 6 and 18 that is in disagreement with the general picture of the nw se geographical orientation for the diurnal cycle groups fig 5 inner panel however these stations still show similarities either in the diurnal pattern alone fig 5 arrow 18 or in both the diurnal and seasonal patterns fig 5 arrow 6 with the medoids of the groups to which the stations belong 3 4 seasonal cycle of precipitation in section 3 3 we showed that the diurnal cycles vary throughout the year and that four groups of dominant diurnal cycles were found to investigate a potential relationship between the diurnal and seasonal cycles we calculated the average seasonal cycles of precipitation for the stations within each group fig 6 additionally the standard deviations for each month were relatively small compared to the mean values this feature indicates that the grouping of the stations based on the diurnal cycle reflects the associated seasonal cycle well keeping in mind the nw se orientation of the groups of diurnal cycles distinct seasonal cycles varying from bimodal fig 6a to unimodal regimes fig 6d were found in the study zone groups 1 and 2 fig 6a b are associated with bimodal regimes with precipitation maxima in the march april period and a during the october november season separated by two minima around the solstices in the july august and december january periods we observed the strongest seasonality in groups 1 and 2 the values are up to seven times higher between the rainiest and driest season however unlike group 1 group 2 shows more constant precipitation during austral summer group 3 fig 6c may also be associated with a bimodal regime however the seasonality of the precipitation is weaker relative maxima can be identified during the march may period and in november and the lowest relative minima occur during the august september and december february periods finally group 4 is unimodal with a rainy season during the may july period with the peak in june in general the seasonal index si values of the seasonal cycles fig 7 do not fit in the seasonal regime as suggested in table 1 since all si values are lower than 0 60 the si values suggest that the seasonality of groups 1 and 2 is rather seasonal with a short drier season this dry season occurs in july august fig 6a b for groups 3 and 4 the seasonality is equable but with a definite wetter season this wetter season occurs in september may fig 6c and march august fig 6d respectively furthermore the median values of the boxplots in fig 7 decrease from group 1 to group 4 which indicates an eastward weakening of the precipitation seasonality towards an equable regime 3 5 contrasting diurnal and seasonal cycles the drier seasons identified for groups 1 and 2 and the wetter seasons for groups 3 and 4 demonstrate contrasting features in the patterns for the diurnal cycles as shown in fig 4 groups 1 and 2 present the same bimodal seasonal cycle and in the drier season july august the diurnal cycles exhibit different behaviour as well as during the wetter seasons in group 1 precipitation is concentrated in the afternoon whereas in group 2 it is concentrated in the morning and night in group 3 during the short dry season from june to august precipitation occurs in the nighttime whereas precipitation is observed in the daytime during the rest of the year in contrast during the wetter season from april to october group 4 is characterized by mostly homogeneous precipitation during the morning and night these findings highlight the complex behaviour of precipitation in the study zone i distinct diurnal concentrations of precipitation are observed in both drier and wetter seasons e g groups 1 2 and 3 and ii there is no marked diurnal cycle throughout the year e g group 4 the detailed diurnal and seasonal cycles of all stations used in this work are provided in the supplementary material figs s 7 s 9 to reconcile the diurnal cycle groups with their spatial distribution altitude and seasonal cycles expressed as monthly precipitation mm month we divided the stations by flank sorting them by altitude fig 8 fig 8a presents flank a and flank b stations ordered by descending altitude varying from 4 012 m a s l station p28 on the cordillera occidental ridge to 1 626 m a s l station c15 the north western most station in the study zone in fig 1b conversely fig 8b shows the stations on the flank b sorted by ascending altitude from 1 886 m a s l station p61 the second northernmost station to 4 148 m a s l station f74 on the cordillera central ridge and fig 8c shows the stations sorted from 4 850 m a s l ore station the highest station in the study zone and the closest one to the antizana glacier to 2 240 m a s l station i14 the south eastern most station fig 8 clearly shows the marked bimodal seasonal cycle from station p28 fig 8a to station f26 fig 8b enclosing the group 1 and group 2 stations in the previously identified nw se variation of both diurnal and seasonal cycles rainfall peaks characterize these stations during the march april and october november seasons and a relatively short dry season july august during austral winter stations f76 fig 8b to i14 fig 8c enclose the group 3 and group 4 stations where the precipitation is better distributed throughout the year and a peak during austral winter is observed in the group 4 stations green labels the situation of group 3 and group 4 in the nw se direction is more heterogeneous than groups 1 and 2 which is explained by the strong spatial gradient that characterizes the andes amazon transition region e g laraque et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009 junquas et al 2018 4 discussion our results refine the assessment of the coherence among the diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation identified by the most recent comparable studies in the tropical andes using precipitation stations poveda et al 2005 bedoya et al 2019 this coherence is clustered in groups of diurnal and seasonal cycles varying spatially in the nw se direction in agreement with the prominent large scale wind direction fig 2 this is the classical picture of orographic precipitation in mountain ranges where the orography and diurnal thermal contrast modulate the regional scale diurnal circulation roe 2005 bendix et al 2006b junquas et al 2018 in addition we identify the concomitant spatial variation of both the diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation in the study region which has not yet been reported in previous studies of the equatorial andes these results may slightly vary when using different clustering methods and different measures of dissimilarity while performing pam but the nw se spatial variation remains unaltered 4 1 atmospheric dynamics related to the diurnal and seasonal cycles key findings emerged regarding the diurnal and seasonal patterns and the related local regional scale processes driving precipitation over seasonal time scales our findings are consistent with previous work carried out in ecuador e g laraque et al 2007 ballari et al 2018 tobar and wyseure 2018 ilbay yupa et al 2021 and are in line with the regional circulation fig 2 the identified groups 1 and 2 in the inter andean valley are bimodal with peaks in the march april and october november seasons in addition in groups 1 and 2 the results clearly show a more significant peak in march april than in october november which could be linked to the spatial proximity of the stations in the groups to the pacific coast where a unimodal maximum prevails during austral autumn see the section 2 1 and references therein this behaviour is particularly pronounced for group 1 which includes the most western stations the weak seasonality of group 3 relative peaks observed in march may and november situated more to the east could be explained by a weaker influence of the coastal regime and a greater influence of the bimodal amazonian regime which entersthe eastern cordillera westward through the main river valleys e g campozano et al 2016 2018 tobar and wyseure 2018 whereas these three groups clearly show inter andean valley regimes with different influences of the coastal western and amazonian eastern regimes group 4 shows a very distinctive unimodal regime with a peak in austral winter and maxima in june this regime has been described in the literature as a particularity of some stations on the eastern slope of the andes and valleys connected to the amazonian plains e g laraque et al 2007 where the orographic barrier effect of the andes block strongly the easterlies the blocking effect is more pronounced in austral winter when mid level moist easterly winds are stronger and oriented perpendicular to the cordillera bendix et al 2006a laraque et al 2007 however as has been found in previous studies using data from stations in the eastern ecuadorian cordillera the easterlies influence and the associated blocking process can show strong local variations therefore the seasonal cycle of nearby stations can be affected differently by this process depending on the characteristics of their locations i e slope or aspect which define if they are leeward or windward consequently a bimodal regime is also found on the amazon slope e g fig 5 station marked by arrow 6 due to inter valley locations sheltered from the influence of easterlies campozano et al 2016 this explains the strong spatial gradient in the eastern cordillera characteristic of the andes amazon transition region the spatial variability in the diurnal maxima even in nearby stations seems to be determined by the stations local topography and windward and leeward configurations afternoon precipitation observed in the inter andean valley throughout the year groups 1 and 2 appears to be mainly related to local convection and induced thermal upslope breezes explaining the higher annual precipitation close the cordillera ridges than in the valley nevertheless the nocturnal precipitation of group 1 can be attributed to the advected moisture from the amazon rainforest during seasons march april and october november with high convective activity in the eastern foothills of the andes nocturnal convective systems are more frequent than daytime convective systems campozano et al 2018 the local scale katabatic winds flowing towards the amazon rainforest due to nocturnal divergence over mountains interact with the warm and moist air of the amazon rainforest inducing compressional lifting and causing nocturnal cloud clusters called the andes occurring system aos rain band bendix et al 2006a the dynamics of the aos may explain the nocturnal precipitation at the stations on the amazon slope that partly changes to morning precipitation as the aos are transported eastward to the cordillera this complex interaction of local to regional atmospheric processes in the andes amazon transition zone could be responsible for the nocturnal and morning peaks observed in groups 2 3 and 4 it should be noted that the present study has not examined the inter annual e g enso or intra seasonal variability e g mjo of the diurnal cycle in the colombian andes poveda et al 2005 found that these modes of variability only modulate the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and do not alter its phase nevertheless it is important to bear in mind that the diurnal and seasonal cycles investigated in this six year period could be capturing stationary conditions however they are regular and preserve their periodicity over long term scales poveda et al 2005 espinoza et al 2020 arias et al 2021 the seasonal cycle of precipitation seems to exert an important role in the east west gradient of greening in the zone haro carrión et al 2021 we show that in the eastern part of the andes the seasonal cycle of greening identified by haro carrión et al 2021 is weak as the seasonal cycle of precipitiation in the inter andean valley the seasonal cycle of greening peaking in july august agrees with the short dry season identified in the zone to develop a full picture of the diurnal cycle in the study zone high resolution atmospheric modelling is necessary to accurately investigate the regional to local interactions that control the diurnal cycle quito 2 850 m a s l fig 1a the capital of ecuador with 2 6 million inhabitants depends on a complex infrastructure of water intakes and conductions that transport water from high altitude catchments and the diurnal cycle described in this study could help to better understand hydro glaciological processes and develop new water management strategies 5 conclusions and final remarks this study analysed the spatial variability of diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation in the equatorial andes thanks to a dense network of 80 precipitation stations with hourly data located over an inter andean valley and its transition to the amazon basin over the 2014 2019 period the precipitation network allowed us first to identify an exceptionally strong spatial gradient in precipitation of up to 330 mm yr km using cluster analysis we identified for the first time groups of stations varying spatially in the nw se direction over this region with complex topography which display concomitant diurnal and seasonal variations of precipitation in the western part of the study area the seasonal cycles of groups 1 and 2 are bimodal and typical of equatorial inter andean valleys with precipitation maxima in the march april and october november seasons and one short drier season in july august conversely in the eastern part group 3 presents a weak bimodal seasonal cycle with relative maxima also in march april and october november finally group 4 is unimodal with a maximum in june it is crucial to notice that distinct diurnal cycles are observed in both drier and wetter seasons of groups 1 2 and 3 and no marked diurnal cycle is observed in any part of the year in group 4 furthermore groups 3 and 4 are the most spatially heterogeneous in annual precipitation and diurnal cycles this local scale analysis based on precipitation stations agrees with the diurnal and seasonal regional circulation observed in reanalysis era5 the findings of this work complement those of earlier studies in the tropical andes that analysed diurnal cycle over complex topography the present study lays the groundwork for future research into the atmospheric physical processes linking diurnal and seasonal precipitation cycles that vary spatially over complex topography further studies need to be carried out to validate the hypothesis discussed in this paper since the use of reanalysis data explains the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of moisture partly for instance our results encourage the use of high resolution atmospheric modelling to identify the interaction of local to large scale mechanisms driving the diurnal cycle in the equatorial andes more broadly research is also needed to understand the diurnal cycle along the andes cordillera in tropical south america to identify the role of oceanic pacific and atlantic and land amazonian basin moisture sources involved in diurnal cycle variations the station based data set presented in this study stress the need to preserve and make denser the current monitoring network in order to capture the long term dynamics of the diurnal cycle the insights gained in this study may help to understand the functioning of andean hydro systems the estimation of water budgets in the páramo is currently subject to large uncertainty due to the limited number of precipitation stations the eastern cordillera receives the highest amounts of precipitation and displays a weak seasonal cycle this homogenous precipitation distributed throughout the year emphasises the role of such environments as water suppliers and regulators thus water management planning should be oriented to generate new strategies to cope with possible future changes in the strength of seasonality for instance sub daily scale processes like flash floods or glacier melting could be better characterised using the diurnal cycle of precipitation in a hydroglaciological modelling framework credit

8102,study region the upper part of the guayllabamba and napo basins 78 2 w 0 3 s 18 500 km2 in the equatorial andes which are vulnerable to stress on the ecosystem services study focus this paper analyses the diurnal cycle of precipitation over a transect from the andes to the amazon the diurnal cycle is estimated as the diurnal distribution of precipitation for 2014 2019 using records from 80 stations cluster analysis performed on the diurnal cycle estimates depicts the spatial association between the diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation new hydrological insights a northwest southeast spatial variation in the diurnal and seasonal cycles is identified with four groups of stations in the western part the seasonal cycles of groups 1 and 2 are bimodal with precipitation maxima in the march april and october november seasons and a short drier season in july august in the eastern part group 3 also presents bimodality but a weaker seasonal cycle conversely group 4 is unimodal with a peak in june distinct diurnal cycles are observed in both drier and wetter seasons of groups 1 3 no marked diurnal cycle is observed in group 4 groups 3 and 4 are the most spatially heterogeneous with an exceptional horizontal variation of 330 mm yr km the analysis of these variations provides insight into the atmospheric dynamics driving precipitation in this zone and may help to better optimize the water supply system keywords precipitation variability diurnal and seasonal cycles equatorial andes 1 introduction the diurnal cycle is the finest scale regular mode of precipitation variability and is an essential aspect of local climate and the hydrological cycle the diurnal cycle results from the interplay between regional mechanisms and complex local atmospheric circulations induced by topography and land atmosphere interactions and is driven mainly by the marked diurnal amplitude of temperature yang and slingo 2001 takahashi et al 2010 junquas et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 espinoza et al 2020 precipitation variations become much more complex in mountainous regions where the topography induces strong horizontal and altitudinal gradients e g immerzeel et al 2014 guo et al 2014 espinoza et al 2015 chavez and takahashi 2017 defining not only diurnal but also contrasted seasonal modes of variability e g oettli and camberlin 2005 takahashi 2010 ilbay yupa et al 2021 in the andean region previous studies used datasets from precipitation stations highlighting the role of the rough topography in modulating the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the northern andes 1 n 11 n colombia poveda et al 2005 used 51 rainfall stations to reveal the heterogeneity of the diurnal cycle even between nearby stations attributing these changes to the interplay of topography with synoptic and local scale circulations more recent research conducted in the medellin andean valley 6 n 6 6 n colombia shows that the diurnal cycle is spatially coherent and varies seasonally depending on the life cycle of deep and large convective systems modulated at diurnal time scales bedoya et al 2019 in the current study the term coherence is also used to describe a common spatial behaviour of precipitation at different time scales diurnal and seasonal the diurnal cycle of precipitation is often used to test physical parameterisations in atmospheric models since its representation is difficult junquas et al 2018 konduru and takahashi 2020 junquas et al 2018 analysed the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the central andes 13 s 17 s peru via mesoscale atmospheric modelling suggesting that thermally driven local scale diurnal circulation patterns control the diurnal precipitation cycle the latter mechanism triggers winds that transport moisture upslope during the day and downslope at night a mechanical channelisation of upslope moisture transport is also described during the day along the eastern andean valleys the sparsity and uneven distribution of networks of meteorological stations in mountain environments make characterising precipitation a challenging task buytaert et al 2006 padrón et al 2015 condom et al 2020 particularly long term hourly records are rare or non existent in most of the equatorial andes due to the harsh environmental conditions the advances in remote sensing techniques e g satellite retrievals radar profiles have significantly contributed to better characterisation of the diurnal cycle over tropical south america e g negri et al 2000 2002 mapes et al 2003 giles et al 2020 however studies related to the tropical andes are either limited by short observation periods or coarse spatial resolution of satellite retrievals e g bendix et al 2006a campozano et al 2016 ballari et al 2018 campozano et al 2018 for instance bendix et al 2006b examined the diurnal cycle of precipitation in a southern ecuadorian andes amazon valley oriented west to east using a doppler rain radar profiler to recognise two diurnal rainfall maxima peaking around sunrise 05 30 06 30 lt and in the early afternoon 14 30 15 30 lt the first peak is attributed to mesoscale convective systems mcs developed during the nighttime over the amazon plains and extending toward the andes by mid level easterlies and the second one to local thermally driven convection furthermore thermally driven upslope flow contributes to cloud formation in the eastern cordillera range releasing rainfall during the day that can also reach the inter andean valleys mcs are more frequent during the night and their size remains constant throughout the year regardless of their seasonal cycle campozano et al 2018 it can be concluded from the literature that the diurnal cycle displays an afternoon evening peak in andean valleys and a midnight dawn peak in the andes amazon slopes precipitation variability in many cases is the major source of uncertainty in catchment hydrology e g beven 2012 buytaert et al 2006 this is especially true in the high altitude environments of the tropical andes that provide essential ecosystem services like water storage and streamflow regulation for downstream water uses gonzález zeas et al 2019 andean catchments particularly those covered by páramo i e a high altitude neotropical grassland ecosystem respond quickly 24 h to storm precipitation events producing flash floods that cause human losses and damages to water supply systems muñoz et al 2018 in addition partially glacierized catchments 5000 m asl approx undergo continuous ablation and accumulation processes at sub daily time scales throughout the year favier et al 2004 recently seasonal and west east spatial variations of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi have been identified in the ecuadorian andes and greening peaks are generally associated with lower rainfall haro carrión et al 2021 to investigate such processes fundamental knowledge about the diurnal variability of precipitation is required thus this paper aims to examine the spatial variability of precipitation in the andes amazon transition zone of ecuador in order to give insights to investigate atmospheric dynamics driving the diurnal cycle and support water management to that goal the coherence of diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation and its relationship with the topography is analysed thanks to a unique dataset from a dense stations network specifically the paper tackles the concomitant spatial variation of both diurnal and seasonal cycles that has not been reported yet by previous studies in the region the target domain is a rectangular zone in the equatorial andes of 18 500 km2 with an altitude between 400 and 5 750 m a s l this region shows high vulnerability to suffering stress on the ecosystem services due to the progressive increase of the population and urgently requires new strategies for water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climate settings the study zone 78 2 w 0 3 s encompasses the upper guayllabamba basin and the upper napo basin draining respectively to the pacific and amazonas basins it extends over 18 500 km2 and is characterized by steep slopes with an altitude between 400 and 5 750 m a s l fig 1 b this zone is critical because it hosts a vast and currently expanding water infrastructure that supplies water for human consumption in quito the capital of ecuador and other surrounding urban areas gonzález zeas et al 2019 the andes cordillera in the zone exhibits a predominant ne sw orientation and branches into two major mountain ranges the so called cordillera occidental western branch and cordillera central eastern branch both characterized by volcanoes and some summits covered by glaciers fig 1b the annual precipitation in the inter andean valley varies from 400 mm yr in the bottom of the valley and reaches 1500 mm yr on the flanks of the cordillera pouget et al 2017 conversely the upper napo basin displays heterogeneous annual precipitation ranging from 1000 mm yr on the cordillera central ridges and reaching up to 6000 mm yr on the andes amazon foothills laraque et al 2007 indeed similar heterogeneity in the amount of annual precipitation has been observed along the tropical andes amazon slopes 5 n 20 s e g espinoza et al 2009 2015 halladay et al 2012 chavez and takahashi 2017 kumar et al 2020 saavedra et al 2020 the moisture barrier effect of the andes modulates the precipitation regimes on the pacific and amazon sides at multiple time scales which interact on the regional to local spatial scales campozano et al 2018 espinoza et al 2020 the inter annual variability of precipitation is in part modulated by anomalies in the sea surface temperature of the tropical pacific and atlantic oceans vuille et al 2000 among them the el niño southern oscillation enso produces positive precipitation anomalies that are responsible for several socio economic impacts on equatorial andean populations e g vuille et al 2000 rossel and cadier 2009 vicente serrano et al 2017 in addition the madden julian oscillation mjo drives the intra seasonal precipitation variability in ecuador recalde coronel et al 2020 the intertropical convergence zone itcz meridional migration partly modulates precipitation seasonality and inter annual extremes segura et al 2019 the northern pacific slope region is influenced by moisture transported upslope from the eastern pacific during the december may season associated with the southward displacement of the itcz vázquez patiño et al 2020 in the plains along the ecuadorian coast the seasonal cycle of precipitation is generally unimodal with a peak during austral autumn bendix and lauer 1992 vicente serrano et al 2017 corresponding to the southernmost position of the eastern pacific itcz during a normal year mitchell and wallace 1996 garreaud 2009 on the other hand in the eastern part of the andes a different unimodal rainfall regime is observed with a peak during austral winter associated with the advection of water vapour from the amazon basin by enhanced easterlies during this season in addition a bimodal seasonal cycle peaking around march may and october november is documented in the inter andean valleys which is characterized by dry conditions during austral winter related to strong atmospheric subsidence campozano et al 2016 segura et al 2019 consequently only one rainy season december may occurs in the coastal plains with one or two rainy seasons june july or march may and october november in the inter andean valleys and amazon plains e g bendix and lauer 1992 laraque et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009 garreaud 2009 campozano et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2017 two other large scale phenomena are associated with the seasonality of precipitation the east andean low level jet llj and the development of mesoscale convective systems that exhibit varying diurnal features e g marengo 2002 rollenbeck and bendix 2011 montini et al 2019 2 2 hydroclimatic data 2 2 1 precipitation data rainfall data for the study site are provided at an hourly time step by three local manager institutions the empresa pública metropolitana de agua potable y saneamiento epmaps the fondo para la protección de agua fonag the instituto nacional de meteorología e hidrología inamhi and the french national observation service glacioclim les glaciers un observatoire du climat which meticulously collect process and check the precipitation records following the protocols suggested by the world meteorological organization wmo wmo 2007 2015 data from a total of 130 stations 1 glacioclim 23 inamhi 34 fonag and 72 epmaps stations all with tipping bucket rain gauges with an accuracy of 0 2 mm per tip were compiled the data quality and data availability over the 2014 2019 study period were checked in this study to estimate the diurnal cycle thereby reducing the amount of data to 80 rainfall stations table s1 supplementary material only the stations that meet the following conditions were retained 1 a maximum of 20 data gaps in the entire study period and 2 data for any given month must be available during a minimum of four years again using a data gap threshold of 20 one exception is made to the criteria six stations with scarce monthly precipitation values located on the amazonian flank white stars in fig 1b were included in order to use data from these remote areas that are characterized by scarce information and a lack of knowledge notice that only the 80 hourly rainfall stations are used to estimate the diurnal cycle fig 1b 2 2 2 atmospheric data seasonal atmospheric circulation was analysed using both meridional and zonal winds at 850 hpa from the european centre for medium range reanalysis era5 hersbach et al 2020 for the 2014 2019 period the 850 hpa winds u and v in m s 1 are highly relevant to properly describing the atmospheric circulation in south america e g espinoza et al 2009 2012 paccini et al 2017 furthermore low level winds are the major drivers of precipitation variability in the andes amazon transition region since they transport most of the moisture towards the cordillera vázquez patiño et al 2020 figueroa et al 2020 conversely diurnal circulation was analysed using hourly monthly means also from era5 during 2014 2019 the selected months were january april july and october because they are the middle month of each season additionally the hours 14h00 lt and 02h00 lt were selected in order to contrast daytime with nighttime circulations these hours agree with the initiation of precipitation maxima in the daytime locally induced and nighttime regionally induced convection in the zone bendix et al 2006b de angelis et al 2004 the vertical structure of the atmosphere is also described using zonal winds u in m s 1 the vertical velocity omega w in pa s 1 and the specific humidity q in g kg 1 from 1000 hpa to 300 hpa 2 3 diurnal cycle estimation to avoid effects of large differences in the amount of precipitation between stations e g in the amazon plain vs the andean stations we estimated the diurnal cycle as the percent of total daily rainfall instead of the traditional diurnal cycle expressed in terms of precipitation intensity mm h hourly precipitation data was used to estimate the diurnal cycle associated with each station following the formulation published in the literature e g oki and musiake 1994 poveda et al 2005 bedoya et al 2019 that states that the diurnal cycle dc1 can be defined by 1 d c 1 m h p m h 1 24 h 0 23 p m h 100 where p m h mm h is the long term 2014 2019 average of precipitation measured in the time interval h 1 h of the hour h in the month m the index h in eq 1 refers to hours 00 23 h lt d c 1 m h eq 1 can be interpreted as the normalized diurnal cycle of each month or the anomaly of the precipitation at hour h in month m of the year oki and musiake 1994 for clustering purposes and to correct for the non concordance between the peak hours of the diurnal cycle at the nearby stations e g poveda et al 2005 we also calculated the diurnal cycles d c 3 at 3 h and d c 6 at 6 h time steps through the aggregation of d c 1 m h as follows 2 d c 3 m h 3 i h 3 i 3 i 2 d c 1 m h 3 d c 6 m h 6 i h 6 i 6 i 5 d c 1 m h where i 0 7 for d c 3 and i 0 3 for d c 6 this means that d c 3 is the sum of the diurnal cycle dc1 every three hours starting at 00 03 06 09 12 15 18 and 21 h lt similarly d c 6 is the sum of the diurnal cycle dc1 every six hours starting at 00 06 12 and 18 h lt the definitions of diurnal cycle according to eqs 1 3 generate respectively three different datasets of diurnal cycle estimations the 1h 3 h and 6 h dataset fig s 1 each dataset has 80 members diurnal cycles and is used in cluster analysis in order to find dominant modes of diurnal variability in the zone it is assumed that the six years of hourly data used in this study is sufficient to capture the diurnal and seasonal variations of precipitation e g bedoya soto et al 2019 since these modes of variability are regular and closely periodic over time espinoza et al 2020 arias et al 2021 2 4 cluster analysis to detect dominant diurnal cycles and delineate their associated groups we used the unsupervised partitioning around medoids pam clustering method where dissimilarity measures and a number of groups k must be specified in order to cluster the datasets kaufman and rousseeuw 2008 pam is a k medoid based algorithm but uses data points as centers real members or stations instead of a centroid non observable mean representative of a group specifically its advantage relies on the medoid a true spatially localizable station which can describe the diurnal cycle groups through only one observed diurnal cycle the chosen measure of dissimilarity to be minimized in pam is the manhattan distance which is based on the absolute distance between members and diminishes the influence of unusual values outliers which can exaggerate dissimilarities such as in euclidean distances clustering methods have been widely used to regionalize rainfall patterns as demonstrated in several studies e g oki and musiake 1994 rau et al 2016 trachte et al 2018 a more detailed description of pam can be found in trachte et al 2018 the number of groups k was selected using the gap statistic that compares the change in within cluster dispersion with that expected under an appropriate null distribution tibshirani et al 2001 we analysed feasible k groups between 2 and 10 suggested by the gap statistic for each diurnal cycle dataset 1h 3 h and 6 h dataset inspecting visually the spatial pattern displayed over topography and the representation of groups in the principal components space pc1 pc2 we chose both the dataset and k hat do not permit the groups convex hulls to overlap in the pc1 pc2 space 2 5 seasonality assessment with the aim to understand whether precipitation diurnal cycle groups are related to seasonality we calculated the seasonal index si suggested by walsh and lawler 1981 for each precipitation station as follows 4 s i 1 r ˆ m 1 12 x m ˆ r ˆ 12 where r ˆ is the mean annual precipitation and x m ˆ is the mean monthly precipitation of month m table 1 shows the qualitative classification of degrees of seasonality 3 results 3 1 spatial pattern of annual precipitation a clear contrast is observed between precipitation in the inter andean valley in the guayllabamba basin flanks a b and c in fig 1b and on the amazonian slopes flank d in fig 1b in the inter andean valley the lowest precipitation values are observed in the surroundings of the valley s talweg decreasing to 400 mm yr whereas the flanks of the cordillera show higher precipitation values up to approximately 1 200 mm yr in contrast the amazonian slopes show higher values of precipitation towards the foothills of the eastern cordillera with observed values up to 6 060 mm yr at the reventador station fig 1b easternmost white star precipitation values are highly contrasted below 2 500 m a s l and can reach up to 4 000 mm yr precipitation values within the range 400 1 500 mm yr are found in the 2 500 3 500 m a s l range whereas precipitation values within the 600 3 500 mm yr range are observed above 3 500 m a s l fig s 2 an interesting feature of the amazonian slopes is the strong spatial variation in precipitation over short horizontal distances particularly on the eastern ridge of the andes fig 1b cordillera central ridge fig 1c shows a profile that crosses several prominent orographic features in the study zone the maximum of precipitation in the profile section y z is 3660 mm yr and at a nearby station the precipitation decreases to 989 mm yr i e a 73 decrease within a horizontal distance of 8 km these values represent an exceptional spatial variation of 330 mm yr km in comparison with spatial variations of 190 mm yr km identified in the rainfall hot spots in the central andes espinoza et al 2015 and 68 mm yr km in the himalayan region immerzeel et al 2014 in addition the evaluation of altitudinal linear gradients that follow preferential orographic paths such as catchment axes e g trachte et al 2018 or swath profiles e g andermann et al 2011 shows a positive annual gradient of 200 mm per km of altitude in the section x y 3 2 diurnal and seasonal circulations the regional atmospheric circulation influencing the zone is dominated by easterly winds fig 2 a d suggesting that most of the moisture is transported from the atlantic ocean and the amazon basin northwesterly winds fig 2a b transport moisture from the eastern pacific mainly in december may since winds are weak in june august and september october seasons fig 2c d maxima of easterly winds are observed during the june august season fig 2c that are impinged by the cordillera and can transport moisture upslope by main river valleys indeed in june august the maxima of precipitation of the amazon basin are displaced to its northwestern part very close to the ecuadorian amazonia espinoza et al 2009 analysing the vertical structure of the atmosphere on diurnal time scales a clear contrast of upslope fig 2e h and downslope fig 2i l winds are observed between daytime and nighttime during all the months at both sides of the cordillera on the other hand the vertical structure of moisture varies slightly throughout the year during daytime and nighttime in the amazon and the ecuadorian lowlands close to the pacific coast hereafter referred to as pacific plains as is typical of tropical regions however more humid conditions are distinguished at low pressure levels on the amazon compared to the pacific plains the details of circulation in the inter andean valley are not observable at the resolution of the data from era5 the moisture available during december may in the pacific plains is transported upslope towards the inter andean valley probably by thermal induced breezes and mechanical uplift fig 2e f interestingly at nighttime in january fig 2i unlike the other months upslope moisture transport persists suggesting that mechanical uplift is dominant on the other hand moisture in the amazon plains is continuously transported towards the cordillera by low and mid level easterlies easterly winds are intensified in july fig 2g k and the wind pattern suggests a significant moisture transport towards the amazonian slope during both daytime and nighttime however the atmospheric subsidence observed in the mid levels 500 600 hpa acts as a barrier that causes moisture to accumulate on the amazonian slope with dry conditions prevailing in the highlands 3 3 diurnal cycle of precipitation according to the criteria defined in section 2 4 clustering the 6 h dataset in four groups is accurate to regionalize the diurnal cycle of the study zone the two first principal components pc1 pc2 for the 6 h dataset which represent 37 4 and 28 of the total variance respectively satisfy the criteria of non overlapping convex hulls of the groups figs 3 s 3 s 5 based on this result four dominant diurnal cycles are clearly depicted in the study zone these groups present a spatial distribution in the nw se direction perpendicular to the axis of the cordillera figs 4 a and s 6 group 1 gathers most of the stations 34 stations located on flanks a b and c group 2 gathers 13 stations mostly on flank c group 3 gathers 15 stations near the cordillera central ridge and is embedded with stations from group 4 demonstrating the effect of the andes amazon transition zone finally group 4 gathers 18 stations mostly on the eastern side of the cordillera central ridge in order to identify the finest features of the diurnal cycle grouped using the 6 h dataset the following description is provided using the 1h dataset for the diurnal cycle where seasonal shifts and diurnal and semidiurnal cycles can be recognized fig 4 for the sake of convenience we define the diurnal cycle as occurring between 07 00 07 00 lt gmt 5 in order to be consistent with the regional literature e g poveda et al 2005 bedoya et al 2019 the medoids fig 4b e derived from the 6 h dataset are therefore the dominant diurnal cycles found in the study zone and exhibit the following features with regards to phase timing a group 1 fig 4b is characterized by daytime precipitation and concentrates precipitation in the afternoon around 13 00 19 00 lt throughout the year with higher concentrations during april december during february april and november december precipitation is also observed in the night with precipitation occurring until 02 00 lt during july august low precipitation values are also observed in the night around 00 00 01 00 lt b group 2 fig 4c is characterized by a high concentration of precipitation in the afternoon around 13 00 19 00 lt throughout the year in particular in the september march season 100 of the precipitation is observed during 13 00 19 00 lt with peaks around 15 00 16 00 lt in june august precipitation is also observed in the morning and night during this season precipitation shows a better distribution throughout the day with a small peak around 01 00 lt little or a total absence of precipitation is observed around 01 00 08 00 lt c group 3 fig 4d concentrates precipitation around 11 00 18 00 lt throughout the year during the september may season a peak of precipitation is clearly observed around 13 00 16 00 lt during june august precipitation is also observed around 01 00 18 00 with a small peak in the morning around 10 00 11 00 lt d group 4 fig 4e in contrast is characterized by a low precipitation concentration at any one particular time of day which means that precipitation is observed most of the day precipitation is observed during the night and morning 22 00 12 00 lt particularly during the april october season during the november march season precipitation is concentrated around 11 00 18 00 lt with a small peak around 14 00 16 00 lt fig 5 presents the results of a sample of the 19 stations systematically selected to reflect the spatial distribution and particularities of the diurnal cycle in the zone the medoids fig 5 arrows 4 8 11 and 17 are the representative diurnal cycles of the zone as demonstrated by the similarity of the diurnal and seasonal patterns present in the sample for each group group 1 fig 5 arrows 1 14 15 16 17 and 19 group 2 fig 5 arrows 2 6 11 12 and 13 group 3 fig 5 arrows 3 7 and 8 and group 4 fig 5 arrows 4 5 9 and 10 fig 5 also shows that there is not a common pattern in the diurnal cycle for the sample of the 19 stations however given the variety observed in the diurnal cycles it is worth mentioning certain aspects i for some stations diurnal cycles are unimodal diurnal throughout the year e g fig 5 arrows 7 and 13 ii for others diurnal cycles switch from a unimodal diurnal to bimodal pattern semi diurnal throughout the year e g fig 5 arrows 2 and 18 iii very similar patterns exist between nearby stations e g fig 5 arrows 15 16 and 17 also arrows 4 5 iv the timing of the diurnal maxima is similar for some nearby stations e g fig 5 arrows 16 and 17 in april and september both stations peak at 16 00 lt and 18 00 lt respectively and v a slightly different timing for the diurnal maxima for nearby stations can also occur e g fig 5 arrows 15 and 16 in august the stations peak at 17 00 lt and 15 00 16 00 lt respectively an unexpected degree of similarity in is observed for two distal stations fig 5 arrows 6 and 18 that is in disagreement with the general picture of the nw se geographical orientation for the diurnal cycle groups fig 5 inner panel however these stations still show similarities either in the diurnal pattern alone fig 5 arrow 18 or in both the diurnal and seasonal patterns fig 5 arrow 6 with the medoids of the groups to which the stations belong 3 4 seasonal cycle of precipitation in section 3 3 we showed that the diurnal cycles vary throughout the year and that four groups of dominant diurnal cycles were found to investigate a potential relationship between the diurnal and seasonal cycles we calculated the average seasonal cycles of precipitation for the stations within each group fig 6 additionally the standard deviations for each month were relatively small compared to the mean values this feature indicates that the grouping of the stations based on the diurnal cycle reflects the associated seasonal cycle well keeping in mind the nw se orientation of the groups of diurnal cycles distinct seasonal cycles varying from bimodal fig 6a to unimodal regimes fig 6d were found in the study zone groups 1 and 2 fig 6a b are associated with bimodal regimes with precipitation maxima in the march april period and a during the october november season separated by two minima around the solstices in the july august and december january periods we observed the strongest seasonality in groups 1 and 2 the values are up to seven times higher between the rainiest and driest season however unlike group 1 group 2 shows more constant precipitation during austral summer group 3 fig 6c may also be associated with a bimodal regime however the seasonality of the precipitation is weaker relative maxima can be identified during the march may period and in november and the lowest relative minima occur during the august september and december february periods finally group 4 is unimodal with a rainy season during the may july period with the peak in june in general the seasonal index si values of the seasonal cycles fig 7 do not fit in the seasonal regime as suggested in table 1 since all si values are lower than 0 60 the si values suggest that the seasonality of groups 1 and 2 is rather seasonal with a short drier season this dry season occurs in july august fig 6a b for groups 3 and 4 the seasonality is equable but with a definite wetter season this wetter season occurs in september may fig 6c and march august fig 6d respectively furthermore the median values of the boxplots in fig 7 decrease from group 1 to group 4 which indicates an eastward weakening of the precipitation seasonality towards an equable regime 3 5 contrasting diurnal and seasonal cycles the drier seasons identified for groups 1 and 2 and the wetter seasons for groups 3 and 4 demonstrate contrasting features in the patterns for the diurnal cycles as shown in fig 4 groups 1 and 2 present the same bimodal seasonal cycle and in the drier season july august the diurnal cycles exhibit different behaviour as well as during the wetter seasons in group 1 precipitation is concentrated in the afternoon whereas in group 2 it is concentrated in the morning and night in group 3 during the short dry season from june to august precipitation occurs in the nighttime whereas precipitation is observed in the daytime during the rest of the year in contrast during the wetter season from april to october group 4 is characterized by mostly homogeneous precipitation during the morning and night these findings highlight the complex behaviour of precipitation in the study zone i distinct diurnal concentrations of precipitation are observed in both drier and wetter seasons e g groups 1 2 and 3 and ii there is no marked diurnal cycle throughout the year e g group 4 the detailed diurnal and seasonal cycles of all stations used in this work are provided in the supplementary material figs s 7 s 9 to reconcile the diurnal cycle groups with their spatial distribution altitude and seasonal cycles expressed as monthly precipitation mm month we divided the stations by flank sorting them by altitude fig 8 fig 8a presents flank a and flank b stations ordered by descending altitude varying from 4 012 m a s l station p28 on the cordillera occidental ridge to 1 626 m a s l station c15 the north western most station in the study zone in fig 1b conversely fig 8b shows the stations on the flank b sorted by ascending altitude from 1 886 m a s l station p61 the second northernmost station to 4 148 m a s l station f74 on the cordillera central ridge and fig 8c shows the stations sorted from 4 850 m a s l ore station the highest station in the study zone and the closest one to the antizana glacier to 2 240 m a s l station i14 the south eastern most station fig 8 clearly shows the marked bimodal seasonal cycle from station p28 fig 8a to station f26 fig 8b enclosing the group 1 and group 2 stations in the previously identified nw se variation of both diurnal and seasonal cycles rainfall peaks characterize these stations during the march april and october november seasons and a relatively short dry season july august during austral winter stations f76 fig 8b to i14 fig 8c enclose the group 3 and group 4 stations where the precipitation is better distributed throughout the year and a peak during austral winter is observed in the group 4 stations green labels the situation of group 3 and group 4 in the nw se direction is more heterogeneous than groups 1 and 2 which is explained by the strong spatial gradient that characterizes the andes amazon transition region e g laraque et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009 junquas et al 2018 4 discussion our results refine the assessment of the coherence among the diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation identified by the most recent comparable studies in the tropical andes using precipitation stations poveda et al 2005 bedoya et al 2019 this coherence is clustered in groups of diurnal and seasonal cycles varying spatially in the nw se direction in agreement with the prominent large scale wind direction fig 2 this is the classical picture of orographic precipitation in mountain ranges where the orography and diurnal thermal contrast modulate the regional scale diurnal circulation roe 2005 bendix et al 2006b junquas et al 2018 in addition we identify the concomitant spatial variation of both the diurnal and seasonal cycles of precipitation in the study region which has not yet been reported in previous studies of the equatorial andes these results may slightly vary when using different clustering methods and different measures of dissimilarity while performing pam but the nw se spatial variation remains unaltered 4 1 atmospheric dynamics related to the diurnal and seasonal cycles key findings emerged regarding the diurnal and seasonal patterns and the related local regional scale processes driving precipitation over seasonal time scales our findings are consistent with previous work carried out in ecuador e g laraque et al 2007 ballari et al 2018 tobar and wyseure 2018 ilbay yupa et al 2021 and are in line with the regional circulation fig 2 the identified groups 1 and 2 in the inter andean valley are bimodal with peaks in the march april and october november seasons in addition in groups 1 and 2 the results clearly show a more significant peak in march april than in october november which could be linked to the spatial proximity of the stations in the groups to the pacific coast where a unimodal maximum prevails during austral autumn see the section 2 1 and references therein this behaviour is particularly pronounced for group 1 which includes the most western stations the weak seasonality of group 3 relative peaks observed in march may and november situated more to the east could be explained by a weaker influence of the coastal regime and a greater influence of the bimodal amazonian regime which entersthe eastern cordillera westward through the main river valleys e g campozano et al 2016 2018 tobar and wyseure 2018 whereas these three groups clearly show inter andean valley regimes with different influences of the coastal western and amazonian eastern regimes group 4 shows a very distinctive unimodal regime with a peak in austral winter and maxima in june this regime has been described in the literature as a particularity of some stations on the eastern slope of the andes and valleys connected to the amazonian plains e g laraque et al 2007 where the orographic barrier effect of the andes block strongly the easterlies the blocking effect is more pronounced in austral winter when mid level moist easterly winds are stronger and oriented perpendicular to the cordillera bendix et al 2006a laraque et al 2007 however as has been found in previous studies using data from stations in the eastern ecuadorian cordillera the easterlies influence and the associated blocking process can show strong local variations therefore the seasonal cycle of nearby stations can be affected differently by this process depending on the characteristics of their locations i e slope or aspect which define if they are leeward or windward consequently a bimodal regime is also found on the amazon slope e g fig 5 station marked by arrow 6 due to inter valley locations sheltered from the influence of easterlies campozano et al 2016 this explains the strong spatial gradient in the eastern cordillera characteristic of the andes amazon transition region the spatial variability in the diurnal maxima even in nearby stations seems to be determined by the stations local topography and windward and leeward configurations afternoon precipitation observed in the inter andean valley throughout the year groups 1 and 2 appears to be mainly related to local convection and induced thermal upslope breezes explaining the higher annual precipitation close the cordillera ridges than in the valley nevertheless the nocturnal precipitation of group 1 can be attributed to the advected moisture from the amazon rainforest during seasons march april and october november with high convective activity in the eastern foothills of the andes nocturnal convective systems are more frequent than daytime convective systems campozano et al 2018 the local scale katabatic winds flowing towards the amazon rainforest due to nocturnal divergence over mountains interact with the warm and moist air of the amazon rainforest inducing compressional lifting and causing nocturnal cloud clusters called the andes occurring system aos rain band bendix et al 2006a the dynamics of the aos may explain the nocturnal precipitation at the stations on the amazon slope that partly changes to morning precipitation as the aos are transported eastward to the cordillera this complex interaction of local to regional atmospheric processes in the andes amazon transition zone could be responsible for the nocturnal and morning peaks observed in groups 2 3 and 4 it should be noted that the present study has not examined the inter annual e g enso or intra seasonal variability e g mjo of the diurnal cycle in the colombian andes poveda et al 2005 found that these modes of variability only modulate the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and do not alter its phase nevertheless it is important to bear in mind that the diurnal and seasonal cycles investigated in this six year period could be capturing stationary conditions however they are regular and preserve their periodicity over long term scales poveda et al 2005 espinoza et al 2020 arias et al 2021 the seasonal cycle of precipitation seems to exert an important role in the east west gradient of greening in the zone haro carrión et al 2021 we show that in the eastern part of the andes the seasonal cycle of greening identified by haro carrión et al 2021 is weak as the seasonal cycle of precipitiation in the inter andean valley the seasonal cycle of greening peaking in july august agrees with the short dry season identified in the zone to develop a full picture of the diurnal cycle in the study zone high resolution atmospheric modelling is necessary to accurately investigate the regional to local interactions that control the diurnal cycle quito 2 850 m a s l fig 1a the capital of ecuador with 2 6 million inhabitants depends on a complex infrastructure of water intakes and conductions that transport water from high altitude catchments and the diurnal cycle described in this study could help to better understand hydro glaciological processes and develop new water management strategies 5 conclusions and final remarks this study analysed the spatial variability of diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation in the equatorial andes thanks to a dense network of 80 precipitation stations with hourly data located over an inter andean valley and its transition to the amazon basin over the 2014 2019 period the precipitation network allowed us first to identify an exceptionally strong spatial gradient in precipitation of up to 330 mm yr km using cluster analysis we identified for the first time groups of stations varying spatially in the nw se direction over this region with complex topography which display concomitant diurnal and seasonal variations of precipitation in the western part of the study area the seasonal cycles of groups 1 and 2 are bimodal and typical of equatorial inter andean valleys with precipitation maxima in the march april and october november seasons and one short drier season in july august conversely in the eastern part group 3 presents a weak bimodal seasonal cycle with relative maxima also in march april and october november finally group 4 is unimodal with a maximum in june it is crucial to notice that distinct diurnal cycles are observed in both drier and wetter seasons of groups 1 2 and 3 and no marked diurnal cycle is observed in any part of the year in group 4 furthermore groups 3 and 4 are the most spatially heterogeneous in annual precipitation and diurnal cycles this local scale analysis based on precipitation stations agrees with the diurnal and seasonal regional circulation observed in reanalysis era5 the findings of this work complement those of earlier studies in the tropical andes that analysed diurnal cycle over complex topography the present study lays the groundwork for future research into the atmospheric physical processes linking diurnal and seasonal precipitation cycles that vary spatially over complex topography further studies need to be carried out to validate the hypothesis discussed in this paper since the use of reanalysis data explains the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of moisture partly for instance our results encourage the use of high resolution atmospheric modelling to identify the interaction of local to large scale mechanisms driving the diurnal cycle in the equatorial andes more broadly research is also needed to understand the diurnal cycle along the andes cordillera in tropical south america to identify the role of oceanic pacific and atlantic and land amazonian basin moisture sources involved in diurnal cycle variations the station based data set presented in this study stress the need to preserve and make denser the current monitoring network in order to capture the long term dynamics of the diurnal cycle the insights gained in this study may help to understand the functioning of andean hydro systems the estimation of water budgets in the páramo is currently subject to large uncertainty due to the limited number of precipitation stations the eastern cordillera receives the highest amounts of precipitation and displays a weak seasonal cycle this homogenous precipitation distributed throughout the year emphasises the role of such environments as water suppliers and regulators thus water management planning should be oriented to generate new strategies to cope with possible future changes in the strength of seasonality for instance sub daily scale processes like flash floods or glacier melting could be better characterised using the diurnal cycle of precipitation in a hydroglaciological modelling framework credit

8103,study region northeast china study focus northeast china is an important region for industry and agriculture in china in this region investigations are lacking on the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to the spring maximum runoff discharge and no studies have compared the spring and summer potential flood risks here for the first time in northeast china we investigated the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to spring maximum runoff discharge and compared the spring and summer potential flood risks in terms of their spatial distributions crop production and economic exposures new hydrological insights for the region we find that snow contributes approximately three fourths of spring maximum floods from 1982 to 2011 on average potential economic exposures to the summer and spring floods represent 3 9 and 0 4 of total gdp respectively potentially exposed production of maize rice and soybean to summer floods accounts for approximately 2 8 of the total and potentially exposed wheat production to the spring floods accounts for 0 3 of the total gdp growth amplifies increasing trends of potential economic exposure while changes in potential crop production exposure are dominated by flood variations this study is unique in that snow melt contributions to the spring maximum floods are quantified and that potential gdp and crop production exposure risks to spring and summer floods are quantified and compared for the first time in northeast china keywords snow flood northeast china gdp crop production hydrological risk 1 introduction there are two types of floods in regions with a cold winter and rainy summer because of the cold precipitation in the winter has the potential to fall as snow with the snow melting in the spring causing spring floods in the summer these regions suffer from heavy rainfall which also results in flooding floods northeast china is a region with both spring floods and heavy summer rainfall induced floods yang et al 2020 because northeast china is an important region for industry and has a large area of cropland yang et al 2007 kent et al 2017 xin et al 2020 floods could cause damage to both economic growth and crop production zhang et al 2015 2016 chen et al 2018 2019 fu et al 2018 investigations into the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to spring maximum runoff discharge and comparisons between spring flood disasters and summer heavy rainfall flood disasters are key issues in extreme flood studies in northeast china currently studies on the spring snow melt spring floods and comparisons between spring floods and summer floods remain limited in the region for example tian et al 2018 studied spring snow melt runoff in the second songhua river accounting for only 1 5 of the area of northeast china based on an empirical approach yang et al 2020 studied flood generation mechanisms in northeast china with regards to snow melt influence although previous studies have investigated the snow influence on floods the quantitative analysis of snow melt contribution to the spring maximum runoff discharge is limited let alone the spatial distribution of the spring flood risk in flood risk studies potential flood risk corresponds to the worst scenario in which there is no flood mitigation infrastructure flood risk management aims to reduce and or avoid potential flood risk the spatial distribution of potential flood risk can provide information on the locations that are vulnerable to floods and therefore region specific measures can be deployed to reduce flood risk therefore knowing the potential flood risk is the first step for making strategic flood adaptation measures and evaluating the benefits of deploying flood risk management measures however the spring and summer potential flood risk studies have not been conducted on the entire northeast china here for the first time in northeast china we investigated the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to the spring maximum runoff discharge and compared spring and summer potential flood risks in terms of their spatial distributions crop production and economic i e gross domestic product gdp exposures this study is unique in which the snow melt contribution to spring maximum floods is quantified and that the potential crop production and economic exposures to the spring and summer floods are determined and compared 2 study region datasets and methodology the study region covers an area of 1 2 million km2 fig 1 the water and energy budget based hydrological model with biosphere and improved snow physics web dhm s was used after calibration and validation against discharge in the study by qi et al 2020 web dhm s combined the hydrological model based on geomorphology developed by yang 1998 the simple biosphere scheme sib2 land surface model and a physically based snowmelt module wang et al 2009a 2009b 2009c 2017 shrestha et al 2010 this model has been implemented in numerous studies and has shown good performance qi et al 2015 2016 2018 2019 wang et al 2017 more details about the study region model calibration model validation input data and model parameters used can be found in the study by qi et al 2020 the simulated runoff by web dhm s was used as the input of a 2 dimensional hydraulic model i e cama flood to simulate the water level flood inundation area and inundation area fraction distribution yamazaki et al 2011 2013 methodology regarding economic and crop production exposures to floods and attribution of the exposures to gdp crop production variations and climate variations can be found in the supporting information the gridded gdp datasets are available from 1990 to 2015 kummu et al 2018 which have a spatial resolution of 0 08 degrees crop yield data of maize rice soybean and spring wheat are from the study by iizumi and sakai 2020 and the yield data from 1982 to 2011 are used in this study with a spatial resolution of 0 5 degrees the yield is from census statistics of the united nations and was compiled and published by iizumi and sakai 2020 we regridded the gdp dataset and crop yield data into 0 1 degree cells to match the grids in the flood simulation using the web dhm s and cama flood models in our study region spring refers to march april and may summer starts in june and ends in the middle of september and the annual maximum floods occur in the summer the main growing season for wheat is the spring and exposure to spring floods is calculated only for wheat because reservoirs and dikes were not considered the flood risk and exposures represent potential values in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation in the discharge simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and relative bias are 0 81 and 7 8 respectively qi et al 2020 indicating that the model performance is acceptable the simulation can reasonably replicate the spatial distribution of satellite observed water bodies fig s1 there are many saline lakes in the study regions zhu et al 2020 because saline lakes are not connected with rivers model simulations cannot simulate their spatial distribution however this does not influence potential flood risk analysis due to saline lakes being unable to store spilled river water during flooding satellite observations include reservoir and dike influences the reservoir distribution developed by lehner et al 2011 and messager et al 2016 could not include all reservoirs especially those built in recent years which could contribute to the differences between model simulations and satellite observations in the liao river the maximum flood depth is less than 3 m shown in section 3 3 and flood dikes are usually approximately 1 5 m or 2 0 m the satellite observed flood inundation area is after the flood dike functions and therefore shows a smaller water body area than the model simulation the simulation can reasonably replicate the seasonal variations in water levels fig s2 with r being at least 0 68 in addition the simulation can imitate the average water level well with rb 0 3 the uncertainty in water level simulation may result from river bathymetry uncertainty such as river depth and width river depth is derived based on empirical power low approaches in the cama flood model because there is no observation river width is based on empirical power low estimation combined with satellite observations since satellite observation availability is limited in regions yamazaki et al 2012 2013 the input data especially precipitation could influence the simulation however we have used the best publicly available precipitation in the region qi et al 2016 in addition human activities could change natural river bathometry for example river channels were destroyed in some regions after the 1998 mega flood and then restored by human activities furthermore there are over one hundred reservoirs in northeast china and the model simulation does not consider reservoir operations which may also cause the differences because the liao river is one of the rivers with the strongest human activity influence in china and discharge in this river is largely influenced by human activities liu et al 2018 we did not choose water level gauges in the liao river to validate the model simulation after evaluations with satellite observed water body distribution in situ gauge observed water levels and discharge we considered that the model can reasonably simulate flood changes and their influences therefore the model framework will be used in the following sections to study floods potential crop production and economic exposures to floods 3 2 spring floods the southeast regions have a higher intensity of maximum runoff than the other regions and the middle and southwest regions have lower intensities see fig 2a similarly runoff from snow melt has higher intensity in southeast regions and lower intensity in the middle and southwest regions fig 2b the contribution of the snow runoff to maximum runoff is higher in the western regions than in the southern regions fig 2c the regional average contribution of snow melt runoff to maximum runoff is 76 2 northern and eastern regions have higher discharge than other regions fig 2d and the snow discharge in the southern region is smaller fig 2e the snow discharge contribution to maximum discharge is higher in the western regions and smaller in the southern regions which are similar to the results of snow runoff contribution to maximum runoff fig 2c the regional average contribution of snow melt discharge to maximum discharge is 74 3 the regional average potential flood area fraction of maximum discharge is 0 6 fig 2g and the potential flood depth in the northern eastern and southeast regions is higher than that in the southwestern regions fig 2h overall snow melt contributes approximately three fourths of the spring maximum runoff and discharge and the contribution of snow melt to discharge is higher in the northern and eastern regions than in the southern regions 3 3 summer floods the southern and eastern regions have higher intensity maximum runoff than the western and northern regions see fig 3a which is different from the spatial distribution of the maximum spring flood the maximum discharge in the songhua river is higher than that in the liao river which is similar to the maximum discharge in the spring the middle reach of the songhua river region a and the lower reach of the liao river region b are two concentrated regions with large potential flood areas in region a the two largest tributaries of the songhua river meet in the plain area i e the neijiang river and the second songhua river and therefore cause a large area to be potentially flooded in region b the main reach of the liao river meets the hun river and taizi river and they cause the large potential flooding area together 3 4 temporal changes of the summer and spring floods the summer maximum potential flood area is decreasing fig 4a the decreasing trend resulted from the reduced annual maximum precipitation fig 4c the average annual maximum potential flood area is 33 000 km2 the results also show that the spring maximum potential flood area is increasing fig 4b which is different from the changes in the annual maximum potential flood area the increasing trends may result from the increasing maximum precipitation in the spring fig 4e however the snow runoff ratio is significantly decreasing fig 4d implying that the potential spring flood risk resulting from snow melt is decreasing the average spring potential flood area is 5000 km2 overall the annual maximum potential flood risk is decreasing and the spring potential flood risk is increasing but the contribution from snow melt is decreasing 3 5 crop production exposure to floods the potential exposure to summer floods for maize crops is decreasing in the situations of considering and without considering the increasing maize production fig 5a and fig s4a fig 5b clearly shows that flood variations dominate the potential maize production exposure to summer floods and the maximum contribution from maize production increase was 39 in 2011 similarly potential rice and soybean production exposure to summer floods decreased as well although the total production of rice and soybean increased fig s4b and c these decreases are also due to summer flood variations fig 5d and f in contrast to maize rice and soybean the potential exposure of wheat to spring floods is increasing although total spring wheat production in northeast china is decreasing fig s4d which is due to the intensification of spring floods fig 4b fig 5h also clearly shows that potential spring wheat production exposure to spring floods is dominated by flood variations in most years the multiyear mean potentially exposed production of maize rice and soybean to summer floods are 2 8 2 9 and 2 8 equivalent to 4 6 106 t 5 7 106 t and 1 4 106 t respectively and potential spring wheat production exposure to spring floods is 0 3 equivalent to 4 5 105 t 3 6 economic exposure to floods fig 6 shows the potential economic exposure to summer maximum floods and spring maximum floods and the attribution of the potential exposure to gdp growth and flood variations the potential exposure decreases when only considering climate variations which is the same as the trend of summer maximum potential flood area fig 4a however the overall potential exposure considering both climate variation and enlargement of economic volume is increasing which is different from the trends of the summer maximum potential flood area implying that enlargement of economic volume plays a primary role in the increases of the potential economic exposure the results in fig 6b underpin the contribution of the enlargement of economic volume to the rapidly increasing potential exposure indicating that economic development exacerbates potential economic exposure fig 6c also shows that potential economic exposure to spring floods is increasing when considering both climate variation and gdp growth different from the potential exposure to summer maximum flood the potential exposure to the spring flood is increasing when only considering flood variations which is due to the increasing spring maximum runoff as shown in fig 4d however the slope of the trend in considering both flood variation and gdp growth is much greater than that of only considering flood variations this result indicates that gdp growth plays an important role in the increases in potential economic exposure which is also confirmed by the results in fig 6d the potential economic exposure to spring floods accounts for 0 4 equivalent to 1 8 109 of the total gdp of northeast china on average from 1990 to 2011 and it is 3 9 equivalent to 1 4 1010 for summer floods overall enlargement of economic volume exacerbates the increasing trends of potential economic exposure to both the summer maximum floods and spring maximum floods potential exposure to summer maximum floods is even decreasing when ignoring enlargement of economic volume and spring flood influenced gdp is minor compared to summer flood influence therefore sustainability measures should be taken to develop the economy and reduce the potential flood influence on development at the same time and flood management should focus on summer floods 3 7 discussion the total number of large and moderate reservoirs was 217 in 1988 and 343 in 2008 according to the water resources report of the songliao river water resources commission ministry of water resources the people s republic of china www mwr gov cn english operation rules vary with dams and detailed information on the dam operation rules for flood control is currently not available in addition dike heights vary along river channels and spatially distributed dike height information is also currently not available it is challenging to simulate the influence of such many dams and varying dike heights without detailed information considering the importance of potential flood risk and the limited dam and dike information we studied the potential flood risk in this study fig s3 shows the probability of flooding under various flood depth thresholds the probability is calculated as the ratio of the number of days with flood depths greater than the thresholds to the total number of days the various flood depth thresholds represent potential flood dike heights the probability generally decreases with increasing thresholds when the flood depth threshold is 1 5 m a large area in the songhua river still has potential flooding risk fig s3b because there are 1 5 m or higher flood dikes along the lower reaches of the liao river the satellite observed water area fig s1d is similar to the results of the 1 5 m flood depth threshold in the liao river fig s3d the global surface water occurrence dataset provides multiyear mean values based on satellite data from 1984 to 2018 our simulation is from 1982 to 2011 the differences in the time periods may contribute to the disparity in fig s1 however there is no satellite data product exactly corresponding to the period we investigated in addition the comparison is on a multiyear mean scale 30 years and the influence of time differences should be minor 4 conclusions as an important area for industry and agriculture northeast china suffers from both the spring floods and summer floods in this region investigations are lacking in terms of the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to the spring maximum runoff discharge and no studies have compared spring and summer potential flood risks this study presents important progress in snow melt spring potential flood risk assessment and its comparison with summer potential flood risk in northeast china the following conclusions are presented based on this study first snow melt contributes approximately three fourths of the spring maximum floods the summer potential flood risk decreased from 1982 to 2011 and the spring potential flood risk increased but the proportion resulting from snow melt decreased second potentially exposed food production of maize rice and soybean to summer floods accounts for approximately 2 8 of the total production and potentially exposed wheat production to spring floods accounts for 0 3 of the total changes in potential crop production exposures to summer and spring floods are dominated by variations in floods third gdp growth exacerbates the increasing trends of potential economic exposure to both summer and spring floods and the potential exposure to summer floods is even decreasing when ignoring the enlargement of economic volume the potential economic exposure to summer floods accounts for 3 9 of the total northeast china gdp and it is 0 4 for spring floods credit authorship contribution statement wei qi conceptualization

exposure risks to spring and summer floods are quantified and compared for the first time in northeast china keywords snow flood northeast china gdp crop production hydrological risk 1 introduction there are two types of floods in regions with a cold winter and rainy summer because of the cold precipitation in the winter has the potential to fall as snow with the snow melting in the spring causing spring floods in the summer these regions suffer from heavy rainfall which also results in flooding floods northeast china is a region with both spring floods and heavy summer rainfall induced floods yang et al 2020 because northeast china is an important region for industry and has a large area of cropland yang et al 2007 kent et al 2017 xin et al 2020 floods could cause damage to both economic growth and crop production zhang et al 2015 2016 chen et al 2018 2019 fu et al 2018 investigations into the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to spring maximum runoff discharge and comparisons between spring flood disasters and summer heavy rainfall flood disasters are key issues in extreme flood studies in northeast china currently studies on the spring snow melt spring floods and comparisons between spring floods and summer floods remain limited in the region for example tian et al 2018 studied spring snow melt runoff in the second songhua river accounting for only 1 5 of the area of northeast china based on an empirical approach yang et al 2020 studied flood generation mechanisms in northeast china with regards to snow melt influence although previous studies have investigated the snow influence on floods the quantitative analysis of snow melt contribution to the spring maximum runoff discharge is limited let alone the spatial distribution of the spring flood risk in flood risk studies potential flood risk corresponds to the worst scenario in which there is no flood mitigation infrastructure flood risk management aims to reduce and or avoid potential flood risk the spatial distribution of potential flood risk can provide information on the locations that are vulnerable to floods and therefore region specific measures can be deployed to reduce flood risk therefore knowing the potential flood risk is the first step for making strategic flood adaptation measures and evaluating the benefits of deploying flood risk management measures however the spring and summer potential flood risk studies have not been conducted on the entire northeast china here for the first time in northeast china we investigated the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to the spring maximum runoff discharge and compared spring and summer potential flood risks in terms of their spatial distributions crop production and economic i e gross domestic product gdp exposures this study is unique in which the snow melt contribution to spring maximum floods is quantified and that the potential crop production and economic exposures to the spring and summer floods are determined and compared 2 study region datasets and methodology the study region covers an area of 1 2 million km2 fig 1 the water and energy budget based hydrological model with biosphere and improved snow physics web dhm s was used after calibration and validation against discharge in the study by qi et al 2020 web dhm s combined the hydrological model based on geomorphology developed by yang 1998 the simple biosphere scheme sib2 land surface model and a physically based snowmelt module wang et al 2009a 2009b 2009c 2017 shrestha et al 2010 this model has been implemented in numerous studies and has shown good performance qi et al 2015 2016 2018 2019 wang et al 2017 more details about the study region model calibration model validation input data and model parameters used can be found in the study by qi et al 2020 the simulated runoff by web dhm s was used as the input of a 2 dimensional hydraulic model i e cama flood to simulate the water level flood inundation area and inundation area fraction distribution yamazaki et al 2011 2013 methodology regarding economic and crop production exposures to floods and attribution of the exposures to gdp crop production variations and climate variations can be found in the supporting information the gridded gdp datasets are available from 1990 to 2015 kummu et al 2018 which have a spatial resolution of 0 08 degrees crop yield data of maize rice soybean and spring wheat are from the study by iizumi and sakai 2020 and the yield data from 1982 to 2011 are used in this study with a spatial resolution of 0 5 degrees the yield is from census statistics of the united nations and was compiled and published by iizumi and sakai 2020 we regridded the gdp dataset and crop yield data into 0 1 degree cells to match the grids in the flood simulation using the web dhm s and cama flood models in our study region spring refers to march april and may summer starts in june and ends in the middle of september and the annual maximum floods occur in the summer the main growing season for wheat is the spring and exposure to spring floods is calculated only for wheat because reservoirs and dikes were not considered the flood risk and exposures represent potential values in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation in the discharge simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and relative bias are 0 81 and 7 8 respectively qi et al 2020 indicating that the model performance is acceptable the simulation can reasonably replicate the spatial distribution of satellite observed water bodies fig s1 there are many saline lakes in the study regions zhu et al 2020 because saline lakes are not connected with rivers model simulations cannot simulate their spatial distribution however this does not influence potential flood risk analysis due to saline lakes being unable to store spilled river water during flooding satellite observations include reservoir and dike influences the reservoir distribution developed by lehner et al 2011 and messager et al 2016 could not include all reservoirs especially those built in recent years which could contribute to the differences between model simulations and satellite observations in the liao river the maximum flood depth is less than 3 m shown in section 3 3 and flood dikes are usually approximately 1 5 m or 2 0 m the satellite observed flood inundation area is after the flood dike functions and therefore shows a smaller water body area than the model simulation the simulation can reasonably replicate the seasonal variations in water levels fig s2 with r being at least 0 68 in addition the simulation can imitate the average water level well with rb 0 3 the uncertainty in water level simulation may result from river bathymetry uncertainty such as river depth and width river depth is derived based on empirical power low approaches in the cama flood model because there is no observation river width is based on empirical power low estimation combined with satellite observations since satellite observation availability is limited in regions yamazaki et al 2012 2013 the input data especially precipitation could influence the simulation however we have used the best publicly available precipitation in the region qi et al 2016 in addition human activities could change natural river bathometry for example river channels were destroyed in some regions after the 1998 mega flood and then restored by human activities furthermore there are over one hundred reservoirs in northeast china and the model simulation does not consider reservoir operations which may also cause the differences because the liao river is one of the rivers with the strongest human activity influence in china and discharge in this river is largely influenced by human activities liu et al 2018 we did not choose water level gauges in the liao river to validate the model simulation after evaluations with satellite observed water body distribution in situ gauge observed water levels and discharge we considered that the model can reasonably simulate flood changes and their influences therefore the model framework will be used in the following sections to study floods potential crop production and economic exposures to floods 3 2 spring floods the southeast regions have a higher intensity of maximum runoff than the other regions and the middle and southwest regions have lower intensities see fig 2a similarly runoff from snow melt has higher intensity in southeast regions and lower intensity in the middle and southwest regions fig 2b the contribution of the snow runoff to maximum runoff is higher in the western regions than in the southern regions fig 2c the regional average contribution of snow melt runoff to maximum runoff is 76 2 northern and eastern regions have higher discharge than other regions fig 2d and the snow discharge in the southern region is smaller fig 2e the snow discharge contribution to maximum discharge is higher in the western regions and smaller in the southern regions which are similar to the results of snow runoff contribution to maximum runoff fig 2c the regional average contribution of snow melt discharge to maximum discharge is 74 3 the regional average potential flood area fraction of maximum discharge is 0 6 fig 2g and the potential flood depth in the northern eastern and southeast regions is higher than that in the southwestern regions fig 2h overall snow melt contributes approximately three fourths of the spring maximum runoff and discharge and the contribution of snow melt to discharge is higher in the northern and eastern regions than in the southern regions 3 3 summer floods the southern and eastern regions have higher intensity maximum runoff than the western and northern regions see fig 3a which is different from the spatial distribution of the maximum spring flood the maximum discharge in the songhua river is higher than that in the liao river which is similar to the maximum discharge in the spring the middle reach of the songhua river region a and the lower reach of the liao river region b are two concentrated regions with large potential flood areas in region a the two largest tributaries of the songhua river meet in the plain area i e the neijiang river and the second songhua river and therefore cause a large area to be potentially flooded in region b the main reach of the liao river meets the hun river and taizi river and they cause the large potential flooding area together 3 4 temporal changes of the summer and spring floods the summer maximum potential flood area is decreasing fig 4a the decreasing trend resulted from the reduced annual maximum precipitation fig 4c the average annual maximum potential flood area is 33 000 km2 the results also show that the spring maximum potential flood area is increasing fig 4b which is different from the changes in the annual maximum potential flood area the increasing trends may result from the increasing maximum precipitation in the spring fig 4e however the snow runoff ratio is significantly decreasing fig 4d implying that the potential spring flood risk resulting from snow melt is decreasing the average spring potential flood area is 5000 km2 overall the annual maximum potential flood risk is decreasing and the spring potential flood risk is increasing but the contribution from snow melt is decreasing 3 5 crop production exposure to floods the potential exposure to summer floods for maize crops is decreasing in the situations of considering and without considering the increasing maize production fig 5a and fig s4a fig 5b clearly shows that flood variations dominate the potential maize production exposure to summer floods and the maximum contribution from maize production increase was 39 in 2011 similarly potential rice and soybean production exposure to summer floods decreased as well although the total production of rice and soybean increased fig s4b and c these decreases are also due to summer flood variations fig 5d and f in contrast to maize rice and soybean the potential exposure of wheat to spring floods is increasing although total spring wheat production in northeast china is decreasing fig s4d which is due to the intensification of spring floods fig 4b fig 5h also clearly shows that potential spring wheat production exposure to spring floods is dominated by flood variations in most years the multiyear mean potentially exposed production of maize rice and soybean to summer floods are 2 8 2 9 and 2 8 equivalent to 4 6 106 t 5 7 106 t and 1 4 106 t respectively and potential spring wheat production exposure to spring floods is 0 3 equivalent to 4 5 105 t 3 6 economic exposure to floods fig 6 shows the potential economic exposure to summer maximum floods and spring maximum floods and the attribution of the potential exposure to gdp growth and flood variations the potential exposure decreases when only considering climate variations which is the same as the trend of summer maximum potential flood area fig 4a however the overall potential exposure considering both climate variation and enlargement of economic volume is increasing which is different from the trends of the summer maximum potential flood area implying that enlargement of economic volume plays a primary role in the increases of the potential economic exposure the results in fig 6b underpin the contribution of the enlargement of economic volume to the rapidly increasing potential exposure indicating that economic development exacerbates potential economic exposure fig 6c also shows that potential economic exposure to spring floods is increasing when considering both climate variation and gdp growth different from the potential exposure to summer maximum flood the potential exposure to the spring flood is increasing when only considering flood variations which is due to the increasing spring maximum runoff as shown in fig 4d however the slope of the trend in considering both flood variation and gdp growth is much greater than that of only considering flood variations this result indicates that gdp growth plays an important role in the increases in potential economic exposure which is also confirmed by the results in fig 6d the potential economic exposure to spring floods accounts for 0 4 equivalent to 1 8 109 of the total gdp of northeast china on average from 1990 to 2011 and it is 3 9 equivalent to 1 4 1010 for summer floods overall enlargement of economic volume exacerbates the increasing trends of potential economic exposure to both the summer maximum floods and spring maximum floods potential exposure to summer maximum floods is even decreasing when ignoring enlargement of economic volume and spring flood influenced gdp is minor compared to summer flood influence therefore sustainability measures should be taken to develop the economy and reduce the potential flood influence on development at the same time and flood management should focus on summer floods 3 7 discussion the total number of large and moderate reservoirs was 217 in 1988 and 343 in 2008 according to the water resources report of the songliao river water resources commission ministry of water resources the people s republic of china www mwr gov cn english operation rules vary with dams and detailed information on the dam operation rules for flood control is currently not available in addition dike heights vary along river channels and spatially distributed dike height information is also currently not available it is challenging to simulate the influence of such many dams and varying dike heights without detailed information considering the importance of potential flood risk and the limited dam and dike information we studied the potential flood risk in this study fig s3 shows the probability of flooding under various flood depth thresholds the probability is calculated as the ratio of the number of days with flood depths greater than the thresholds to the total number of days the various flood depth thresholds represent potential flood dike heights the probability generally decreases with increasing thresholds when the flood depth threshold is 1 5 m a large area in the songhua river still has potential flooding risk fig s3b because there are 1 5 m or higher flood dikes along the lower reaches of the liao river the satellite observed water area fig s1d is similar to the results of the 1 5 m flood depth threshold in the liao river fig s3d the global surface water occurrence dataset provides multiyear mean values based on satellite data from 1984 to 2018 our simulation is from 1982 to 2011 the differences in the time periods may contribute to the disparity in fig s1 however there is no satellite data product exactly corresponding to the period we investigated in addition the comparison is on a multiyear mean scale 30 years and the influence of time differences should be minor 4 conclusions as an important area for industry and agriculture northeast china suffers from both the spring floods and summer floods in this region investigations are lacking in terms of the spatial distribution of snow melt contributions to the spring maximum runoff discharge and no studies have compared spring and summer potential flood risks this study presents important progress in snow melt spring potential flood risk assessment and its comparison with summer potential flood risk in northeast china the following conclusions are presented based on this study first snow melt contributes approximately three fourths of the spring maximum floods the summer potential flood risk decreased from 1982 to 2011 and the spring potential flood risk increased but the proportion resulting from snow melt decreased second potentially exposed food production of maize rice and soybean to summer floods accounts for approximately 2 8 of the total production and potentially exposed wheat production to spring floods accounts for 0 3 of the total changes in potential crop production exposures to summer and spring floods are dominated by variations in floods third gdp growth exacerbates the increasing trends of potential economic exposure to both summer and spring floods and the potential exposure to summer floods is even decreasing when ignoring the enlargement of economic volume the potential economic exposure to summer floods accounts for 3 9 of the total northeast china gdp and it is 0 4 for spring floods credit authorship contribution statement wei qi conceptualization

8104,study region taiwan study focus the precipitation in taiwan demonstrates clear diurnal variations this study evaluated the performance of four near real time nrt multiple satellite precipitation products mspps from the global precipitation measurement gpm mission in depicting the variation in diurnal precipitation from 2017 to 2020 in may to september mjjas the four mspps include the v06 of integrated multi satellite retrievals for the gpm early run imerg e and late run imerg l and the v07 of global satellite mapping of precipitation nrt gsmap n and gauge nrt gsmap gn two sub components of diurnal precipitation variation were evaluated daily mean pm and anomalies δp δp was further separated into diurnal s1 and semidiurnal s2 harmonic modes new hydrological insights for the region compared with surface observations results show that all nrt mspps underestimate pm and δp but the imerg products are better than gsmap products in most of the examined spatial characteristics temporally only imerg e depicts the phase evolution of both s1 and s2 similar to surface observations these findings indicate that imerg e is the best nrt product for studying the diurnal precipitation characteristics across mjjas in taiwan the general bias in the nrt mspps considered in the study in depicting the features examined was attributed to the limitation of passive microwave sensors in illustrating the developing and dissipating stage of diurnal precipitation formation and to the weakness of infrared precipitation algorithms in detecting warm orographic clouds graphical abstract ga1 keywords complex terrain diurnal precipitation satellite precipitation east asia 1 introduction multiple satellite precipitation products mspps are an important resource for studying variations in global and regional precipitation the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm was launched in november 1997 to help understand tropical precipitation variations within the water cycle huffman et al 2007 in february 2014 the global precipitation measurement gpm core satellite was launched hou et al 2014 and new gpm products were developed to continue providing global precipitation observations after completion of the trmm currently there are two main data sources for gpm based mspps the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2020 provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 provided by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa compared with trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa gpm based mspps have higher spatiotemporal resolution and improved algorithms kubota et al 2007 huffman et al 2020 thus it is generally expected that gpm based mspps might provide more reliable precipitation estimates for research however this expectation requires many validation efforts notably tmpa is a legacy product that is not being extended therefore this study focused on the current gpm based mspps as all the gpm based mspps incorporate trmm as the calibrator to provide a data record that extends well before the initiation of gpm the trmm record is not lost in imerg and gsmap both imerg and gsmap provide near real time nrt products and post real time prt products depending on the time latency imerg has two nrt products early and late runs herein referred as imerg e and imerg l respectively and one prt product final run herein referred as imerg f huffman et al 2020 the release of imerg e and imerg l is delayed 4 h and 14 h after the observation time respectively table 1 in contrast the release of imerg f is delayed by 3 5 months because its production requires adjustment based on monthly gauge data huffman et al 2020 although each of the three runs of imerg products might perform best in depicting the precipitation variation over different regions o et al 2017 tang et al 2020 huang et al 2021a nasa has advised researchers to use imerg f for most research purposes https gpm nasa gov data directory following this suggestion many studies have focused on assessing imerg f precipitation estimates over various regions wang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 o and kirstetter 2018 navarro et al 2019 huang et al 2020 moazami and najafi 2021 for example huang et al 2018 2020 assessed the performance of imerg f in depicting the precipitation variation over taiwan an island of approximately 36 000 km2 and complex orography features fig 1 and noted that imerg f showed better depiction of the monthly daily and diurnal precipitation variation in taiwan during the warm seasons compared to those during the cold seasons however it is necessary to use nrt products when examining the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation formation prior to the release of prt products thus it is also important to determine the capability of imerg e and imerg l in depicting precipitation variations over various regions o et al 2017 ma et al 2020 huang et al 2021a in contrast to imerg gsmap has two prt products gsmap mvk and gsmap gauge herein referred as gsmap m and gsmap g respectively with a 3 day latency and two nrt products gsmap nrt and gsmap gauge nrt herein referred as gsmap n and gsmap gn respectively with a 4 h latency kubota et al 2020 most studies evaluating the ability of gsmap products have mainly focused on the assessment of prt products across various regions tian et al 2010 prakash et al 2015 hur et al 2016 setiawati and miura 2016 setiyoko et al 2019 trinh tuan et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in addition some studies have compared the differences between the prt products of imerg and gsmap reddy et al 2019 salles et al 2019 huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 for taiwan huang et al 2020 compared the gpm based prt products including imerg f and gsmap g in depicting the summer diurnal precipitation formation and found that imerg f outperforms gsmap g in both estimations of quantitative precipitation and depiction of phase evolution however to the best of our knowledge it is unclear whether this conclusion is also valid when juxtaposing gpm based nrt products including imerg e imerg l gsmap n and gsmap gn in depicting the diurnal precipitation formation over taiwan notably as documented in supplementary table s1 the monthly and daily means of gpm based mspps for both prt and nrt products over taiwan have been examined in our previous studies huang et al 2018 2021a 2021b further the diurnal variation of gpm based prt products has also been examined huang et al 2020 in contrast from previous studies huang et al 2018 2020 2021a 2021b this study aimed to examine precipitation variation on the hourly time scale to compare the nrt products of imerg and gsmap in particular we focused on the active months for the variation in diurnal precipitation in taiwan identified later in fig 2 formation of diurnal precipitation has been commonly observed over taiwan chen et al 1999 chen and chen 2003 kerns et al 2010 huang and wang 2014 huang and chang 2018 sometimes extreme diurnal precipitation formation can lead to local flooding events lin et al 2011 because nrt mspps are an important source for quickly examining the characteristics and causes of diurnal precipitation formation over taiwan related assessments are necessary prior to conducting further research the objective of this study is not to identify new precipitation features from surface observations but to use the well known surface precipitation features as a reference base to evaluate the unknown performance of gpm based nrt mspps the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the data and methodology are described in section 2 section 3 presents our results on diurnal precipitation evaluation the causes of the mspp bias in depicting diurnal precipitation are discussed in section 4 followed by the conclusions in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 precipitation data this study examined four gpm based nrt mspps imerg e imerg l gsmap n and gsmap gn from the latest versions of imerg v06 and gsmap v07 the information regarding the spatiotemporal resolution and available time periods of these mspps is presented in table 1 the analyses focused on the overlapping data periods from april 2017 to september 2020 for comparison the half hourly resolutions of imerg e and imerg l were accumulated to produce hourly resolution data as described by huang et al 2018 we used the gridded surface observed precipitation data generated from 436 rain gauges provided by the taiwan central weather bureau herein referred as cwb data as a reference for comparison the resolution of cwb data was 0 1 0 1 in spatial and hourly temporal intervals table 1 the detailed information on imerg v06 can be found in tan et al 2019 and huffman et al 2020 in general the production procedures of imerg products included the following steps 1 the goddard profiling algorithm gprof kummerow et al 2015 was used to obtain precipitation from passive microwave pmw sensors then calibrated by the gpm combined precipitation estimates derived from the gpm microwave imager gmi and the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr 2 the precipitation estimates were then applied to the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud cluster system persiann ccs algorithm hong et al 2004 nguyen et al 2018 with calibration using the merged pmw 3 the precipitation estimates were propagated based on vertically integrated vapor from numerical modeling and 4 the kalman filter approach was applied joyce and xie 2011 in v06 both imerg e and imerg l used forecast fields from the goddard earth observing system forward processing geos fp forecast product to derive motion vectors tan et al 2019 however imerg e only applied forward propagation across time whereas imerg l used both forward and backward propagation across time huffman et al 2020 the detailed information on gsmap v07 can be found in mega et al 2019 and kubota et al 2020 the production procedures of gsmap v07 generally comprised the following steps 1 the precipitation estimates were derived from brightness temperatures of the pmw sensors in which intercalibrated to the gpm combined radar radiometer precipitation estimates kubota et al 2020 2 the combined precipitation estimates were only propagated forward in time using the atmospheric moving vector derived from infrared ir data and 3 the kalman filter approach was applied to refine the prediction based on the relationship between the ir brightness temperature and surface rain rate ushio et al 2009 kubota et al 2020 among gsmap nrt mspps gsmap n was adjusted using a system model with parameters calculated from gsmap g data over the past 30 days to produce gsmap gn mega et al 2019 kubota et al 2020 tashima et al 2020 the difference between gsmap nrt mspps is that the adjustment of gsmap gn applied over land and the precipitation rate estimated over the ocean using gsmap gn is the same as that estimated using gsmap n 2 2 methods in this study all analysis was done on hourly 0 1 0 1 grids for comparison between cwb and a selected satellite precipitation product spp the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 cc i 1 n spp i sppm cwb i cwbm i 1 n spp i sppm 2 i 1 n cwb i cwbm 2 2 rmse i 1 n spp i cwb i 2 n 1 where n is the sample size cwbm sppm represents the mean of all sample sizes of cwb spp and cwbi sppi represents the precipitation estimates for a specific sample of cwb spp both the temporal correlation coefficient tcorr and spatial correlation coefficient scorr were calculated for later analyses for tcorr the mean status cwbm and sppm in eq 1 is determined over time for a selected period e g a month or season for scorr the mean status cwbm and sppm in eq 1 is determined over the spatial domain for all spatial grids within the domain the perfect value for tcorr and scorr is 1 and a higher value implies a higher similarity between the cwb and selected spp the rmse was calculated to quantify the difference between the magnitude of the cwb and selected spp the perfect value for rmse is 0 and a lower value suggests a smaller bias of the selected spp to make the evaluation as complete as possible we separated the diurnal precipitation variation into two parts daily mean pm and anomalies δp as in eq 3 3 p pm p for eq 3 the mean status is determined over time for a selected period e g a month or season comparisons between cwb and the four nrt mspps were performed for pm and δp this method has been adopted in many previous studies to better illustrate the diurnal precipitation features sato et al 2009 huang et al 2013 chen et al 2018 previous studies have commonly separated the variability of p into diurnal s1 p and semidiurnal s2 p harmonic components to examine the diurnal precipitation variation in detail dai 2001 o and kirstetter 2018 for example o and kirstetter 2018 evaluated the performance of imerg f in capturing diurnal s1 p and semidiurnal s2 p variations of δp across the united states us in this study we adopted this classic analysis scheme and examined the performance of nrt mspps in depicting the spatiotemporal variation of s1 p and s2 p across taiwan s1 p and s2 p were obtained from the first and second harmonic modes of the fourier analysis respectively storch and zwiers 1999 the percentages of s1 p and s2 p for explaining the variance of s1 p s2 p were calculated using equation 4 4 percentage variance of s 1 or s 2 variance of s 1 variance of s 2 100 hereafter all analyses are presented in taiwan local time lt which is the universal time utc 8 h unless otherwise noted the climatological fields were obtained from the averaged values during the study period from april 2017 to september 2020 3 results 3 1 area averaged precipitation features prior to judging the performance of mspps the frequently examined observational features from the cwb data that serve as the reference base are first illustrated to help explain why the period of may to september mjjas but not a whole year is the focus of this study fig 2a shows the annual evolution of the climatological hourly precipitation area averaged over taiwan as estimated from the cwb data visually a diurnal precipitation maximum occurs in the late afternoon around 16 17 lt during mjjas e g huang et al 2018 by separating the hourly precipitation into the daily mean pm gray bar in fig 2b and anomalies p fig 2c we noted that may to october showed larger amounts of pm whereas larger values of variability in p fig 2b red bar appeared mainly during mjjas temporally the evolution of p in fig 2c seems to be separated into two different groups one is mainly dominated by a maximum minimum peak within 24 h during mjjas and the other is mainly dominated by two maximum minimum peaks within 24 h from october to april similar observational features were also noted in our previous studies huang et al 2018 2021a 2021b but with different periods of data studied many studies have examined in diurnal precipitation variation haile et al 2013 pfeifroth et al 2016 o and kirstetter 2018 it is very important to identify whether the data studied e g satellite precipitation products model simulation data etc can represent the phase of depicting the time of the diurnal precipitation maximum therefore using the well known observational features shown in fig 2 we evaluated the unknown performance of gpm based nrt mspps the performance of the four nrt mspps in depicting the above reference features is shown in fig 3 similar to cwb fig 2a all mspps captured the hourly precipitation maximum occurring around 16 17 lt during mjjas fig 3a from january to april fig 3a gsmap n and gsmap gn seemed to be dominated by two maximum minimum peaks within 24 h but this feature was not observed in imerg e and imerg l these similarities and differences among mspps were more clearly observed in terms of p fig 3b the diurnal evolution of p depicted by all mspps fig 3b was similar to that of cwb fig 2c during mjjas compared to that during other months we also tested an analysis using daily data smoothed with a 30 day moving average window as shown in supplementary fig s1 the signal of the diurnal precipitation maximum occurring at 16 17 lt is the same as the monthly data this suggests that the feature is robust and independent of the examined timescale monthly or daily as for the pm area averaged over taiwan fig 3c all mspps can depict the annual cycle with two peaks occurring in june and august similar to cwb e g hsu et al 2021 however relative to cwb all mspps tended to underestimate the pm in most months similar findings have been reported by huang et al 2018 2020 2021a 2021b but with different time periods and not all the four nrt mspps together as in fig 3c the statistical values for comparing the time series of pm in fig 3c are listed in table 2 compared with cwb all mspps have a tcorr of pm 0 9 which is significant at the 95 confidence interval suggesting a good ability to qualitatively depict the annual evolution of area averaged pm across taiwan as for the rmse of pm the value is the smallest for gsmap n whereas the other three mspps show a similar performance fig 3d shows the hourly p variability estimated from fig 3b for each specific month similar to cwb all mspps depict that the variability in hourly p is larger in mjjas than in other months considering that this study focused on the active months of hourly precipitation variation the remaining analyses were performed only for mjjas from 2017 to 2020 fig 4a shows the tcorr for comparing the hourly p of cwb fig 2c and mspps fig 3b during a day and for each individual month of mjjas even though all mspps have a value of tcorr 0 8 which is significant at a 95 confidence interval imerg e performs the best with a higher tcorr fig 4a as well as a smaller rmse fig 4b during most of the examined months however this finding is different from that revealed by pm fig 3c showing that gsmap n performs better than other mspps in estimating quantitative precipitation during mjjas this difference is further discussed in section 3 2 the variation of the hourly p area averaged over taiwan can be mostly explained by its related combination of diurnal and semidiurnal modes herein s1 p s2 p e g huang et al 2018 consistent with the report by huang et al 2018 we noted from cwb fig 5a that the variation of p is close to s1 p s2 p which also demonstrated a major maximum in the late afternoon and a minor maximum in the early morning however while huang et al 2018 used this feature to evaluate the performance of a prt data we used this feature to examine the performance of nrt mspps comparing fig 5a and fig 5b the appearance of the afternoon maximum of s1 p s2 p was markedly dominated by the maximum of s1 p with contributions by the maximum of s2 p at around 16 17 lt in contrast the appearance of the early morning minor maximum of s1 p s2 p was mainly dominated by the maximum of s2 p at around 04 05 lt similarly huang and chan 2012 examined the p changes over south china near taiwan and concluded that the late afternoon maximum of p was mostly dominated by the s1 p mode whereas the early morning minor peak of p was mainly dominated by the s2 p mode fig 5c shows the comparison between cwb and the four nrt mspps for the temporal evolution of the s1 p area averaged over taiwan and averaged during 2017 2020 mjjas for comparison the timing of occurrence for the observed s1 p maximum of cwb at 15 16 lt is highlighted using a yellow bar overall most mspps show a phase evolution of s1 p similar to cwb however imerg l seems to shift the maximum minimum timing by approximately 1 h earlier than that of the cwb for s2 p fig 5d only imerg e successfully captured the phase similar to cwb occurrence timing of cwb s maximum values highlighted by yellow bars in contrast relative to cwb the two gsmap products showed delayed maximum peaks whereas imerg l showed advanced maximum peaks for s2 p together these results indicate that imerg e has the best performance among mspps in capturing the temporal evolution of s1 p s2 p fig 6 indeed by calculating the tcorr and rmse between cwb and mspps in fig 6 the statistical results table 3 show that imerg e has the largest tcorr and smallest rmse confirming its better performance over other mspps the possible causes for bias in mspps depicting the phase evolution of s1 p and s2 p are discussed in section 4 fig 6 also shows that imerg products are better than gsmap products in capturing the early morning minor peak but only imerg e captures the right phase of s2 p fig 5d this might be partly attributable to the relatively better performance of imerg products compared to gsmap products in depicting the contribution of s1 p and s2 p respectively to the variability in s1 p s2 p to confirm this hypothesis we calculated the percentage of variability in s1 p s2 p explained by s1 p and s2 p respectively using equation 4 as shown in table 4 when compared to cwb gsmap products have a clear bias in underestimating the contribution of s2 p to s1 p s2 p this could lead to gsmap products being less capable of depicting the early morning maximum of s1 p s2 p fig 6 among the four nrt mspps imerg e had less bias in determining the respective contribution of s1 p and s2 p to s1 p s2 p table 4 likely leading to its better ability to represent the phase evolution of s1 p s2 p fig 6 and table 3 3 2 spatial features thus far this study has focused on area averaged values to clarify the spatial differences we constructed a climatological averaged during 2017 2020 mjjas horizontal distribution for the occurrence time of the s1 p maximum during a day fig 7a dotted areas representing the phase difference between mspps and cwb are greater than one hour overall cwb depicts the s1 p maximum occurring during 14 18 lt in most of taiwan with a time lagged feature that shows that the s1 p maximum occurred earlier in the west than in the central region which is earlier than that in the east e g huang et al 2018 compared with cwb all mspps can represent the s1 p maximum appearing during 14 18 lt over most of taiwan but these are incapable of showing the aforementioned time lagged relationship consistent with fig 5c imerg l shows greater bias i e more dot areas compared to other mspps in depicting the temporal phase of s1 p especially across eastern taiwan where imerg l peaks earlier than cwb for s2 p fig 7b cwb depicts the maximum value that occurred during 04 06 lt and 16 18 lt across most of taiwan with the timing over coastal areas being slightly later than that in the mountainous areas imerg e shows the s2 p phase distribution closest to the cwb i e with less dotted region whereas imerg l performs slightly better than gsmap products with more dotted regions as shown in fig 5d the shifting of the s2 p phase differs between the imerg l and gsmap products which is in accordance with fig 7b showing that imerg l has more errors in capturing the s2 p phase across eastern taiwan earlier than cwb whereas gsmap products have more errors in capturing the s2 p phase across western taiwan later than cwb the related grid to grid tcorr between mspps and cwb for the time series of s1 p s2 p fig 6 is further constructed in fig 7c because of its better ability to capture s1 p fig 7a and s2 p fig 7b imerg e also has a higher value of tcorr for s1 p s2 p across most of taiwan fig 7c next we compared the spatial distribution for the variability in s1 p fig 8a and s2 p fig 8b estimated from cwb and mspps during 2017 2020 mjjas as shown in fig 8a the s1 p variability in cwb is larger over the western mountain slope where the windward side of the summer monsoon flows e g chen and chen 2003 relative to cwb the maximum s1 p variability in imerg products shifted slightly to the north whereas the maximum s1 p variability in gsmap products shifted to the west a similar feature is also shown in fig 8b which shows that imerg products are more capable than gsmap products in capturing the spatial distribution of s2 p variability as in cwb the evidence supporting this finding is provided in table 5 which shows higher smaller values of scorr for the comparison between imerg gsmap products and cwb in fig 8a b with better performance in both s1 p and s2 p imerg products have less bias than gsmap products in illustrating the spatial distribution of the variability in s1 p s2 p fig 8c and the bias in imerg e is slightly smaller than that in imerg l the spatial distribution of pm estimated by cwb and mspps averaged during 2017 2020 mjjas was also examined fig 9a although all mspps captured the maximum pm appearing over southern taiwan the patterns of imerg products with scorr 0 8 were more similar to cwb table 6 among mspps gsmap n was the worst with the smallest value of scorr in illustrating the spatial distribution of pm this differed from the earlier conclusion that gsmap n is the best product for estimating the area averaged value of pm fig 3c to further clarify this finding the spatial differences between the pm values of the mspps and cwb are plotted in fig 9b quantitatively all mspps underestimated the pm over mountainous regions however over the lower elevations gsmap n showed a more noticeable overestimation of pm as a result of cancellation between overestimation and underestimation gsmap n showed smaller errors in depicting the pm area averaged over taiwan table 6 the scatter diagram of the original hourly precipitation p pm p for comparing the mspps and cwb over taiwan during 2017 2020 mjjas was further examined fig 10 gsmap n fig 10a has systematic errors in overestimating weaker precipitation events spread in the top left but underestimating stronger precipitation events unlike gsmap n gsmap gn fig 10b has a criterion of maximum hourly precipitation equal to approximately 30 mm h 1 in fact through personal communication with a gsmap gn production team member dr takuji kubota in 2021 we understood that this was their first version of the gsmap gn method due to which they have adopted conservative limits such as 30 mm h 1 therefore gsmap gn underestimated the heavy precipitation events observed by cwb 30 mm h 1 explaining why the value of pm in gsmap gn is smaller than that in gsmap n fig 9a however from the related statistical values of cc and rmse given in fig 10a b we noted that gsmap gn with larger cc and smaller rmse is better than gsmap n in the quantitative estimation of hourly precipitation across taiwan unlike gsmap products the scatter diagram distributions in imerg e fig 10c and imerg l fig 10d are more similar and no clear limitation of the maximum value is found in imerg products further examination of cc and rmse suggested that imerg products with larger cc and smaller rmse are better than gsmap products with imerg e cc 0 52 rmse 1 79 mm h 1 being slightly better than imerg l cc 0 51 rmse 1 80 mm h 1 in summary all analyzed features suggest that imerg e outperforms the other three nrt mspps in depicting the hourly precipitation variation over taiwan 4 possible explanations for the performance of gpm based nrt mspps from fig 7a we noted that not all gpm based nrt mspps can capture the time lagged feature of s1 p as observed by the cwb note that the short interval daily and sub daily performance is driven by the sequence of satellite estimates the additional calibration in the prt is really at the monthly time scale and mostly just shows up as a bias adjustment in the short interval data considering that the bias in the nrt mspps might be reflected in the prt mspps for the short interval data we attempted to look for possible explanations of this common bias for gpm based nrt mspps from o and kirstetter 2018 who evaluated the performance of imerg f a prt product in representing the phase of s1 p over the us similar to fig 7a o and kirstetter 2018 found that relative to surface observations imerg f estimated that precipitation appeared late on the west side but early on the east side of central us they concluded that this bias was mainly caused by the inability of imerg f to represent the developing and dissipating stages of mesoscale convective systems mcs in general the mcs developed in the west matured in the middle and decayed in the east of central us during the developing and dissipating stages different phases of water ice particles liquid droplets and water vapor exist in clouds these are called mixed phase cloud systems in contrast during the mature stage ice particles constitute the main phase of water in clouds as the detection of precipitation in imerg including nrt and prt products uses pmw sensors which are mostly sensitive to ice particles from the mature stage of mcs imerg f does not represent the right timing of maximum precipitation occurring in mixed phase cloud systems over the west and east sides of central us o and kirstetter 2018 this bias in the imerg f i e prt product may also explain the bias of imerg e and imerg l i e nrt products in depicting the timing of s1 p over the western and eastern coastal regions of taiwan notably the gsmap also used pmw for precipitation detection therefore a similar bias in peaking precipitation late in western taiwan but early in eastern taiwan was also noted in gsmap n and gsmap gn moreover this bias is revealed in s1 p fig 7a as well as in s2 p fig 7b yamamoto et al 2008 also found that the differences in peak time precipitation from satellite sensors are related to the evolution of convection precipitation from these discussions we suggest that both imerg and gsmap need to further improve satellite precipitation retrieval from the process of cloud microphysics to better detect the phase evolution of s1 p and s2 p in the nrt products moreover as shown in fig 10b gsmap gn has a cut off maximum hourly precipitation of approximately 30 mm h 1 which led to greater underestimation of the quantitative pm estimation in gsmap gn than in gsmap n table 6 therefore we suggest that adjusting the precipitation threshold from 30 mm h 1 to a higher value depending on the topography might help improve the quantitative estimation of gsmap gn for hourly precipitation over taiwan in fact through personal communication with a gsmap gn production team member dr takuji kubota in 2021 we understood that in their development of the next version they are conducting a trade off study among 30 mm h 1 50 mm h 1 100 mm h 1 and 200 mm h 1 as the upper limit more details will be reported in the future additionally for why gpm based nrt mspps tending to quantitatively underestimate the pm over mountainous areas we suggest the following possible explanations 1 the brightness temperature of warm orographic clouds is not trained well by the ir precipitation algorithms e g bitew and gebremichael 2010 maggioni et al 2016 sun et al 2018 wang and yong 2020 and 2 in orographic conditions the ice signal can effectively be decoupled from the surface rain rate if there is a lot of warm rain clouds because the pmw retrievals over land are almost entirely dependent on the scattering signal and the ice hydrometeor content of the clouds it is possible that the ice of warm orographic clouds is too sparse to be detected by the pmw sensors e g dinku et al 2007 huang et al 2018 o and kirstette 2018 satgé et al 2018 huang et al 2020 these weaknesses should be further fixed to obtain better satellite precipitation estimations over the complex terrain of taiwan a possible explanation for why imerg e is better than imerg l in depicting the hourly precipitation variation over taiwan is also discussed notably imerg e only applied the forward algorithms in time whereas imerg l applied forward as well as backward algorithms in time tan et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 as imerg e already picks the right phase of s1 p and s2 p in fig 5c d additional application of backward algorithms in time for imerg l might increase its errors in depicting the temporal evolution of diurnal precipitation o et al 2017 one factor could be that the forward and backward morphing moves the overpass snapshots forward and backward in time thus the peak in the diurnal cycle may move with the typical flow and so forward carries the diurnal peak with it whereas the backward takes the peak in the wrong direction there are also two more factors possible 1 the overpass time of a particular satellite might matter and 2 as the early run has less data ir has a bigger impact by personal communication with the imerg production team member dr george j huffman in 2021 5 conclusion this study aimed to compare the performance of four gpm based nrt products gsmap n gsmap gn imerg e and imerg l in depicting the diurnal precipitation variation over taiwan our analyses focused on mjjas i e months with larger diurnal variability from 2017 to 2020 we used the gridded data of surface observed precipitation cwb data as a reference for comparison the analysis was done on hourly 0 1 0 1 grids to make the evaluation as complete as possible the diurnal precipitation variation was separated into two components daily mean pm and anomalies p using eq 3 and p was further separated into diurnal s1 and semidiurnal s2 harmonic modes using fourier analysis each of these sub components of precipitation changes was examined our results show that during mjjas all mspps tend to underestimate the pm over most of taiwan however imerg products with higher scorr values perform better than gsmap products in depicting the spatial distribution of pm fig 9 and table 6 for p area averaged over taiwan during mjjas all mspps can capture the occurrence of the late afternoon maximum fig 3b but the performance of imerg e with the largest tcorr and smallest rmse in fig 4 is better than that of other mspps the better ability of imerg e to depict the variations in p area averaged over taiwan was found to be related to its better ability to represent the variations in s1 p s2 p and s1 p s2 p among all mspps imerg e alone peaks the phases of s1 p and s2 p area averaged over taiwan similar to the cwb fig 5c d therefore imerg e demonstrated the best performance in depicting the temporal phase evolution of s1 p s2 p fig 6 and table 3 the difference between the performance of mspps in depicting the area averaged s1 p and s2 p fig 5c d can be attributed to their ability to capture the spatial distribution of the phases of s1 p and s2 p fig 7 compared with the reference benchmark cwb the two imerg products are overall better than the two gsmap products in terms of the spatial distribution of variability of s1 p fig 8a s2 p fig 8b and pm fig 9 in addition imerg e is slightly better than imerg l in depicting most of the spatial features examined the possible causes for general bias in the four examined mspps are as follows 1 the pmw sensor is more sensitive to cloud ice during the mature stage of convective precipitation but it is difficult to detect the ice of mixed phase cloud systems during the developing and dissipating stages 2 warm orographic clouds were not trained well by the ir precipitation algorithms and 3 the ice particles existing in warm orographic clouds are too sparse to be detected by pmw sensors these general shortcomings for gpm products need to be improved to obtain better diurnal precipitation detection over taiwan to further improve the gsmap products we suggest that a cap of maximum hourly precipitation at approximately 30 mm h 1 on gsmap gn fig 10b be adjusted to a higher value or be dependent on topography on the contrary for imerg products we suggest that the extra backward algorithms applied in imerg l increased the bias notably other reasons might contribute to the different performance of the mspps documented in this study and these need to be studied further this study is the first to assess the gpm based nrt mspps from both imerg and gsmap in estimating diurnal precipitation variations over taiwan supplementary table s1 our findings highlight the potential use of these products to study local diurnal precipitation changes credit authorship contribution

8104,study region taiwan study focus the precipitation in taiwan demonstrates clear diurnal variations this study evaluated the performance of four near real time nrt multiple satellite precipitation products mspps from the global precipitation measurement gpm mission in depicting the variation in diurnal precipitation from 2017 to 2020 in may to september mjjas the four mspps include the v06 of integrated multi satellite retrievals for the gpm early run imerg e and late run imerg l and the v07 of global satellite mapping of precipitation nrt gsmap n and gauge nrt gsmap gn two sub components of diurnal precipitation variation were evaluated daily mean pm and anomalies δp δp was further separated into diurnal s1 and semidiurnal s2 harmonic modes new hydrological insights for the region compared with surface observations results show that all nrt mspps underestimate pm and δp but the imerg products are better than gsmap products in most of the examined spatial characteristics temporally only imerg e depicts the phase evolution of both s1 and s2 similar to surface observations these findings indicate that imerg e is the best nrt product for studying the diurnal precipitation characteristics across mjjas in taiwan the general bias in the nrt mspps considered in the study in depicting the features examined was attributed to the limitation of passive microwave sensors in illustrating the developing and dissipating stage of diurnal precipitation formation and to the weakness of infrared precipitation algorithms in detecting warm orographic clouds graphical abstract ga1 keywords complex terrain diurnal precipitation satellite precipitation east asia 1 introduction multiple satellite precipitation products mspps are an important resource for studying variations in global and regional precipitation the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm was launched in november 1997 to help understand tropical precipitation variations within the water cycle huffman et al 2007 in february 2014 the global precipitation measurement gpm core satellite was launched hou et al 2014 and new gpm products were developed to continue providing global precipitation observations after completion of the trmm currently there are two main data sources for gpm based mspps the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2020 provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 provided by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa compared with trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa gpm based mspps have higher spatiotemporal resolution and improved algorithms kubota et al 2007 huffman et al 2020 thus it is generally expected that gpm based mspps might provide more reliable precipitation estimates for research however this expectation requires many validation efforts notably tmpa is a legacy product that is not being extended therefore this study focused on the current gpm based mspps as all the gpm based mspps incorporate trmm as the calibrator to provide a data record that extends well before the initiation of gpm the trmm record is not lost in imerg and gsmap both imerg and gsmap provide near real time nrt products and post real time prt products depending on the time latency imerg has two nrt products early and late runs herein referred as imerg e and imerg l respectively and one prt product final run herein referred as imerg f huffman et al 2020 the release of imerg e and imerg l is delayed 4 h and 14 h after the observation time respectively table 1 in contrast the release of imerg f is delayed by 3 5 months because its production requires adjustment based on monthly gauge data huffman et al 2020 although each of the three runs of imerg products might perform best in depicting the precipitation variation over different regions o et al 2017 tang et al 2020 huang et al 2021a nasa has advised researchers to use imerg f for most research purposes https gpm nasa gov data directory following this suggestion many studies have focused on assessing imerg f precipitation estimates over various regions wang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 o and kirstetter 2018 navarro et al 2019 huang et al 2020 moazami and najafi 2021 for example huang et al 2018 2020 assessed the performance of imerg f in depicting the precipitation variation over taiwan an island of approximately 36 000 km2 and complex orography features fig 1 and noted that imerg f showed better depiction of the monthly daily and diurnal precipitation variation in taiwan during the warm seasons compared to those during the cold seasons however it is necessary to use nrt products when examining the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation formation prior to the release of prt products thus it is also important to determine the capability of imerg e and imerg l in depicting precipitation variations over various regions o et al 2017 ma et al 2020 huang et al 2021a in contrast to imerg gsmap has two prt products gsmap mvk and gsmap gauge herein referred as gsmap m and gsmap g respectively with a 3 day latency and two nrt products gsmap nrt and gsmap gauge nrt herein referred as gsmap n and gsmap gn respectively with a 4 h latency kubota et al 2020 most studies evaluating the ability of gsmap products have mainly focused on the assessment of prt products across various regions tian et al 2010 prakash et al 2015 hur et al 2016 setiawati and miura 2016 setiyoko et al 2019 trinh tuan et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in addition some studies have compared the differences between the prt products of imerg and gsmap reddy et al 2019 salles et al 2019 huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 for taiwan huang et al 2020 compared the gpm based prt products including imerg f and gsmap g in depicting the summer diurnal precipitation formation and found that imerg f outperforms gsmap g in both estimations of quantitative precipitation and depiction of phase evolution however to the best of our knowledge it is unclear whether this conclusion is also valid when juxtaposing gpm based nrt products including imerg e imerg l gsmap n and gsmap gn in depicting the diurnal precipitation formation over taiwan notably as documented in supplementary table s1 the monthly and daily means of gpm based mspps for both prt and nrt products over taiwan have been examined in our previous studies huang et al 2018 2021a 2021b further the diurnal variation of gpm based prt products has also been examined huang et al 2020 in contrast from previous studies huang et al 2018 2020 2021a 2021b this study aimed to examine precipitation variation on the hourly time scale to compare the nrt products of imerg and gsmap in particular we focused on the active months for the variation in diurnal precipitation in taiwan identified later in fig 2 formation of diurnal precipitation has been commonly observed over taiwan chen et al 1999 chen and chen 2003 kerns et al 2010 huang and wang 2014 huang and chang 2018 sometimes extreme diurnal precipitation formation can lead to local flooding events lin et al 2011 because nrt mspps are an important source for quickly examining the characteristics and causes of diurnal precipitation formation over taiwan related assessments are necessary prior to conducting further research the objective of this study is not to identify new precipitation features from surface observations but to use the well known surface precipitation features as a reference base to evaluate the unknown performance of gpm based nrt mspps the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the data and methodology are described in section 2 section 3 presents our results on diurnal precipitation evaluation the causes of the mspp bias in depicting diurnal precipitation are discussed in section 4 followed by the conclusions in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 precipitation data this study examined four gpm based nrt mspps imerg e imerg l gsmap n and gsmap gn from the latest versions of imerg v06 and gsmap v07 the information regarding the spatiotemporal resolution and available time periods of these mspps is presented in table 1 the analyses focused on the overlapping data periods from april 2017 to september 2020 for comparison the half hourly resolutions of imerg e and imerg l were accumulated to produce hourly resolution data as described by huang et al 2018 we used the gridded surface observed precipitation data generated from 436 rain gauges provided by the taiwan central weather bureau herein referred as cwb data as a reference for comparison the resolution of cwb data was 0 1 0 1 in spatial and hourly temporal intervals table 1 the detailed information on imerg v06 can be found in tan et al 2019 and huffman et al 2020 in general the production procedures of imerg products included the following steps 1 the goddard profiling algorithm gprof kummerow et al 2015 was used to obtain precipitation from passive microwave pmw sensors then calibrated by the gpm combined precipitation estimates derived from the gpm microwave imager gmi and the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr 2 the precipitation estimates were then applied to the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud cluster system persiann ccs algorithm hong et al 2004 nguyen et al 2018 with calibration using the merged pmw 3 the precipitation estimates were propagated based on vertically integrated vapor from numerical modeling and 4 the kalman filter approach was applied joyce and xie 2011 in v06 both imerg e and imerg l used forecast fields from the goddard earth observing system forward processing geos fp forecast product to derive motion vectors tan et al 2019 however imerg e only applied forward propagation across time whereas imerg l used both forward and backward propagation across time huffman et al 2020 the detailed information on gsmap v07 can be found in mega et al 2019 and kubota et al 2020 the production procedures of gsmap v07 generally comprised the following steps 1 the precipitation estimates were derived from brightness temperatures of the pmw sensors in which intercalibrated to the gpm combined radar radiometer precipitation estimates kubota et al 2020 2 the combined precipitation estimates were only propagated forward in time using the atmospheric moving vector derived from infrared ir data and 3 the kalman filter approach was applied to refine the prediction based on the relationship between the ir brightness temperature and surface rain rate ushio et al 2009 kubota et al 2020 among gsmap nrt mspps gsmap n was adjusted using a system model with parameters calculated from gsmap g data over the past 30 days to produce gsmap gn mega et al 2019 kubota et al 2020 tashima et al 2020 the difference between gsmap nrt mspps is that the adjustment of gsmap gn applied over land and the precipitation rate estimated over the ocean using gsmap gn is the same as that estimated using gsmap n 2 2 methods in this study all analysis was done on hourly 0 1 0 1 grids for comparison between cwb and a selected satellite precipitation product spp the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 cc i 1 n spp i sppm cwb i cwbm i 1 n spp i sppm 2 i 1 n cwb i cwbm 2 2 rmse i 1 n spp i cwb i 2 n 1 where n is the sample size cwbm sppm represents the mean of all sample sizes of cwb spp and cwbi sppi represents the precipitation estimates for a specific sample of cwb spp both the temporal correlation coefficient tcorr and spatial correlation coefficient scorr were calculated for later analyses for tcorr the mean status cwbm and sppm in eq 1 is determined over time for a selected period e g a month or season for scorr the mean status cwbm and sppm in eq 1 is determined over the spatial domain for all spatial grids within the domain the perfect value for tcorr and scorr is 1 and a higher value implies a higher similarity between the cwb and selected spp the rmse was calculated to quantify the difference between the magnitude of the cwb and selected spp the perfect value for rmse is 0 and a lower value suggests a smaller bias of the selected spp to make the evaluation as complete as possible we separated the diurnal precipitation variation into two parts daily mean pm and anomalies δp as in eq 3 3 p pm p for eq 3 the mean status is determined over time for a selected period e g a month or season comparisons between cwb and the four nrt mspps were performed for pm and δp this method has been adopted in many previous studies to better illustrate the diurnal precipitation features sato et al 2009 huang et al 2013 chen et al 2018 previous studies have commonly separated the variability of p into diurnal s1 p and semidiurnal s2 p harmonic components to examine the diurnal precipitation variation in detail dai 2001 o and kirstetter 2018 for example o and kirstetter 2018 evaluated the performance of imerg f in capturing diurnal s1 p and semidiurnal s2 p variations of δp across the united states us in this study we adopted this classic analysis scheme and examined the performance of nrt mspps in depicting the spatiotemporal variation of s1 p and s2 p across taiwan s1 p and s2 p were obtained from the first and second harmonic modes of the fourier analysis respectively storch and zwiers 1999 the percentages of s1 p and s2 p for explaining the variance of s1 p s2 p were calculated using equation 4 4 percentage variance of s 1 or s 2 variance of s 1 variance of s 2 100 hereafter all analyses are presented in taiwan local time lt which is the universal time utc 8 h unless otherwise noted the climatological fields were obtained from the averaged values during the study period from april 2017 to september 2020 3 results 3 1 area averaged precipitation features prior to judging the performance of mspps the frequently examined observational features from the cwb data that serve as the reference base are first illustrated to help explain why the period of may to september mjjas but not a whole year is the focus of this study fig 2a shows the annual evolution of the climatological hourly precipitation area averaged over taiwan as estimated from the cwb data visually a diurnal precipitation maximum occurs in the late afternoon around 16 17 lt during mjjas e g huang et al 2018 by separating the hourly precipitation into the daily mean pm gray bar in fig 2b and anomalies p fig 2c we noted that may to october showed larger amounts of pm whereas larger values of variability in p fig 2b red bar appeared mainly during mjjas temporally the evolution of p in fig 2c seems to be separated into two different groups one is mainly dominated by a maximum minimum peak within 24 h during mjjas and the other is mainly dominated by two maximum minimum peaks within 24 h from october to april similar observational features were also noted in our previous studies huang et al 2018 2021a 2021b but with different periods of data studied many studies have examined in diurnal precipitation variation haile et al 2013 pfeifroth et al 2016 o and kirstetter 2018 it is very important to identify whether the data studied e g satellite precipitation products model simulation data etc can represent the phase of depicting the time of the diurnal precipitation maximum therefore using the well known observational features shown in fig 2 we evaluated the unknown performance of gpm based nrt mspps the performance of the four nrt mspps in depicting the above reference features is shown in fig 3 similar to cwb fig 2a all mspps captured the hourly precipitation maximum occurring around 16 17 lt during mjjas fig 3a from january to april fig 3a gsmap n and gsmap gn seemed to be dominated by two maximum minimum peaks within 24 h but this feature was not observed in imerg e and imerg l these similarities and differences among mspps were more clearly observed in terms of p fig 3b the diurnal evolution of p depicted by all mspps fig 3b was similar to that of cwb fig 2c during mjjas compared to that during other months we also tested an analysis using daily data smoothed with a 30 day moving average window as shown in supplementary fig s1 the signal of the diurnal precipitation maximum occurring at 16 17 lt is the same as the monthly data this suggests that the feature is robust and independent of the examined timescale monthly or daily as for the pm area averaged over taiwan fig 3c all mspps can depict the annual cycle with two peaks occurring in june and august similar to cwb e g hsu et al 2021 however relative to cwb all mspps tended to underestimate the pm in most months similar findings have been reported by huang et al 2018 2020 2021a 2021b but with different time periods and not all the four nrt mspps together as in fig 3c the statistical values for comparing the time series of pm in fig 3c are listed in table 2 compared with cwb all mspps have a tcorr of pm 0 9 which is significant at the 95 confidence interval suggesting a good ability to qualitatively depict the annual evolution of area averaged pm across taiwan as for the rmse of pm the value is the smallest for gsmap n whereas the other three mspps show a similar performance fig 3d shows the hourly p variability estimated from fig 3b for each specific month similar to cwb all mspps depict that the variability in hourly p is larger in mjjas than in other months considering that this study focused on the active months of hourly precipitation variation the remaining analyses were performed only for mjjas from 2017 to 2020 fig 4a shows the tcorr for comparing the hourly p of cwb fig 2c and mspps fig 3b during a day and for each individual month of mjjas even though all mspps have a value of tcorr 0 8 which is significant at a 95 confidence interval imerg e performs the best with a higher tcorr fig 4a as well as a smaller rmse fig 4b during most of the examined months however this finding is different from that revealed by pm fig 3c showing that gsmap n performs better than other mspps in estimating quantitative precipitation during mjjas this difference is further discussed in section 3 2 the variation of the hourly p area averaged over taiwan can be mostly explained by its related combination of diurnal and semidiurnal modes herein s1 p s2 p e g huang et al 2018 consistent with the report by huang et al 2018 we noted from cwb fig 5a that the variation of p is close to s1 p s2 p which also demonstrated a major maximum in the late afternoon and a minor maximum in the early morning however while huang et al 2018 used this feature to evaluate the performance of a prt data we used this feature to examine the performance of nrt mspps comparing fig 5a and fig 5b the appearance of the afternoon maximum of s1 p s2 p was markedly dominated by the maximum of s1 p with contributions by the maximum of s2 p at around 16 17 lt in contrast the appearance of the early morning minor maximum of s1 p s2 p was mainly dominated by the maximum of s2 p at around 04 05 lt similarly huang and chan 2012 examined the p changes over south china near taiwan and concluded that the late afternoon maximum of p was mostly dominated by the s1 p mode whereas the early morning minor peak of p was mainly dominated by the s2 p mode fig 5c shows the comparison between cwb and the four nrt mspps for the temporal evolution of the s1 p area averaged over taiwan and averaged during 2017 2020 mjjas for comparison the timing of occurrence for the observed s1 p maximum of cwb at 15 16 lt is highlighted using a yellow bar overall most mspps show a phase evolution of s1 p similar to cwb however imerg l seems to shift the maximum minimum timing by approximately 1 h earlier than that of the cwb for s2 p fig 5d only imerg e successfully captured the phase similar to cwb occurrence timing of cwb s maximum values highlighted by yellow bars in contrast relative to cwb the two gsmap products showed delayed maximum peaks whereas imerg l showed advanced maximum peaks for s2 p together these results indicate that imerg e has the best performance among mspps in capturing the temporal evolution of s1 p s2 p fig 6 indeed by calculating the tcorr and rmse between cwb and mspps in fig 6 the statistical results table 3 show that imerg e has the largest tcorr and smallest rmse confirming its better performance over other mspps the possible causes for bias in mspps depicting the phase evolution of s1 p and s2 p are discussed in section 4 fig 6 also shows that imerg products are better than gsmap products in capturing the early morning minor peak but only imerg e captures the right phase of s2 p fig 5d this might be partly attributable to the relatively better performance of imerg products compared to gsmap products in depicting the contribution of s1 p and s2 p respectively to the variability in s1 p s2 p to confirm this hypothesis we calculated the percentage of variability in s1 p s2 p explained by s1 p and s2 p respectively using equation 4 as shown in table 4 when compared to cwb gsmap products have a clear bias in underestimating the contribution of s2 p to s1 p s2 p this could lead to gsmap products being less capable of depicting the early morning maximum of s1 p s2 p fig 6 among the four nrt mspps imerg e had less bias in determining the respective contribution of s1 p and s2 p to s1 p s2 p table 4 likely leading to its better ability to represent the phase evolution of s1 p s2 p fig 6 and table 3 3 2 spatial features thus far this study has focused on area averaged values to clarify the spatial differences we constructed a climatological averaged during 2017 2020 mjjas horizontal distribution for the occurrence time of the s1 p maximum during a day fig 7a dotted areas representing the phase difference between mspps and cwb are greater than one hour overall cwb depicts the s1 p maximum occurring during 14 18 lt in most of taiwan with a time lagged feature that shows that the s1 p maximum occurred earlier in the west than in the central region which is earlier than that in the east e g huang et al 2018 compared with cwb all mspps can represent the s1 p maximum appearing during 14 18 lt over most of taiwan but these are incapable of showing the aforementioned time lagged relationship consistent with fig 5c imerg l shows greater bias i e more dot areas compared to other mspps in depicting the temporal phase of s1 p especially across eastern taiwan where imerg l peaks earlier than cwb for s2 p fig 7b cwb depicts the maximum value that occurred during 04 06 lt and 16 18 lt across most of taiwan with the timing over coastal areas being slightly later than that in the mountainous areas imerg e shows the s2 p phase distribution closest to the cwb i e with less dotted region whereas imerg l performs slightly better than gsmap products with more dotted regions as shown in fig 5d the shifting of the s2 p phase differs between the imerg l and gsmap products which is in accordance with fig 7b showing that imerg l has more errors in capturing the s2 p phase across eastern taiwan earlier than cwb whereas gsmap products have more errors in capturing the s2 p phase across western taiwan later than cwb the related grid to grid tcorr between mspps and cwb for the time series of s1 p s2 p fig 6 is further constructed in fig 7c because of its better ability to capture s1 p fig 7a and s2 p fig 7b imerg e also has a higher value of tcorr for s1 p s2 p across most of taiwan fig 7c next we compared the spatial distribution for the variability in s1 p fig 8a and s2 p fig 8b estimated from cwb and mspps during 2017 2020 mjjas as shown in fig 8a the s1 p variability in cwb is larger over the western mountain slope where the windward side of the summer monsoon flows e g chen and chen 2003 relative to cwb the maximum s1 p variability in imerg products shifted slightly to the north whereas the maximum s1 p variability in gsmap products shifted to the west a similar feature is also shown in fig 8b which shows that imerg products are more capable than gsmap products in capturing the spatial distribution of s2 p variability as in cwb the evidence supporting this finding is provided in table 5 which shows higher smaller values of scorr for the comparison between imerg gsmap products and cwb in fig 8a b with better performance in both s1 p and s2 p imerg products have less bias than gsmap products in illustrating the spatial distribution of the variability in s1 p s2 p fig 8c and the bias in imerg e is slightly smaller than that in imerg l the spatial distribution of pm estimated by cwb and mspps averaged during 2017 2020 mjjas was also examined fig 9a although all mspps captured the maximum pm appearing over southern taiwan the patterns of imerg products with scorr 0 8 were more similar to cwb table 6 among mspps gsmap n was the worst with the smallest value of scorr in illustrating the spatial distribution of pm this differed from the earlier conclusion that gsmap n is the best product for estimating the area averaged value of pm fig 3c to further clarify this finding the spatial differences between the pm values of the mspps and cwb are plotted in fig 9b quantitatively all mspps underestimated the pm over mountainous regions however over the lower elevations gsmap n showed a more noticeable overestimation of pm as a result of cancellation between overestimation and underestimation gsmap n showed smaller errors in depicting the pm area averaged over taiwan table 6 the scatter diagram of the original hourly precipitation p pm p for comparing the mspps and cwb over taiwan during 2017 2020 mjjas was further examined fig 10 gsmap n fig 10a has systematic errors in overestimating weaker precipitation events spread in the top left but underestimating stronger precipitation events unlike gsmap n gsmap gn fig 10b has a criterion of maximum hourly precipitation equal to approximately 30 mm h 1 in fact through personal communication with a gsmap gn production team member dr takuji kubota in 2021 we understood that this was their first version of the gsmap gn method due to which they have adopted conservative limits such as 30 mm h 1 therefore gsmap gn underestimated the heavy precipitation events observed by cwb 30 mm h 1 explaining why the value of pm in gsmap gn is smaller than that in gsmap n fig 9a however from the related statistical values of cc and rmse given in fig 10a b we noted that gsmap gn with larger cc and smaller rmse is better than gsmap n in the quantitative estimation of hourly precipitation across taiwan unlike gsmap products the scatter diagram distributions in imerg e fig 10c and imerg l fig 10d are more similar and no clear limitation of the maximum value is found in imerg products further examination of cc and rmse suggested that imerg products with larger cc and smaller rmse are better than gsmap products with imerg e cc 0 52 rmse 1 79 mm h 1 being slightly better than imerg l cc 0 51 rmse 1 80 mm h 1 in summary all analyzed features suggest that imerg e outperforms the other three nrt mspps in depicting the hourly precipitation variation over taiwan 4 possible explanations for the performance of gpm based nrt mspps from fig 7a we noted that not all gpm based nrt mspps can capture the time lagged feature of s1 p as observed by the cwb note that the short interval daily and sub daily performance is driven by the sequence of satellite estimates the additional calibration in the prt is really at the monthly time scale and mostly just shows up as a bias adjustment in the short interval data considering that the bias in the nrt mspps might be reflected in the prt mspps for the short interval data we attempted to look for possible explanations of this common bias for gpm based nrt mspps from o and kirstetter 2018 who evaluated the performance of imerg f a prt product in representing the phase of s1 p over the us similar to fig 7a o and kirstetter 2018 found that relative to surface observations imerg f estimated that precipitation appeared late on the west side but early on the east side of central us they concluded that this bias was mainly caused by the inability of imerg f to represent the developing and dissipating stages of mesoscale convective systems mcs in general the mcs developed in the west matured in the middle and decayed in the east of central us during the developing and dissipating stages different phases of water ice particles liquid droplets and water vapor exist in clouds these are called mixed phase cloud systems in contrast during the mature stage ice particles constitute the main phase of water in clouds as the detection of precipitation in imerg including nrt and prt products uses pmw sensors which are mostly sensitive to ice particles from the mature stage of mcs imerg f does not represent the right timing of maximum precipitation occurring in mixed phase cloud systems over the west and east sides of central us o and kirstetter 2018 this bias in the imerg f i e prt product may also explain the bias of imerg e and imerg l i e nrt products in depicting the timing of s1 p over the western and eastern coastal regions of taiwan notably the gsmap also used pmw for precipitation detection therefore a similar bias in peaking precipitation late in western taiwan but early in eastern taiwan was also noted in gsmap n and gsmap gn moreover this bias is revealed in s1 p fig 7a as well as in s2 p fig 7b yamamoto et al 2008 also found that the differences in peak time precipitation from satellite sensors are related to the evolution of convection precipitation from these discussions we suggest that both imerg and gsmap need to further improve satellite precipitation retrieval from the process of cloud microphysics to better detect the phase evolution of s1 p and s2 p in the nrt products moreover as shown in fig 10b gsmap gn has a cut off maximum hourly precipitation of approximately 30 mm h 1 which led to greater underestimation of the quantitative pm estimation in gsmap gn than in gsmap n table 6 therefore we suggest that adjusting the precipitation threshold from 30 mm h 1 to a higher value depending on the topography might help improve the quantitative estimation of gsmap gn for hourly precipitation over taiwan in fact through personal communication with a gsmap gn production team member dr takuji kubota in 2021 we understood that in their development of the next version they are conducting a trade off study among 30 mm h 1 50 mm h 1 100 mm h 1 and 200 mm h 1 as the upper limit more details will be reported in the future additionally for why gpm based nrt mspps tending to quantitatively underestimate the pm over mountainous areas we suggest the following possible explanations 1 the brightness temperature of warm orographic clouds is not trained well by the ir precipitation algorithms e g bitew and gebremichael 2010 maggioni et al 2016 sun et al 2018 wang and yong 2020 and 2 in orographic conditions the ice signal can effectively be decoupled from the surface rain rate if there is a lot of warm rain clouds because the pmw retrievals over land are almost entirely dependent on the scattering signal and the ice hydrometeor content of the clouds it is possible that the ice of warm orographic clouds is too sparse to be detected by the pmw sensors e g dinku et al 2007 huang et al 2018 o and kirstette 2018 satgé et al 2018 huang et al 2020 these weaknesses should be further fixed to obtain better satellite precipitation estimations over the complex terrain of taiwan a possible explanation for why imerg e is better than imerg l in depicting the hourly precipitation variation over taiwan is also discussed notably imerg e only applied the forward algorithms in time whereas imerg l applied forward as well as backward algorithms in time tan et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 as imerg e already picks the right phase of s1 p and s2 p in fig 5c d additional application of backward algorithms in time for imerg l might increase its errors in depicting the temporal evolution of diurnal precipitation o et al 2017 one factor could be that the forward and backward morphing moves the overpass snapshots forward and backward in time thus the peak in the diurnal cycle may move with the typical flow and so forward carries the diurnal peak with it whereas the backward takes the peak in the wrong direction there are also two more factors possible 1 the overpass time of a particular satellite might matter and 2 as the early run has less data ir has a bigger impact by personal communication with the imerg production team member dr george j huffman in 2021 5 conclusion this study aimed to compare the performance of four gpm based nrt products gsmap n gsmap gn imerg e and imerg l in depicting the diurnal precipitation variation over taiwan our analyses focused on mjjas i e months with larger diurnal variability from 2017 to 2020 we used the gridded data of surface observed precipitation cwb data as a reference for comparison the analysis was done on hourly 0 1 0 1 grids to make the evaluation as complete as possible the diurnal precipitation variation was separated into two components daily mean pm and anomalies p using eq 3 and p was further separated into diurnal s1 and semidiurnal s2 harmonic modes using fourier analysis each of these sub components of precipitation changes was examined our results show that during mjjas all mspps tend to underestimate the pm over most of taiwan however imerg products with higher scorr values perform better than gsmap products in depicting the spatial distribution of pm fig 9 and table 6 for p area averaged over taiwan during mjjas all mspps can capture the occurrence of the late afternoon maximum fig 3b but the performance of imerg e with the largest tcorr and smallest rmse in fig 4 is better than that of other mspps the better ability of imerg e to depict the variations in p area averaged over taiwan was found to be related to its better ability to represent the variations in s1 p s2 p and s1 p s2 p among all mspps imerg e alone peaks the phases of s1 p and s2 p area averaged over taiwan similar to the cwb fig 5c d therefore imerg e demonstrated the best performance in depicting the temporal phase evolution of s1 p s2 p fig 6 and table 3 the difference between the performance of mspps in depicting the area averaged s1 p and s2 p fig 5c d can be attributed to their ability to capture the spatial distribution of the phases of s1 p and s2 p fig 7 compared with the reference benchmark cwb the two imerg products are overall better than the two gsmap products in terms of the spatial distribution of variability of s1 p fig 8a s2 p fig 8b and pm fig 9 in addition imerg e is slightly better than imerg l in depicting most of the spatial features examined the possible causes for general bias in the four examined mspps are as follows 1 the pmw sensor is more sensitive to cloud ice during the mature stage of convective precipitation but it is difficult to detect the ice of mixed phase cloud systems during the developing and dissipating stages 2 warm orographic clouds were not trained well by the ir precipitation algorithms and 3 the ice particles existing in warm orographic clouds are too sparse to be detected by pmw sensors these general shortcomings for gpm products need to be improved to obtain better diurnal precipitation detection over taiwan to further improve the gsmap products we suggest that a cap of maximum hourly precipitation at approximately 30 mm h 1 on gsmap gn fig 10b be adjusted to a higher value or be dependent on topography on the contrary for imerg products we suggest that the extra backward algorithms applied in imerg l increased the bias notably other reasons might contribute to the different performance of the mspps documented in this study and these need to be studied further this study is the first to assess the gpm based nrt mspps from both imerg and gsmap in estimating diurnal precipitation variations over taiwan supplementary table s1 our findings highlight the potential use of these products to study local diurnal precipitation changes credit authorship contribution
