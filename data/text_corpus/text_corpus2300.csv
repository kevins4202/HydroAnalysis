11500,the aim of this research was to compare two irrigation and n application systems gun irrigation gi and drip fertigation df in terms of soil water dynamics n uptake n use efficiency and yield of table potatoes two treatments were set up in a three year field experiment treatments differed by irrigation and n application methods and scheduling water and n management in gi was managed according to typical best practice while irrigation and n for df was applied through drip fertigation according to a crop simulation model results showed that df provided high soil water content at the center of the ridge average soil water content across the ridge soil profile was higher for df than gi compared to df gi led to relatively high canopy growth early in the season through applying all n at planting while the opposite trend was detected later in the growing season tuber yields in gi were 46 43 and 44 t ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively tuber yields in df were 48 43 and 40 t ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively there was no significant difference in yield between systems for any of the three seasons of the experiment however df led to significantly higher tuber n recovery and agronomic n use efficiency in one of the years 2013 in addition gi caused greater nitrate leaching during the growing season in both 2013 and 2014 as measured by suction cups and simulated by the

production is strongly influenced by drought timing severity and duration porter et al 1999 onder et al 2005 ünlü et al 2006 in denmark arable land for potato is dominated by coarse textured soil which has low water holding capacity highlighting the necessity of irrigation to maintain yield and quality shock et al 1992 shock et al 2007 irrigation for potato production in denmark is done almost solely by traveling gun irrigation gi a type of sprinkler system the main advantage of gi is that it can be set up easily and rapidly nevertheless water is susceptible to evaporation and wind losses

interception which increases with canopy growth in addition it is hard for sprinklers to apply irrigation in a uniform way i e the soil wetting pattern across the field is often uneven saffigna et al 1976 stieber and shock 1995 robinson 1999 starr 2005 as a large proportion of gi applied water concentrates in the furrows the water is at risk of deep percolation which is often associated with n loss by nitrate leaching jury et al 1976 starr 2005 since water uptake occurs mostly in the potato ridge starr et al 2008 the efficiency with which an irrigation system supplies water to the ridge will increase water use efficiency wue an alternative irrigation system to gi is drip irrigation which can save water by applying water close to the base of the plant i e the ridge center and only wetting a small area of soil drip irrigation is a more water efficient alternative to traditional sprinkler irrigation systems for potato waddell et al 1999 starr 2005 wang et al 2006 patel and rajput 2007 drip fertigation df which supplies soluble fertilizer through drip irrigation lines is a technique that combines drip irrigation with fertilization one merit of df is its flexibility to conduct in season split fertilization which can reduce nitrate leaching and increase nitrogen use efficiency nue compared to the usual practice of applying all n at planting most of the potato rhizospere is confined to a small area lesczynski and tanner 1976 asfary et al 1983 especially during early stages of growth applying all the basal n at one time will potentially increase n loss by nitrate leaching and leave inadequate n available for crop use at later stages by applying n continuously throughout the season df is a promising means for maintaining n concentration in the soil without undue leaching losses papadopoulos 1988 hebbar et al 2004 as well as maintaining lai crop n concentration and ultimately tuber yield hebbar et al 2004 a wide array of studies have derived optimal application rates of n for potato production meyer and marcum 1998 badr et al 2012 but these results were relatively static and did not consider how n mineralization in the root zone depends on varying environmental conditions for example soil texture root depth mineralization of soil organic matter and climate have significant effects on n availability in the root zone of potato and n requirements to assess n dynamics in both crop and soil and estimate crop n requirements crop models have been developed and used under varying environmental conditions peralta and stockle 2002 van delden et al 2003 daisy hansen et al 2012 was chosen to simulate n dynamics and subsequently guide in season n fertigation in the current study and a description of the model is presented in the m m section of this paper the objective of the study was to explore the response of crop growth tuber yield and soil water dynamics under two irrigation systems conventional gun irrigation gi and drip fertigation df the hypothesis was that compared to df gi may lead to inadequate soil water content in the center of the ridge which in turn causes lower n uptake tuber yield and n use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and crop management three field experiments with potato solanum tuberosum l cv folva in 2013 and cv sava in 2014 and 2015 were carried out at jyndevad research station denmark 54 53 60 n 9 07 30 e the soil at this experimental site was a coarse textured sandy soil containing ca 76 coarse sand 0 2 2 0 mm 15 fine sand 0 02 0 2 mm 4 silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 3 clay 0 002 mm the plant available water capacity is about 67 mm in the top 60 cm of soil further details on soil properties are described in zhou et al 2016 the annual average precipitation is 1000 mm when the soil temperature was at least 8 c at 0 10 m soil depth mother tubers were planted 0 08 m below ground level mother tubers were ridged with 15 cm of soil the plant density was 49382 plants per hectare planting occurred on 15th may 10th april and 23th april and emerged 7th june 21th may and 27th may for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fungicides were sprayed to control fungal diseases 2 2 daisy crop model description daisy simulates soil water carbon n balances heat and crop production in agro ecosystems under various management strategies hansen et al 2012 soil water balance is described by a numerical solution to the richards equation in 1 d or 2 d and the saturated water flow is described by darcy s equation hansen et al 1990 root water uptake is simulated by the single root concept hansen and abrahamsen 2009 photosynthesis is simulated by a simple light response curve hansen 2002 weather data solar radiation mean air temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity were measured at the danish met office meteorological station situated within 1 km from the field site management practices irrigation and n application were recorded daily to estimate the initial soil water and mineral n content at the start of each season daisy was run with a warm up period of 10 years using the historical weather and crop rotation records daisy has been demonstrated to excellently simulate dry matter and n balance in soil crop atmosphere systems in danish and other european condition heidmann et al 2008 moreover daisy potato module was calibrated by heidmann et al 2008 under the drip irrigation and sandy soil conditions prior to the current study and the potato variety folva used in the current study only year 2013 has been parameterized and included in daisy heidmann et al 2008 therefore the model calibrated prior to the current study provides a starting point for using daisy as decision support tool for n and irrigation scheduling 2 3 experimental design two treatments representing different systems were set up in each season gun irrigation gdsn120 and drip fertigation fdsnds irrigation was initiated when plant height was approximately 15 cm irrigation of gdsn120 was scheduled whenever the soil water deficit exceeded 25 mm using the results calculated in daisy the upper threshold of soil moisture was field capacity fc volumetric which was determined at the start of season with the time domain reflectrometry tdr 100 campbell logan utah usa equipment irrigation of fdsnds was scheduled every two days according to the preceding two days of soil water use which was also simulated using daisy the upper threshold of soil moisture for fdsnds was 90 fc drip lines with an emitter 1 l h 1 distance of 0 20 m were buried 0 03 m below the surface of the ridge both treatments had 30 kg p ha 1 and 180 kg k ha 1 applied at planting 120 kg n ha 1 was applied to gdsn120 as a basal dressing at planting n fertilization scheduling for fdsnds followed daisy model simulations of n demand based on critical nc actual na and potential np uptake levels of n in the crop hansen et al 1991 a fertilization amount of 20 kg n ha 1 was applied to fdsnds whenever na uptake approached the critical value nc which is the model threshold for n stress negatively affecting crop growth more details on the n uptake module of daisy are described in zhou et al 2017 fertigation n was given as a mixture of ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate n ratio 1 2 the experiment was a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates this resulted in 8 plots in total which were aligned in a north south direction individual plots were 6 m wide and 10 3 m long adjacent plots were separated by a buffer zone 4 m wide to prevent overlap of different irrigation systems shelters 3 m 6 5 m were used to cover the fdsnds when gdsn120 was receiving irrigation 2 4 soil water content soil water content was measured manually in two replicates of all irrigation treatments every two days before irrigation equipment used was a handheld computer allegro juniper systems inc logan utah usa connected to vertically installed tdr probes located at depths of 77 60 and 43 cm measured respectively from the top of the ridge a midway between the ridge and furrow b and from the base of the furrow c fig 1 details of the probe design and tdr trace interpretation software are given by thomsen 1994 and soil moisture content calculations by shahnazari et al 2007 2 5 measurement of canopy reflectance canopy reflectance in each plot was measured weekly using the active spectrometer rapidscan cs 45 holland scientific lincoln nebraska the field of view of the sensor is 45 by 10 spectral reflectance at red r670 nm red edge r730 nm and near infra red r780 nm are captured by the sensor ratio vegetation index rvi was calculated as r780nm r670nm the sensor was hand held 90 cm above the canopy during measurement in each plot it scanned along the row direction and returned an average value by integrating the measurement within a scanning area of 4 5 m2 per plot 2 6 final yield and tuber quality determination during the growing season defoliation was done by chemical desiccation at 71 76 or 81 days after emergence dae in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively potato tubers were harvested mechanically three weeks after defoliation for each plot yield and tuber quality were determined from four adjacent rows with an area of 3 6 m dry matter was determined after drying for 24 h at 80 c in a fan forced convection oven n concentration of each sample was analyzed by the kjeldahl method bremner and mulvaney 1982 200 tubers from each plot were evaluated for deformed tubers and green tubers 2 7 nitrate leaching dynamics of no3 within the soil were assessed with suction cups placed at 80 cm depth in each plot starting 2 weeks after planting and continuing until harvest the leaching water was sampled every 2 weeks or adjusted based on rainfall events when equilibrium was reached between the inner compartment and the soil solution soil water samples were frozen within a few hours and later analyzed for nitrate n on a technicon auto analyzer after addition of tartrate 2 8 statistical analysis and calculations t tests p 0 05 in the r software r core team 2016 were used to assess the effects of treatments on various agronomic parameters individually for each year water use efficiency wue was calculated as follows 1 w u e d m t o t e t a where dmtot is total plant dry matter and eta is actual evapotranspiration accumulated from plant emergence to harvest eta was simulated by the daisy model which used the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 to estimate eto tuber n recovery efficiency nre was calculated as 2 n r e n t u b n 0 n a where ntub is tuber n uptake n0 is tuber n uptake by the reference treatment zero n application indicating the soil n mineralization capacity na is applied n rate tuber n uptake rather than total n uptake was considered in eq 2 because only tubers were harvested while the rest of plants i e above ground parts still remained in the field thus nre indicates the efficiency of n removed from the field tuber n uptake in the reference treatment the reference treatment was set up adjacent the main experimental site was 30 32 and 40 kg n ha 1 for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively total n uptake ntot was calculated as the sum of root tuber and aboveground n uptake kg n ha 1 agronomic n use efficiency nuea was defined as 3 n u e a f y f y 0 n a where fy is fresh tuber yield in n fertilized treatments and fy0 is fresh tuber yield in the non n fertilized treatment tuber yields in reference treatment fy0 were 22 17 and 22 t ha 1 for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in order to test the daisy simulation of dry matter and n uptake of potato rrmse was calculated as 4 r r m s e 100 o i 1 n n i 1 s i o i 2 where s i and oi are predicted and observed values respectively o i is the mean of observed values n is the number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate conditions accumulated rainfall recorded in the three growing seasons from emergence to growth cessation was 183 mm 171 mm and 211 mm respectively fig 2 accumulated rainfall from the 1st irrigation until the end of the irrigation was 35 mm 150 mm and 165 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively relatively low precipitation during the irrigation treatment period led to higher irrigation requirements in 2013 than in the other two seasons accumulated reference evapotranspiration et0 in the three growing seasons was 196 mm 252 mm and 243 mm respectively average temperature in the three growing seasons was 16 0 17 0 and 14 8 c respectively 3 2 water consumption and soil water content compared to the water use in gdsn120 fdsnds consumed 1 and 17 mm less water in 2013 and 2014 respectively but 13 mm more in 2015 table 1 thus there was no pronounced water saving by df the average swc for gdsn120 were 10 4 10 6 and 12 3 for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively which were 0 3 1 4 and 1 8 volumetric lower than the swc of fdsnds for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively swc at the ridge position for fdsnds was typically higher than that in gdsn120 fig 3 for all seasons furthermore seasonal mean swcs at the ridge of fdsnds were greater than the swcs of gdsn120 at corresponding positions for all seasons table 2 among which the difference was significant p 0 05 in 2013 and 2015 with respect to shoulder and furrow swc in gdsn120 was relatively high compared to that in fdsnds only in 2013 while fdsnds had higher swc compared to that in gdsn120 in 2015 fig 3 and table 2 irrespective of irrigation systems the furrow bottom was relatively wetter than the ridge and shoulder position table 2 3 3 rvi development rvi is strongly related to leaf n concentration wang et al 2012 and aboveground dry matter and n uptake of potato zhou et al 2018 because rvi combines information from both the amount and photosynthetic activity of green leaf wohlfahrt et al 2010 and also covers a large sampling area in each plot rvi was measured in this study to compare the canopy development of the two systems in 2013 rvi in gdsn120 was generally high across the whole season fig 5 in 2014 rvi in gdsn120 was generally similar to rvi in fdsnds until 38dae after which rvi for fdsnds was consistently higher than that in gdsn120 from 48dae onwards fdsnds had relatively high rvi compared to that in gdsn120 in 2015 in the middle of the season gdsn120 had relatively high rvi compared to that in fdsnds the implications of these results are discussed below 3 4 nitrate leaching 3 4 1 soil water nitrate concentration measured at 80 cm soil depth in 2013 gdsn120 had a relatively high nitrate concentration during the growing season fig 6 on 31th august 2013 nitrate concentration was significantly p 0 05 higher in fdsnds than in gdsn120 on 21th october 2013 nitrate concentration was significantly lower for fdsnds than that in gdsn120 post season nitrate concentration was generally the same between gdsn120 and fdsnds in 2014 gdsn120 had a relatively high nitrate concentration compared to that in fdsnds during the growing season the first two sampling dates 3 4 2 nitrate leaching amount simulated by daisy to compare the different n application strategies of gdsn120 and fdsnds nitrate that was leached at the 80 cm soil depth during all growing seasons was simulated by daisy and was considered as n loss fig 7 there were occasions of high nitrate leaching in 2013 and 2015 peaks at fig 7 which were caused by high rainfall a few days before the peaks there was quite high nitrate leaching in gdsn120 the accumulated nitrate leaching during the growing season was 83 50 and 62 kg n ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in contrast the nitrate leaching in fdsnds was much less 33 27 and 29 kg n ha 1 in the growing seasons of 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 5 yield quality wue n uptake and n use efficiency for season 2015 fresh tuber yield fy for gdsn120 was 10 higher than that for fdsnds table 3 however for other years there was no difference tuber number did not respond to treatments table 3 in terms of tuber quality parameters no significant differences were found between the two systems the incidence of tuber defects was generally low table 4 eta and wue was the same between treatments except in 2015 where fdsnds had significant greater wue than gdsn120 due to a lesser eta df led to tuber n uptake of 98 kg n ha 1 with only 100 kg n ha 1 application in 2013 this caused a significantly higher nre of 68 for fdsnds in 2014 ntot ntub nre and nuea were similar between treatments in 2015 even though gdsn120 achieved significantly higher total and tuber n uptake both nre and nuea were the same between treatments due to a much lower n rate applied to fdsnds 3 6 validation of daisy simulation on soil water content tuber dry matter and n uptake soil water content vol was well simulated for fdsnds with rrmse of 11 0 14 2 and 17 3 in 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 8 respectively in contrast the swc simulation in gdsn120 was not as good as that in fdsnds the rrmse between simulated and swc was 13 8 26 4 and 27 8 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in 2014 daisy overestimated the swc in gdsn120 while in 2015 the simulation of swc in gdsn120 was too low the simulation of tuber dry matter resulted in good agreement between observed and simulated values fig 9 although the simulated dry matter was too high for fdsnds in 2014 rrmse 34 daisy over estimated tuber n uptake in all cases especially in gdsn120 rrmse 42 50 the simulation of tuber n uptake in fdsnds was generally good especially in 2014 rrmse 9 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption and soil water content due to fdsnds being irrigated more frequently than gdsn120 a relatively higher soil water availability was maintained in fdsnds there was no pronounced water saving by df furthermore a high canopy coverage was reached before first irrigation due to high rainfall in june 2013 and 2014 therefore the water loss by evaporation from the soil did not differ between fdsnds and gdsn120 in the literature it is generally agreed that drip irrigation requires less water compared to sprinkler irrigation shalhevet et al 1983 waddell et al 1999 starr et al 2008 even though the low threshold that triggers either drip or sprinkler irrigation varies among different experiments waddell et al 1999 swc at the ridge position for fdsnds was typically higher than that in gdsn120 fig 3 table 2 for all seasons corroborating the finding of cooley et al 2007 that swc in the ridge portion of the potato hill was greater under drip irrigation than sprinkler irrigation he found an increase in swc with drip irrigation by 3 2 compared with sprinkler irrigation this was caused by the fact that the center of ridge under gdsn120 was rather dry compared to that in fdsnds fig 4 a dry zone present in the center of the ridge under gun irrigation can be caused by the following factors 1 ridge geometry reduces infiltration of water from irrigation 2 stem flow which can increase swc in the center of ridge decreases as the crop develops saffigna et al 1976 3 as swc decreases water repellence increasingly reduces infiltration of water into the dry zone of the ridge hart et al 1994 robinson 1999 keizer et al 2007 however swc for gdsn120 in the ridge was still generally higher than expected this is likely because still 20 46 of the gun irrigation water on the canopy flows down the stems and increases the swc around the stems saffigna et al 1976 in addition it is likely that as tubers beneath the ridge developed they occupied a large portion of the soil volume in the hill so that irrigation water penetrated deeper saffigna et al 1976 thus wetting a larger soil volume and keeping swc at a relatively high level the furrow bottom was relatively wetter than the ridge and shoulder position corroborating the findings of starr et al 2008 this can be explained by low water uptake at the furrow compared with the ridge starr et al 2008 due to a relatively sparse root system compared to that in the ridge in addition the hill structure creates a downward surface flow of water along the sides of the ridges resulting in collection of water in the furrow it is reported in the literature that gun irrigation leads to high swc in the furrow and low swc in the ridge cooley et al 2007 this is because swc in the center of ridge does not respond to either sprinkler or rainfall as water repellency of dry sandy hydrophobic soil creates a downward flow on the outside of the ridge unless high rainfall occurs cooley et al 2007 robinson 1999 also found that under gun irrigation most of the water sheds off the ridges to the furrows due to the water repellent nature of sandy soils 4 2 nitrate leaching a relative high in season nitrate concentration at 80 cm depth was found for gdsn120 in both years fig 6 although only significantly higher than fdsnds in 2014 reducing the proportion of n applied at planting and applying the rest with split n can decrease nitrate leaching errebhi et al 1998 this was also confirmed by model simulation fig 7 so split n has been recommended as a best management policy rosen and bierman 2008 however other findings show that the supply of n may have little effect on nitrate leaching macdonald et al 1989 nieisen and jensen 1990 or at least n at rates up to the recommended application rate has only a slight effect on nitrate leaching gast et al 1978 thomsen et al 1993 the apparent contradictory conclusions may be due to the limitations of short term observations of nitrate leaching during the experiments gast et al 1978 chaney 1990 thomsen et al 1993 which are not adequate to make long term based conclusions however when high rates of n are supplied more n is expected to be left in plant residues in the long term this can lead to increased nitrate leaching davies and sylvester bradley 1995 4 3 yield wue n uptake n use efficiency and tuber quality opposite to our expectation difference of fresh tuber yield between drip fertigation and gun irrigation system was not found similar yield of drip fertigation and gun irrigation systems has also been reported in literature shalhevet et al 1983 waddell et al 1999 in this study a higher fy in fdsnds might have been achieved by applying n earlier thereby providing adequate n for early canopy growth this is corroborated by the low rvi in fdsnds compared to that in gdsn120 during early stages fig 5 the lesser canopy growth in fdsnds was probably due to inadequate 36 kg n ha 1 initial n supply westermann and kleinkopf 1985 found that a low n rate 67 kg n ha 1 at planting has negative effects on final yield by restricting leaf growth in contrast abundant early n application substantially promoted plant vegetative growth in gdsn120 fig 5 as also reported by vos 1995 delaying all non starter n until tuberization or later typically reduces yield and quality roberts et al 1982 millard and robinson 1990 the best strategy has to take into account that n application at planting should be sufficient for early canopy growth and supplementary n fertigation should be applied in time to avoid n deficiency another issue that may have masked the potential of drip fertigation was that both gdsn120 and fdsnds could have experienced drought stress for example in 2013 and 2015 wue total dry matter et for fdsnds and gdsn120 was higher than 5 0 g l 1 table 3 which is generally obtained in potato suffering from drought stress liu et al 2006 in this study tuber number did not differ between treatments table 3 it is generally accepted that tuberization is controlled by phytohormones including gibberillic and abscisic acids and these are influenced by exogenous factors such as n nutrition sattelmacher and marschner 1979 there is a potential negative effect of high n level on delaying tuberization and decreasing tuber number mack and schjoerring 2002 we hypothesized that 1 withholding n applications until some point will increase tuber number and yield 2 this practice of withholding n can reduce the canopy cover and result in lower yields roberts et al 1982 the 2nd hypothesis was partially confirmed by the relatively low canopy growth in early season as mentioned above with regards to the 1st hypothesis it was found by kolodziejczyk 2014 that the number of tuber per plant does not respond to n application rate there have been controversial results with regards to n s effect on tuber number sommerfeldt and knutson 1965 and de la morena et al 1994 found that high early season n rate either has no effect or decreases the numbers of tubers in contrast others observed that tuber numbers were increased dubetz and bole 1975 roberts et al 1982 zelalem et al 2009 jamaati e somarin et al 2010 however it is generally agreed that early season n fertilization consistently results in a delay in tuber initiation by 7 10 days kleinkopf et al 1981 df led to significantly higher nre only in 2013 in other seasons both nre and nuea were the same between treatments therefore we cannot confirm our hypothesis that gi has lower n use efficiency the hypothesis is based on the idea that gi will have inadequate swc in the center and shoulder of the ridge where most n is located however pronounced swc differences in the center or shoulder were not detected between the two irrigation systems in addition most roots accumulate in the top layers of sandy soils ahmadi et al 2011 and 90 of the root length is in the surface 25 cm of the soil profile lesczynski and tanner 1976 gi can wet large parts of the top soil as mentioned above fig 4 and saffigna et al 1976 and thereby provide adequate water for n movement towards root surfaces besides ahmadi et al 2011 found considerable root length density in the furrow portion in this study the furrow portion is where most water is concentrated particularly in gi fig 3 and this furrow portion thus contributes to water uptake as well as n uptake by the plant with regards to split n fertigation through df a clear advantage of split n was not found split n is generally preferable when n demand is high more than 200 kg n ha 1 as excessive shoot growth can be avoided with split n baker et al 1980 the incidence of tuber defects was generally low over all seasons bohmig et al 1975 reported that tuber greening and tuber deformation increased only with excessive n fertilization therefore the low incidence of tuber quality defects was probably due to the moderate n rate used in the current study it was expected that gun irrigation would cause erosion bohmig et al 1975 which will cause the increased risk of green tuber due to direct sunlight the canopy for gdsn120 was well developed during most irrigation events therefore the risk of direct splash erosion was reduced and only low incidence of green tubers was found 5 conclusions based on these comparisons between drip and gun irrigation there is no clear advantage of changing to drip irrigation management of drip irrigation is laborious as drip lines interfere with field operations e g hilling spraying and harvest burying drip lines under the depth of tillage could avoid the problems starr et al 2008 provided irrigation water could move upward to root zone which cannot however be achieved with soils as sandy as those used in this study although drip fertigation can supply water more efficiently to the ridge center confirming the hypothesis yield n uptake and n use efficiency were not improved with drip irrigation in contrast with our hypothesis the gun irrigation and drip fertigation treatments differed in irrigation method and scheduling as well as n regimes entangling the comparison of two treatments in terms of swc yield etc further research is needed to focus on isolated factors e g to explore effects of irrigation regimes while keeping n regimes the same for both gun and drip irrigation systems the experimental design deployed did not enable direct examination of the effect of split n compared to single dose n at planting to further explore the potential effect of split n we suggest to add another treatment where all n is supplied at planting while irrigation is done by

11500,the aim of this research was to compare two irrigation and n application systems gun irrigation gi and drip fertigation df in terms of soil water dynamics n uptake n use efficiency and yield of table potatoes two treatments were set up in a three year field experiment treatments differed by irrigation and n application methods and scheduling water and n management in gi was managed according to typical best practice while irrigation and n for df was applied through drip fertigation according to a crop simulation model results showed that df provided high soil water content at the center of the ridge average soil water content across the ridge soil profile was higher for df than gi compared to df gi led to relatively high canopy growth early in the season through applying all n at planting while the opposite trend was detected later in the growing season tuber yields in gi were 46 43 and 44 t ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively tuber yields in df were 48 43 and 40 t ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively there was no significant difference in yield between systems for any of the three seasons of the experiment however df led to significantly higher tuber n recovery and agronomic n use efficiency in one of the years 2013 in addition gi caused greater nitrate leaching during the growing season in both 2013 and 2014 as measured by suction cups and simulated by the

will increase water use efficiency wue an alternative irrigation system to gi is drip irrigation which can save water by applying water close to the base of the plant i e the ridge center and only wetting a small area of soil drip irrigation is a more water efficient alternative to traditional sprinkler irrigation systems for potato waddell et al 1999 starr 2005 wang et al 2006 patel and rajput 2007 drip fertigation df which supplies soluble fertilizer through drip irrigation lines is a technique that combines drip irrigation with fertilization one merit of df is its flexibility to conduct in season split fertilization which can reduce nitrate leaching and increase nitrogen use efficiency nue compared to the usual practice of applying all n at planting most of the potato rhizospere is confined to a small area lesczynski and tanner 1976 asfary et al 1983 especially during early stages of growth applying all the basal n at one time will potentially increase n loss by nitrate leaching and leave inadequate n available for crop use at later stages by applying n continuously throughout the season df is a promising means for maintaining n concentration in the soil without undue leaching losses papadopoulos 1988 hebbar et al 2004 as well as maintaining lai crop n concentration and ultimately tuber yield hebbar et al 2004 a wide array of studies have derived optimal application rates of n for potato production meyer and marcum 1998 badr et al 2012 but these results were relatively static and did not consider how n mineralization in the root zone depends on varying environmental conditions for example soil texture root depth mineralization of soil organic matter and climate have significant effects on n availability in the root zone of potato and n requirements to assess n dynamics in both crop and soil and estimate crop n requirements crop models have been developed and used under varying environmental conditions peralta and stockle 2002 van delden et al 2003 daisy hansen et al 2012 was chosen to simulate n dynamics and subsequently guide in season n fertigation in the current study and a description of the model is presented in the m m section of this paper the objective of the study was to explore the response of crop growth tuber yield and soil water dynamics under two irrigation systems conventional gun irrigation gi and drip fertigation df the hypothesis was that compared to df gi may lead to inadequate soil water content in the center of the ridge which in turn causes lower n uptake tuber yield and n use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and crop management three field experiments with potato solanum tuberosum l cv folva in 2013 and cv sava in 2014 and 2015 were carried out at jyndevad research station denmark 54 53 60 n 9 07 30 e the soil at this experimental site was a coarse textured sandy soil containing ca 76 coarse sand 0 2 2 0 mm 15 fine sand 0 02 0 2 mm 4 silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 3 clay 0 002 mm the plant available water capacity is about 67 mm in the top 60 cm of soil further details on soil properties are described in zhou et al 2016 the annual average precipitation is 1000 mm when the soil temperature was at least 8 c at 0 10 m soil depth mother tubers were planted 0 08 m below ground level mother tubers were ridged with 15 cm of soil the plant density was 49382 plants per hectare planting occurred on 15th may 10th april and 23th april and emerged 7th june 21th may and 27th may for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fungicides were sprayed to control fungal diseases 2 2 daisy crop model description daisy simulates soil water carbon n balances heat and crop production in agro ecosystems under various management strategies hansen et al 2012 soil water balance is described by a numerical solution to the richards equation in 1 d or 2 d and the saturated water flow is described by darcy s equation hansen et al 1990 root water uptake is simulated by the single root concept hansen and abrahamsen 2009 photosynthesis is simulated by a simple light response curve hansen 2002 weather data solar radiation mean air temperature precipitation wind speed and relative humidity were measured at the danish met office meteorological station situated within 1 km from the field site management practices irrigation and n application were recorded daily to estimate the initial soil water and mineral n content at the start of each season daisy was run with a warm up period of 10 years using the historical weather and crop rotation records daisy has been demonstrated to excellently simulate dry matter and n balance in soil crop atmosphere systems in danish and other european condition heidmann et al 2008 moreover daisy potato module was calibrated by heidmann et al 2008 under the drip irrigation and sandy soil conditions prior to the current study and the potato variety folva used in the current study only year 2013 has been parameterized and included in daisy heidmann et al 2008 therefore the model calibrated prior to the current study provides a starting point for using daisy as decision support tool for n and irrigation scheduling 2 3 experimental design two treatments representing different systems were set up in each season gun irrigation gdsn120 and drip fertigation fdsnds irrigation was initiated when plant height was approximately 15 cm irrigation of gdsn120 was scheduled whenever the soil water deficit exceeded 25 mm using the results calculated in daisy the upper threshold of soil moisture was field capacity fc volumetric which was determined at the start of season with the time domain reflectrometry tdr 100 campbell logan utah usa equipment irrigation of fdsnds was scheduled every two days according to the preceding two days of soil water use which was also simulated using daisy the upper threshold of soil moisture for fdsnds was 90 fc drip lines with an emitter 1 l h 1 distance of 0 20 m were buried 0 03 m below the surface of the ridge both treatments had 30 kg p ha 1 and 180 kg k ha 1 applied at planting 120 kg n ha 1 was applied to gdsn120 as a basal dressing at planting n fertilization scheduling for fdsnds followed daisy model simulations of n demand based on critical nc actual na and potential np uptake levels of n in the crop hansen et al 1991 a fertilization amount of 20 kg n ha 1 was applied to fdsnds whenever na uptake approached the critical value nc which is the model threshold for n stress negatively affecting crop growth more details on the n uptake module of daisy are described in zhou et al 2017 fertigation n was given as a mixture of ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate n ratio 1 2 the experiment was a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates this resulted in 8 plots in total which were aligned in a north south direction individual plots were 6 m wide and 10 3 m long adjacent plots were separated by a buffer zone 4 m wide to prevent overlap of different irrigation systems shelters 3 m 6 5 m were used to cover the fdsnds when gdsn120 was receiving irrigation 2 4 soil water content soil water content was measured manually in two replicates of all irrigation treatments every two days before irrigation equipment used was a handheld computer allegro juniper systems inc logan utah usa connected to vertically installed tdr probes located at depths of 77 60 and 43 cm measured respectively from the top of the ridge a midway between the ridge and furrow b and from the base of the furrow c fig 1 details of the probe design and tdr trace interpretation software are given by thomsen 1994 and soil moisture content calculations by shahnazari et al 2007 2 5 measurement of canopy reflectance canopy reflectance in each plot was measured weekly using the active spectrometer rapidscan cs 45 holland scientific lincoln nebraska the field of view of the sensor is 45 by 10 spectral reflectance at red r670 nm red edge r730 nm and near infra red r780 nm are captured by the sensor ratio vegetation index rvi was calculated as r780nm r670nm the sensor was hand held 90 cm above the canopy during measurement in each plot it scanned along the row direction and returned an average value by integrating the measurement within a scanning area of 4 5 m2 per plot 2 6 final yield and tuber quality determination during the growing season defoliation was done by chemical desiccation at 71 76 or 81 days after emergence dae in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively potato tubers were harvested mechanically three weeks after defoliation for each plot yield and tuber quality were determined from four adjacent rows with an area of 3 6 m dry matter was determined after drying for 24 h at 80 c in a fan forced convection oven n concentration of each sample was analyzed by the kjeldahl method bremner and mulvaney 1982 200 tubers from each plot were evaluated for deformed tubers and green tubers 2 7 nitrate leaching dynamics of no3 within the soil were assessed with suction cups placed at 80 cm depth in each plot starting 2 weeks after planting and continuing until harvest the leaching water was sampled every 2 weeks or adjusted based on rainfall events when equilibrium was reached between the inner compartment and the soil solution soil water samples were frozen within a few hours and later analyzed for nitrate n on a technicon auto analyzer after addition of tartrate 2 8 statistical analysis and calculations t tests p 0 05 in the r software r core team 2016 were used to assess the effects of treatments on various agronomic parameters individually for each year water use efficiency wue was calculated as follows 1 w u e d m t o t e t a where dmtot is total plant dry matter and eta is actual evapotranspiration accumulated from plant emergence to harvest eta was simulated by the daisy model which used the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 to estimate eto tuber n recovery efficiency nre was calculated as 2 n r e n t u b n 0 n a where ntub is tuber n uptake n0 is tuber n uptake by the reference treatment zero n application indicating the soil n mineralization capacity na is applied n rate tuber n uptake rather than total n uptake was considered in eq 2 because only tubers were harvested while the rest of plants i e above ground parts still remained in the field thus nre indicates the efficiency of n removed from the field tuber n uptake in the reference treatment the reference treatment was set up adjacent the main experimental site was 30 32 and 40 kg n ha 1 for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively total n uptake ntot was calculated as the sum of root tuber and aboveground n uptake kg n ha 1 agronomic n use efficiency nuea was defined as 3 n u e a f y f y 0 n a where fy is fresh tuber yield in n fertilized treatments and fy0 is fresh tuber yield in the non n fertilized treatment tuber yields in reference treatment fy0 were 22 17 and 22 t ha 1 for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in order to test the daisy simulation of dry matter and n uptake of potato rrmse was calculated as 4 r r m s e 100 o i 1 n n i 1 s i o i 2 where s i and oi are predicted and observed values respectively o i is the mean of observed values n is the number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate conditions accumulated rainfall recorded in the three growing seasons from emergence to growth cessation was 183 mm 171 mm and 211 mm respectively fig 2 accumulated rainfall from the 1st irrigation until the end of the irrigation was 35 mm 150 mm and 165 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively relatively low precipitation during the irrigation treatment period led to higher irrigation requirements in 2013 than in the other two seasons accumulated reference evapotranspiration et0 in the three growing seasons was 196 mm 252 mm and 243 mm respectively average temperature in the three growing seasons was 16 0 17 0 and 14 8 c respectively 3 2 water consumption and soil water content compared to the water use in gdsn120 fdsnds consumed 1 and 17 mm less water in 2013 and 2014 respectively but 13 mm more in 2015 table 1 thus there was no pronounced water saving by df the average swc for gdsn120 were 10 4 10 6 and 12 3 for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively which were 0 3 1 4 and 1 8 volumetric lower than the swc of fdsnds for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively swc at the ridge position for fdsnds was typically higher than that in gdsn120 fig 3 for all seasons furthermore seasonal mean swcs at the ridge of fdsnds were greater than the swcs of gdsn120 at corresponding positions for all seasons table 2 among which the difference was significant p 0 05 in 2013 and 2015 with respect to shoulder and furrow swc in gdsn120 was relatively high compared to that in fdsnds only in 2013 while fdsnds had higher swc compared to that in gdsn120 in 2015 fig 3 and table 2 irrespective of irrigation systems the furrow bottom was relatively wetter than the ridge and shoulder position table 2 3 3 rvi development rvi is strongly related to leaf n concentration wang et al 2012 and aboveground dry matter and n uptake of potato zhou et al 2018 because rvi combines information from both the amount and photosynthetic activity of green leaf wohlfahrt et al 2010 and also covers a large sampling area in each plot rvi was measured in this study to compare the canopy development of the two systems in 2013 rvi in gdsn120 was generally high across the whole season fig 5 in 2014 rvi in gdsn120 was generally similar to rvi in fdsnds until 38dae after which rvi for fdsnds was consistently higher than that in gdsn120 from 48dae onwards fdsnds had relatively high rvi compared to that in gdsn120 in 2015 in the middle of the season gdsn120 had relatively high rvi compared to that in fdsnds the implications of these results are discussed below 3 4 nitrate leaching 3 4 1 soil water nitrate concentration measured at 80 cm soil depth in 2013 gdsn120 had a relatively high nitrate concentration during the growing season fig 6 on 31th august 2013 nitrate concentration was significantly p 0 05 higher in fdsnds than in gdsn120 on 21th october 2013 nitrate concentration was significantly lower for fdsnds than that in gdsn120 post season nitrate concentration was generally the same between gdsn120 and fdsnds in 2014 gdsn120 had a relatively high nitrate concentration compared to that in fdsnds during the growing season the first two sampling dates 3 4 2 nitrate leaching amount simulated by daisy to compare the different n application strategies of gdsn120 and fdsnds nitrate that was leached at the 80 cm soil depth during all growing seasons was simulated by daisy and was considered as n loss fig 7 there were occasions of high nitrate leaching in 2013 and 2015 peaks at fig 7 which were caused by high rainfall a few days before the peaks there was quite high nitrate leaching in gdsn120 the accumulated nitrate leaching during the growing season was 83 50 and 62 kg n ha 1 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in contrast the nitrate leaching in fdsnds was much less 33 27 and 29 kg n ha 1 in the growing seasons of 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 5 yield quality wue n uptake and n use efficiency for season 2015 fresh tuber yield fy for gdsn120 was 10 higher than that for fdsnds table 3 however for other years there was no difference tuber number did not respond to treatments table 3 in terms of tuber quality parameters no significant differences were found between the two systems the incidence of tuber defects was generally low table 4 eta and wue was the same between treatments except in 2015 where fdsnds had significant greater wue than gdsn120 due to a lesser eta df led to tuber n uptake of 98 kg n ha 1 with only 100 kg n ha 1 application in 2013 this caused a significantly higher nre of 68 for fdsnds in 2014 ntot ntub nre and nuea were similar between treatments in 2015 even though gdsn120 achieved significantly higher total and tuber n uptake both nre and nuea were the same between treatments due to a much lower n rate applied to fdsnds 3 6 validation of daisy simulation on soil water content tuber dry matter and n uptake soil water content vol was well simulated for fdsnds with rrmse of 11 0 14 2 and 17 3 in 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 8 respectively in contrast the swc simulation in gdsn120 was not as good as that in fdsnds the rrmse between simulated and swc was 13 8 26 4 and 27 8 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in 2014 daisy overestimated the swc in gdsn120 while in 2015 the simulation of swc in gdsn120 was too low the simulation of tuber dry matter resulted in good agreement between observed and simulated values fig 9 although the simulated dry matter was too high for fdsnds in 2014 rrmse 34 daisy over estimated tuber n uptake in all cases especially in gdsn120 rrmse 42 50 the simulation of tuber n uptake in fdsnds was generally good especially in 2014 rrmse 9 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption and soil water content due to fdsnds being irrigated more frequently than gdsn120 a relatively higher soil water availability was maintained in fdsnds there was no pronounced water saving by df furthermore a high canopy coverage was reached before first irrigation due to high rainfall in june 2013 and 2014 therefore the water loss by evaporation from the soil did not differ between fdsnds and gdsn120 in the literature it is generally agreed that drip irrigation requires less water compared to sprinkler irrigation shalhevet et al 1983 waddell et al 1999 starr et al 2008 even though the low threshold that triggers either drip or sprinkler irrigation varies among different experiments waddell et al 1999 swc at the ridge position for fdsnds was typically higher than that in gdsn120 fig 3 table 2 for all seasons corroborating the finding of cooley et al 2007 that swc in the ridge portion of the potato hill was greater under drip irrigation than sprinkler irrigation he found an increase in swc with drip irrigation by 3 2 compared with sprinkler irrigation this was caused by the fact that the center of ridge under gdsn120 was rather dry compared to that in fdsnds fig 4 a dry zone present in the center of the ridge under gun irrigation can be caused by the following factors 1 ridge geometry reduces infiltration of water from irrigation 2 stem flow which can increase swc in the center of ridge decreases as the crop develops saffigna et al 1976 3 as swc decreases water repellence increasingly reduces infiltration of water into the dry zone of the ridge hart et al 1994 robinson 1999 keizer et al 2007 however swc for gdsn120 in the ridge was still generally higher than expected this is likely because still 20 46 of the gun irrigation water on the canopy flows down the stems and increases the swc around the stems saffigna et al 1976 in addition it is likely that as tubers beneath the ridge developed they occupied a large portion of the soil volume in the hill so that irrigation water penetrated deeper saffigna et al 1976 thus wetting a larger soil volume and keeping swc at a relatively high level the furrow bottom was relatively wetter than the ridge and shoulder position corroborating the findings of starr et al 2008 this can be explained by low water uptake at the furrow compared with the ridge starr et al 2008 due to a relatively sparse root system compared to that in the ridge in addition the hill structure creates a downward surface flow of water along the sides of the ridges resulting in collection of water in the furrow it is reported in the literature that gun irrigation leads to high swc in the furrow and low swc in the ridge cooley et al 2007 this is because swc in the center of ridge does not respond to either sprinkler or rainfall as water repellency of dry sandy hydrophobic soil creates a downward flow on the outside of the ridge unless high rainfall occurs cooley et al 2007 robinson 1999 also found that under gun irrigation most of the water sheds off the ridges to the furrows due to the water repellent nature of sandy soils 4 2 nitrate leaching a relative high in season nitrate concentration at 80 cm depth was found for gdsn120 in both years fig 6 although only significantly higher than fdsnds in 2014 reducing the proportion of n applied at planting and applying the rest with split n can decrease nitrate leaching errebhi et al 1998 this was also confirmed by model simulation fig 7 so split n has been recommended as a best management policy rosen and bierman 2008 however other findings show that the supply of n may have little effect on nitrate leaching macdonald et al 1989 nieisen and jensen 1990 or at least n at rates up to the recommended application rate has only a slight effect on nitrate leaching gast et al 1978 thomsen et al 1993 the apparent contradictory conclusions may be due to the limitations of short term observations of nitrate leaching during the experiments gast et al 1978 chaney 1990 thomsen et al 1993 which are not adequate to make long term based conclusions however when high rates of n are supplied more n is expected to be left in plant residues in the long term this can lead to increased nitrate leaching davies and sylvester bradley 1995 4 3 yield wue n uptake n use efficiency and tuber quality opposite to our expectation difference of fresh tuber yield between drip fertigation and gun irrigation system was not found similar yield of drip fertigation and gun irrigation systems has also been reported in literature shalhevet et al 1983 waddell et al 1999 in this study a higher fy in fdsnds might have been achieved by applying n earlier thereby providing adequate n for early canopy growth this is corroborated by the low rvi in fdsnds compared to that in gdsn120 during early stages fig 5 the lesser canopy growth in fdsnds was probably due to inadequate 36 kg n ha 1 initial n supply westermann and kleinkopf 1985 found that a low n rate 67 kg n ha 1 at planting has negative effects on final yield by restricting leaf growth in contrast abundant early n application substantially promoted plant vegetative growth in gdsn120 fig 5 as also reported by vos 1995 delaying all non starter n until tuberization or later typically reduces yield and quality roberts et al 1982 millard and robinson 1990 the best strategy has to take into account that n application at planting should be sufficient for early canopy growth and supplementary n fertigation should be applied in time to avoid n deficiency another issue that may have masked the potential of drip fertigation was that both gdsn120 and fdsnds could have experienced drought stress for example in 2013 and 2015 wue total dry matter et for fdsnds and gdsn120 was higher than 5 0 g l 1 table 3 which is generally obtained in potato suffering from drought stress liu et al 2006 in this study tuber number did not differ between treatments table 3 it is generally accepted that tuberization is controlled by phytohormones including gibberillic and abscisic acids and these are influenced by exogenous factors such as n nutrition sattelmacher and marschner 1979 there is a potential negative effect of high n level on delaying tuberization and decreasing tuber number mack and schjoerring 2002 we hypothesized that 1 withholding n applications until some point will increase tuber number and yield 2 this practice of withholding n can reduce the canopy cover and result in lower yields roberts et al 1982 the 2nd hypothesis was partially confirmed by the relatively low canopy growth in early season as mentioned above with regards to the 1st hypothesis it was found by kolodziejczyk 2014 that the number of tuber per plant does not respond to n application rate there have been controversial results with regards to n s effect on tuber number sommerfeldt and knutson 1965 and de la morena et al 1994 found that high early season n rate either has no effect or decreases the numbers of tubers in contrast others observed that tuber numbers were increased dubetz and bole 1975 roberts et al 1982 zelalem et al 2009 jamaati e somarin et al 2010 however it is generally agreed that early season n fertilization consistently results in a delay in tuber initiation by 7 10 days kleinkopf et al 1981 df led to significantly higher nre only in 2013 in other seasons both nre and nuea were the same between treatments therefore we cannot confirm our hypothesis that gi has lower n use efficiency the hypothesis is based on the idea that gi will have inadequate swc in the center and shoulder of the ridge where most n is located however pronounced swc differences in the center or shoulder were not detected between the two irrigation systems in addition most roots accumulate in the top layers of sandy soils ahmadi et al 2011 and 90 of the root length is in the surface 25 cm of the soil profile lesczynski and tanner 1976 gi can wet large parts of the top soil as mentioned above fig 4 and saffigna et al 1976 and thereby provide adequate water for n movement towards root surfaces besides ahmadi et al 2011 found considerable root length density in the furrow portion in this study the furrow portion is where most water is concentrated particularly in gi fig 3 and this furrow portion thus contributes to water uptake as well as n uptake by the plant with regards to split n fertigation through df a clear advantage of split n was not found split n is generally preferable when n demand is high more than 200 kg n ha 1 as excessive shoot growth can be avoided with split n baker et al 1980 the incidence of tuber defects was generally low over all seasons bohmig et al 1975 reported that tuber greening and tuber deformation increased only with excessive n fertilization therefore the low incidence of tuber quality defects was probably due to the moderate n rate used in the current study it was expected that gun irrigation would cause erosion bohmig et al 1975 which will cause the increased risk of green tuber due to direct sunlight the canopy for gdsn120 was well developed during most irrigation events therefore the risk of direct splash erosion was reduced and only low incidence of green tubers was found 5 conclusions based on these comparisons between drip and gun irrigation there is no clear advantage of changing to drip irrigation management of drip irrigation is laborious as drip lines interfere with field operations e g hilling spraying and harvest burying drip lines under the depth of tillage could avoid the problems starr et al 2008 provided irrigation water could move upward to root zone which cannot however be achieved with soils as sandy as those used in this study although drip fertigation can supply water more efficiently to the ridge center confirming the hypothesis yield n uptake and n use efficiency were not improved with drip irrigation in contrast with our hypothesis the gun irrigation and drip fertigation treatments differed in irrigation method and scheduling as well as n regimes entangling the comparison of two treatments in terms of swc yield etc further research is needed to focus on isolated factors e g to explore effects of irrigation regimes while keeping n regimes the same for both gun and drip irrigation systems the experimental design deployed did not enable direct examination of the effect of split n compared to single dose n at planting to further explore the potential effect of split n we suggest to add another treatment where all n is supplied at planting while irrigation is done by

11501,we conducted a two year field research to evaluate the effect of three planting densities l 52 500 m 75 000 and h 97 500 plants ha 1 and three different planting patterns rf ridge with plastic film mulching fm flat planting with plastic film mulching and cp conventional planting without mulching on maize yield results showed that at each planting density average topsoil temperature 5 25 cm was improved under fm and rf relative to cp before silking this resulted in earlier emergence and accelerated plant development compared to cp rf significantly increased soil water storage sws at the end of the fallow season and provided non limiting water conditions for early seedling growth during the growing season when rainfall was more abundant rf prevented evapotranspiration et thereby favouring sws furthermore when rainfall was scarce rf provided the crop with additional soil moisture which resulted in increased et under rf and fm the two year average grain yield increased by 33 4 and 30 respectively while water use efficiency wue increased by 34 2 and 27 5 respectively similarly rainwater use efficiency rue increased by 35 6 and 32 1 respectively in a normal year 2015 grain yield wue and rue significantly increased as planting density increased from low to moderate but not in a dry year 2016 under such conditions no significant differences were observed in grain yield wue or rue among planting density treatments within the same planting pattern under moderate planting density the two year average final aboveground dry matter grain yield wue and rue in rf increased by 14 7 31 8 31 9 and 34 1 respectively compared to cp therefore we conclude that rf is the most suitable planting pattern under moderate planting density for increasing maize yield in the loess plateau in china keywords plastic film mulching soil temperature soil water maize growth evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction scarce precipitation and low water availability are the main factors limiting plant growth development and yield in arid and semi arid areas amanullah and adil 2015 gan et al 2009 approximately 60 of all cultivated land in china is dryland and approximately 40 of dryland farming is carried out in the region of the loess plateau editorial board of china agricultural yearbook 2001 water shortage is the primary factor limiting agricultural productivity and economic development in such areas li et al 2004a liu and zhang 2007 in the loess plateau of northwest china there is no more water available for crop irrigation thus rainfall is the major water resource for agricultural productivity li et al 2004b however rainfall is limited and high evaporation often limits crop yields in this area li et al 2013a b therefore it is essential to efficiently exploit rainwater resources to maximize crop yield and rainwater use efficiency rue which requires both better methods of capturing rainfall and reducing evaporation some technologies have recently been developed to enhance crop yield and rue in semi arid regions of china turner et al 2011 including mulching with plastic film zhou et al 2009 rainwater harvesting yuan et al 2003 ridge furrow mulching ren et al 2016 and crop residue retention kong 2014 among these agronomic measures mulching with plastic film is becoming a widely used technique in semi arid areas and has recently been widely adopted in the northwest loess plateau li et al 2004b liu et al 2014a 2014b various studies have shown that plastic film mulching significantly improved soil moisture conservation zhou et al 2009 increased topsoil temperature wang et al 2015 reduced evaporation liu et al 2014a 2014b suppressed weed growth hegazi and ogier 2000 and improved crop yield liu and siddique 2015 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting rf system is a new film mulching cultivation technology which includes a rainwater harvesting zone ridge and a planting zone furrow gan et al 2013 in the rf system the mulched ridges serve as a runoff surface that allows rainwater to be channelled to the furrows where rain can penetrate into the soil liu et al 2014a 2014b in addition rf planting can reduce topsoil evaporation and increase soil water storage thereby supplying sufficient water at critical crop growth stages to increase wue qin et al 2014 increasing planting density is a key practice used worldwide to increase maize yield and it is a simple and effective method for increasing yield in semi arid regions as well tokatlidis et al 2011 turgut et al 2005 griesh and yakout 2001 suggested that a planting density of 50 000 to 56 000 plants ha 1 is optimal because it reduced intraspecific competition thereby increasing yield however ryan et al 2011 reported that a planting density of 81 700 to 107 900 plants ha 1 resulted in the highest yield 12 500 kg ha 1 li et al 2013b showed that over a certain range of planting densities leaf area index lai and grain yield increased with increasing planting density however if planting density is too high leaf shading causes poor ventilation and light penetration resulting in thin stems increased maize lodging and decreased dry matter which ultimately lead to lower grain yield farnham 2001 nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 trachsel et al 2016 although many researchers have studied maize planting density research on the appropriate density of spring maize under the rf system has not been reported to improve maize yield and rue in the loess plateau of china it is important to determine the most suitable planting densities for spring maize under the rf and plastic film mulching cultivation systems therefore we tested different planting patterns under three planting densities the objectives of our study were 1 to determine the appropriate planting density and planting patterns for spring maize and 2 to investigate the efficiency of planting patterns utilizing different planting densities in terms of grain yield wue rue evapotranspiration and soil water storage 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description this research was performed in 2015 and 2016 in pengyang city ningxia province china the research site is

planting patterns rf ridge with plastic film mulching fm flat planting with plastic film mulching cp conventional planting without mulching the length and width of each plot were 12 0 m and 4 8 m respectively area 57 6 m2 a 1 2 m wide isolation belt in which maize was not planted as well as a ridge were established between each plot to prevent water leakage in the rf system the ridges and furrows were 60 cm wide and 15 cm high and the ridge was covered with plastic film 0 9 m wide and 0 008 mm thick plastic film covered furrows 70 cm in width were used for the fm treatment the row spacing of all treatments was 60 cm and the seeding spacing was as follows l 31 8 cm m 22 2 cm and h 17 1 cm the treatments are illustrated in fig 2 maize dafeng 30 was sown on april 23 2015 and april 21 2016 using a hole sowing machine at a seeding depth of 4 5 cm fertilizer application was the same for all treatments base fertilizer containing 150 kg ha 1 n and 150 kg ha 1 p2o5 was spread evenly over the furrow and ploughed into the soil layer and topsoil fertilizer containing 150 kg ha 1 n was applied at the 11 leaf stage hanway 1963 july 10 2015 and july 8 2016 the crops were harvested on october 10 2015 and october 5 2016 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil temperature daily variation in soil temperature at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm depths between individual maize plants was monitored with a mercury in glass geothermometer each measurement was repeated three times measurements were obtained at the maize 3 leaf stage may 22 28 2015 and may 19 26 2016 at the 6 leaf stage june 18 25 2015 and june 15 23 2016 at the 11 leaf stage july 7 15 2015 and july 6 12 2016 at the silking stage july 28 to august 5 2015 and july 24 31 2016 at the blister stage august 24 30 2015 and august 20 29 2016 and at the dough stage september 6 16 2015 and september 21 30 2016 temperatures were recorded on five sunny days at 08 00 10 00 12 00 14 00 16 00 18 00 and 20 00 during each growth stage average daily temperature was calculated and the average value for the five days was reported as the soil temperature at each growth stage 2 3 2 soil water storage and evapotranspiration soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer was measured using a 54 mm diameter steel core sampling tube ferraro and ghersa 2007 before sowing and at emergence 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking and at blister and maturity stages samples were collected at every 10 cm from the 0 20 cm soil layer and at every 20 cm from the 20 200 cm soil layer sampling within each planting pattern treatment was done according to the following criteria for the rf treatment the soil cores were sampled from the middle of a ridge from the middle of a furrow and between two plants within the same row for the fm treatment one sample was obtained between two plants and two samples between two rows one in the plastic film and the other outside the plastic film finally for the cp treatment two samples were obtained between two rows and one between two plants on the same row after their wet weight was determined the soil samples were dried for 48 h in an oven at 105 c until a constant weight was reached the soil water content was calculated as the mean of the measurements at the three positions and was replicated three times per plot the evapotranspiration et was calculated in accordance with the water balance formula huang et al 2005 1 e t p i c s w s t 1 s w s t 2 d r where p mm is the precipitation during the maize growing season i mm is the amount of irrigation i 0 and c mm is the upward flow into the root zone the groundwater level was approximately 80 m below the soil surface thus groundwater flow to the roots could be neglected swst1 mm is the soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer at t1 days after planting dap and swst2 mm is the sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer at t2 dap d mm is the drainage below the measured root zone and was assumed to be zero because of the deeply measured soil depth 200 cm and the absence of extreme rain events during both experimental years r mm is the surface runoff although there was no runoff during the experiment because of the flat field and surrounding border ridges for each plot li et al 2013a wu et al 2015 thus i c and r in eq 2 were zero for all plots the sws was calculated using the following equation dam et al 2005 ren et al 2008 2 s w s i n h i p i b

20 40 200 2 3 3 maize development and leaf area index six square metres of ground in each plot were marked after sowing days after planting dap or from sowing to emergence 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking dough and maturity stages were recorded the specific stage was established only when 50 or more plants within the 6 m2 marked plots were at that particular stage plants from 1 m2 subplots were sampled from each plot at the 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking blister and dough stages in each experimental year and the leaf area of these plants were measured the length and maximum width of each leaf were measured using a ruler and the leaf area index lai was estimated as the total leaf area per square meter ritchie et al 1993 2 3 4 aboveground dry matter and grain yield the same plants from each 1 m2 subplot were used to measure aboveground dry matter after measuring leaf area at the 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking and blister and dough stages aboveground dry matter was determined after plants were oven dried at 70 c for a minimum of 48 h to constant weight at harvest two rows 6 m 1 2 m of maize were hand harvested from each plot on october 10 2015 and october 5 2016 grain yield was determined based on grain that had been sun dried until water content was down to 13 2 3 5 water use efficiency wue and rainwater use efficiency rue the wue kg mm 1 ha 1 and rue kg mm 1 ha 1 were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively as described by huang et al 2005 and payero et al 2008 3 w u e y e t 4 r u e y p where y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 et is the evapotranspiration during the entire growth period mm and p is the precipitation during the entire growth period mm 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analysed with a residual test method prior to statistical analysis the data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances and were normally distributed the analysis of variance was performed using spss 13 0 spss inc chicago il usa the data from each sampling event were analysed separately the means among treatments were compared based on the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil temperature soil temperature in the 0 25 cm top soil layers were significantly higher under flat planting with plastic film fm than those in the corresponding layers under conventional flat planting cp before the silking stage 0 98 dap under the three planting densities and in the two years of study figs 3 and 4 after silking temperature in the same soil layers were significantly higher in the fm treatment than those in the cp treatment in 2016 but not in 2015 further temperature in the 10 25 cm top soil layers were higher under rf than under cp throughout all six growth stages in both years the average soil temperature of the five layers at the six stages under fm and rf treatments increased by 2 1 c and 0 5 c in 2015 and by 3 0 c and 0 9 c in 2016 respectively compared to the cp treatment differences in soil temperature observed among the three planting densities tested under the same planting pattern were small the average soil temperature of the five layers at the six growth stages under the low and moderate planting densities increased by 0 7 c and 0 3 c in 2015 and by 0 5 c and 0 1 c in 2016 respectively compared with the high planting density treatment 3 2 maize development results of anova showed that planting density pd did not affect maize development significantly in either year under study p 0 05 table 2 in contrast the effect of planting pattern on maize development at different stages was significant p 0 01 or p 0 05 the number of days to emergence 3 leaf 6 leaf dough and maturity stages under fm at the three planting densities was significantly lower than either under rf or cp the two year mean values showed that seedling emergence occurred 2 2 and 4 7 days earlier in fm than in rf and cp plots respectively dough stage in the fm treatment was reached 11 7 and 15 5 days earlier than in rf and cp treatments respectively grain maturity was reached 10 1 and 14 2 days later in rf and cp respectively than in fm plots thus rf fm and cp treatments were harvested at grain maturity 165 3 156 6 and 170 4 days respectively in 2015 a year with normal rainfall whereas in 2016 a dry year the crop cycle was shortened to 162 0 150 5 and 165 1 days respectively 3 3 soil water storage no significant difference was observed in soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil layers in any of the treatments at the emergence or 3 leaf stages in 2015 12 and 31 dap respectively fig 5 however in 2016 the sws under the rf treatment was significantly higher than that in the fm and cp treatments at the same two growth stages this effect might have been due to the delivery of more rainwater to the soil through the ridge under the rf system during the fallow season on the other hand in 2015 the sws in each treatment decreased to a minimum at the blister stage 128 dap thereafter and until maturity 128 170 dap sws increased due to 104 mm of precipitation fig 6 since less precipitation occurred early in the dry year 2016 fig 7 sws in each treatment gradually decreased before the 11 leaf stage 0 78 dap from this point until silking stage 78 97 dap 114 mm of rainfall accumulated resulting in an increase in sws in each treatment by silking a higher maximum sws was recorded under rf than under the fm and cp treatments 3 4 evapotranspiration in 2015 at the same planting density evapotranspiration et was significantly higher under fm and cp than under rf fig 6 at three growth stages before the 11 leaf stage i e 0 31 31 59 and 59 78 dap however at three stages after the 11 leaf stage 78 98 98 128 and 128 170 dap et was higher in rf than in fm or cp plots as planting density increased et increased during the early three growth stages 0 31 31 59 59 78 dap in 2015 however from silking to blister stage 98 128 dap and from blister to maturity 128 170 dap et decreased in each planting pattern treatment with increasing planting density in 2016 when the soil moisture conditions were higher during the early growth stages 0 30 30 60 dap fig 7 et was higher in fm and cp than in rf plots at all three planting densities during the latter growth stages 125 165 dap and during periods of less precipitation 60 78 dap et was lower in fm and cp than in rf plots from 11 leaf to silking 78 97 dap 114 mm rainfall were registered in july and et was higher therefore et did not differ significantly among treatments et increased with increasing planting density in all three planting pattern treatments during the early growth stages 0 30 30 60 78 97 dap however in the late growth stages 125 165 dap et decreased as the planting density increased regardless of planting pattern 3 5 soil water change in root zone based on the anova in the fallow season the effect of planting density on soil water change swc was not significant p 0 05 table 3 whereas the effect of planting pattern on swc was highly significant p 0 01 during the fallow period in 2015 a total of 115 6 mm of rainfall were recorded thereby increasing sws in all treatments at the end of the fallow season further the soil water increase under rf was significantly higher than that under cp or fm treatments at the same planting density compared with 2015 in 2016 soil water increase was less during the fallow season in this case soil water increase in rf and fm was significantly higher than in cp plots regardless of planting density during the two years compared to fm rf treatment allowed more rainwater to collect during the fallow period thus providing the highest soil moisture over the growing season in two consecutive cropping cycles the effects of planting density and planting pattern on swc was significant p 0 05 and highly significant p 0 01 respectively table 3 the swc in rf plots was significantly lower than in fm and cp plots in the normal year 2015 however in the dry year 2016 swc under the rf treatment was significantly higher than under the cp treatment this showed that in normal years the rf system collected and stored rainwater in the soil which heled maintain soil moisture balance and thus provided more moisture to the crop during the dry year the formula 1 shows that the calculation of et mainly consists of swc and amount of precipitation two year data showed that percent swc relative to et was 20 33 during the growing season on the other hand percent precipitation relative to et was 67 80 this indicates that et follows mainly precipitation during the growing season especially in the dry years in contrast in normal years under low and medium plant density the swc et ratio under rf was significantly lower than under fm or cp however in the dry year at all three plant densities tested the swc et under rf was significantly higher than under cp therefore in normal years et is mostly derived from rainfall under rf compared to fm and cp which promotes the utilization of rainfall conversely in the dry years rf may store more moisture in the soil during the fallow season thus supplying water to the crop during the growing season 3 6 leaf area index and aboveground dry matter during 2015 and 2016 the leaf area index lai peaked at silking 98 dap and decreased gradually thereafter fig 8 maize lai at 6 leaf 11 leaf and silking stages was significantly higher under rf and fm than under cp at the same planting density no significant differences in lai were noted between the rf and fm treatments before the silking stage in 2015 no significant differences in lai were observed in the rf and fm treatments at low planting density at the blister and dough stages 125 and 142 dap however at moderate and high planting densities lai was significantly higher in rf than in fm plots in 2016 lai at the blister and the dough stages was significantly higher under rf than under fm at all three planting densities under the same planting density there was no significant difference in aboveground dry matter between different planting patterns at the 3 leaf 30 dap or 6 leaf stages 60 dap in both years fig 9 after the 6 leaf stage aboveground dry matter was significantly higher in rf and fm than in cp plots in 2015 at 11 leaf 78 dap and at silking 98 dap stages under low and moderate planting densities aboveground dry matter was significantly higher in fm than in rf plots although the difference was not significant at the higher density in the dry year 2016 aboveground dry matter after silking 97 dap was higher under rf than under fm at all three planting densities after silking aboveground dry matter increased significantly with increasing planting density under all three planting patterns during the two years of study 3 7 final aboveground dry matter and grain yield the anova revealed highly significant effects of planting density and pattern on final aboveground dry matter fadm in both years p 0 01 table 4 in 2015 there was no significant difference in the fadm obtained with different planting patterns at low planting density however at moderate and high planting density fadm was significantly higher in the rf and fm treatments than in the cp treatment compared to fadm in cp the average fadm obtained under rf and fm treatments increased by 14 2 and 12 7 in 2015 and by 20 2 and 16 5 in 2016 respectively significantly higher fadm was associated with rf and fm treatments than with cp treatment at the three planting densities tested in 2016 however no significant difference was observed between fm and rf the mean values showed that fadm increased significantly with increasing planting density in both years based on the anova the effect of planting density on grain yield was significant in 2015 p 0 01 table 2 but not in 2016 p 0 05 in contrast the effect of planting pattern on grain yield was significant p 0 01 in both years there was no significant difference in the grain yield obtained using rf or fm treatments at the same planting density but grain yield was significantly p 0 05 higher in rf and fm treatments than in the cp treatment the average grain yield under rf and fm treatments increased by 20 5 and 17 9 in 2015 and by 52 9 and 48 5 in 2016 respectively compared to the cp treatment no significant difference in grain yield at three planting densities was observed in 2016 but in 2015 grain yield under moderate and high planting densities was significantly higher than under low planting density compared to low planting density average grain yield obtained at moderate and high planting densities increased by 6 5 and 10 3 in 2015 and by 3 9 and 1 8 in 2016 respectively 3 8 water use efficiency and rainwater use efficiency the anova revealed significant effects of planting density on wue and rue in 2015 p 0 01 but not in 2016 p 0 05 table 4 the effects of planting pattern on wue and rue were significant p 0 01 in both years wue and rue were significantly higher under rf and fm than under cp at all planting densities in both years compared to cp average wue in rf and fm treatments increased by 23 6 and 16 8 in 2015 and by 45 1 and 38 4 in 2016 respectively average rue under rf and fm treatments increased by 20 5 and 17 9 in 2015 and by 52 9 and 48 5 in 2016 respectively under moderate and high planting densities wue and rue were significantly higher than under low density in 2015 whereas in 2016 there were no significant differences in wue or rue among planting density treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil temperature soil water and evapotranspiration the use of plastic film mulch prevents water and heat exchange between soil and air thereby reducing latent heat flux zhou et al 2009 additionally mulching with plastic films reportedly improves soil temperature in the 0 15 cm top layer thereby reducing the number of days to germination and enhancing early seedling growth li et al 1999 our two year study yielded similar results soil temperature in the fm treatment was significantly higher at all three planting densities than in the cp treatment before silking 0 98 dap figs 3 and 4 li et al 2001 showed that the average soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm in plastic film mulched plots was 0 5 4 5 c greater than that in non mulched plots wang et al 2005 found that early during the growing season the topsoil temperature in an rf system was 3 0 6 8 c higher than in an uncovered flat planting treatment whereas later in the growing season no difference was found between the two conditions our own observations of soil temperature at depths of 10 15 cm 15 20 cm and 20 25 cm corroborate that in the rf treatment temperatures at the aforementioned depths in the soil profile before silking were higher than those in the cp treatment while after silking the differences in soil temperature under the different treatments decreased fig 3 this result was probably due to the larger plant canopy which reduced considerably the incidence of solar radiation on the ground consistently with this result we also found that the soil temperature in the 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm topsoil layers under the rf treatment were slightly lower than those under the cp treatment at blister 128 dap and dough 145 dap stages in 2015 this is surely because the rf system collects more rainwater into the surface soil due to the more abundant rainwater registered during these two development stages maize production in semi arid regions of china is greatly affected by the amount and distribution of seasonal rainfall over the cropping cycle where frequent drought can negatively affect maize growth and yield blanco moure et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 at the site of our study in ningxia province the average annual rainfall over 40 years was 410 mm but the average annual potential evaporation is 1753 mm overcoming this imbalance in order to provide sufficient water is crucial both for maize production and for the economy of northwest china grassini et al 2009 the rf system can efficiently maintain a higher swc during maize growth thereby promoting crop growth and increasing wue and grain yield gan et al 2013 plastic film mulching directly reduces evaporation from the soil surface in addition water moves from the deeper soil layers to the topsoil by capillarity and vapour transfer thereby maintaining a relatively stable topsoil moisture content tian et al 2003 in our two year study sws at each growth stage was higher in the rf treatment than in the fm or cp treatments this finding is consistent with the results reported by li and gong 2002 and by zhang et al 2007 whose studies suggest that rf is an advanced system that increases soil water availability by reducing water evaporation and increasing the penetration of light rain deeper into the soil profile previous studies have shown that the rf system yielded the best rainwater harvesting capacity and increased soil moisture while low soil water and high evapotranspiration were observed under conventional planting without mulching li et al 2013a wu et al 2015 as these previous studies our results show that the rf treatment promotes full use of rainfall during a normal year 2015 while in a dry year it can supply maize the rainwater stored in the soil during the fallow season table 3 and fig 5 other studies have indicated that the rf treatment increases both soil moisture content and water lost through transpiration resulting in a higher et than is observed in conventional flat planting li et al 2013a qin et al 2014 our two year field study showed that total et over the entire maize growth period did not differ significantly among treatments table 4 this is because et differs at different stages in each treatment figs 6 and 7 at the same planting density et was lower in the rf treatment than in the cp treatment at the early growth stages 0 30 and 30 60 dap whereas at the late stages 128 165 dap and at those with less rainfall 60 78 dap et was higher in the rf than in the cp treatment this is explained because of the strong winds and the smaller lai during the early maize growth stages which resulted in increased evapotranspiration in the cp treatment with respect to the rf system feng et al 2016 kang et al 2003 our results are similar to those of li et al 2002 and niu et al 2004 who suggested that the rf system concentrates the surface runoff stores water in the root zone and stores water during dry periods even though rainwater is not available to the crop in addition other studies have shown that the rf system can retain the surface runoff from heavy rains jia et al 2006 prevent soil water evaporation increase soil moisture content zhang et al 2007 prolong the period during which moisture is available to the crop and supply water at critical growth stages li et al 2000 4 2 maize growth and yield the two year experimental data showed that lai before silking was significantly higher in the rf than in the cp treatment because soil temperature and soil water storage were higher in the in the former than in the latter at that time figs 3 5 thus the rf system provided better conditions for plant growth our results are similar to those of gan et al 2013 and ren et al 2008 who showed that the ridge with plastic film mulching provides adequate hydrothermal conditions to accelerate crop development at the blister and dough stages in 2016 lai at all three planting densities was significantly higher in the rf treatment than in the fm treatment fig 8 this result was mainly explained by the occurrence of less rainfall after silking in 2016 and concomitantly lower sws which led to premature leaf senescence under the fm treatment our results are consistent with those of balkcom et al 2011 and amanullah 2007 who reported that lai increased as the planting density increased however lai decreased more rapidly after silking at the higher planting density we found that lai increased with increasing density from the 6 leaf to silking stage and at high planting density lai decreased rapidly after silking especially in the dry year in the dry year 2016 aboveground dry matter after silking was higher in the rf treatment than in the fm treatment possibly because the flat plastic film mulching provided favourable soil water and temperature conditions and greater evapotranspiration during early maize growth ma et al 2008 xue et al 2008 whereas the soil water deficit was serious under fm treatment and significantly affected maize growth after silking fig 5 lu et al 2005 suggested that the effect of planting density on dry matter accumulation is mainly evident after silking similar conclusions were drawn from our study aboveground dry matter after silking obviously increased as planting density increased under same planting pattern li et al 2004b found that rf systems can increase deep soil moisture and avoid severe drought at critical growth stages thereby increasing biomass and grain yield similar trends were observed in the present study aboveground dry matter and grain yield showed a significant increase under rf and fm treatments relative to the cp treatment a previous study showed that precipitation was positively correlated with grain yield both in rf systems and in conventional planting ye and liu 2012 the results of our study are consistent with earlier reports of lower grain yield in each treatment in the dry year 2016 than in the normal year 2015 these effects were possibly due to the following factors in 2016 soil moisture decreased due to less rainfall after maize silking fig 5 thus from silking to grain filling stage 97 125 dap soil water could not meet the moisture demand of maize and et was reduced fig 7 this also led to significantly lower lai and aboveground dry matter at this stage in 2016 than in 2015 figs 8 and 9 however in 2015 sws increased due to more rainfall during the grain filling stage fig 5 which resulted in significantly higher et from silking to grain filling 98 128 dap than in 2016 fig 6 this eventually allowed for a higher grain yield in 2015 than in 2016 no significant difference in grain yield was noted between the moderate and high planting densities in the same planting pattern in the two years this result may be explained because plants growing at high planting densities consume more water if low rainfall occurs during the time from silking to blister stage rainfall and soil water cannot meet the demand of maize for moisture under high planting density conditions 4 3 water use efficiency and rainwater use efficiency maintaining soil moisture content and improving wue and rue are key factors in a rain fed farming system in which annual precipitation exceeds evaporation deng et al 2006 turner 2004 many studies have shown that rf systems make better use of rainwater thereby improving the availability of water to crops and increasing grain yield and the wue as a result compared with conventional planting ren et al 2015 wu et al 2015 our study showed that wue was significantly higher in the rf and fm treatments than in the cp treatment at all planting densities in both the normal and the dry years studies have shown that the highest wue was found for the rf system mainly because it improves grain yield while reducing et lu et al 2014 varga et al 2013 our two year study yielded similar results average et was lower under the rf treatment than under the cp treatment and grain yield was significantly higher than that obtained with the cp treatment in arid and semi arid areas higher rue is generally associated with increased crop yield ren et al 2016 in our results rue in the rf treatment was significantly higher in the dry year than in the normal year additionally average rue in the rf treatment increased by 20 5 in 2015 and by 52 9 in 2016 respectively compared with the cp treatment our results are similar to those obtained in a simulated rainfall study by ren et al 2008 who found that with simulated rainfall rue of maize was 73 greater under rf than under conventional planting when rainfall was 230 mm and 40 greater when the rainfall was 340 mm but no difference between the rf treatment and conventional planting was noted when rainfall was 440 mm rainfall is the most important factor when evaluating crop water management strategies in semi arid regions we found that growing maize at moderate density on ridges covered with plastic film had positive effects which manifested as increased grain yield wue and rue these positive effects were possibly due to the following factors 1 as soil temperature increased figs 3 and 4 maize emerged earlier table 2 grew and developed faster and accumulated more aboveground dry matter fig 9 table 4 ultimately resulting in increased grain yield table 4 2 during the fallow and the cropping seasons mulching on the ridges collected more water in the soil table 3 and increased sws fig 5 thereby providing more water for maize during the reproductive growth stages figs 6 and 7 and increasing lai fig 8 final aboveground dry matter grain yield wue and rue table 4 yield and rue of maize are affected by soil moisture temperature light nutrients and many other factors whether or not rf systems increase yield and rue by increasing plant photosynthetic capacity and or nutrient use efficiency requires further study 5 conclusions in an rf system with a moderate planting density m 75 000 plants ha 1 average aboveground dry matter grain yield wue and rue were higher than those obtained through conventional planting although maximum aboveground dry matter was obtained at high planting density h 97 500 plant ha 1 the average grain yield wue and rue were not significantly different from those obtained at moderate planting density especially in the dry year in the long term the use of an rf system with moderate planting density is an innovative planting practice that can increase maize yield and rue in the

11501,we conducted a two year field research to evaluate the effect of three planting densities l 52 500 m 75 000 and h 97 500 plants ha 1 and three different planting patterns rf ridge with plastic film mulching fm flat planting with plastic film mulching and cp conventional planting without mulching on maize yield results showed that at each planting density average topsoil temperature 5 25 cm was improved under fm and rf relative to cp before silking this resulted in earlier emergence and accelerated plant development compared to cp rf significantly increased soil water storage sws at the end of the fallow season and provided non limiting water conditions for early seedling growth during the growing season when rainfall was more abundant rf prevented evapotranspiration et thereby favouring sws furthermore when rainfall was scarce rf provided the crop with additional soil moisture which resulted in increased et under rf and fm the two year average grain yield increased by 33 4 and 30 respectively while water use efficiency wue increased by 34 2 and 27 5 respectively similarly rainwater use efficiency rue increased by 35 6 and 32 1 respectively in a normal year 2015 grain yield wue and rue significantly increased as planting density increased from low to moderate but not in a dry year 2016 under such conditions no significant differences were observed in grain yield wue or rue among planting density treatments within the same planting pattern under moderate planting density the two year average final aboveground dry matter grain yield wue and rue in rf increased by 14 7 31 8 31 9 and 34 1 respectively compared to cp therefore we conclude that rf is the most suitable planting pattern under moderate planting density for increasing maize yield in the loess plateau in china keywords plastic film mulching soil temperature soil water maize growth evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction scarce precipitation and low water availability are the main factors limiting plant growth development and yield in arid and semi arid areas amanullah and adil 2015 gan et al 2009 approximately 60 of all cultivated land in china is dryland and approximately 40 of dryland farming is carried out in the region of the loess plateau editorial board of china agricultural yearbook 2001 water shortage is the primary factor limiting agricultural productivity and economic development in such areas li et al 2004a liu and zhang 2007 in the loess plateau of northwest china there is no more water available for crop irrigation thus rainfall is the major water resource for agricultural productivity li et al 2004b however rainfall is limited and high evaporation often limits crop yields in this area li et al 2013a b therefore it is essential to efficiently exploit rainwater resources to maximize crop yield and rainwater use efficiency rue which requires both better methods of capturing rainfall and reducing evaporation some technologies have recently been developed to enhance crop yield and rue in semi arid regions of china turner et al 2011 including mulching with plastic film zhou et al 2009 rainwater harvesting yuan et al 2003 ridge furrow mulching ren et al 2016 and crop residue retention kong 2014 among these agronomic measures mulching with plastic film is becoming a widely used technique in semi arid areas and has recently been widely adopted in the northwest loess plateau li et al 2004b liu et al 2014a 2014b various studies have shown that plastic film mulching significantly improved soil moisture conservation zhou et al 2009 increased topsoil temperature wang et al 2015 reduced evaporation liu et al 2014a 2014b suppressed weed growth hegazi and ogier 2000 and improved crop yield liu and siddique 2015 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting rf system is a new film mulching cultivation technology which includes a rainwater harvesting zone ridge and a planting zone furrow gan et al 2013 in the rf system the mulched ridges serve as a runoff surface that allows rainwater to be channelled to the furrows where rain can penetrate into the soil liu et al 2014a 2014b in addition rf planting can reduce topsoil evaporation and increase soil water storage thereby supplying sufficient water at critical crop growth stages to increase wue qin et al 2014 increasing planting density is a key practice used worldwide to increase maize yield and it is a simple and effective method for increasing yield in semi arid regions as well tokatlidis et al 2011 turgut et al 2005 griesh and yakout 2001 suggested that a planting density of 50 000 to 56 000 plants ha 1 is optimal because it reduced intraspecific competition thereby increasing yield however ryan et al 2011 reported that a planting density of 81 700 to 107 900 plants ha 1 resulted in the highest yield 12 500 kg ha 1 li et al 2013b showed that over a certain range of planting densities leaf area index lai and grain yield increased with increasing planting density however if planting density is too high leaf shading causes poor ventilation and light penetration resulting in thin stems increased maize lodging and decreased dry matter which ultimately lead to lower grain yield farnham 2001 nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 trachsel et al 2016 although many researchers have studied maize planting density research on the appropriate density of spring maize under the rf system has not been reported to improve maize yield and rue in the loess plateau of china it is important to determine the most suitable planting densities for spring maize under the rf and plastic film mulching cultivation systems therefore we tested different planting patterns under three planting densities the objectives of our study were 1 to determine the appropriate planting density and planting patterns for spring maize and 2 to investigate the efficiency of planting patterns utilizing different planting densities in terms of grain yield wue rue evapotranspiration and soil water storage 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description this research was performed in 2015 and 2016 in pengyang city ningxia province china the research site is

potential evaporation is 1753 mm the amount of rainfall during the maize growing season was 335 2 mm in 2015 a normal year and 251 6 mm in 2016 a dry year the monthly amounts of rainfall and air temperature during the maize fallow and growing seasons in both years as well as the 40 year monthly mean rainfall 1977 2016 are shown in fig 1 according to the fao unesco soil classification system fao unesco 1993 the soil at the research site was a calcic cambisol 14 sand 26 silt and 60 clay the topsoil had a ph of 8 5 and a mean bulk density of 1 34 g cm 3 the characteristics of the soil at a depth of 0 60 cm at the research site are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the experiment consisted of a completely randomized block design with three replications in 2015 16 we conducted field research on the loess plateau of china to evaluated the effects of three planting densities l 52 500 plants ha 1 m 75 000 plants ha 1 h 97 500 plants ha 1 and three different planting patterns rf ridge with plastic film mulching fm flat planting with plastic film mulching cp conventional planting without mulching the length and width of each plot were 12 0 m and 4 8 m respectively area 57 6 m2 a 1 2 m wide isolation belt in which maize was not planted as well as a ridge were established between each plot to prevent water leakage in the rf system the ridges and furrows were 60 cm wide and 15 cm high and the ridge was covered with plastic film 0 9 m wide and 0 008 mm thick plastic film covered furrows 70 cm in width were used for the fm treatment the row spacing of all treatments was 60 cm and the seeding spacing was as follows l 31 8 cm m 22 2 cm and h 17 1 cm the treatments are illustrated in fig 2 maize dafeng 30 was sown on april 23 2015 and april 21 2016 using a hole sowing machine at a seeding depth of 4 5 cm fertilizer application was the same for all treatments base fertilizer containing 150 kg ha 1 n and 150 kg ha 1 p2o5 was spread evenly over the furrow and ploughed into the soil layer and topsoil fertilizer containing 150 kg ha 1 n was applied at the 11 leaf stage hanway 1963 july 10 2015 and july 8 2016 the crops were harvested on october 10 2015 and october 5 2016 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil temperature daily variation in soil temperature at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm depths between individual maize plants was monitored with a mercury in glass geothermometer each measurement was repeated three times measurements were obtained at the maize 3 leaf stage may 22 28 2015 and may 19 26 2016 at the 6 leaf stage june 18 25 2015 and june 15 23 2016 at the 11 leaf stage july 7 15 2015 and july 6 12 2016 at the silking stage july 28 to august 5 2015 and july 24 31 2016 at the blister stage august 24 30 2015 and august 20 29 2016 and at the dough stage september 6 16 2015 and september 21 30 2016 temperatures were recorded on five sunny days at 08 00 10 00 12 00 14 00 16 00 18 00 and 20 00 during each growth stage average daily temperature was calculated and the average value for the five days was reported as the soil temperature at each growth stage 2 3 2 soil water storage and evapotranspiration soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer was measured using a 54 mm diameter steel core sampling tube ferraro and ghersa 2007 before sowing and at emergence 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking and at blister and maturity stages samples were collected at every 10 cm from the 0 20 cm soil layer and at every 20 cm from the 20 200 cm soil layer sampling within each planting pattern treatment was done according to the following criteria for the rf treatment the soil cores were sampled from the middle of a ridge from the middle of a furrow and between two plants within the same row for the fm treatment one sample was obtained between two plants and two samples between two rows one in the plastic film and the other outside the plastic film finally for the cp treatment two samples were obtained between two rows and one between two plants on the same row after their wet weight was determined the soil samples were dried for 48 h in an oven at 105 c until a constant weight was reached the soil water content was calculated as the mean of the measurements at the three positions and was replicated three times per plot the evapotranspiration et was calculated in accordance with the water balance formula huang et al 2005 1 e t p i c s w s t 1 s w s t 2 d r where p mm is the precipitation during the maize growing season i mm is the amount of irrigation i 0 and c mm is the upward flow into the root zone the groundwater level was approximately 80 m below the soil surface thus groundwater flow to the roots could be neglected swst1 mm is the soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer at t1 days after planting dap and swst2 mm is the sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer at t2 dap d mm is the drainage below the measured root zone and was assumed to be zero because of the deeply measured soil depth 200 cm and the absence of extreme rain events during both experimental years r mm is the surface runoff although there was no runoff during the experiment because of the flat field and surrounding border ridges for each plot li et al 2013a wu et al 2015 thus i c and r in eq 2 were zero for all plots the sws was calculated using the following equation dam et al 2005 ren et al 2008 2 s w s i n h i p i b

20 40 200 2 3 3 maize development and leaf area index six square metres of ground in each plot were marked after sowing days after planting dap or from sowing to emergence 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking dough and maturity stages were recorded the specific stage was established only when 50 or more plants within the 6 m2 marked plots were at that particular stage plants from 1 m2 subplots were sampled from each plot at the 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking blister and dough stages in each experimental year and the leaf area of these plants were measured the length and maximum width of each leaf were measured using a ruler and the leaf area index lai was estimated as the total leaf area per square meter ritchie et al 1993 2 3 4 aboveground dry matter and grain yield the same plants from each 1 m2 subplot were used to measure aboveground dry matter after measuring leaf area at the 3 leaf 6 leaf 11 leaf silking and blister and dough stages aboveground dry matter was determined after plants were oven dried at 70 c for a minimum of 48 h to constant weight at harvest two rows 6 m 1 2 m of maize were hand harvested from each plot on october 10 2015 and october 5 2016 grain yield was determined based on grain that had been sun dried until water content was down to 13 2 3 5 water use efficiency wue and rainwater use efficiency rue the wue kg mm 1 ha 1 and rue kg mm 1 ha 1 were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively as described by huang et al 2005 and payero et al 2008 3 w u e y e t 4 r u e y p where y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 et is the evapotranspiration during the entire growth period mm and p is the precipitation during the entire growth period mm 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analysed with a residual test method prior to statistical analysis the data met the assumption of homogeneity of variances and were normally distributed the analysis of variance was performed using spss 13 0 spss inc chicago il usa the data from each sampling event were analysed separately the means among treatments were compared based on the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil temperature soil temperature in the 0 25 cm top soil layers were significantly higher under flat planting with plastic film fm than those in the corresponding layers under conventional flat planting cp before the silking stage 0 98 dap under the three planting densities and in the two years of study figs 3 and 4 after silking temperature in the same soil layers were significantly higher in the fm treatment than those in the cp treatment in 2016 but not in 2015 further temperature in the 10 25 cm top soil layers were higher under rf than under cp throughout all six growth stages in both years the average soil temperature of the five layers at the six stages under fm and rf treatments increased by 2 1 c and 0 5 c in 2015 and by 3 0 c and 0 9 c in 2016 respectively compared to the cp treatment differences in soil temperature observed among the three planting densities tested under the same planting pattern were small the average soil temperature of the five layers at the six growth stages under the low and moderate planting densities increased by 0 7 c and 0 3 c in 2015 and by 0 5 c and 0 1 c in 2016 respectively compared with the high planting density treatment 3 2 maize development results of anova showed that planting density pd did not affect maize development significantly in either year under study p 0 05 table 2 in contrast the effect of planting pattern on maize development at different stages was significant p 0 01 or p 0 05 the number of days to emergence 3 leaf 6 leaf dough and maturity stages under fm at the three planting densities was significantly lower than either under rf or cp the two year mean values showed that seedling emergence occurred 2 2 and 4 7 days earlier in fm than in rf and cp plots respectively dough stage in the fm treatment was reached 11 7 and 15 5 days earlier than in rf and cp treatments respectively grain maturity was reached 10 1 and 14 2 days later in rf and cp respectively than in fm plots thus rf fm and cp treatments were harvested at grain maturity 165 3 156 6 and 170 4 days respectively in 2015 a year with normal rainfall whereas in 2016 a dry year the crop cycle was shortened to 162 0 150 5 and 165 1 days respectively 3 3 soil water storage no significant difference was observed in soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil layers in any of the treatments at the emergence or 3 leaf stages in 2015 12 and 31 dap respectively fig 5 however in 2016 the sws under the rf treatment was significantly higher than that in the fm and cp treatments at the same two growth stages this effect might have been due to the delivery of more rainwater to the soil through the ridge under the rf system during the fallow season on the other hand in 2015 the sws in each treatment decreased to a minimum at the blister stage 128 dap thereafter and until maturity 128 170 dap sws increased due to 104 mm of precipitation fig 6 since less precipitation occurred early in the dry year 2016 fig 7 sws in each treatment gradually decreased before the 11 leaf stage 0 78 dap from this point until silking stage 78 97 dap 114 mm of rainfall accumulated resulting in an increase in sws in each treatment by silking a higher maximum sws was recorded under rf than under the fm and cp treatments 3 4 evapotranspiration in 2015 at the same planting density evapotranspiration et was significantly higher under fm and cp than under rf fig 6 at three growth stages before the 11 leaf stage i e 0 31 31 59 and 59 78 dap however at three stages after the 11 leaf stage 78 98 98 128 and 128 170 dap et was higher in rf than in fm or cp plots as planting density increased et increased during the early three growth stages 0 31 31 59 59 78 dap in 2015 however from silking to blister stage 98 128 dap and from blister to maturity 128 170 dap et decreased in each planting pattern treatment with increasing planting density in 2016 when the soil moisture conditions were higher during the early growth stages 0 30 30 60 dap fig 7 et was higher in fm and cp than in rf plots at all three planting densities during the latter growth stages 125 165 dap and during periods of less precipitation 60 78 dap et was lower in fm and cp than in rf plots from 11 leaf to silking 78 97 dap 114 mm rainfall were registered in july and et was higher therefore et did not differ significantly among treatments et increased with increasing planting density in all three planting pattern treatments during the early growth stages 0 30 30 60 78 97 dap however in the late growth stages 125 165 dap et decreased as the planting density increased regardless of planting pattern 3 5 soil water change in root zone based on the anova in the fallow season the effect of planting density on soil water change swc was not significant p 0 05 table 3 whereas the effect of planting pattern on swc was highly significant p 0 01 during the fallow period in 2015 a total of 115 6 mm of rainfall were recorded thereby increasing sws in all treatments at the end of the fallow season further the soil water increase under rf was significantly higher than that under cp or fm treatments at the same planting density compared with 2015 in 2016 soil water increase was less during the fallow season in this case soil water increase in rf and fm was significantly higher than in cp plots regardless of planting density during the two years compared to fm rf treatment allowed more rainwater to collect during the fallow period thus providing the highest soil moisture over the growing season in two consecutive cropping cycles the effects of planting density and planting pattern on swc was significant p 0 05 and highly significant p 0 01 respectively table 3 the swc in rf plots was significantly lower than in fm and cp plots in the normal year 2015 however in the dry year 2016 swc under the rf treatment was significantly higher than under the cp treatment this showed that in normal years the rf system collected and stored rainwater in the soil which heled maintain soil moisture balance and thus provided more moisture to the crop during the dry year the formula 1 shows that the calculation of et mainly consists of swc and amount of precipitation two year data showed that percent swc relative to et was 20 33 during the growing season on the other hand percent precipitation relative to et was 67 80 this indicates that et follows mainly precipitation during the growing season especially in the dry years in contrast in normal years under low and medium plant density the swc et ratio under rf was significantly lower than under fm or cp however in the dry year at all three plant densities tested the swc et under rf was significantly higher than under cp therefore in normal years et is mostly derived from rainfall under rf compared to fm and cp which promotes the utilization of rainfall conversely in the dry years rf may store more moisture in the soil during the fallow season thus supplying water to the crop during the growing season 3 6 leaf area index and aboveground dry matter during 2015 and 2016 the leaf area index lai peaked at silking 98 dap and decreased gradually thereafter fig 8 maize lai at 6 leaf 11 leaf and silking stages was significantly higher under rf and fm than under cp at the same planting density no significant differences in lai were noted between the rf and fm treatments before the silking stage in 2015 no significant differences in lai were observed in the rf and fm treatments at low planting density at the blister and dough stages 125 and 142 dap however at moderate and high planting densities lai was significantly higher in rf than in fm plots in 2016 lai at the blister and the dough stages was significantly higher under rf than under fm at all three planting densities under the same planting density there was no significant difference in aboveground dry matter between different planting patterns at the 3 leaf 30 dap or 6 leaf stages 60 dap in both years fig 9 after the 6 leaf stage aboveground dry matter was significantly higher in rf and fm than in cp plots in 2015 at 11 leaf 78 dap and at silking 98 dap stages under low and moderate planting densities aboveground dry matter was significantly higher in fm than in rf plots although the difference was not significant at the higher density in the dry year 2016 aboveground dry matter after silking 97 dap was higher under rf than under fm at all three planting densities after silking aboveground dry matter increased significantly with increasing planting density under all three planting patterns during the two years of study 3 7 final aboveground dry matter and grain yield the anova revealed highly significant effects of planting density and pattern on final aboveground dry matter fadm in both years p 0 01 table 4 in 2015 there was no significant difference in the fadm obtained with different planting patterns at low planting density however at moderate and high planting density fadm was significantly higher in the rf and fm treatments than in the cp treatment compared to fadm in cp the average fadm obtained under rf and fm treatments increased by 14 2 and 12 7 in 2015 and by 20 2 and 16 5 in 2016 respectively significantly higher fadm was associated with rf and fm treatments than with cp treatment at the three planting densities tested in 2016 however no significant difference was observed between fm and rf the mean values showed that fadm increased significantly with increasing planting density in both years based on the anova the effect of planting density on grain yield was significant in 2015 p 0 01 table 2 but not in 2016 p 0 05 in contrast the effect of planting pattern on grain yield was significant p 0 01 in both years there was no significant difference in the grain yield obtained using rf or fm treatments at the same planting density but grain yield was significantly p 0 05 higher in rf and fm treatments than in the cp treatment the average grain yield under rf and fm treatments increased by 20 5 and 17 9 in 2015 and by 52 9 and 48 5 in 2016 respectively compared to the cp treatment no significant difference in grain yield at three planting densities was observed in 2016 but in 2015 grain yield under moderate and high planting densities was significantly higher than under low planting density compared to low planting density average grain yield obtained at moderate and high planting densities increased by 6 5 and 10 3 in 2015 and by 3 9 and 1 8 in 2016 respectively 3 8 water use efficiency and rainwater use efficiency the anova revealed significant effects of planting density on wue and rue in 2015 p 0 01 but not in 2016 p 0 05 table 4 the effects of planting pattern on wue and rue were significant p 0 01 in both years wue and rue were significantly higher under rf and fm than under cp at all planting densities in both years compared to cp average wue in rf and fm treatments increased by 23 6 and 16 8 in 2015 and by 45 1 and 38 4 in 2016 respectively average rue under rf and fm treatments increased by 20 5 and 17 9 in 2015 and by 52 9 and 48 5 in 2016 respectively under moderate and high planting densities wue and rue were significantly higher than under low density in 2015 whereas in 2016 there were no significant differences in wue or rue among planting density treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil temperature soil water and evapotranspiration the use of plastic film mulch prevents water and heat exchange between soil and air thereby reducing latent heat flux zhou et al 2009 additionally mulching with plastic films reportedly improves soil temperature in the 0 15 cm top layer thereby reducing the number of days to germination and enhancing early seedling growth li et al 1999 our two year study yielded similar results soil temperature in the fm treatment was significantly higher at all three planting densities than in the cp treatment before silking 0 98 dap figs 3 and 4 li et al 2001 showed that the average soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm in plastic film mulched plots was 0 5 4 5 c greater than that in non mulched plots wang et al 2005 found that early during the growing season the topsoil temperature in an rf system was 3 0 6 8 c higher than in an uncovered flat planting treatment whereas later in the growing season no difference was found between the two conditions our own observations of soil temperature at depths of 10 15 cm 15 20 cm and 20 25 cm corroborate that in the rf treatment temperatures at the aforementioned depths in the soil profile before silking were higher than those in the cp treatment while after silking the differences in soil temperature under the different treatments decreased fig 3 this result was probably due to the larger plant canopy which reduced considerably the incidence of solar radiation on the ground consistently with this result we also found that the soil temperature in the 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm topsoil layers under the rf treatment were slightly lower than those under the cp treatment at blister 128 dap and dough 145 dap stages in 2015 this is surely because the rf system collects more rainwater into the surface soil due to the more abundant rainwater registered during these two development stages maize production in semi arid regions of china is greatly affected by the amount and distribution of seasonal rainfall over the cropping cycle where frequent drought can negatively affect maize growth and yield blanco moure et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 at the site of our study in ningxia province the average annual rainfall over 40 years was 410 mm but the average annual potential evaporation is 1753 mm overcoming this imbalance in order to provide sufficient water is crucial both for maize production and for the economy of northwest china grassini et al 2009 the rf system can efficiently maintain a higher swc during maize growth thereby promoting crop growth and increasing wue and grain yield gan et al 2013 plastic film mulching directly reduces evaporation from the soil surface in addition water moves from the deeper soil layers to the topsoil by capillarity and vapour transfer thereby maintaining a relatively stable topsoil moisture content tian et al 2003 in our two year study sws at each growth stage was higher in the rf treatment than in the fm or cp treatments this finding is consistent with the results reported by li and gong 2002 and by zhang et al 2007 whose studies suggest that rf is an advanced system that increases soil water availability by reducing water evaporation and increasing the penetration of light rain deeper into the soil profile previous studies have shown that the rf system yielded the best rainwater harvesting capacity and increased soil moisture while low soil water and high evapotranspiration were observed under conventional planting without mulching li et al 2013a wu et al 2015 as these previous studies our results show that the rf treatment promotes full use of rainfall during a normal year 2015 while in a dry year it can supply maize the rainwater stored in the soil during the fallow season table 3 and fig 5 other studies have indicated that the rf treatment increases both soil moisture content and water lost through transpiration resulting in a higher et than is observed in conventional flat planting li et al 2013a qin et al 2014 our two year field study showed that total et over the entire maize growth period did not differ significantly among treatments table 4 this is because et differs at different stages in each treatment figs 6 and 7 at the same planting density et was lower in the rf treatment than in the cp treatment at the early growth stages 0 30 and 30 60 dap whereas at the late stages 128 165 dap and at those with less rainfall 60 78 dap et was higher in the rf than in the cp treatment this is explained because of the strong winds and the smaller lai during the early maize growth stages which resulted in increased evapotranspiration in the cp treatment with respect to the rf system feng et al 2016 kang et al 2003 our results are similar to those of li et al 2002 and niu et al 2004 who suggested that the rf system concentrates the surface runoff stores water in the root zone and stores water during dry periods even though rainwater is not available to the crop in addition other studies have shown that the rf system can retain the surface runoff from heavy rains jia et al 2006 prevent soil water evaporation increase soil moisture content zhang et al 2007 prolong the period during which moisture is available to the crop and supply water at critical growth stages li et al 2000 4 2 maize growth and yield the two year experimental data showed that lai before silking was significantly higher in the rf than in the cp treatment because soil temperature and soil water storage were higher in the in the former than in the latter at that time figs 3 5 thus the rf system provided better conditions for plant growth our results are similar to those of gan et al 2013 and ren et al 2008 who showed that the ridge with plastic film mulching provides adequate hydrothermal conditions to accelerate crop development at the blister and dough stages in 2016 lai at all three planting densities was significantly higher in the rf treatment than in the fm treatment fig 8 this result was mainly explained by the occurrence of less rainfall after silking in 2016 and concomitantly lower sws which led to premature leaf senescence under the fm treatment our results are consistent with those of balkcom et al 2011 and amanullah 2007 who reported that lai increased as the planting density increased however lai decreased more rapidly after silking at the higher planting density we found that lai increased with increasing density from the 6 leaf to silking stage and at high planting density lai decreased rapidly after silking especially in the dry year in the dry year 2016 aboveground dry matter after silking was higher in the rf treatment than in the fm treatment possibly because the flat plastic film mulching provided favourable soil water and temperature conditions and greater evapotranspiration during early maize growth ma et al 2008 xue et al 2008 whereas the soil water deficit was serious under fm treatment and significantly affected maize growth after silking fig 5 lu et al 2005 suggested that the effect of planting density on dry matter accumulation is mainly evident after silking similar conclusions were drawn from our study aboveground dry matter after silking obviously increased as planting density increased under same planting pattern li et al 2004b found that rf systems can increase deep soil moisture and avoid severe drought at critical growth stages thereby increasing biomass and grain yield similar trends were observed in the present study aboveground dry matter and grain yield showed a significant increase under rf and fm treatments relative to the cp treatment a previous study showed that precipitation was positively correlated with grain yield both in rf systems and in conventional planting ye and liu 2012 the results of our study are consistent with earlier reports of lower grain yield in each treatment in the dry year 2016 than in the normal year 2015 these effects were possibly due to the following factors in 2016 soil moisture decreased due to less rainfall after maize silking fig 5 thus from silking to grain filling stage 97 125 dap soil water could not meet the moisture demand of maize and et was reduced fig 7 this also led to significantly lower lai and aboveground dry matter at this stage in 2016 than in 2015 figs 8 and 9 however in 2015 sws increased due to more rainfall during the grain filling stage fig 5 which resulted in significantly higher et from silking to grain filling 98 128 dap than in 2016 fig 6 this eventually allowed for a higher grain yield in 2015 than in 2016 no significant difference in grain yield was noted between the moderate and high planting densities in the same planting pattern in the two years this result may be explained because plants growing at high planting densities consume more water if low rainfall occurs during the time from silking to blister stage rainfall and soil water cannot meet the demand of maize for moisture under high planting density conditions 4 3 water use efficiency and rainwater use efficiency maintaining soil moisture content and improving wue and rue are key factors in a rain fed farming system in which annual precipitation exceeds evaporation deng et al 2006 turner 2004 many studies have shown that rf systems make better use of rainwater thereby improving the availability of water to crops and increasing grain yield and the wue as a result compared with conventional planting ren et al 2015 wu et al 2015 our study showed that wue was significantly higher in the rf and fm treatments than in the cp treatment at all planting densities in both the normal and the dry years studies have shown that the highest wue was found for the rf system mainly because it improves grain yield while reducing et lu et al 2014 varga et al 2013 our two year study yielded similar results average et was lower under the rf treatment than under the cp treatment and grain yield was significantly higher than that obtained with the cp treatment in arid and semi arid areas higher rue is generally associated with increased crop yield ren et al 2016 in our results rue in the rf treatment was significantly higher in the dry year than in the normal year additionally average rue in the rf treatment increased by 20 5 in 2015 and by 52 9 in 2016 respectively compared with the cp treatment our results are similar to those obtained in a simulated rainfall study by ren et al 2008 who found that with simulated rainfall rue of maize was 73 greater under rf than under conventional planting when rainfall was 230 mm and 40 greater when the rainfall was 340 mm but no difference between the rf treatment and conventional planting was noted when rainfall was 440 mm rainfall is the most important factor when evaluating crop water management strategies in semi arid regions we found that growing maize at moderate density on ridges covered with plastic film had positive effects which manifested as increased grain yield wue and rue these positive effects were possibly due to the following factors 1 as soil temperature increased figs 3 and 4 maize emerged earlier table 2 grew and developed faster and accumulated more aboveground dry matter fig 9 table 4 ultimately resulting in increased grain yield table 4 2 during the fallow and the cropping seasons mulching on the ridges collected more water in the soil table 3 and increased sws fig 5 thereby providing more water for maize during the reproductive growth stages figs 6 and 7 and increasing lai fig 8 final aboveground dry matter grain yield wue and rue table 4 yield and rue of maize are affected by soil moisture temperature light nutrients and many other factors whether or not rf systems increase yield and rue by increasing plant photosynthetic capacity and or nutrient use efficiency requires further study 5 conclusions in an rf system with a moderate planting density m 75 000 plants ha 1 average aboveground dry matter grain yield wue and rue were higher than those obtained through conventional planting although maximum aboveground dry matter was obtained at high planting density h 97 500 plant ha 1 the average grain yield wue and rue were not significantly different from those obtained at moderate planting density especially in the dry year in the long term the use of an rf system with moderate planting density is an innovative planting practice that can increase maize yield and rue in the

11502,sustainable irrigation should rely on the efficient use of water while avoiding soil degradation to this end decision tools for assessing best management practices are necessary there is however little evidence of efficient tools to assess best irrigation practices at regional scale taking into account water quality to avoid soil degradation and negative impacts on crop yields the objective of this work was the performance of a gis based decision tool to assess best irrigation management practices aimed at reducing the negative effect of salts in irrigation water in olive orchards the approach in this tool involved first the blending of two sources of available waters surface and underground and when necessary the application of leaching fractions lf we tested this tool in the province of jaen south spain as representative area of olive cultivation in mediterranean environments in 82 4 of the study area the use of one of both water sources with electrical conductivity ecw below the defined threshold 1 8 ds m 1 was possible without blending water blending for achieving optimal irrigation water quality was possible in 16 of the irrigated land in other 9 8 of the irrigated land leaching fraction was required to achieve the defined salinity threshold in the area where water blending was possible this strategy resulted in the best irrigation water efficiency iwe estimated for the province with water blending and lf when necessary the annual gross income in the province can be increased by 80 mill the proposed gis base decision tool is easy to update for different crops and regions it is able to transform and combine geographical data and value judgments for decision making in irrigation at a regional scale with a view of achieving the most efficient irrigation water use while avoiding negative effects on crop and soil due to water salinity keywords gis irrigation water quality water blending leaching fraction olive benchmarking 1 introduction water is the most critical resource for sustainable agricultural development worldwide chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 agriculture consumes more water than any other human activity pimentel et al 1997 hosseinzade et al 2017 and the efficient and sustainable use of water is nowadays the main challenge of irrigated agriculture araus 2004 levidow et al 2014 a sustainable use of water resources in irrigation must take into account not only crop water requirements but also the quality of irrigation water in order to predict and overcome negative impacts mainly ascribed to water salt content ghassemi et al 1995 paz et al 2004 houk et al 2006 in this regard soil salinization ascribed to irrigation is the main constraint for irrigation agriculture sustainability in many regions of the world affecting more than 34 mha letey et al 2011 mateo sagasta and burke 2011 mora et al 2017 only in europe around 4 mha have a moderate to high soil salinization by irrigation mostly in the mediterranean countries where this problem affects 25 of irrigated agricultural land paz et al 2004 daliakopoulos et al 2016 the main strategy used to prevent the harmful effects of excessive accumulation of soluble salts in soils due to irrigation is to promote drainage in the root zone in order to leach the excess of soluble salts that could constrain crop yield the fraction of applied water required to maintain soil salt content below a given threshold is named leaching fraction lf which increases with increased crop sensitivity to salinity u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 rhoades 1974 this extra volume of water percolates below the root zone displacing at least in part the salts accumulated therein pastor et al 2002 orgaz and fereres 2004 raine et al 2007 mesa jurado et al 2010 in the long term the amount of salts displaced by leaching must be equal to or higher than the salts applied with the irrigation water to avoid their accumulation at dangerous levels in soil this salt balance is the crucial issue in achieving sustainability in irrigated agriculture corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 however it implies a decreased water application efficiency since a significant fraction of applied water must be lost through drainage in areas where different source of water with different quality are available their combined use may allow an improvement in irrigation water quality through dilution qureshi et al 2004 this leads to a decreased lf requirement and consequently an increased efficiency in irrigation water application in practice this means more water available for irrigation while maintaining yield and soil quality this strategy is feasible by combining surface and underground water with different salt concentrations in areas where both water sources coincide mahfuzur et al 2014 prendergast et al 1994 singh 2014 in recent decades irrigated land has increased steadily frequently involving the use of poor quality irrigation water singh 2016 this consequently increases the area with risk of soil salinization this occurred particularly in arid regions of the world where agricultural production is strongly dependent on irrigation ashour and al najar 2012 hosseinzade et al 2017 in the mediterranean basin many new irrigated olive orchards were planted in the last decades fereres 1998 fereres and gonzález dugo 2009 vega et al 2001 vega and pastor 2005 wiesman et al 2004 this is explained because olive is one of the most important crops in this region 10 4 mha 98 of the world s olive cultivated area fao 2016 with lower water demand than other crops and which allows a profitable deficit irrigation with low water availability peragón et al 2015 a representative example of this expanded irrigation land in the mediterranean basin sometimes relying on poor quality irrigation water is the province of jaen south spain this is the most representative area of olive cultivation in spain with near a quarter of the total national orchard surface and amounting to 5 5 of the total surface in the world peragón et al 2015 2016 this area has arid and semi arid zones junta de andalucía 2011 aemet 2011 with scarcity and irregular distribution of rainfall throughout the agricultural year constraining yields in olive orchards melgar et al 2009 the water authority assigns an irrigation rate of 1 500 m3 ha 1 per year which in practice means deficit irrigation in this crop pastor et al 2002 therefore lf to avoid soil salinization may pose in practice a reduction in available water for olives negatively affecting yields in the short term the efficient management of limited water resources for agriculture in mediterranean basin requires complex decision making processes at regional scales araus 2004 this implies the management of large datasets and the spatial analysis of the information which can be achieved with geographic information systems gis chowdary et al 2003 malczewski 2006 gis allows geospatial analysis integrating different sources of information making maps and providing complex outputs of the model results singh 2016 pereira et al 2018 gis have proved practical tools for assessing the quality of irrigation water and the risk of salinization at the regional level by providing maps of water quality and salinization risks in many regions of the world such as west asia simsek and gunduz 2007 arslan 2012 argentine pampas romanelli et al 2012 and spain paz et al 2004 in the province of jaen peragón et al 2015 recently described how the use of gis was useful for providing salinization risk maps in addition gis based tools were useful in calculating lf and water blending from different sources in the same province peragón et al 2016 however for developing a gis based decision tool for the assessment of best irrigation management practices a next step is required beyond the release of risk maps this means the definition of targets to be achieved with the use of the decision tool to this end the gis based tool should be implemented with a model able to combine and process geographical data in order to provide different solutions to achieve the defined target chowdary et al 2003 in this case the target is a salinity threshold in irrigation water below which no substantial yield decrease or soil salinization can be expected these solutions involve first water blending and second if necessary lf estimation to compensate the effect of water salinity on soil and crops if the threshold is surpassed in addition an analysis of solutions provided is required to assess the efficiency in using irrigation water this means an assessment of the economic implications of these irrigation management practices for farmers and policy makers in this regard the objective of the present work was to study the suitability of a gis based decision tool in assessing the best management practices to avoid salinization effects due to irrigation not only in terms of potential effects on crops and soils but also in terms of water saving efficiency and economical balance at regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the province of jaén southern spain which is the most representative area of olive production in spain it covers an area of 13 489 km2 which accounts for 15 4 and 2 7 of the andalusian region and spanish territory respectively the province has a mountainous geography with heights above 900 m in the north south and east of the province the valley formed by the guadalquivir river and its tributaries especially the guadalimar and guadiana minor rivers offers a relatively flat topography in the central zone with heights lower than 450 m overall 25 of the province is below 450 m a s l 20 is between 450 and 600 31 between 600 and 900 20 5 between 900 and 1 500 and 3 51 is above 1 500 m a s l most of the territory 97 of the total area of the province corresponds to the administrative area of the guadalquivir river basin and the rest of the area 3 to the segura river basin between both areas there is a small endorheic basin of only 130 km2 there are two different sources of ground water aquifers carbonated aquifers and detrital aquifers on the one hand carbonate aquifers from limestone materials poses less salt concentration than detrital aquifers aquifers in the province cover around 8 030 km2 these water sources are mostly located in the eastern part of the province in the areas known as sierras de cazorla segura and the villas and quesada castril accounting for 61 of the area covered by aquifers 4 900 km2 igme 2010 the olive orchard is the main crop in this province and irrigated orchards amounts to a surface of 2 903 km2 mainly within the basin of the guadalquivir river magrama 2015 olive orchards are mainly irrigated by a drip system with deficient water supplies magrama 2012 even with these water limitations olive tree has proved to be the best cultivation alternative in the area it being a key element for the sustainability of irrigated land in the province which provides maximum social and economic profitability per cubic meter of water pastor et al 2002 in this province olive orchards are predominantly of the picual variety cespj 2011 which is considered one of the most tolerant varieties to salinity benlloch et al 1994 for this variety salinity in irrigation water may constraint yields at electrical conductivity ec higher than 1 8 ds m 1 above this threshold yield decrease may be expected reduced yields of olive orchard of 10 25 and 50 are expectable at ec values of 2 6 3 7 y 5 6 ds m 1 respectively maas and hoffman 1977 fipps 1996 2 2 data set the authority of the guadalquivir basin confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2014 provided the monthly average electrical conductivity data of irrigation water ecw for the years 1994 2013 this information comes from 66 surface water stations and 136 groundwater stations the underground stations corresponded to 26 hydrogeological units delimited territorially according to the national institute of geology and mining of spain igme 2010 water quality parameters in particular salt concentration are described elsewhere peragón et al 2015 estimation of the water blending rate and leaching requirement leaching fraction lf were done according to previous results by peragón et al 2016 in the province of jaén drip irrigation system is installed in around 90 of irrigated olive orchards peragón et al 2016 for this system annual fixed irrigation cost was set at 692 74 ha 1 alarcón 2016 based on the average irrigation cost in spain this cost includes average amortization of the investment to install a drip irrigation system average maintenance of irrigation system and maintenance costs and average annual cost of installed electrical power aquavir 2005 aemo 2010 cespj 2011 calculation of the irrigation cost was done for an annual water supply of 1 500 m3 ha 1 which is the irrigation rate allowed in the area the economic data for olive production in the province of jaén according to the described irrigation typology were estimated according to alarcón 2016 and coi 2015 average income for growers were 2197 20 ha 1 based on mean olive fruit production oil concentration in olive and oil production aemo 2010 cespj 2011 2 3 model a methodological framework was defined for the management of water resources in the province of jaén fig 1 this model integrates the required information for a geostatistical analysis involving spatial analysis and management after that georeferencing of the different layers of information was performed using the gvsig program www gvsig org peragón et al 2015 2016 the model includes the definition of a target of ec in irrigation water to avoid negative effects 1 8 ds m 1 on this ground information was processed required strategies defined water blending or lf and maps where each strategy should be applied released as a result thus released maps define for each area considered the best management option for irrigation water according to premises in the model areas with different salinity range were defined based on the expectable yield decrease for both surface and underground water upper limits in the considered ranges were 1 8 2 6 3 7 and 5 6 ds m 1 an additional range above the latter value was also considered the three later values corresponded to the threshold values for a relative yield reduction in the production of the olive orchard of 10 25 and 50 respectively ayers and westcot 1985 fipps 1996 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 for both sources of water surface and underground the following premises were applied to define alternative solutions in the model a zones with water salinity lower than the threshold value of 1 8 ds m 1 where it is not necessary any action since there is not any expectable yield reduction due to salinity in water b zones with water salinity higher than the threshold value of 1 8 ds m 1 which were divided into two categories i those where both sources of water cannot be blended and consequently yield reduction is expectable differentiation according to the threshold values of 2 6 3 7 and 5 6 ds m 1 was done in order to predict reductions of the relative yield of the olive orchard of 10 25 and 50 respectively and ii areas where water blending is feasible to achieve an ecw of 1 8 ds m 1 and consequently lf is not required c areas with water salinity above 1 8 ds m 1 where water blending is not applicable those defined in point i above and also where the blending can be applied but the result obtained is higher than the threshold of 1 8 ds m 1 in these cases leaching fraction lf is required to reduce risks lf requirement was estimated to avoid a yield reduction in olive higher than 10 2 4 gis calculations the classifications in the limitations for the use of irrigation water in olive and the definition of thresholds for irrigation water are based on data published by ayers and westcot 1985 maas and hoffman 1977 and benlloch et al 1994 rhoades 1982 and rhoades and loveday 1990 the optimum proportions of both sources of water were calculated where their blending was possible i e in those sub basins with surface and underground water availability by mathematical algorithms of rasterization rasterize vector layer and cut raster layer with polygon layer and later vectorization vectorize raster layer the gis sextant module reduces the thematic map of ec in surface water to the region where there is an overlap with aquifers then using the mapping calculator algorithm of the gis the proportion of each water source in water mixture was calculated this calculation was done according to the tolerance limit of olive to salinity mentioned above i e for ecw of 1 8 ds m 1 this calculation was applied to areas of surface waters below defined values that coincide with areas of underground water with values higher than the established thresholds or vice versa after integrating all the variables in the model with their geospatial attributes through queries involving both thematic and spatial components we obtained the maps that meet the criteria for efficient use of irrigation water according to the three premises defined above in practice this means that where it was not possible to use a source of water with less than 1 8 ds m 1 we applied first water blending if this alternative was not feasible to achieve the defined threshold lf was applied finally to compare the water use strategies described above we calculated the irrigation water efficiency iwe as ratio of the potential olive yield kg ha 1 to the irrigation rate m3 ha 1 in addition an analysis of the income according to the harvest value and the cost of irrigation was performed according to sources mentioned above in the description of the dataset 3 results 3 1 irrigated areas without water blending approximately in 82 of the land which can be potentially irrigated with surface water 11111 km2 it can be used water with electrical conductivity ecw below the threshold of 1 8 ds m 1 meanwhile 85 of the land potentially irrigated with groundwater 6855 km2 was supplied with water below that limit table 1 fig 2 a yield reduction of 10 i e ecw ranging from 1 8 to 2 6 ds m 1 was expectable in 4 6 of the area supplied with surface water 617 km2 and in 2 7 218 km2 of the area supplied with underground water table 1 fig 2 the land potentially irrigated with water with ec ranging from 2 6 to 3 7 ds m 1 where a yield decrease between 10 and 25 may be expectable as result amounted to 10 7 1457 km2 and 11 9 957 km2 of the land with surface and underground water supplies respectively the area irrigable with water ranging from 3 7 to 5 6 ds m 1 was not accountable and that irrigated with water with ec higher than 5 6 ds m 1 only represented 2 3 304 km2 of the area supplied with surface water thus irrigated areas with ec between 1 8 and 5 6 ds m 1 where yield reduction up to 50 was possible accounted for ca 15 of the land supplied with surface and underground water supplies 2074 km2 and 1176 km2 respectively table 2 in 17 7 and 13 0 of the land potentially irrigated with surface water ecw was higher than 1 8 and 2 6 ds m 1 respectively table 2 fig 3 ecw values greater than 3 7 were observed in 2 9 of the area potentially irrigated with surface water for groundwater ecw above 1 8 and 2 6 ds m 1 was observed in 14 6 and 11 9 of the surface potentially irrigated with this water source respectively table 2 fig 3 for this source the area potentially irrigated with water with ec higher than 3 7 was negligible table 2 fig 3 3 2 application of water blending strategy sub basins with surface water supply coincident with aquifers accounted for 8030 km2 it was possible the use of surface water with ecw lower than 1 8 ds m 1 in 11111 km2 this accounted for 82 4 of the total area irrigable with surface water thus in this area it was not necessary any measure to improve irrigation water quality only in 1130 km2 of the remaining 2378 km2 irrigable with surface water it was feasible water blending with underground water with this blending it was possible to maintain an ec in irrigation water lower than 1 8 ds m 1 in 1056 km2 by using different surface to underground water ratios table 3 fig 4 on the other hand when underground water had ecw higher than 1 8 ds m 1 it was possible the obtaining of irrigation water below this threshold by blending with surface water in 1102 km2 table 3 fig 4 the defined ecw threshold was unfeasible with water blending in 74 km2 of the area with overlap of both sources of water table 3 3 3 application of leaching fraction lf in sub basins with ecw higher than the defined threshold value where it is not possible to mix water i e not coincident aquifers 1248 km2 table 4 as well as where water blending is impractical for achieving defined thresholds for ecw 74 km2 table 4 the leaching fraction criteria was applied the model provided different leaching fractions for the defined yield loss threshold 10 which was achievable in all the targeted area defined above 1322 km2 table 4 fig 5 3 4 irrigable areas with different approaches there was not any expectable negative effect ascribed to water salinity i e ecw 1 8 ds m 1 in 6 900 km2 of the area irrigable indifferently with superficial or underground water overlap of both sources and in 4211 km2 of the area irrigable with surface water where it do not overlap with underground table 5 when the ec of both sources of water was lower than 1 8 ds m 1 it was not necessary water blending or lf only in 2158 km2 16 of the total irrigable land and 1322 km2 9 8 it was required water blending and lf respectively according to the defined premises in the model table 5 if we define a different approach which is the preservation of water without any action to preserve soils or yields no water blending and no lf as defined in the model land or irrigation rates for areas with lf can be increased in fact this is the current irrigation strategy in the province of jaen with this premise of water preservation 11111 km2 82 4 was irrigable with water with ec till 1 8 ds m 1 as estimated for the yield preservation approach defined above in the gis based model however 762 km2 5 7 were potentially irrigated with water ranging from 1 8 to 2 6 ds m 1 and consequently with an expectable yield decrease up to 10 and 1616 km2 10 9 with water ranging from 2 6 to 3 7 ds m 1 thus potentially promoting a yield decrease of up to 25 table 6 3 5 benchmarking overall with the yield preservation strategy defined in the model the cost of irrigation in the irrigable land of the province of jaen was 943 million meanwhile the value of the production was 2936 million table 5 in this case the ratio of olive yield to volume of water used iwe was 8 66 above the ecw threshold of 1 8 ds m 1 defined in the model lf was applied this means that production decreased with increased volume of water used for salt leaching as a result iwe decreased to 7 09 table 5 with this lf requirement it is assumed that irrigation costs increased by 10 with a decrease in production of the same percentage 10 with the premise of water preservation without any action the value of crop production and the irrigation cost in the irrigable land decreased to 2859 and 935 million respectively table 6 regarding iwe it varied according to the source of water used for the threshold value 1 8 ds m 1 iwe was 8 66 meanwhile for ecw thresholds of 2 6 and 3 7 it decreased to 7 80 and 6 50 respectively due to yield losses table 6 on a regional basis yield preservation approach defined in our gis based decision tool implied an increased irrigation cost of 8 million however it was expectable an increase in the value of the harvest of near 80 million tables 5 and 6 it should be remarked that this increased gross income was mostly obtained in the 2158 km2 where water blending is possible when compared with the water preservation strategy without any action 4 discussion the proposed gis based decision tool was useful in managing hydrochemical information of irrigation water intended to create maps of qualities and irrigable surfaces which each source of water surface and underground similar results were obtained in other geographical areas with analogous water quality criteria e g romanelli et al 2012 for argentine pampas however in contrast with previous literature on the use of gis in predicting soil salinization risks our model applied decision criteria for defining the best management option with the premise of yield preservation and soil protection the information released is not only a risk map our gis based tool was useful to estimate where the blending of both water sources is possible to calculate lf requirements to achieve the minimum yield loss defined in the model our approach is similar to that used by chowdary et al 2003 for providing best solutions for each zone of an irrigated land for groundwater preservation the proposed gis based tool was useful for using irrigation water efficiently in order to avoid constraints ascribed to water salinity alternatively the model can handle the information by applying different decision criteria e g with a water preservation approach i e without blending or lf instead the yield preservation approach although the water preservation approach lead to less sustainability in the agricultural land salinization will occur its implementation in the model allow us to compare iwe with different approaches and the potential economic implications of different irrigation strategies the approach based in yield preservation by avoiding salt accumulation in soil by water blending or lf led to an increased iwe in the areas affected by irrigation with saline water this was achieved by decreasing lf requirements with blending or by increasing potential crop yield in the cases that lf had to be applied although area affected by water blending amounted to 16 of the total irrigable area of the province of jaen the economic impact in this affected area was significant water blending was an effective strategy to maintain iwe in the highest value 8 66 in 2158 km2 without any control measure iwe would diminish in this area due to the reduction in crop yield thus in these affected areas economic implications of water quality and best management options for irrigation are truly relevant water blending implies an expected cost in the infrastructure required for this strategy however the economic study revealed that this investment can be affordable at least partially with expected benefits in affected areas the proposed tool can facilitate the analysis and processing of data allowing the visualization of the geographic information and offering all the functionalities of manipulation of the geographic data this can be used in the planning and decision making processes peragón et al 2015 2016 with these capabilities gis can be considered as a decision support system involving the integration of spatially referenced data in a problem solving environment cowen 1988 however the proposed gis based tool was effective in defining the best management options for irrigation and represented the next step to previous models these previous models were only able to make a geospatial analysis of water quality and constraints derived from its use such as models proposed by peragón et al 2015 2016 for the same area and crop thus the proposed tool is able to transform and combine geographical data and value judgments to obtain information for decision making it provides procedures for structuring decision problems and designing evaluating and prioritizing alternative decisions thus it can be considered an example of gis based multicriteria decision analysis feick and hall 2004 malczewski 2006 the gis based decision tool proposed here is able to define best management options for salinity control in each area after defining the target to be achieved which in a first step is an irrigation water below a given ecw value this is very relevant in the arid regions such as the area of study where water availability is scarce in the province of jaen with an assigned limit of 1500 m3 ha 1 deficit irrigation is only possible pastor et al 2002 mixing both sources of water up to the threshold of water salinity in the irrigation that is established as tolerance limit for olive orchard 1 8 ds m 1 will allow a reasonable control of water salinity effects while increasing water availability to crop by decreasing lf it should be highlighted that high lf requirements cannot be considered suitable which such a low water irrigation rates peragón et al 2016 and alternative strategies such as water blending can contribute to the sustainability of olive production in these areas usually the gis techniques have been used as a tool for storing analyzing and displaying spatial information in an efficient manner for water resources management singh 2016 we demonstrated here that spatial information can be successfully processed for providing best solutions in each zone of an irrigated land with an economic analysis at regional scale this spatial and economic analysis of control measures for avoiding salinization risks related to irrigation water quality was never described in literature however this is a relevant issue not only with a view of analyzing potential economic benefits frequently in the implementation of changes in irrigating schemes social benefits prevail and large public investments are required in this regard gis based tools can help governmental policy makers in taking decisions neji and turki 2015 this type of gis based tools is also able to adapt decisions to fast changes in water composition as previously proved by peragón et al 2016 the gis based decision tool proposed was developed for olive crop in the province of jaen in spain this is a representative example of crop and environment with increasing risk of soil salinization by irrigation however this tool can be easily extrapolated to other regions and crops and it can be an useful tool for helping stakeholders to take decisions on irrigation management at regional scales 5 conclusions the proposed gis based is able to transform and combine geographical data and value judgments for decision making this was useful in defining best irrigation practices to avoid salinization risks in the different areas of the irrigated land studied in those areas where water blending was possible this strategy allowed the best irrigation water efficiency without blending and leaching fraction this

11502,sustainable irrigation should rely on the efficient use of water while avoiding soil degradation to this end decision tools for assessing best management practices are necessary there is however little evidence of efficient tools to assess best irrigation practices at regional scale taking into account water quality to avoid soil degradation and negative impacts on crop yields the objective of this work was the performance of a gis based decision tool to assess best irrigation management practices aimed at reducing the negative effect of salts in irrigation water in olive orchards the approach in this tool involved first the blending of two sources of available waters surface and underground and when necessary the application of leaching fractions lf we tested this tool in the province of jaen south spain as representative area of olive cultivation in mediterranean environments in 82 4 of the study area the use of one of both water sources with electrical conductivity ecw below the defined threshold 1 8 ds m 1 was possible without blending water blending for achieving optimal irrigation water quality was possible in 16 of the irrigated land in other 9 8 of the irrigated land leaching fraction was required to achieve the defined salinity threshold in the area where water blending was possible this strategy resulted in the best irrigation water efficiency iwe estimated for the province with water blending and lf when necessary the annual gross income in the province can be increased by 80 mill the proposed gis base decision tool is easy to update for different crops and regions it is able to transform and combine geographical data and value judgments for decision making in irrigation at a regional scale with a view of achieving the most efficient irrigation water use while avoiding negative effects on crop and soil due to water salinity keywords gis irrigation water quality water blending leaching fraction olive benchmarking 1 introduction water is the most critical resource for sustainable agricultural development worldwide chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 agriculture consumes more water than any other human activity pimentel et al 1997 hosseinzade et al 2017 and the efficient and sustainable use of water is nowadays the main challenge of irrigated agriculture araus 2004 levidow et al 2014 a sustainable use of water resources in irrigation must take into account not only crop water requirements but also the quality of irrigation water in order to predict and overcome negative impacts mainly ascribed to water salt content ghassemi et al 1995 paz et al 2004 houk et al 2006 in this regard soil salinization ascribed to irrigation is the main constraint for irrigation agriculture sustainability in many regions of the world affecting more than 34 mha letey et al 2011 mateo sagasta and burke 2011 mora et al 2017 only in europe around 4 mha have a moderate to high soil salinization by irrigation mostly in the mediterranean countries where this problem affects 25 of irrigated agricultural land paz et al 2004 daliakopoulos et al 2016 the main strategy used to prevent the harmful effects of excessive accumulation of soluble salts in soils due to irrigation is to promote drainage in the root zone in order to leach the excess of soluble salts that could constrain crop yield the fraction of applied water required to maintain soil salt content below a given threshold is named leaching fraction lf which increases with increased crop sensitivity to salinity u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 rhoades 1974 this extra volume of water percolates below the root zone displacing at least in part the salts accumulated therein pastor et al 2002 orgaz and fereres 2004 raine et al 2007 mesa jurado et al 2010 in the long term the amount of salts displaced by leaching must be equal to or higher than the salts applied with the irrigation water to avoid their accumulation at dangerous levels in soil this salt balance is the crucial issue in achieving sustainability in irrigated agriculture corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 however it implies a decreased water application efficiency since a significant fraction of applied water must be lost through drainage in areas where different source of water with different quality are available their combined use may allow an improvement in irrigation water quality through dilution qureshi et al 2004 this leads to a decreased lf requirement and consequently an increased efficiency in irrigation water application in practice this means more water available for irrigation while maintaining yield and soil quality this strategy is feasible by combining surface and underground water with different salt concentrations in areas where both water sources coincide mahfuzur et al 2014 prendergast et al 1994 singh 2014 in recent decades irrigated land has increased steadily frequently involving the use of poor quality irrigation water singh 2016 this consequently increases the area with risk of soil salinization this occurred particularly in arid regions of the world where agricultural production is strongly dependent on irrigation ashour and al najar 2012 hosseinzade et al 2017 in the mediterranean basin many new irrigated olive orchards were planted in the last decades fereres 1998 fereres and gonzález dugo 2009 vega et al 2001 vega and pastor 2005 wiesman et al 2004 this is explained because olive is one of the most important crops in this region 10 4 mha 98 of the world s olive cultivated area fao 2016 with lower water demand than other crops and which allows a profitable deficit irrigation with low water availability peragón et al 2015 a representative example of this expanded irrigation land in the mediterranean basin sometimes relying on poor quality irrigation water is the province of jaen south spain this is the most representative area of olive cultivation in spain with near a quarter of the total national orchard surface and amounting to 5 5 of the total surface in the world peragón et al 2015 2016 this area has arid and semi arid zones junta de andalucía 2011 aemet 2011 with scarcity and irregular distribution of rainfall throughout the agricultural year constraining yields in olive orchards melgar et al 2009 the water authority assigns an irrigation rate of 1 500 m3 ha 1 per year which in practice means deficit irrigation in this crop pastor et al 2002 therefore lf to avoid soil salinization may pose in practice a reduction in available water for olives negatively affecting yields in the short term the efficient management of limited water resources for agriculture in mediterranean basin requires complex decision making processes at regional scales araus 2004 this implies the management of large datasets and the spatial analysis of the information which can be achieved with geographic information systems gis chowdary et al 2003 malczewski 2006 gis allows geospatial analysis integrating different sources of information making maps and providing complex outputs of the model results singh 2016 pereira et al 2018 gis have proved practical tools for assessing the quality of irrigation water and the risk of salinization at the regional level by providing maps of water quality and salinization risks in many regions of the world such as west asia simsek and gunduz 2007 arslan 2012 argentine pampas romanelli et al 2012 and spain paz et al 2004 in the province of jaen peragón et al 2015 recently described how the use of gis was useful for providing salinization risk maps in addition gis based tools were useful in calculating lf and water blending from different sources in the same province peragón et al 2016 however for developing a gis based decision tool for the assessment of best irrigation management practices a next step is required beyond the release of risk maps this means the definition of targets to be achieved with the use of the decision tool to this end the gis based tool should be implemented with a model able to combine and process geographical data in order to provide different solutions to achieve the defined target chowdary et al 2003 in this case the target is a salinity threshold in irrigation water below which no substantial yield decrease or soil salinization can be expected these solutions involve first water blending and second if necessary lf estimation to compensate the effect of water salinity on soil and crops if the threshold is surpassed in addition an analysis of solutions provided is required to assess the efficiency in using irrigation water this means an assessment of the economic implications of these irrigation management practices for farmers and policy makers in this regard the objective of the present work was to study the suitability of a gis based decision tool in assessing the best management practices to avoid salinization effects due to irrigation not only in terms of potential effects on crops and soils but also in terms of water saving efficiency and economical balance at regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the province of jaén southern spain which is the most representative area of olive production in spain it covers an area of 13 489 km2 which accounts for 15 4 and 2 7 of the andalusian region and spanish territory respectively the province has a mountainous geography with heights above 900 m in the north south and east of the province the valley formed by the guadalquivir river and its tributaries especially the guadalimar and guadiana minor rivers offers a relatively flat topography in the central zone with heights lower than 450 m overall 25 of the province is below 450 m a s l 20 is between 450 and 600 31 between 600 and 900 20 5 between 900 and 1 500 and 3 51 is above 1 500 m a s l most of the territory 97 of the total area of the province corresponds to the administrative area of the guadalquivir river basin and the rest of the area 3 to the segura river basin between both areas there is a small endorheic basin of only 130 km2 there are two different sources of ground water aquifers carbonated aquifers and detrital aquifers on the one hand carbonate aquifers from limestone materials poses less salt concentration than detrital aquifers aquifers in the province cover around 8 030 km2 these water sources are mostly located in the eastern part of the province in the areas known as sierras de cazorla segura and the villas and quesada castril accounting for 61 of the area covered by aquifers 4 900 km2 igme 2010 the olive orchard is the main crop in this province and irrigated orchards amounts to a surface of 2 903 km2 mainly within the basin of the guadalquivir river magrama 2015 olive orchards are mainly irrigated by a drip system with deficient water supplies magrama 2012 even with these water limitations olive tree has proved to be the best cultivation alternative in the area it being a key element for the sustainability of irrigated land in the province which provides maximum social and economic profitability per cubic meter of water pastor et al 2002 in this province olive orchards are predominantly of the picual variety cespj 2011 which is considered one of the most tolerant varieties to salinity benlloch et al 1994 for this variety salinity in irrigation water may constraint yields at electrical conductivity ec higher than 1 8 ds m 1 above this threshold yield decrease may be expected reduced yields of olive orchard of 10 25 and 50 are expectable at ec values of 2 6 3 7 y 5 6 ds m 1 respectively maas and hoffman 1977 fipps 1996 2 2 data set the authority of the guadalquivir basin confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2014 provided the monthly average electrical conductivity data of irrigation water ecw for the years 1994 2013 this information comes from 66 surface water stations and 136 groundwater stations the underground stations corresponded to 26 hydrogeological units delimited territorially according to the national institute of geology and mining of spain igme 2010 water quality parameters in particular salt concentration are described elsewhere peragón et al 2015 estimation of the water blending rate and leaching requirement leaching fraction lf were done according to previous results by peragón et al 2016 in the province of jaén drip irrigation system is installed in around 90 of irrigated olive orchards peragón et al 2016 for this system annual fixed irrigation cost was set at 692 74 ha 1 alarcón 2016 based on the average irrigation cost in spain this cost includes average amortization of the investment to install a drip irrigation system average maintenance of irrigation system and maintenance costs and average annual cost of installed electrical power aquavir 2005 aemo 2010 cespj 2011 calculation of the irrigation cost was done for an annual water supply of 1 500 m3 ha 1 which is the irrigation rate allowed in the area the economic data for olive production in the province of jaén according to the described irrigation typology were estimated according to alarcón 2016 and coi 2015 average income for growers were 2197 20 ha 1 based on mean olive fruit production oil concentration in olive and oil production aemo 2010 cespj 2011 2 3 model a methodological framework was defined for the management of water resources in the province of jaén fig 1 this model integrates the required information for a geostatistical analysis involving spatial analysis and management after that georeferencing of the different layers of information was performed using the gvsig program www gvsig org peragón et al 2015 2016 the model includes the definition of a target of ec in irrigation water to avoid negative effects 1 8 ds m 1 on this ground information was processed required strategies defined water blending or lf and maps where each strategy should be applied released as a result thus released maps define for each area considered the best management option for irrigation water according to premises in the model areas with different salinity range were defined based on the expectable yield decrease for both surface and underground water upper limits in the considered ranges were 1 8 2 6 3 7 and 5 6 ds m 1 an additional range above the latter value was also considered the three later values corresponded to the threshold values for a relative yield reduction in the production of the olive orchard of 10 25 and 50 respectively ayers and westcot 1985 fipps 1996 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 for both sources of water surface and underground the following premises were applied to define alternative solutions in the model a zones with water salinity lower than the threshold value of 1 8 ds m 1 where it is not necessary any action since there is not any expectable yield reduction due to salinity in water b zones with water salinity higher than the threshold value of 1 8 ds m 1 which were divided into two categories i those where both sources of water cannot be blended and consequently yield reduction is expectable differentiation according to the threshold values of 2 6 3 7 and 5 6 ds m 1 was done in order to predict reductions of the relative yield of the olive orchard of 10 25 and 50 respectively and ii areas where water blending is feasible to achieve an ecw of 1 8 ds m 1 and consequently lf is not required c areas with water salinity above 1 8 ds m 1 where water blending is not applicable those defined in point i above and also where the blending can be applied but the result obtained is higher than the threshold of 1 8 ds m 1 in these cases leaching fraction lf is required to reduce risks lf requirement was estimated to avoid a yield reduction in olive higher than 10 2 4 gis calculations the classifications in the limitations for the use of irrigation water in olive and the definition of thresholds for irrigation water are based on data published by ayers and westcot 1985 maas and hoffman 1977 and benlloch et al 1994 rhoades 1982 and rhoades and loveday 1990 the optimum proportions of both sources of water were calculated where their blending was possible i e in those sub basins with surface and underground water availability by mathematical algorithms of rasterization rasterize vector layer and cut raster layer with polygon layer and later vectorization vectorize raster layer the gis sextant module reduces the thematic map of ec in surface water to the region where there is an overlap with aquifers then using the mapping calculator algorithm of the gis the proportion of each water source in water mixture was calculated this calculation was done according to the tolerance limit of olive to salinity mentioned above i e for ecw of 1 8 ds m 1 this calculation was applied to areas of surface waters below defined values that coincide with areas of underground water with values higher than the established thresholds or vice versa after integrating all the variables in the model with their geospatial attributes through queries involving both thematic and spatial components we obtained the maps that meet the criteria for efficient use of irrigation water according to the three premises defined above in practice this means that where it was not possible to use a source of water with less than 1 8 ds m 1 we applied first water blending if this alternative was not feasible to achieve the defined threshold lf was applied finally to compare the water use strategies described above we calculated the irrigation water efficiency iwe as ratio of the potential olive yield kg ha 1 to the irrigation rate m3 ha 1 in addition an analysis of the income according to the harvest value and the cost of irrigation was performed according to sources mentioned above in the description of the dataset 3 results 3 1 irrigated areas without water blending approximately in 82 of the land which can be potentially irrigated with surface water 11111 km2 it can be used water with electrical conductivity ecw below the threshold of 1 8 ds m 1 meanwhile 85 of the land potentially irrigated with groundwater 6855 km2 was supplied with water below that limit table 1 fig 2 a yield reduction of 10 i e ecw ranging from 1 8 to 2 6 ds m 1 was expectable in 4 6 of the area supplied with surface water 617 km2 and in 2 7 218 km2 of the area supplied with underground water table 1 fig 2 the land potentially irrigated with water with ec ranging from 2 6 to 3 7 ds m 1 where a yield decrease between 10 and 25 may be expectable as result amounted to 10 7 1457 km2 and 11 9 957 km2 of the land with surface and underground water supplies respectively the area irrigable with water ranging from 3 7 to 5 6 ds m 1 was not accountable and that irrigated with water with ec higher than 5 6 ds m 1 only represented 2 3 304 km2 of the area supplied with surface water thus irrigated areas with ec between 1 8 and 5 6 ds m 1 where yield reduction up to 50 was possible accounted for ca 15 of the land supplied with surface and underground water supplies 2074 km2 and 1176 km2 respectively table 2 in 17 7 and 13 0 of the land potentially irrigated with surface water ecw was higher than 1 8 and 2 6 ds m 1 respectively table 2 fig 3 ecw values greater than 3 7 were observed in 2 9 of the area potentially irrigated with surface water for groundwater ecw above 1 8 and 2 6 ds m 1 was observed in 14 6 and 11 9 of the surface potentially irrigated with this water source respectively table 2 fig 3 for this source the area potentially irrigated with water with ec higher than 3 7 was negligible table 2 fig 3 3 2 application of water blending strategy sub basins with surface water supply coincident with aquifers accounted for 8030 km2 it was possible the use of surface water with ecw lower than 1 8 ds m 1 in 11111 km2 this accounted for 82 4 of the total area irrigable with surface water thus in this area it was not necessary any measure to improve irrigation water quality only in 1130 km2 of the remaining 2378 km2 irrigable with surface water it was feasible water blending with underground water with this blending it was possible to maintain an ec in irrigation water lower than 1 8 ds m 1 in 1056 km2 by using different surface to underground water ratios table 3 fig 4 on the other hand when underground water had ecw higher than 1 8 ds m 1 it was possible the obtaining of irrigation water below this threshold by blending with surface water in 1102 km2 table 3 fig 4 the defined ecw threshold was unfeasible with water blending in 74 km2 of the area with overlap of both sources of water table 3 3 3 application of leaching fraction lf in sub basins with ecw higher than the defined threshold value where it is not possible to mix water i e not coincident aquifers 1248 km2 table 4 as well as where water blending is impractical for achieving defined thresholds for ecw 74 km2 table 4 the leaching fraction criteria was applied the model provided different leaching fractions for the defined yield loss threshold 10 which was achievable in all the targeted area defined above 1322 km2 table 4 fig 5 3 4 irrigable areas with different approaches there was not any expectable negative effect ascribed to water salinity i e ecw 1 8 ds m 1 in 6 900 km2 of the area irrigable indifferently with superficial or underground water overlap of both sources and in 4211 km2 of the area irrigable with surface water where it do not overlap with underground table 5 when the ec of both sources of water was lower than 1 8 ds m 1 it was not necessary water blending or lf only in 2158 km2 16 of the total irrigable land and 1322 km2 9 8 it was required water blending and lf respectively according to the defined premises in the model table 5 if we define a different approach which is the preservation of water without any action to preserve soils or yields no water blending and no lf as defined in the model land or irrigation rates for areas with lf can be increased in fact this is the current irrigation strategy in the province of jaen with this premise of water preservation 11111 km2 82 4 was irrigable with water with ec till 1 8 ds m 1 as estimated for the yield preservation approach defined above in the gis based model however 762 km2 5 7 were potentially irrigated with water ranging from 1 8 to 2 6 ds m 1 and consequently with an expectable yield decrease up to 10 and 1616 km2 10 9 with water ranging from 2 6 to 3 7 ds m 1 thus potentially promoting a yield decrease of up to 25 table 6 3 5 benchmarking overall with the yield preservation strategy defined in the model the cost of irrigation in the irrigable land of the province of jaen was 943 million meanwhile the value of the production was 2936 million table 5 in this case the ratio of olive yield to volume of water used iwe was 8 66 above the ecw threshold of 1 8 ds m 1 defined in the model lf was applied this means that production decreased with increased volume of water used for salt leaching as a result iwe decreased to 7 09 table 5 with this lf requirement it is assumed that irrigation costs increased by 10 with a decrease in production of the same percentage 10 with the premise of water preservation without any action the value of crop production and the irrigation cost in the irrigable land decreased to 2859 and 935 million respectively table 6 regarding iwe it varied according to the source of water used for the threshold value 1 8 ds m 1 iwe was 8 66 meanwhile for ecw thresholds of 2 6 and 3 7 it decreased to 7 80 and 6 50 respectively due to yield losses table 6 on a regional basis yield preservation approach defined in our gis based decision tool implied an increased irrigation cost of 8 million however it was expectable an increase in the value of the harvest of near 80 million tables 5 and 6 it should be remarked that this increased gross income was mostly obtained in the 2158 km2 where water blending is possible when compared with the water preservation strategy without any action 4 discussion the proposed gis based decision tool was useful in managing hydrochemical information of irrigation water intended to create maps of qualities and irrigable surfaces which each source of water surface and underground similar results were obtained in other geographical areas with analogous water quality criteria e g romanelli et al 2012 for argentine pampas however in contrast with previous literature on the use of gis in predicting soil salinization risks our model applied decision criteria for defining the best management option with the premise of yield preservation and soil protection the information released is not only a risk map our gis based tool was useful to estimate where the blending of both water sources is possible to calculate lf requirements to achieve the minimum yield loss defined in the model our approach is similar to that used by chowdary et al 2003 for providing best solutions for each zone of an irrigated land for groundwater preservation the proposed gis based tool was useful for using irrigation water efficiently in order to avoid constraints ascribed to water salinity alternatively the model can handle the information by applying different decision criteria e g with a water preservation approach i e without blending or lf instead the yield preservation approach although the water preservation approach lead to less sustainability in the agricultural land salinization will occur its implementation in the model allow us to compare iwe with different approaches and the potential economic implications of different irrigation strategies the approach based in yield preservation by avoiding salt accumulation in soil by water blending or lf led to an increased iwe in the areas affected by irrigation with saline water this was achieved by decreasing lf requirements with blending or by increasing potential crop yield in the cases that lf had to be applied although area affected by water blending amounted to 16 of the total irrigable area of the province of jaen the economic impact in this affected area was significant water blending was an effective strategy to maintain iwe in the highest value 8 66 in 2158 km2 without any control measure iwe would diminish in this area due to the reduction in crop yield thus in these affected areas economic implications of water quality and best management options for irrigation are truly relevant water blending implies an expected cost in the infrastructure required for this strategy however the economic study revealed that this investment can be affordable at least partially with expected benefits in affected areas the proposed tool can facilitate the analysis and processing of data allowing the visualization of the geographic information and offering all the functionalities of manipulation of the geographic data this can be used in the planning and decision making processes peragón et al 2015 2016 with these capabilities gis can be considered as a decision support system involving the integration of spatially referenced data in a problem solving environment cowen 1988 however the proposed gis based tool was effective in defining the best management options for irrigation and represented the next step to previous models these previous models were only able to make a geospatial analysis of water quality and constraints derived from its use such as models proposed by peragón et al 2015 2016 for the same area and crop thus the proposed tool is able to transform and combine geographical data and value judgments to obtain information for decision making it provides procedures for structuring decision problems and designing evaluating and prioritizing alternative decisions thus it can be considered an example of gis based multicriteria decision analysis feick and hall 2004 malczewski 2006 the gis based decision tool proposed here is able to define best management options for salinity control in each area after defining the target to be achieved which in a first step is an irrigation water below a given ecw value this is very relevant in the arid regions such as the area of study where water availability is scarce in the province of jaen with an assigned limit of 1500 m3 ha 1 deficit irrigation is only possible pastor et al 2002 mixing both sources of water up to the threshold of water salinity in the irrigation that is established as tolerance limit for olive orchard 1 8 ds m 1 will allow a reasonable control of water salinity effects while increasing water availability to crop by decreasing lf it should be highlighted that high lf requirements cannot be considered suitable which such a low water irrigation rates peragón et al 2016 and alternative strategies such as water blending can contribute to the sustainability of olive production in these areas usually the gis techniques have been used as a tool for storing analyzing and displaying spatial information in an efficient manner for water resources management singh 2016 we demonstrated here that spatial information can be successfully processed for providing best solutions in each zone of an irrigated land with an economic analysis at regional scale this spatial and economic analysis of control measures for avoiding salinization risks related to irrigation water quality was never described in literature however this is a relevant issue not only with a view of analyzing potential economic benefits frequently in the implementation of changes in irrigating schemes social benefits prevail and large public investments are required in this regard gis based tools can help governmental policy makers in taking decisions neji and turki 2015 this type of gis based tools is also able to adapt decisions to fast changes in water composition as previously proved by peragón et al 2016 the gis based decision tool proposed was developed for olive crop in the province of jaen in spain this is a representative example of crop and environment with increasing risk of soil salinization by irrigation however this tool can be easily extrapolated to other regions and crops and it can be an useful tool for helping stakeholders to take decisions on irrigation management at regional scales 5 conclusions the proposed gis based is able to transform and combine geographical data and value judgments for decision making this was useful in defining best irrigation practices to avoid salinization risks in the different areas of the irrigated land studied in those areas where water blending was possible this strategy allowed the best irrigation water efficiency without blending and leaching fraction this efficiency decreased with increased salt concentration in water due to yield reductions with water blending and leaching fraction when necessary the annual gross income in the province can be increased by 80 mill further research is however required to check the long term efficiency of this tool in avoiding soil salinization and for implementations of more complete gis based decision tools

be higher and deep percolation occurs if infiltrated irrigation exceeds the soil storage capacity bethune et al 2008 furthermore excessive non productive transpiration in poor irrigation management may be a substantial loss in data scarce areas such as ltb and in situations where acquisition of field data is costly and time consuming models are an alternative ways to manage systems once they are validated arnold and allen 1996 water balance simulation using process based models helps to analyse how efficient the water is used soldevilla martinez et al 2014 on the other hand process based complex models that accurately simulate the water balance require large input data and parameters loosvelt et al 2011 which needs intensive field and laboratory work determination of all required soil parameters is difficult in developing countries because of lack of equipment skills and budget simple models can be an alternative tool for water management in data scarce regions and provide comparable results as those of processes based models the direct application of physically based models at field level is restricted by extensive experimental information and several assumptions for their parameters rao 1987 this paper examines evapotranspiration and deep percolation to understand the major processes that influence the hydrological cycle and addresses the challenges of traditional flood irrigation management through combined use of water balance model and the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2005 2008 in the ltb the hydrus 1d is based on the richards equation which is the standard model for variably saturated soil water balance simulations diamantopoulos et al 2012 šimůnek et al 2003 vereecken et al 2016 and application of this model in tropical floodplains and comparison with simple models at field scale is substantial comparison of a conceptual deep percolation model and a hydrus 1d model based on lysimetric experiments on different soils of irrigated pasture was conducted by bethune et al 2008 in australia however ground water tables that fluctuate with time in response to irrigation rainfall in the field conditions was not addressed in lysimeters bethune et al 2008 and the study was done for temperate soils at an experimental station based on optimum irrigation management more realistic results were found by incorporating groundwater in unsaturated zone modelling using hydrs 1d in shallow water table regions kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 soylu et al 2011 modelling at field experiments with different soil types groundwater depths fluctuations crop types and irrigation amounts in tropical areas are important simulation of soil water balance using hydrus 1d requires characterization of both top and sub soils groundwater monitoring and measurements of other time variable boundary conditions rezaei et al 2016 which require money skill and equipment as the main interests in this study are inflow and outflow of water from the soil column the internal distribution of soil water content is not examined this study sought a to estimate the deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration from farmers irrigated fields in tropical floodplain soils and b to compare simple water balance model with the hydrus 1d for use in irrigation water use analysis in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area ltb comprises the largest ethiopian lake and extends from 36 7 to 38 2 e to 10 9 to 12 8 n fig 1 it contains 15 321 km2 including 3064 km2 the lake area mccartney et al 2010 the mean annual rainfall is 1345 mm mostly occurring during the rainy season kiremt from june to september engida 2010 wossenie 2015 the other months are dry and crop production is then only possible through irrigation temperature shows high diurnal but small seasonal variations with an annual average of 20 c kebede et al 2011 the basin consists of tertiary and quaternary igneous and quaternary sedimentary rocks that include among others the floodplains dessie et al 2014c the major soil types are luvisols fluvisols leptosols and vertisols about 90 of ltb has an elevation ranging from 1780 to 2500 m a s l with the downstream mostly flat or gently undulating and makes a large floodplain around lake tana wossenie 2015 the floodplains are found bordering the east and north part of the lake and are intensively cultivated both under rain fed during kiremt and irrigation during the dry season irrigation has been practised in the area for a long time and the widely used irrigation methods are flooding and traditional short furrows 2 2 field experiment and data collection two experimental sites called bebeks and shina were selected based on the soil physical characteristics and availability of information in the ltb floodplains for this to get the soil variation which is the most important parameter for water balance modelling the two schemes were systematically selected after determining the soil texture of all schemes found in the floodplain of ltb table 1 generally the floodplain is uniformly clayey but we selected the two schemes with highest sand shina and lowest sand bebeks to interpolate the model results as far as the whole floodplain soil characters lay between these schemes the bebeks irrigation scheme is using a stone masonry diversion weir and is situated in the eastern tip of the floodplains the shina irrigation scheme uses water from an earthen micro dam and is located near lake tana the experimental sites and the other irrigated fields in the floodplains were surveyed and mapped using gps and gis fig 1 the average slope of the experimental sites was 1 3 for experimentation from december 2015 to may 2016 three fields were selected per crop type in a transect perpendicular to the rivers source of irrigation to address soil and groundwater gradient variations hence three fields were selected at bebeks where onion allium cepa l was dominantly produced and six fields were selected in shina where onion and maize zea mays l were cultivated during the experimental period using traditional flood irrigation 2 2 1 irrigation volumes and water table monitoring irrigation application by farmers and the excess irrigation volume that might leave the field as surface runoff were measured using 60 v notches that were installed at the inlet from the irrigation canal and the outlet at the lower side of each field the discharge through the v notches was determined by the v notch formula shen 1981 1 q c d 8 15 2 g tan φ 2 h 2 5 where q is discharge m3 s 1 c is coefficient of discharge g is acceleration due to gravity m s 2 φ is angle between the sides of the notch in this case φ 60 and h is the surface of water level measured with respect to the vertex of the notch m the discharge coefficient cd for v notch angles between 20 and 120 greve 1932 is given as 2 c d 0 585 tan φ 2 0 004 h 0 03 the irrigation volume m3 was determined by multiplying the discharge with irrigation duration s and depth mm was determined by dividing the volume by field size m2 assuming evenly distributed application over the field the depth of irrigation applied by farmers was mostly variable non steady due to traditional water allocation methods that fluctuate even during one irrigation event consequently both depth and duration of flow at every change of flow was recorded then the v notch equation above eqs 1 and 2 was applied for each depth h and time t to compute volume finally each volume obtained was summed up to get the total volume of applied water per irrigation event farmers controlled all farm activities including the amount and timing of irrigation researchers had no role on the farm water management except for measurement and data collection the maximum root depth of onion is 60 cm allen et al 1998 and effective root zone the depth within which most crop roots are concentrated for maize is estimated about 50 100 cm and likely 50 of the roots are found in the upper 20 cm fan et al 2016 similarly the root length density of maize decreases with soil depth and almost 50 of the total root length occurs in the top 10 cm another 30 within the next 20 cm and the remaining 20 below 30 cm yu et al 2007 due to this fact and limitation of moisture sensor at deeper root zones we focused on the most important portion of the root zone the soil water content at the top 30 and 60 cm depths were measured just before and 24 h after irrigation event using gravimetric method two manual rain gauges one for each experimental site were installed but no rainfall was observed during the experimentation period the groundwater level was manually measured daily at 9 00 am from piezometers installed in the experimental fields using stick and meter the piezometers were prepared using 50 mm diameter pvc pipes screened over a length of 1 m from the bottom and the screens were covered with a thin parachute cloth to prevent the entry of fine soil the piezometers were inserted 1 m below the water table before the start of the irrigation season the piezometer screens were packed with sand to prevent clogging with fine soil particles and the well points at the bottom were perforated to prevent false readings during non recharge periods five piezometers were installed diagonally and similarly soil moisture was sampled at five points at each field to average the water table and soil moisture variations as result of infiltration profile variations due to differences in opportunity time surface water sources streams and rivers with electrical conductivity ec values of 0 05 ds m 1 and 0 09 ds m 1 for bebeks and shina respectively as measured with electrical conductivity meter rhoades 1993 richard 1968 was used for irrigation the average electrical conductivity of the groundwater for bebeks and shina were 0 053 0 018 ds m 1 and 0 16 0 07 ds m 1 respectively with salinity levels below 0 7 ds m 1 the water is non saline and suitable for irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 rashid et al 1993 2 2 2 field and laboratory procedures of soil characterization the soil physical properties such as texture field capacity permanent wilting point organic matter and particle density were determined by taking soil samples at each horizon texture was determined by hydrometer analysis field capacity and permanent wilting point were determined at pressures 33 kpa and 1500 kpa using pressure plate extraction botula et al 2012 organic matter was determined by the walkley black method walkley and black 1934 using the potassium dichromate dilution technique bulk density was determined from undisturbed soil samples taken at each horizon using 49 mm diameter and 51 mm length core samplers the soil hydraulic conductivity was determined using pedotransfer functions from texture bulk density and organic matter according to wösten 1997 2 3 the water balance model a simple bucket type water balance model was developed to estimate the actual evapotranspiration and deep percolation components of the water balance in irrigated fields major inputs into the soil include irrigation precipitation and capillary rise whereas the outputs are evapotranspiration surface runoff and deep percolation fig 2 the amount of water added to and leaving out of the soil reservoir by lateral subsurface flow is demonstrated using darcy s law 3 v k s δ h δ l where v is the lateral velocity m day 1 δ h δ l is the slope sub surface slope between the field boundaries and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m day 1 the average slope of the water table between the field boundaries is 0 02 based on the water table depths of the different fields and the distance between fields using values of k s table 2 and this slope the lateral groundwater flow ranges from 0 006 to 0 019 m day 1 hence the contribution of this lateral subsurface flow is minimum as compared to vertical water flow which is governed by gravity similar result was reported by enku et al 2016 for the floodplains in general the water balance equation can be represented as 4 δ s p i c r d p a e t where δs is the change in root zone soil water storage p is precipitation i is irrigation dp is deep percolation r is surface runoff c is capillary rise and aet is actual evapotranspiration all components are expressed in mm and the water balance computation was conducted on a daily basis at each irrigation event during the growing period of the crops under consideration for simplicity capillary flow and deep percolation were merged as 5 d d p c d the net deep percolation is negative if capillary rise dominates and it is positive if deep percolation dominates there was no rainfall p observed during the irrigation dry season in the study area so that runoff generation did not occur thus the runoff component in eq 4 corresponds to the excess amount of irrigation removed from the field as surface runoff finally the field water balance eq 4 can be reduced to 6 δ s i d r a e t 2 3 1 water balance model inputs measured irrigation depth details in section 2 2 during the experimental period were used as an input for the model the region study area is suffering from sparse and unevenly distributed network of meteorological stations worqlul et al 2017 worqlul et al 2018 there are three nearby meteorological stations indicated in fig 1 to experimental sites bahir dar station about 50 km for both schemes hamusit 7 km from shina and wereta 5 km from bebeks all the three stations are found on the same agro ecological zone mid altitude average 1800 m a s l and generally are flat areas according to the world meteorological organization the minimum station network density for tropical regions are 600 900 km2 per station for flat areas worqlul et al 2017 hence the distance of stations from the experimental sites is fair to accept and several researchers used bahir dar station to calculate et p monteith equation in the study area dessie et al 2014a c kebede et al 2011 thirty six years from 1980 to 2016 daily values of temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed data of bahir dar woreta and hamusit stations were obtained from bahir dar branch office of national meteorological agency to estimate the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 potential crop evapotranspiration is the maximum evapotranspiration of a given crop for the given weather conditions and at each stage of development it is expressed as allen et al 1998 rao 1987 7 e t c e t o k c where kc is the crop factor with no water stress conditions allen et al 1998 and cropwat 8 0 fao 2009 smith 1992 swennenhuis 2009 was used for eto and etc calculations the crop factors and growth stages for onion and maize were obtained from allen et al 1998 the δs for the top 60 cm soil was determined by subtracting soil water content measured before irrigation and from soil water content measured 24 h after the each irrigation event at 30 and 60 cm depths and weighting the values 2 3 2 water balance model outputs estimating the actual evapotranspiration aet is a critical element in water balance modelling to estimate deep percolation recharge jiménez martínez et al 2009 aet will reach the maximum potential crop evapotranspiration when the soil moisture exceeds field capacity whereas the aet will be modelled for other moisture values as follows steenhuis and van der molen 1986 8 a e t θ e t c f c θ f c a e t e t c θ f c where θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 fc is the field capacity of the soil in volumetric basis cm3 cm 3 the measured fc values at each horizon section 2 2 was weighted and used for the top 60 cm soil for this calculation deep percolation water leaving below the root zone is found by re arranging eq 6 and solving for d as it is the only unknown parameter in the water balance equation of course when d is greater than zero aet etc 2 4 hydrus model description the hydrus 1d model version 4 14 which is based on the richards equation and simulates one dimensional water movement in multi layered variably saturated soil was applied to predict deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration šimůnek et al 2005 2008 heterogeneous conceptualizations of the soil layers were included for each field by specifying the soil profile and investigating the soil physical properties of each horizon since water movement between soil surface and water table unsaturated zone is dominantly vertical one dimensional hillel 2004 meiwirth and mermoud 2004 van dam and malik 2003 hydrus 1d can be used to study the soil water dynamics van dam et al 2004 several researchers such as crevoisier et al 2008 forkutsa et al 2009 gonzález et al 2015 li et al 2014 and tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 preferred hydrus 1d and successfully applied it for unsaturated zone soil water dynamics the modified richards equation for variably saturated one dimensional water flow in soil assuming the role of the air phase and water flow due to heat gradient being negligible is 9 θ t z k h h θ z 1 s h where h is the water pressure head cm θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 t is time day z is the vertical coordinate cm positive upward and its origin is the soil surface s is the sink term cm3 cm 3 day 1 representing the plant water uptake by roots transpiration and k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function cm day 1 the sink term is determined in terms of the crop potential uptake rate and a water stress factor feddes et al 1978 the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties θ h and k h were derived using the van genuchten mualem functional relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 2 4 1 the hydrus model input hydraulic parameter optimization points on the soil water retention curves for each soil horizon were estimated with a k nearest neighbour pedotransfer functions of tropical soils botula et al 2013 the function uses measured particle size distribution bulk density organic carbon soil water content at field capacity and at wilting point data the retc parameter optimization program van genuchten et al 1991 was then used to fit the predicted data and to derive the independent unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity parameters θ s θ r α n k s retc uses a nonlinear least squares optimization approach levenberg marquardt to estimate the unknown model parameters from observed retention data van genuchten et al 1991 the value for l was set at 0 5 a default value for many soils sensitivity analysis was performed to find out the most important hydraulic parameters on which the model results are most sensitive in the specific situations local sensitivity analysis lsa using a one at a time oat approach was used to understand the effect of each parameter to the model output since this approach allows a clear identification of single parameter effects we ran simulations of soil water balance after the van genuchten 1980 hydraulic property model was optimized 2 4 2 initial and boundary conditions and other input data to the hydrus model since the soil surface is subjected to the atmospheric boundary condition bc the upper bc was set equal to the atmospheric bc with surface runoff whereas the variable pressure head was selected as the lower bc daily records of groundwater level was input soil water content during planting was used to define the initial conditions the root water uptake was simulated using the feddes root water uptake reduction model with no solute stress the ec of soil water in the study area is less than 0 7 ds m 1 crop information was derived from observations of crop height measured crop height at each stage to obtain lai leaf area index and growth stages and values of rooting depth were taken from literature the critical water pressure head values were taken from wesseling et al 1991 feddes and raats 2004 and taylor and ashcroft 1972 considering a high evaporative demand the crop interception and throughfall contributions were ignored because flood irrigation was directly applied to the soil surface daily meteorological data including minimum and maximum air temperature humidity sunshine hours and wind speed that are required to calculate potential et by penman monteith method allen et al 1998 which were obtained from the nearby meteorological stations see 2 3 1 were given to the hydrus model the latitude to define the extra terrestrial radiation and altitude were also defined measured irrigation event based and putting zero for non irrigation dates because there was no rainfall and daily records of groundwater level were given as time variable boundary conditions the soil material was distributed based on the observed depths of each horizon three soil layers were considered in each field for simulations with the bottom layer extended to the depth of the water table before the onset of irrigation the profile was discretized by assigning 1 cm equally spaced nodes for the whole profile depth and no hysteresis in water retention was considered observation nodes were placed at 30 cm and 60 cm depths to track moisture fluxes and compare with the observations of soil water content which were measured at 30 cm and 60 cm depths 2 4 3 simulation results of the hydrus model from hydrus model simulation results actual and potential transpiration evaporation soil water content and bottom flux were the most important components of interest a negative bottom flux indicates loss from the soil column in the form of deep percolation and positive values indicate gain to the system capillary rise here the daily and seasonal bottom flux actual transpiration and soil evaporation were quantified and investigated to understand the soil water balance of the fields under different soil crop irrigation and water table depth conditions 2 5 the hydrus model validation the irrigation application and simulated soil water content daily at 30 cm and 60 cm depths at observation nodes and the soil water content taken just before and 24 h after each irrigation event at 30 cm and 60 cm depths were plotted and compared for validation one of the common methods of estimating et o is by converting the class a pan evaporation into et o by using a pan coefficient doorenbos and pruitt 1977 grismer et al 2002 sentelhas and folegatti 2003 hence the hydrus model was also validated by comparing the daily simulated potential et by hydrus model calculated et o eq 11 using class a pan evaporation data and also daily et o simulated by the cropwat 8 0 allen et al 1998 daily pan evaporation data was collected from bahir dar metrology station the pan coefficient k p was calculated to the specific climatic conditions from daily records of wind speed u and relative humidity h using the cuenca 1989 equation 10 k p 0 475 2 4 10 4 u 2 5 16 10 3 r h 1 18 10 3 f 1 6 10 5 r

the pan which was commonly taken about 20 m after determining kp the eto was calculated as 11 e t o e p a n k p 3 results 3 1 soil hydraulic parameters the soil hydraulic parameters required to simulate the hydrus model are shown in table 3 the most important hydraulic parameters on which the hydrus model is most sensitive were saturated soil water content θs the parameter n and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks fig 3 since the values of n were small table 3 sensitivity analysis was performed starting from n 1 the minimum value in van genuchten thus reduction in percentages of n were not considered fig 3c 3 2 model validation the observed soil water content before and 24 h after irrigation events and daily simulated soil water content by the hydrus model at 30 cm and 60 cm depths and farmers irrigation depth are given fig 4 the soil moisture showed similar variation tendencies following irrigation as it rapid increase and decrease by visual comparison the simulated and observed soil water content also showed reasonably similar trends and the mean estimation error mse ranged from 0 05 to 0 08 similarly the root means square error rmse between observed and simulated soil water content varied from 0 06 to 0 09 the simulated potential et by hydrus model and eto simulated by cropwat 8 0 and from pan evaporation are also illustrated fig 4 the rmse between eto from pan and potential et from hydrus was 0 69 and the me was 0 45 likewise the rmse and me between estimated eto by cropwat 8 0 and potential et from hydrus model was 0 51 and 0 37 respectively as expected the eto estimated from pan evaporation was generally higher than the simulated values specifically starting from march fig 4 in addition rainfall was not observed and there was no excess irrigation water leaving the fields during the experimental period hence runoff was not included in the water balance model the hydrus model simulations also resulted in zero runoff in all fields and the seasonal values of d and aet estimated by the hydrus model and by the water balance model are comparable table 7 3 3 evapotranspiration the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and the potential crop evapotranspiration etc values are presented in tables 4 and 5 because of growth stage variations due to different planting dates the potential etc values in the same experimental site are different for the same crop at different fields table 5 the computation of evapotranspiration as well as partitioning of evapotranspiration in to crop transpiration crop water uptake by roots that is the sink term in richards s equation and soil evaporation was done by hydrus model fig 5 the seasonal actual values of evapotranspiration for the crops growing periods simulated by the hydrus and the water balance models are also listed table 7 3 4 deep percolation field observations showed that the groundwater table depth varied from 2 m to 3 5 m with a decreasing trend from fields 1 to 3 for both experimental sites the deep percolation d values estimated by the water balance and the hydrus model for each field for the growing season and irrigation application are shown table 7 the highest d 184 7 mm was predicted in shina onion field 2 by the water balance model the hydrus model predicted the second highest d 139 4 mm in bebeks onion field 3 the smallest d 54 4 mm was predicted in shina maize field 2 by the hydrus model in general the seasonal d values range from 12 to 41 of the applied irrigation 3 5 irrigation management and irrigation water consumption the experimental period december may is dry season and crop growth was possible by full irrigation applications rainfall was not observed in both sites during the experimental period about 2 5 of the floodplain is currently irrigated which is 60 km2 surveyed and are found scattered in small scale community managed irrigation schemes and farmer level pump irrigation systems from rivers and streams surface water sources the crop water requirements were also estimated using the fao penman monteith method based on the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 using cropwat 8 0 and soil properties the farmers irrigation depth at each irrigation event indicated in fig 4 and crop water requirement of each field estimated by cropwat 8 0 based on planting dates and weather data are given table 6 in addition irrigation scheduling is recommended for maize and onion crops planted at 10th december most common planting week according to the local practice in shina and bebeks taking the average soil properties of the scheme annex a annex b annex c the minimum and maximum seasonal irrigation application by farmers were 397 mm and 526 mm respectively due to absence of water in the reservoir maize fields were not irrigated starting from the second week of april during maize maturity period this indicated that irrigation amount in maize fields would be higher than the observed values in table 6 generally onion fields were over irrigated than maize fields table 6 and annex a annex b annex c the irrigation water abstraction in the floodplain during irrigation seasons likely ranges from 23 8 to 31 5 mm3 y 1 4 discussion 4 1 evapotranspiration the seasonal values of aet estimated by the hydrus and the water balance models are comparable and correlated pearson r 0 73 the hydrus model estimated the actual transpiration and evaporation whereas the water balance model where the internal physical processes are not considered but the system as a whole is treated xu et al 2016 only estimated aet merging evaporation and transpiration because of high vegetation cover of maize starting from its vegetative stages soil evaporation was zero and aet was controlled by actual transpiration in the onion fields evaporation was high in early stages and reduced starting from vegetative stages but existed throughout the growing season though here the dominant process was also transpiration fig 5 the actual transpiration was high during most of the growth periods except in maize fields during the late stage in both crops due to high irrigation application in the early stages however irrigation was excess during most of the growth stages absence of water for irrigation in maize fields during maturity period resulted stress which was indicated by a rapid decrease of the actual transpiration during the period fig 5 the water balance modelling results table 7 showed that aet is the dominant process of the hydrological cycle 72 94 of irrigation this high aet was mostly close to the potential et because the crops were not stressed in most of the seasons except maize fields during maturity stage in this particular case where the crops were fully irrigated were not under stress the numerical model might not had much added value as the et values were nearly the same in both models 4 2 soil moisture and deep percolation the fluctuations in measured and predicted by hydrus model soil water content before and after irrigation events are higher at 30 cm depth than at 60 cm fig 4 this indicates a higher response to irrigation and evaporative demand as well as more root water uptake in the topsoil than in the subsoil soil moisture is generally high in onion fields than in maze fields due to high consumption of water by maize crops the cumulative deep percolation d predicted by the hydrus and the water balance models are generally comparable since in the water balance model a uniform root depth was considered for all plots depth to groundwater has no a recognized effect on the predicted d the hydrus model predicted higher d in fields with shallower groundwater than fields with higher groundwater depth for instance fields 2 and 3 have higher d than field 1 the deepest water table field in both schemes in both experimental sites and crops table 7 generally higher d was predicted by the simple water balance model table 7 due to smaller root zone consideration the resulted showed that d resulted in a significant loss of available surface water under the current irrigation management in the area of interest 12 41 of the applied water 4 3 irrigation water management the farmers in both irrigation schemes decide irrigating their fields based on weather conditions and access to water rather than on growth stage based crop water demand they apply the same amount of irrigation regardless of growth stages and crop types depending on access to water farmers apply more water in early crop stages even if the crop does not require irrigation believing that applying more water will increase the crop yield fig 4 and table 6 the farmers over irrigate onion fields than maize fields table 6 and annex a annex b annex c because they irrigate regardless of crop type overuse of water during early stages caused the water reservoir in shina to dry this overuse at the early stage led to shortage of irrigation water for maize fields during maturity stages maize was planted around 10th of december and harvested in the mid of may causing stress during the last weeks of the crop stage with the rapid decrease of actual transpiration in maize fields fig 5 furthermore this over irrigation during early stages might cause loss of water due to unproductive excessive transpiration in both crops the farmers irrigation scheme uses over irrigation during early growth stages table 6 and annex a annex b annex c it can be noted that the farmer s irrigation application might have been more if the reservoir in shina had not dried generally it could be possible to save the available water and irrigate maize fields to avoid stress during maturity by reducing early stage over irrigation the d from irrigation 12 41 of irrigation is the second important water balance component next to aet and the most important loss in the soil reservoir in the study area soil evaporation is minimum table 6 and drastically decreased during vegetative periods fig 5 hence the most important loss in the irrigation system is the d to the groundwater from the seasonal current irrigation consumption in the floodplains 3 10 mm3 y 1 of irrigation water is lost due to d and fed the groundwater previous studies of recharge from agricultural alluvial soils of arid climate also indicated that irrigation water is the most important source of groundwater recharge followed by rain water ebrahimi et al 2016 here irrigation management strategies that minimize d and conservation practices that reduce excessive unproductive transpiration are crucial to irrigate more fields with the present available surface water resources to meet the growing food and fibre demand obviously deep percolation from irrigation will feed the groundwater for future use for irrigation as well as for urban or rural domestic consumption coming to the irrigation consumption pumping the groundwater for irrigation purpose has higher operation cost than using available surface water sources if feasible for only some wealthy farmers to pump the groundwater that would mean un equal resource distribution hence for low income farming society like in the study area minimizing deep percolation will bring a better and cheaper access to water among beneficiary farmers 5 conclusion both the hydrus 1d and the water balance model provided reasonably good simulation results of actual evapotranspiration aet and deep percolation d from irrigated fields in tropical floodplain soils the seasonal values of d and aet simulated by the hydrus and the water balance models are comparable the study showed that aet and d are the dominant processes in the hydrological cycle in the study area the soil water balance simulation results of the hydrus model were mainly controlled by the soil hydraulic parameters irrigation depth local weather conditions and depth to the groundwater the saturated soil water content saturated hydraulic conductivity and pore size distribution parameter i e van genuchten s n were found to be the most important parameter inputs to hydrus model in the study area the water balance model can be used as an alternative for numerical models in data scarce areas as the cumulative results obtained by both models are comparable in general the d appeared to be a significant loss of applied irrigation water 12 41 in the floodplains farmers irrigation practice in which irrigation was applied regardless of crop type and growth stage must be scheduled according to the crop water demand annex a annex b annex c

11503,the deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration from flood irrigation in tropical floodplains were predicted using a numerical model hydrus 1d and a bucket type water balance model field experiments were conducted on onion and maize crops grown from december 2015 to may 2016 in small irrigation schemes found in the lake tana floodplains of ethiopia experimental fields were selected along a topographic transect to account for soil and groundwater variability irrigation volumes were measured using v notches and irrigation depths 400 550 mm were calculated and daily groundwater levels were monitored manually from piezometers installed in the fields the soil profiles were described at each field and physical properties texture fc pwp bd and om were measured at each horizon which were used to derive model input parameters soil hydraulic properties residual and saturated moisture content saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters related to pore size distribution n air entry α and pore connectivity l were derived using knn pedotransfer functions for tropical soils and fitted using retention curve program for unsaturated soils retc the seasonal actual evapotranspiration estimated by hydrus and water balance models ranged from 320 to 360 mm for onion and from 400 to 470 mm for maize the seasonal deep percolation estimated from both models was 12 41 of applied irrigation and with this flood irrigation management the deep percolation is very high implementing precise irrigation and water saving practices that minimize deep percolation and unproductive excessive consumptive use are required to achieve the growing food demand with the available water when less detailed information is available the water balance model can be an alternative to predict deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration keywords deep percolation irrigation soil water balance hydraulic parameters hydrus 1d ethiopia 1 introduction irrigated agriculture accounts for 70 of the global freshwater withdrawals and 90 of consumptive water uses siebert et al 2010 due to growing food demand for the 7 billion world population irrigated areas more than doubled from 1961 to 2009 fao 2010 irrigation is used to get out of poverty alleviate the effects of drought and improve livelihoods belay and bewket 2013 makurira et al 2007 improving irrigation efficiency for sustainable water management is the major objective of irrigated agriculture this is especially important in africa south of the sahara where undernourishment is prevalent clarke et al 2017 and irrigated agriculture highly depends on the amount of nearby water sources belay and bewket 2013 most smallholders in africa south of the sahara use surface irrigation methods with greater risks of failure kay 2001 and irrigation water management in the region is generally poor belay and bewket 2013 the majority of ethiopian farmers use traditional short closed end furrow irrigation geremew et al 2008 mintesinot et al 2004 and flooding like other poorly resourced farmers in africa data scarcity is one of the challenges of water management in the country in general and lake tana basin ltb basin in particular where only 3 of the potential irrigable area which is 11 is irrigated with surface water worqlul et al 2015 in ltb resources scarcity is critical to agricultural productivity of small farms clarke et al 2017 and its land and water resources are not properly utilized derib et al 2010 setegn et al 2008 although few researches were conducted in ltb to understand rainfall and runoff processes collick et al 2009 dessie et al 2014b c kebede et al 2011 setegn et al 2008 the irrigated agriculture as an integral part of the systems was not investigated well despite its role in water resources as well as in rural livelihoods floodplains are dynamic systems due to frequent erosion and sedimentation flood inundations and complex groundwater surface water interactions dessie et al 2014a tockner et al 2008 floodplains have been exposed to intensive land use and management changes krause et al 2007 furthermore the new water resource management approach in ethiopia is giving priories to protect floodplains kloos and legesse 2016 the ltb floodplains are selected as national growth corridor where irrigation will be intensified mccartney et al 2010 therefore besides government priorities the complex exchanges in groundwater surface water and its economic benefits to rural livelihoods made irrigated floodplains of ltb vital areas of research to improve irrigation systems efficiency the major hydrological processes in the system are needed to be identified and quantified understanding the important components of the water balance such as actual evapotranspiration and deep percolation under specific irrigation practice is crucial to develop irrigation management strategies under excessive irrigation applications soil evaporation will be higher and deep percolation occurs if infiltrated irrigation exceeds the soil storage capacity bethune et al 2008 furthermore excessive non productive transpiration in poor irrigation management may be a substantial loss in data scarce areas such as ltb and in situations where acquisition of field data is costly and time consuming models are an alternative ways to manage systems once they are validated arnold and allen 1996 water balance simulation using process based models helps to analyse how efficient the water is used soldevilla martinez et al 2014 on the other hand process based complex models that accurately simulate the water balance require large input data and parameters loosvelt et al 2011 which needs intensive field and laboratory work determination of all required soil parameters is difficult in developing countries because of lack of equipment skills and budget simple models can be an alternative tool for water management in data scarce regions and provide comparable results as those of processes based models the direct application of physically based models at field level is restricted by extensive experimental information and several assumptions for their parameters rao 1987 this paper examines evapotranspiration and deep percolation to understand the major processes that influence the hydrological cycle and addresses the challenges of traditional flood irrigation management through combined use of water balance model and the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2005 2008 in the ltb the hydrus 1d is based on the richards equation which is the standard model for variably saturated soil water balance simulations diamantopoulos et al 2012 šimůnek et al 2003 vereecken et al 2016 and application of this model in tropical floodplains and comparison with simple models at field scale is substantial comparison of a conceptual deep percolation model and a hydrus 1d model based on lysimetric experiments on different soils of irrigated pasture was conducted by bethune et al 2008 in australia however ground water tables that fluctuate with time in response to irrigation rainfall in the field conditions was not addressed in lysimeters bethune et al 2008 and the study was done for temperate soils at an experimental station based on optimum irrigation management more realistic results were found by incorporating groundwater in unsaturated zone modelling using hydrs 1d in shallow water table regions kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 soylu et al 2011 modelling at field experiments with different soil types groundwater depths fluctuations crop types and irrigation amounts in tropical areas are important simulation of soil water balance using hydrus 1d requires characterization of both top and sub soils groundwater monitoring and measurements of other time variable boundary conditions rezaei et al 2016 which require money skill and equipment as the main interests in this study are inflow and outflow of water from the soil column the internal distribution of soil water content is not examined this study sought a to estimate the deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration from farmers irrigated fields in tropical floodplain soils and b to compare simple water balance model with the hydrus 1d for use in irrigation water use analysis in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area ltb comprises the largest ethiopian lake and extends from 36 7 to 38 2 e to 10 9 to 12 8 n fig 1 it contains 15 321 km2 including 3064 km2 the lake area mccartney et al 2010 the mean annual rainfall is 1345 mm mostly occurring during the rainy season kiremt from june to september engida 2010 wossenie 2015 the other months are dry and crop production is then only possible through irrigation temperature shows high diurnal but small seasonal variations with an annual average of 20 c kebede et al 2011 the basin consists of tertiary and quaternary igneous and quaternary sedimentary rocks that include among others the floodplains dessie et al 2014c the major soil types are luvisols fluvisols leptosols and vertisols about 90 of ltb has an elevation ranging from 1780 to 2500 m a s l with the downstream mostly flat or gently undulating and makes a large floodplain around lake tana wossenie 2015 the floodplains are found bordering the east and north part of the lake and are intensively cultivated both under rain fed during kiremt and irrigation during the dry season irrigation has been practised in the area for a long time and the widely used irrigation methods are flooding and traditional short furrows 2 2 field experiment and data collection two experimental sites called bebeks and shina were selected based on the soil physical characteristics and availability of information in the ltb floodplains for this to get the soil variation which is the most important parameter for water balance modelling the two schemes were systematically selected after determining the soil texture of all schemes found in the floodplain of ltb table 1 generally the floodplain is uniformly clayey but we selected the two schemes with highest sand shina and lowest sand bebeks to interpolate the model results as far as the whole floodplain soil characters lay between these schemes the bebeks irrigation scheme is using a stone masonry diversion weir and is situated in the eastern tip of the floodplains the shina irrigation scheme uses water from an earthen micro dam and is located near lake tana the experimental sites and the other irrigated fields in the floodplains were surveyed and mapped using gps and gis fig 1 the average slope of the experimental sites was 1 3 for experimentation from december 2015 to may 2016 three fields were selected per crop type in a transect perpendicular to the rivers source of irrigation to address soil and groundwater gradient variations hence three fields were selected at bebeks where onion allium cepa l was dominantly produced and six fields were selected in shina where onion and maize zea mays l were cultivated during the experimental period using traditional flood irrigation 2 2 1 irrigation volumes and water table monitoring irrigation application by farmers and the excess irrigation volume that might leave the field as surface runoff were measured using 60 v notches that were installed at the inlet from the irrigation canal and the outlet at the lower side of each field the discharge through the v notches was determined by the v notch formula shen 1981 1 q c d 8 15 2 g tan φ 2 h 2 5 where q is discharge m3 s 1 c is coefficient of discharge g is acceleration due to gravity m s 2 φ is angle between the sides of the notch in this case φ 60 and h is the surface of water level measured with respect to the vertex of the notch m the discharge coefficient cd for v notch angles between 20 and 120 greve 1932 is given as 2 c d 0 585 tan φ 2 0 004 h 0 03 the irrigation volume m3 was determined by multiplying the discharge with irrigation duration s and depth mm was determined by dividing the volume by field size m2 assuming evenly distributed application over the field the depth of irrigation applied by farmers was mostly variable non steady due to traditional water allocation methods that fluctuate even during one irrigation event consequently both depth and duration of flow at every change of flow was recorded then the v notch equation above eqs 1 and 2 was applied for each depth h and time t to compute volume finally each volume obtained was summed up to get the total volume of applied water per irrigation event farmers controlled all farm activities including the amount and timing of irrigation researchers had no role on the farm water management except for measurement and data collection the maximum root depth of onion is 60 cm allen et al 1998 and effective root zone the depth within which most crop roots are concentrated for maize is estimated about 50 100 cm and likely 50 of the roots are found in the upper 20 cm fan et al 2016 similarly the root length density of maize decreases with soil depth and almost 50 of the total root length occurs in the top 10 cm another 30 within the next 20 cm and the remaining 20 below 30 cm yu et al 2007 due to this fact and limitation of moisture sensor at deeper root zones we focused on the most important portion of the root zone the soil water content at the top 30 and 60 cm depths were measured just before and 24 h after irrigation event using gravimetric method two manual rain gauges one for each experimental site were installed but no rainfall was observed during the experimentation period the groundwater level was manually measured daily at 9 00 am from piezometers installed in the experimental fields using stick and meter the piezometers were prepared using 50 mm diameter pvc pipes screened over a length of 1 m from the bottom and the screens were covered with a thin parachute cloth to prevent the entry of fine soil the piezometers were inserted 1 m below the water table before the start of the irrigation season the piezometer screens were packed with sand to prevent clogging with fine soil particles and the well points at the bottom were perforated to prevent false readings during non recharge periods five piezometers were installed diagonally and similarly soil moisture was sampled at five points at each field to average the water table and soil moisture variations as result of infiltration profile variations due to differences in opportunity time surface water sources streams and rivers with electrical conductivity ec values of 0 05 ds m 1 and 0 09 ds m 1 for bebeks and shina respectively as measured with electrical conductivity meter rhoades 1993 richard 1968 was used for irrigation the average electrical conductivity of the groundwater for bebeks and shina were 0 053 0 018 ds m 1 and 0 16 0 07 ds m 1 respectively with salinity levels below 0 7 ds m 1 the water is non saline and suitable for irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 rashid et al 1993 2 2 2 field and laboratory procedures of soil characterization the soil physical properties such as texture field capacity permanent wilting point organic matter and particle density were determined by taking soil samples at each horizon texture was determined by hydrometer analysis field capacity and permanent wilting point were determined at pressures 33 kpa and 1500 kpa using pressure plate extraction botula et al 2012 organic matter was determined by the walkley black method walkley and black 1934 using the potassium dichromate dilution technique bulk density was determined from undisturbed soil samples taken at each horizon using 49 mm diameter and 51 mm length core samplers the soil hydraulic conductivity was determined using pedotransfer functions from texture bulk density and organic matter according to wösten 1997 2 3 the water balance model a simple bucket type water balance model was developed to estimate the actual evapotranspiration and deep percolation components of the water balance in irrigated fields major inputs into the soil include irrigation precipitation and capillary rise whereas the outputs are evapotranspiration surface runoff and deep percolation fig 2 the amount of water added to and leaving out of the soil reservoir by lateral subsurface flow is demonstrated using darcy s law 3 v k s δ h δ l where v is the lateral velocity m day 1 δ h δ l is the slope sub surface slope between the field boundaries and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m day 1 the average slope of the water table between the field boundaries is 0 02 based on the water table depths of the different fields and the distance between fields using values of k s table 2 and this slope the lateral groundwater flow ranges from 0 006 to 0 019 m day 1 hence the contribution of this lateral subsurface flow is minimum as compared to vertical water flow which is governed by gravity similar result was reported by enku et al 2016 for the floodplains in general the water balance equation can be represented as 4 δ s p i c r d p a e t where δs is the change in root zone soil water storage p is precipitation i is irrigation dp is deep percolation r is surface runoff c is capillary rise and aet is actual evapotranspiration all components are expressed in mm and the water balance computation was conducted on a daily basis at each irrigation event during the growing period of the crops under consideration for simplicity capillary flow and deep percolation were merged as 5 d d p c d the net deep percolation is negative if capillary rise dominates and it is positive if deep percolation dominates there was no rainfall p observed during the irrigation dry season in the study area so that runoff generation did not occur thus the runoff component in eq 4 corresponds to the excess amount of irrigation removed from the field as surface runoff finally the field water balance eq 4 can be reduced to 6 δ s i d r a e t 2 3 1 water balance model inputs measured irrigation depth details in section 2 2 during the experimental period were used as an input for the model the region study area is suffering from sparse and unevenly distributed network of meteorological stations worqlul et al 2017 worqlul et al 2018 there are three nearby meteorological stations indicated in fig 1 to experimental sites bahir dar station about 50 km for both schemes hamusit 7 km from shina and wereta 5 km from bebeks all the three stations are found on the same agro ecological zone mid altitude average 1800 m a s l and generally are flat areas according to the world meteorological organization the minimum station network density for tropical regions are 600 900 km2 per station for flat areas worqlul et al 2017 hence the distance of stations from the experimental sites is fair to accept and several researchers used bahir dar station to calculate et p monteith equation in the study area dessie et al 2014a c kebede et al 2011 thirty six years from 1980 to 2016 daily values of temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed data of bahir dar woreta and hamusit stations were obtained from bahir dar branch office of national meteorological agency to estimate the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 potential crop evapotranspiration is the maximum evapotranspiration of a given crop for the given weather conditions and at each stage of development it is expressed as allen et al 1998 rao 1987 7 e t c e t o k c where kc is the crop factor with no water stress conditions allen et al 1998 and cropwat 8 0 fao 2009 smith 1992 swennenhuis 2009 was used for eto and etc calculations the crop factors and growth stages for onion and maize were obtained from allen et al 1998 the δs for the top 60 cm soil was determined by subtracting soil water content measured before irrigation and from soil water content measured 24 h after the each irrigation event at 30 and 60 cm depths and weighting the values 2 3 2 water balance model outputs estimating the actual evapotranspiration aet is a critical element in water balance modelling to estimate deep percolation recharge jiménez martínez et al 2009 aet will reach the maximum potential crop evapotranspiration when the soil moisture exceeds field capacity whereas the aet will be modelled for other moisture values as follows steenhuis and van der molen 1986 8 a e t θ e t c f c θ f c a e t e t c θ f c where θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 fc is the field capacity of the soil in volumetric basis cm3 cm 3 the measured fc values at each horizon section 2 2 was weighted and used for the top 60 cm soil for this calculation deep percolation water leaving below the root zone is found by re arranging eq 6 and solving for d as it is the only unknown parameter in the water balance equation of course when d is greater than zero aet etc 2 4 hydrus model description the hydrus 1d model version 4 14 which is based on the richards equation and simulates one dimensional water movement in multi layered variably saturated soil was applied to predict deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration šimůnek et al 2005 2008 heterogeneous conceptualizations of the soil layers were included for each field by specifying the soil profile and investigating the soil physical properties of each horizon since water movement between soil surface and water table unsaturated zone is dominantly vertical one dimensional hillel 2004 meiwirth and mermoud 2004 van dam and malik 2003 hydrus 1d can be used to study the soil water dynamics van dam et al 2004 several researchers such as crevoisier et al 2008 forkutsa et al 2009 gonzález et al 2015 li et al 2014 and tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 preferred hydrus 1d and successfully applied it for unsaturated zone soil water dynamics the modified richards equation for variably saturated one dimensional water flow in soil assuming the role of the air phase and water flow due to heat gradient being negligible is 9 θ t z k h h θ z 1 s h where h is the water pressure head cm θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 t is time day z is the vertical coordinate cm positive upward and its origin is the soil surface s is the sink term cm3 cm 3 day 1 representing the plant water uptake by roots transpiration and k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function cm day 1 the sink term is determined in terms of the crop potential uptake rate and a water stress factor feddes et al 1978 the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties θ h and k h were derived using the van genuchten mualem functional relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 2 4 1 the hydrus model input hydraulic parameter optimization points on the soil water retention curves for each soil horizon were estimated with a k nearest neighbour pedotransfer functions of tropical soils botula et al 2013 the function uses measured particle size distribution bulk density organic carbon soil water content at field capacity and at wilting point data the retc parameter optimization program van genuchten et al 1991 was then used to fit the predicted data and to derive the independent unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity parameters θ s θ r α n k s retc uses a nonlinear least squares optimization approach levenberg marquardt to estimate the unknown model parameters from observed retention data van genuchten et al 1991 the value for l was set at 0 5 a default value for many soils sensitivity analysis was performed to find out the most important hydraulic parameters on which the model results are most sensitive in the specific situations local sensitivity analysis lsa using a one at a time oat approach was used to understand the effect of each parameter to the model output since this approach allows a clear identification of single parameter effects we ran simulations of soil water balance after the van genuchten 1980 hydraulic property model was optimized 2 4 2 initial and boundary conditions and other input data to the hydrus model since the soil surface is subjected to the atmospheric boundary condition bc the upper bc was set equal to the atmospheric bc with surface runoff whereas the variable pressure head was selected as the lower bc daily records of groundwater level was input soil water content during planting was used to define the initial conditions the root water uptake was simulated using the feddes root water uptake reduction model with no solute stress the ec of soil water in the study area is less than 0 7 ds m 1 crop information was derived from observations of crop height measured crop height at each stage to obtain lai leaf area index and growth stages and values of rooting depth were taken from literature the critical water pressure head values were taken from wesseling et al 1991 feddes and raats 2004 and taylor and ashcroft 1972 considering a high evaporative demand the crop interception and throughfall contributions were ignored because flood irrigation was directly applied to the soil surface daily meteorological data including minimum and maximum air temperature humidity sunshine hours and wind speed that are required to calculate potential et by penman monteith method allen et al 1998 which were obtained from the nearby meteorological stations see 2 3 1 were given to the hydrus model the latitude to define the extra terrestrial radiation and altitude were also defined measured irrigation event based and putting zero for non irrigation dates because there was no rainfall and daily records of groundwater level were given as time variable boundary conditions the soil material was distributed based on the observed depths of each horizon three soil layers were considered in each field for simulations with the bottom layer extended to the depth of the water table before the onset of irrigation the profile was discretized by assigning 1 cm equally spaced nodes for the whole profile depth and no hysteresis in water retention was considered observation nodes were placed at 30 cm and 60 cm depths to track moisture fluxes and compare with the observations of soil water content which were measured at 30 cm and 60 cm depths 2 4 3 simulation results of the hydrus model from hydrus model simulation results actual and potential transpiration evaporation soil water content and bottom flux were the most important components of interest a negative bottom flux indicates loss from the soil column in the form of deep percolation and positive values indicate gain to the system capillary rise here the daily and seasonal bottom flux actual transpiration and soil evaporation were quantified and investigated to understand the soil water balance of the fields under different soil crop irrigation and water table depth conditions 2 5 the hydrus model validation the irrigation application and simulated soil water content daily at 30 cm and 60 cm depths at observation nodes and the soil water content taken just before and 24 h after each irrigation event at 30 cm and 60 cm depths were plotted and compared for validation one of the common methods of estimating et o is by converting the class a pan evaporation into et o by using a pan coefficient doorenbos and pruitt 1977 grismer et al 2002 sentelhas and folegatti 2003 hence the hydrus model was also validated by comparing the daily simulated potential et by hydrus model calculated et o eq 11 using class a pan evaporation data and also daily et o simulated by the cropwat 8 0 allen et al 1998 daily pan evaporation data was collected from bahir dar metrology station the pan coefficient k p was calculated to the specific climatic conditions from daily records of wind speed u and relative humidity h using the cuenca 1989 equation 10 k p 0 475 2 4 10 4 u 2 5 16 10 3 r h 1 18 10 3 f 1 6 10 5 r

the pan which was commonly taken about 20 m after determining kp the eto was calculated as 11 e t o e p a n k p 3 results 3 1 soil hydraulic parameters the soil hydraulic parameters required to simulate the hydrus model are shown in table 3 the most important hydraulic parameters on which the hydrus model is most sensitive were saturated soil water content θs the parameter n and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks fig 3 since the values of n were small table 3 sensitivity analysis was performed starting from n 1 the minimum value in van genuchten thus reduction in percentages of n were not considered fig 3c 3 2 model validation the observed soil water content before and 24 h after irrigation events and daily simulated soil water content by the hydrus model at 30 cm and 60 cm depths and farmers irrigation depth are given fig 4 the soil moisture showed similar variation tendencies following irrigation as it rapid increase and decrease by visual comparison the simulated and observed soil water content also showed reasonably similar trends and the mean estimation error mse ranged from 0 05 to 0 08 similarly the root means square error rmse between observed and simulated soil water content varied from 0 06 to 0 09 the simulated potential et by hydrus model and eto simulated by cropwat 8 0 and from pan evaporation are also illustrated fig 4 the rmse between eto from pan and potential et from hydrus was 0 69 and the me was 0 45 likewise the rmse and me between estimated eto by cropwat 8 0 and potential et from hydrus model was 0 51 and 0 37 respectively as expected the eto estimated from pan evaporation was generally higher than the simulated values specifically starting from march fig 4 in addition rainfall was not observed and there was no excess irrigation water leaving the fields during the experimental period hence runoff was not included in the water balance model the hydrus model simulations also resulted in zero runoff in all fields and the seasonal values of d and aet estimated by the hydrus model and by the water balance model are comparable table 7 3 3 evapotranspiration the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and the potential crop evapotranspiration etc values are presented in tables 4 and 5 because of growth stage variations due to different planting dates the potential etc values in the same experimental site are different for the same crop at different fields table 5 the computation of evapotranspiration as well as partitioning of evapotranspiration in to crop transpiration crop water uptake by roots that is the sink term in richards s equation and soil evaporation was done by hydrus model fig 5 the seasonal actual values of evapotranspiration for the crops growing periods simulated by the hydrus and the water balance models are also listed table 7 3 4 deep percolation field observations showed that the groundwater table depth varied from 2 m to 3 5 m with a decreasing trend from fields 1 to 3 for both experimental sites the deep percolation d values estimated by the water balance and the hydrus model for each field for the growing season and irrigation application are shown table 7 the highest d 184 7 mm was predicted in shina onion field 2 by the water balance model the hydrus model predicted the second highest d 139 4 mm in bebeks onion field 3 the smallest d 54 4 mm was predicted in shina maize field 2 by the hydrus model in general the seasonal d values range from 12 to 41 of the applied irrigation 3 5 irrigation management and irrigation water consumption the experimental period december may is dry season and crop growth was possible by full irrigation applications rainfall was not observed in both sites during the experimental period about 2 5 of the floodplain is currently irrigated which is 60 km2 surveyed and are found scattered in small scale community managed irrigation schemes and farmer level pump irrigation systems from rivers and streams surface water sources the crop water requirements were also estimated using the fao penman monteith method based on the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 using cropwat 8 0 and soil properties the farmers irrigation depth at each irrigation event indicated in fig 4 and crop water requirement of each field estimated by cropwat 8 0 based on planting dates and weather data are given table 6 in addition irrigation scheduling is recommended for maize and onion crops planted at 10th december most common planting week according to the local practice in shina and bebeks taking the average soil properties of the scheme annex a annex b annex c the minimum and maximum seasonal irrigation application by farmers were 397 mm and 526 mm respectively due to absence of water in the reservoir maize fields were not irrigated starting from the second week of april during maize maturity period this indicated that irrigation amount in maize fields would be higher than the observed values in table 6 generally onion fields were over irrigated than maize fields table 6 and annex a annex b annex c the irrigation water abstraction in the floodplain during irrigation seasons likely ranges from 23 8 to 31 5 mm3 y 1 4 discussion 4 1 evapotranspiration the seasonal values of aet estimated by the hydrus and the water balance models are comparable and correlated pearson r 0 73 the hydrus model estimated the actual transpiration and evaporation whereas the water balance model where the internal physical processes are not considered but the system as a whole is treated xu et al 2016 only estimated aet merging evaporation and transpiration because of high vegetation cover of maize starting from its vegetative stages soil evaporation was zero and aet was controlled by actual transpiration in the onion fields evaporation was high in early stages and reduced starting from vegetative stages but existed throughout the growing season though here the dominant process was also transpiration fig 5 the actual transpiration was high during most of the growth periods except in maize fields during the late stage in both crops due to high irrigation application in the early stages however irrigation was excess during most of the growth stages absence of water for irrigation in maize fields during maturity period resulted stress which was indicated by a rapid decrease of the actual transpiration during the period fig 5 the water balance modelling results table 7 showed that aet is the dominant process of the hydrological cycle 72 94 of irrigation this high aet was mostly close to the potential et because the crops were not stressed in most of the seasons except maize fields during maturity stage in this particular case where the crops were fully irrigated were not under stress the numerical model might not had much added value as the et values were nearly the same in both models 4 2 soil moisture and deep percolation the fluctuations in measured and predicted by hydrus model soil water content before and after irrigation events are higher at 30 cm depth than at 60 cm fig 4 this indicates a higher response to irrigation and evaporative demand as well as more root water uptake in the topsoil than in the subsoil soil moisture is generally high in onion fields than in maze fields due to high consumption of water by maize crops the cumulative deep percolation d predicted by the hydrus and the water balance models are generally comparable since in the water balance model a uniform root depth was considered for all plots depth to groundwater has no a recognized effect on the predicted d the hydrus model predicted higher d in fields with shallower groundwater than fields with higher groundwater depth for instance fields 2 and 3 have higher d than field 1 the deepest water table field in both schemes in both experimental sites and crops table 7 generally higher d was predicted by the simple water balance model table 7 due to smaller root zone consideration the resulted showed that d resulted in a significant loss of available surface water under the current irrigation management in the area of interest 12 41 of the applied water 4 3 irrigation water management the farmers in both irrigation schemes decide irrigating their fields based on weather conditions and access to water rather than on growth stage based crop water demand they apply the same amount of irrigation regardless of growth stages and crop types depending on access to water farmers apply more water in early crop stages even if the crop does not require irrigation believing that applying more water will increase the crop yield fig 4 and table 6 the farmers over irrigate onion fields than maize fields table 6 and annex a annex b annex c because they irrigate regardless of crop type overuse of water during early stages caused the water reservoir in shina to dry this overuse at the early stage led to shortage of irrigation water for maize fields during maturity stages maize was planted around 10th of december and harvested in the mid of may causing stress during the last weeks of the crop stage with the rapid decrease of actual transpiration in maize fields fig 5 furthermore this over irrigation during early stages might cause loss of water due to unproductive excessive transpiration in both crops the farmers irrigation scheme uses over irrigation during early growth stages table 6 and annex a annex b annex c it can be noted that the farmer s irrigation application might have been more if the reservoir in shina had not dried generally it could be possible to save the available water and irrigate maize fields to avoid stress during maturity by reducing early stage over irrigation the d from irrigation 12 41 of irrigation is the second important water balance component next to aet and the most important loss in the soil reservoir in the study area soil evaporation is minimum table 6 and drastically decreased during vegetative periods fig 5 hence the most important loss in the irrigation system is the d to the groundwater from the seasonal current irrigation consumption in the floodplains 3 10 mm3 y 1 of irrigation water is lost due to d and fed the groundwater previous studies of recharge from agricultural alluvial soils of arid climate also indicated that irrigation water is the most important source of groundwater recharge followed by rain water ebrahimi et al 2016 here irrigation management strategies that minimize d and conservation practices that reduce excessive unproductive transpiration are crucial to irrigate more fields with the present available surface water resources to meet the growing food and fibre demand obviously deep percolation from irrigation will feed the groundwater for future use for irrigation as well as for urban or rural domestic consumption coming to the irrigation consumption pumping the groundwater for irrigation purpose has higher operation cost than using available surface water sources if feasible for only some wealthy farmers to pump the groundwater that would mean un equal resource distribution hence for low income farming society like in the study area minimizing deep percolation will bring a better and cheaper access to water among beneficiary farmers 5 conclusion both the hydrus 1d and the water balance model provided reasonably good simulation results of actual evapotranspiration aet and deep percolation d from irrigated fields in tropical floodplain soils the seasonal values of d and aet simulated by the hydrus and the water balance models are comparable the study showed that aet and d are the dominant processes in the hydrological cycle in the study area the soil water balance simulation results of the hydrus model were mainly controlled by the soil hydraulic parameters irrigation depth local weather conditions and depth to the groundwater the saturated soil water content saturated hydraulic conductivity and pore size distribution parameter i e van genuchten s n were found to be the most important parameter inputs to hydrus model in the study area the water balance model can be used as an alternative for numerical models in data scarce areas as the cumulative results obtained by both models are comparable in general the d appeared to be a significant loss of applied irrigation water 12 41 in the floodplains farmers irrigation practice in which irrigation was applied regardless of crop type and growth stage must be scheduled according to the crop water demand annex a annex b annex c

11504,under localized irrigation even when applying non limiting amounts of water there could be transpiration t limitations due to a limited wetted soil volume to study under field conditions how drip irrigated almond trees responded to a change in wetted soil volume two treatments were established in summer 2012 in a drip irrigated almond orchard in cordoba spain one treatment large volume was initially irrigated with micro sprinklers ms to wet the entire ground surface and then reverted to drip irrigation while other was always kept under drip irrigation small volume continuous monitoring of t and measurements of soil moisture content tree water status and trunk growth were carried out even though trees in both treatments were supplied with sufficient water the ms application induced an increase in t and an improvement in water status in large volume relative to small volume a reduction in the hydraulic resistance of the tree was also detected in large volume as well as an enhancement in canopy conductance and tree growth we concluded that there are situations in the field where almond tree transpiration is limited by an insufficient wetted soil volume even when supplied with adequate water due to a high hydraulic resistance during times of high evaporative demand keywords wetted soil volume tree transpiration drip irrigation hydraulic resistance almond prunus dulcis mill 1 introduction localized irrigation has expanded substantially during the last decades following the introduction of drip irrigation in the early 1960 s goldberg et al 1976 at present there are more than 14 million ha of agricultural land under localized irrigation worldwide icid 2016 one primary difference between localized and full coverage irrigation is the partial wetting of the soil volume by the emitters while full coverage systems wet nearly 100 of soil surface in localized irrigation this percentage is significantly reduced the adoption of drip irrigation systems has been particularly successful in tree crops where the plants do not fully cover the ground and any system reducing the evaporation from soil will increase water use efficiency fereres and soriano 2007 passioura 1977 the quantity of water applied determines the soil water potential and thus how easily water can be extracted by the root system gardner 1960 the distribution in the soil of that quantity of water defines the surface of roots influenced by irrigation if the volume wetted by irrigation does not enclose a surface area of roots sufficient to meet plant water demand there will be a limitation of transpiration t no matter the amount of water applied the catenary hypothesis van den honert 1948 establishes that t is related to the difference between soil and leaf water potential and a set of resistances 1 t δ ψ r s o i l r p l a n t where rsoil is the resistance to the movement of water from the bulk soil towards the root rplant is the resistance of the plant that considers the movement of water from the root surface to the xylem vessels right before the substomatal cavities and δ ψ is the water potential gradient between the soil and the leaf variations in rsoil are inversely related to the root length density length of roots per volume of soil more roots density means a shorter pathway for water particles from their location to any root surface or the soil water content increasing when one or the two variables diminish let us assume that we provide with the same amount of water two identical trees with the same leaf area root length and anatomical features in one of the trees the entire volume occupied by the root system is wetted to field capacity by the irrigation system while in the other tree only half of this volume is wetted and the rest is dry the gradient in water potential of the wetted roots and the rplant will be the same in both trees the only difference is that in one tree only half of the root system will be withdrawing water therefore in that tree the overall rsoil will be necessarily higher if the root surface area of the wetted zone is not sufficient to meet the t demand consequently t in the half root volume wetted tree will be lower due to a greater total rsoil this simple analogy can explain why in localized irrigation t might be limited even though the amount of water applied exceeds the maximum crop demand the wetted soil volume limitations of localized irrigation were recognized early by the engineers that designed the first drip systems keller and karmeli 1974 who recommended wetting 30 50 of the ground in low rainfall areas for an appropriate development of the crop however due to the excellent results obtained with this irrigation method that concern has generally been ignored since that time currently it is common to find studies about plant responses to deficit irrigation treatments where it is uncertain whether the volume of soil wetted by emitters was large enough to avoid a t limitation in the crop even in the full irrigation treatment regardless of the amount of water applied garcía tejera et al 2017 tested the hypothesis of t limitation due to limited wetting volume under localized irrigation using a spac model that was able to capture horizontal heterogeneities in soil water content and root distribution present under such systems a simulation was performed in which the same amount of water was distributed to a larger surface area simulations results showed that in a well irrigated tree irrigation was applied to maintain the wet bulb at field capacity t increased as the wetted soil area was increased for the same volume of water applied garcía tejera et al 2017 under model assumptions the authors also demonstrated that the degree of t limitation depends on the evaporative demand and on the root length density relations inside and outside the wet bulb these results are in accordance with the hypothesis of t limitation by an hydraulic effect kramer 1988 kramer and boyer 1995 an alternative hypothesis argues that t is limited by stomata closure induced by chemical signals from roots exploring dry soil davies and zhang 1991 in the field the relation between the spatial distribution of water and crop t appeared in different crops the general approach to study this relationship has been to use and compare different irrigation systems such as micro sprinkler surface and subsurface drip systems with a changing number of emitters bielorai 1982 bryla et al 2003 2005 edstrom and schwankl 2002 gispert et al 2012 moreshet et al 1983 pastor et al 1997 porras et al 1988 schwankl et al 1999 however in those studies it is not clear whether the water applied was sufficient to meet the maximum crop water requirements then although the general conclusion was that growth and production is favoured by a large percentage of the surface wetted by irrigation it was not possible to clearly separate the effects of larger soil volumes wetted from higher amounts of water because larger wetted areas were always obtained by increasing the volume of water applied hutmacher et al 1994 for instance found a strong relationship between almond tree growth and amount of water applied under drip and attributed the increase in growth not only to the increased water volumes but also to the increased volume of soil wetted as the applied water volumes increased in a french prunes deficit irrigation experiment lampinen et al 2001 found that well drip irrigated trees showed a worse water status than the expected according to the relationship between vpd and stem water potential obtained by mccutchan and shackel 1992 for prunes they pointed out as a possible explanation that in their experiments the amount of wetted soil was limited whereas the relationship found by mccutchan and shackel 1992 was obtained from orchards where the entire soil surface was wetted the confusion between the effects on crop production of variable water amounts and of changing soil wetting patterns could also explain why in almond some studies conclude that applying more water than the estimated as full requirements promotes vegetative growth shackel et al 1998 torrecillas et al 1989 while girona et al 2005 applying 130 of estimated crop water requirements did not observe greater yields that when applying 100 note that girona et al 2005 used a micro sprinkler irrigation system and thus wetted a significant fraction of the soil surface regardless of the irrigation treatment while in the other experiments a drip irrigation system was used and presumable the volume of wetted soil increased with the irrigation level then t of low and even in high irrigation treatments could have been limited by small volume of soil wetted if the volume of wetted soil has an influence on tree response even when trees are supplied with adequate water the implications for the design and operation of drip and other microirrigation systems would be highly relevant in this study we attempted to a determine if the volume of wetted soil actually limits transpiration under drip irrigation in almond trees that were receiving adequate amounts of water and b describe the response of almond trees to a sudden change in wetted soil volume under field conditions 2 materials and methods the experiments were performed in the summer of 2012 on four year old almond trees prunus dulcis mill cv guara growing in the experimental orchard alameda del obispo of ifapa in córdoba spain tree spacing was 6 7 m average canopy volume was 31 m3 and approximately 34 of the ground was covered by the trees the climate is semi arid mediterranean average annual rainfall is 615 mm concentrated from autumn to spring and annual reference evapotranspiration eto is 1350 mm with 920 mm occurring from june to september the irrigation system was a single drip line per tree row with emitters spaced 1 m apart discharging 2 4 l h a total of six emitters per tree irrigation frequency was daily no rainfall occurred throughout the course of the experiment irrigation requirements were calculated using the crop coefficients recommended by allen et al 1998 and corrected by a reduction coefficient to adjust for incomplete cover relative to the etc of a mature crop fereres et al 2012 the kc used for the experimental period was 0 96 and the reduction coefficient kr t was 0 63 for a shaded area by trees of 34 a tree placed in a weighing lysimeter in the orchard lorite et al 2012 which had 20 emitters in the 9 m2 of the lysimeter surface provided actual consumptive use records which were used to adjust the calculated applied water the soil of sandy loam texture is deep of alluvial origin and is lighter below the 150 cm depth the upper and lower limits of soil water storage are 0 23 and 0 08 cm3 cm3 respectively the soil profile in 2012 was partially dry at the start of the irrigation season as the rainfall between 21 december and 1 april was 54 mm while eto was 215 mm as no irrigation to refill the soil profile was applied the soil water reservoir was partially depleted at the start of the experiments the experiment was carried out between 11 july and 10 august two different wetted soil volume situations were recreated in the field corresponding to the two treatments a control treatment large volume to represent a situation where the volume of soil wetted by irrigation is large and where it is not expected that transpiration would be limited this was done by the application of a micro sprinkler irrigation at the beginning of the measurement period to substantially increase the soil volume previously wetted by the drip system the micro sprinklers were run for 50 h spread over three days to apply 100 mm starting in july 12th applications were scheduled as follows july 12th 18 h july 13rd 16 h july 17th 16 h during the micro sprinkler irrigation there was no irrigation applications through the drip system from then on irrigation was applied via drip as in the small volume treatment and the rest of the orchard a treatment where irrigation is applied in a small volume of soil small volume this was the situation in the whole field irrigated by the drip system irrigation was applied daily to ensure that in the case that t was lower in the small volume than in the large volume treatment the differences were due to a smaller volume of soil wetted and not due to insufficient applied water a slight excess 5 in the calculated irrigation amount was applied daily if we consider as wetted patch that area of soil surface with soil moisture above 20 cm3 cm3 the percentage of soil wetted area by the drip system was 18 of tree spacing at the beginning of the experiment but this percentage increased due to the indicated excess in irrigation reaching 35 at the end of july in this treatment the volume of water applied was high enough to guarantee maximum crop water requirements as indicated by the etc calculations and the lysimeter measurements each replication consisted of three adjacent trees in which the middle one was used for measurements and the others served as experimental guard trees the number of replications was three in the case of large volume treatment and four in the case of small volume treatment during the experiment and after the micro sprinkler irrigation application to the large volume treatment the irrigation amounts in the two treatments were identical and applied by the drippers the irrigation was suspended from 9th of august in the whole orchard to avoid bark damage at harvest volumetric soil water content was measured every week with a neutron probe campbell pacific nuclear model 503 eight aluminium access tubes were installed on the central trees of one replication per treatment as shown in fig 1 the arrangement was two rows of four tubes which were installed perpendicular to the drip line one row in front of a dripper and the other between two drippers distances from drip line were 15 60 140 and 270 cm measurements of soil moisture were performed also in the central trees of one more replication in the large volume treatment and of two more replications in the small volume treatment in these cases two tubes per tree were installed one placed 40 cm apart from the drip line and between drippers and the other 160 cm apart from the drip line readings were taken weekly at 30 cm intervals down to the 150 cm depth except for the first two readings taken between 0 and 15 cm and 15 30 cm total soil water content down to the 150 cm depth was calculated for each tree as the weighted average by ascribing an area of influence for each of the eight or two tubes for the replications with eight access tubes contour graphs delimiting areas with the same moisture were developed using sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc transpiration was measured with a sap flow system device developed and assembled at the institute of sustainable agriculture in cordoba as described in testi and villalobos 2009 transpiration was determined in the central trees of the replications where soil moisture was monitored with neutron probes measurements the sap flow system uses the compensated heat pulse chp method green et al 2003 plus the calibrated average gradient cag technique testi and villalobos 2009 the latter is used when low sap velocities below than 12 cm h 1 prevent the use of the chp method or reduce its accuracy to measure sap flow velocity a set of probes and associated electronics connected to a logger are needed one set of probes consists of one linear heater and two probes with four temperature sensors to characterize the sap flow velocity profile at different depths from the cambium two set of probes per tree were installed at the appropriate depth in order to measure sap velocity at the 5 15 25 and 35 mm depths from the cambium the heat pulse velocity is calculated by measuring the time from the pulse needed for both temperature sensors to reach the same gradient they show before the pulse these values are then converted to sap velocity and are integrated first along the trunk radius using the radial velocity profile curve given by the probe and then around the azimuth angle green et al 2003 to convert them to t data were recorded every 15 min transpiration measurements in trees of the same orchard have been validated in several occasions using a weighing lysimeter as we reported in espadafor et al 2015 and by water balance as reported in lópez lópez et al 2018 canopy conductance gc was calculated from t data by inverting the penman monteith equation assuming a negligible aerodynamic resistance e g villalobos et al 2013 the stem water potential ψ was measured around midday using a scholander type pressure chamber model 3005f01 santa barbara ca usa shaded leaves near the tree trunk previously covered with foil during 30 min were excised and immediately placed in the chamber following the recommendations of hsiao 1990 the same ψ measurements were performed at pre dawn for assessing an estimate of the root soil water potential between three and four leaves per tree and time of measurement were measured in the central trees of all the replications twice during the experimental period once before and once after the micro sprinkler irrigation application the diurnal course of ψ was determined by measuring every 2 3 h from dawn to dusk in both treatments the resistance found by water in its way from soil to stems was calculated as 2 r s o i l s t e m δ ψ t where t is transpiration l h measured with sap flow δψ is the difference between soil and stem water potential mpa canopy volume was calculated at the beginning and at the end of the experiment by measuring horizontal and vertical radii and approximating its shape to that of an ellipsoid as a measure of tree growth trunk cross sectional tcsa area was calculated from trunk perimeter at 30 cm height was measured once a month from june to september these measurements were carried out in the central trees of all the replications the statistical treatment of the data anova and tukey hsd test and linear regression comparison were performed with the statistix program statistix 9 analytical software tallahassee fl usa 3 results 3 1 soil water content fig 2 shows the evolution of soil water content swc down to a depth of 150 cm for the central trees of the two replications with eight access tubes for neutron probe measurements the effect of the micro sprinkler irrigation ms can be observed in large volume treatment soil moisture measurements where swc increased a total of 85 mm going from 175 mm to 260 mm of stored soil water then after a slight decrease following the end of ms the swc in this treatment was maintained relatively constant until the irrigation was cut off in august in the case of small volume treatment swc was constant or even increased throughout the experimental period due to the slight excess 5 in applied water above the calculated water requirements fig 2 the rest of replications showed a similar behaviour than the ones showed in fig 2 fig 3 shows the soil moisture distribution under the central trees of the two replications with 8 access tubes for neutron probe measurements observations of the soil wetted areas in the two treatments just before the ms irrigation of large volume treatment indicated that their shapes were clearly defined by sharp changes in volumetric soil water content the wetting front depth extended to 90 and 120 cm under the dripper and the radius of the wet patch at the 30 cm depth was around 50 cm after the ms soil moisture at the 30 cm depth extended over the whole distance between trees in large volume treatment later soil moisture in the shallow depths decreased by evaporation while it increased in the lower depths as the water deepened in the soil profile little change occurred in the large volume central tree soil moisture from 17 july to 31 july but a decrease in the wetted area can be observed by 9 august in the case of small volume treatment the shape of wetted soil was clearly defined throughout the experiment the slight excess in irrigation increased the wetted volume of soil the moisture content above 0 15 cm3 cm3 at the 30 cm depth reached a distance from tree trunk of 80 cm from the drip line on 11 july and a distance of more than 125 cm on 31 july losses of water to zones of the soil profile below the root zone were likely to occur as the soil moisture in the last measured depth continued to increase with time 3 2 evolution of transpiration as daily transpiration t is related to daily reference eto the ratio between these two parameters termed the transpiration coefficient kt is used here to document the changes in t as affected by the ms application fig 4 depicts the average kt of large volume and small volume treatments throughout the experiment before the ms application the kt of both treatments was nearly identical with differences never exceeding 5 a slight increase of kt of large volume relative to small volume treatments began to be observed just 2 days after the start of the ms on 14 july the t of the two treatments continued to diverge as time went on and around 20 july the large volume kt was 15 higher than small volume kt from 18 july to 23 july the difference between treatments was constant around 12 then coinciding with a decrease in eto from 24 july the difference between the two treatments decreased once the eto increased again the difference in kt between treatments also increased reaching a maximum difference of 0 10 a relative difference of 22 on 9 august the average increase in kt in large volume after the ms application relative to that of small volume was 14 over a period of 25 days the detailed t responses to the ms application are presented in fig 5 at 15 min steps together with the time course of the ms irrigation the first part of the ms application 36 mm was completed on the morning of 13 july and a slight increase in the t of large volume treatment is observed fig 5 such an increase became more noticeable as the next 32 mm application took place on 13 and 14 july even though the application was discontinued until day 16 july t of large volume increased more every day relative to that of small volume treatment fig 5 probably because the wetting front advanced slowly in depth through unsaturated flow by the time the planned 100 mm ms application was completed there were substantial differences between the t of large volume and that of small volume treatment fig 5 such differences were most noticeable during the central hours of the day when evaporative demand was highest as time went on the t differences increased as shown in fig 5 even though both treatments were reverted to drip irrigation and received the same water amounts 3 3 tree water status the evolution of midday stem water potential ψ before and during the experimental period is shown in fig 6 periodic measurements taken from june until the ms application showed that the ψ values were almost identical in all the experimental trees the first statistically significant difference in ψ was detected on 16 july four days after ms application started fig 6 the ψ difference between treatments remained about the same throughout the experimental period being statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level the maximum ψ difference occurred during the first week following the ms application with ψ values in large volume 0 3 mpa higher than in small volume treatment a minimum difference between treatments of 0 1 mpa occurred on 1 august a cloudy day on average the ψ of large volume was about 0 2 mpa greater than that of small volume treatment after the ms application to assess the ψ differences at a daily scale two diurnal ψ cycles were performed fig 7 a and b show the diurnal course of ψ measured every two hours on one day before the ms application 11 july fig 7a and on the 20 july fig 7b the eto of those days was 7 2 and 8 3 mm respectively for the first date fig 7a the ψ was nearly identical for the two treatments throughout the day in fig 7a the ψ decreased during the morning from a maximum value of 0 4 mpa at pre dawn to a minimum value of 1 2 mpa that was reached approximately at noon and it was maintained until 1600 h after which the ψ recovered to 0 8 mpa at 1830 h for the second date fig 7b ψ differed between the two treatments at all measurement hours with large volume always exhibiting better water status differences ranged from 0 1 mpa in the morning to a maximum of 0 3 mpa at around 1230 h late in the afternoon ψ of both treatments recovered and showed similar values all the differences observed on this date were statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level 3 4 assessment of tree hydraulic resistance hydraulic resistance from the soil to the stems r soil stem of the trees was calculated from ψ measurements and the corresponding t values recorded by sap flow from the diurnal course of ψ of fig 7 the pattern of r soil stem could be derived and is shown in fig 8 the day before the ms irrigation fig 8a r soil stem did not differ between treatments the r soil stem was constant from 1000 h solar to the last measurement at 1800 h solar after the ms irrigation fig 8b the r soil stem of large volume and small volume treatments coincided during the early hours but from 1200 h onwards the two treatments clearly separated this day the whole plant resistance was more fluctuating it increased up to a maximum value at 1500 h and then diminished again at 1700 h to recover partially at 1700 h the difference between the soil water potential estimated as the predawn ψ and the stem water potential was plotted against the t rate fig 9 the slope of this relationship is the r soil stem cfr eq 2 measurements at different times of the day on four dates 20 july 27 july 1 august 8 august all of them after the application of the ms are shown the first measurement of each date was discarded because the small magnitude of t at that hour produced high calculation errors large volume exhibited less apparent hydraulic resistance than small volume as shown by the different slopes in fig 9 0 11 mpah l for large volume vs 0 15 mpah l for small volume the slopes of the regression lines for small volume and large volume were statistically different at the 0 05 level the results of fig 9 are confirmed by the midday r soil stem values depicted in fig 10 for the duration of the experiment for all measurement dates the r soil stem of large volume was less than that of small volume with a maximum difference of 0 004 mpah l which occurred on 20 july when the eto was the highest of all the measurement days on the other measurement days the differences between treatments were similar about 0 002 mpah l 3 5 tree growth and canopy conductance the bulk canopy conductance gc derived from t measurements and the inversion of the penman monteith equation exhibited significant differences between the two treatments as shown in fig 11 even though gc was similar for both treatments until 1000 h from that time until 2000 h large volume trees had greater gc than small volume treatment trees during most of daytime hours the gc curve presented in fig 11 is that of 20 july subsequent days showed the same pattern of difference between treatments data not presented a significant increase in trunk growth was detected as a result of the ms application fig 12 shows that while in june the growth of trunk perimeter was similar for large volume and small volume treatments after the ms application the growth of large volume treatment was greater than that of small volume 4 discussion in this work the response of field grown drip irrigated almond trees cv guara to a change in the volume of soil wetted by irrigation was investigated the hypothesis was that even when the amount of water is not a limiting factor the tree transpiration t may be limited if the rooting density in the small volume of soil wetted by irrigation is not sufficient we recreated two situations in the field where the only difference was the size of wetted soil volume one with wetted volume restricted to the area near and under the emitters small volume treatment and the other with all the soil wetted by an initial application of a micro sprinkler ms irrigation large volume treatment fig 3 previous research to identify the minimum soil wetted volume was carried out in the 1980 s in other species but no definitive results were reported bielorai 1982 moreshet et al 1983 porras et al 1988 there is an inherent difficulty in determining experimentally the tree responses to wetted soil volume given that an increase in wetted soil volume may lead to a higher level of available water and the plant would respond to that increase directly if its supply was previously limited thus it is difficult to separate the response to increased wetted soil volume from that to increased availability of water and this has impaired most attempts to study tree responses to wetted soil volume under field conditions e g gispert et al 2012 then as an essential point of our work we made sure that the amount of water provided to the crop was enough to cover its maximum water requirements or in other words that the amount of water was not a limiting factor in either treatment this fact is demonstrated by fig 2 where a slight increment in soil water content swc of the small volume treatment is observed throughout the experimental period and even more clearly the increase in size of the wetted bulb can be observed in the small volume treatment fig 3 and then leaving no room for doubt as to whether the limitation in t was due to a lack of water following the ms application the t and the stem water potential ψ of large volume increased relative to the values of small volume figs 4 5 6 and 7 which stayed more or less the same even though its soil water content slightly increased during the course of the experiment fig 2 the increase of t in large volume treatment was detected around 4 days from the start of ms irrigation fig 5 while the first measurements of ψ carried out 2 days after the end of the ms application already detected significant differences between treatments fig 7 to our knowledge this is the first time that continuous measurements of sap flow have been used to characterize the tree response in a field experiment where the volume of wet soil was suddenly changed as can be seen in fig 6 the negative effect of a small wetted soil volume decreases when the evaporative demand is lower this relation between the magnitude of the effect and the evaporative demand has been recently tested by simulation of olive trees t under different wetting patterns using a spac model garcía tejera et al 2017 at the diurnal scale fig 11 gc in the early morning was identical for both treatments but from 1000 h solar large volume showed higher gc values than small volume when the stem water potential also had separated between the two treatments the rsoil stem was higher in small volume than in large volume figs 8 9 and 10 suggesting that under the experimental conditions drip irrigation limited tree transpiration the hypothesis is that insufficient root density in the wetted zone produced an increment in plant resistance which lead to a reduction in t mediated by a lower stem water potential in the small volume which reduces the canopy conductance during the hours of high transpiration rates these results indicate that a hydraulic limitation is present nevertheless it cannot be discarded the hypothesis of a chemical signal from the roots in contact with dry soil that induces a stomatal closure and a subsequent decrease in t supported by many studies davies and zhang 1991 tardieu et al 2010 this limitation in t can lead to situations as the observed by andreu et al 1997 in which despite being irrigated below its needs the crop is not able to extract all the applied water and part is lost through percolation causing a decrease in water use efficiency the increase in t agrees with earlier reports in other tree species that suggested a positive response in terms of growth and production to increasing the wetted soil volume under some conditions moreshet et al 1983 pastor et al 1997 porras et al 1988 schwankl et al 1999 cell expansion is driven by turgor pressure taiz and zeiger 2002 therefore a situation that lead to a higher ψ should always be more favourable to tree growth the results from fig 12 support this idea as the relative trunk growth of the large volume treatment increased after the begging of the ms application the fact that the difference in t between the two treatments was not constant but continued increasing with time fig 4 could be explained by the different growth rate of the trees faster in large volume than in small volume the sudden increase of root surface provided with available water generated a relatively quick increase in both stem water potential stomatal conductance and transpiration figs 4 5 6 and 11 whereas the higher ψ induced an acceleration in growth rate which but more slowly further increase transpiration over time through new leaf area the trunk cross sectional area tcsa was well related to cumulative pruning weights by bryla et al 2003 indicating that it may be useful as an indicator of tree growth they found significant differences among tcsa of treatments receiving the same amount of water but under different irrigation systems in peaches in particular they concluded that for the first three years after plantation the highest productions were reached with the irrigation systems that wetted the largest surface areas in peaches similar results were found in almond by schwankl et al 1999 in conclusion an increase in the wetted soil volume of drip irrigated almond trees led to an increase in t and growth of young almond trees even though the drip irrigated trees were supplied with adequate water to avoid any water stress effect their water status improved after the increment of wetted soil volume suggesting that the small area wetted by the common use of a single drip irrigation line per tree line may be restricting the potential growth of the trees then the use of two drip irrigation lines per tree line or the use of other micro irrigation systems such as microsprinklers to wet a larger area should be considered this issue acquires greater importance in areas of arid or semi arid climates where the soil is usually dry during the irrigation season however the optimal strategy in each case must be studied considering the climate soil and crop as well as the availability of water for instance the fact that high evaporative demand enhances the root surface limitation in t may have an impact on designing the irrigation system at different locations allowing for example to adopt a design that wet a smaller percentage of soil surface in regions where evaporative demand is low this study was carried out in one specific soil type the determination of the minimum wetted volume of soil for maximum almond tree growth and t requires further research efforts in modelling and experimentation

11504,under localized irrigation even when applying non limiting amounts of water there could be transpiration t limitations due to a limited wetted soil volume to study under field conditions how drip irrigated almond trees responded to a change in wetted soil volume two treatments were established in summer 2012 in a drip irrigated almond orchard in cordoba spain one treatment large volume was initially irrigated with micro sprinklers ms to wet the entire ground surface and then reverted to drip irrigation while other was always kept under drip irrigation small volume continuous monitoring of t and measurements of soil moisture content tree water status and trunk growth were carried out even though trees in both treatments were supplied with sufficient water the ms application induced an increase in t and an improvement in water status in large volume relative to small volume a reduction in the hydraulic resistance of the tree was also detected in large volume as well as an enhancement in canopy conductance and tree growth we concluded that there are situations in the field where almond tree transpiration is limited by an insufficient wetted soil volume even when supplied with adequate water due to a high hydraulic resistance during times of high evaporative demand keywords wetted soil volume tree transpiration drip irrigation hydraulic resistance almond prunus dulcis mill 1 introduction localized irrigation has expanded substantially during the last decades following the introduction of drip irrigation in the early 1960 s goldberg et al 1976 at present there are more than 14 million ha of agricultural land under localized irrigation worldwide icid 2016 one primary difference between localized and full coverage irrigation is the partial wetting of the soil volume by the emitters while full coverage systems wet nearly 100 of soil surface in localized irrigation this percentage is significantly reduced the adoption of drip irrigation systems has been particularly successful in tree crops where the plants do not fully cover the ground and any system reducing the evaporation from soil will increase water use efficiency fereres and soriano 2007 passioura 1977 the quantity of water applied determines the soil water potential and thus how easily water can be extracted by the root system gardner 1960 the distribution in the soil of that quantity of water defines the surface of roots influenced by irrigation if the volume wetted by irrigation does not enclose a surface area of roots sufficient to meet plant water demand there will be a limitation of transpiration t no matter the amount of water applied the catenary hypothesis van den honert 1948 establishes that t is related to the difference between soil and leaf water potential and a set of resistances 1 t δ ψ r s o i l r p l a n t where rsoil is the resistance to the movement of water from the bulk soil towards the root rplant is the resistance of the plant that considers the movement of water from the root surface to the xylem vessels right before the substomatal cavities and δ ψ is the water potential gradient between the soil and the leaf variations in rsoil are inversely related to the root length density length of roots per volume of soil more roots density means a shorter pathway for water particles from their location to any root surface or the soil water content increasing when one or the two variables diminish let us assume that we provide with the same amount of water two identical trees with the same leaf area root length and anatomical features in one of the trees the entire volume occupied by the root system is wetted to field capacity by the irrigation system while in the other tree only half of this volume is wetted and the rest is dry the gradient in water potential of the wetted roots and the rplant will be the same in both trees the only difference is that in one tree only half of the root system will be withdrawing water therefore in that tree the overall rsoil will be necessarily higher if the root surface area of the wetted zone is not sufficient to meet the t demand consequently t in the half root volume wetted tree will be lower due to a greater total rsoil this simple analogy can explain why in localized irrigation t might be limited even though the amount of water applied exceeds the maximum crop demand the wetted soil volume limitations of localized irrigation were recognized early by the engineers that designed the first drip systems keller and karmeli 1974 who recommended wetting 30 50 of the ground in low rainfall areas for an appropriate development of the crop however due to the excellent results obtained with this irrigation method that concern has generally been ignored since that time currently it is common to find studies about plant responses to deficit irrigation treatments where it is uncertain whether the volume of soil wetted by emitters was large enough to avoid a t limitation in the crop even in the full irrigation treatment regardless of the amount of water applied garcía tejera et al 2017 tested the hypothesis of t limitation due to limited wetting volume under localized irrigation using a spac model that was able to capture horizontal heterogeneities in soil water content and root distribution present under such systems a simulation was performed in which the same amount of water was distributed to a larger surface area simulations results showed that in a well irrigated tree irrigation was applied to maintain the wet bulb at field capacity t increased as the wetted soil area was increased for the same volume of water applied garcía tejera et al 2017 under model assumptions the authors also demonstrated that the degree of t limitation depends on the evaporative demand and on the root length density relations inside and outside the wet bulb these results are in accordance with the hypothesis of t limitation by an hydraulic effect kramer 1988 kramer and boyer 1995 an alternative hypothesis argues that t is limited by stomata closure induced by chemical signals from roots exploring dry soil davies and zhang 1991 in the field the relation between the spatial distribution of water and crop t appeared in different crops the general approach to study this relationship has been to use and compare different irrigation systems such as micro sprinkler surface and subsurface drip systems with a changing number of emitters bielorai 1982 bryla et al 2003 2005 edstrom and schwankl 2002 gispert et al 2012 moreshet et al 1983 pastor et al 1997 porras et al 1988 schwankl et al 1999 however in those studies it is not clear whether the water applied was sufficient to meet the maximum crop water requirements then although the general conclusion was that growth and production is favoured by a large percentage of the surface wetted by irrigation it was not possible to clearly separate the effects of larger soil volumes wetted from higher amounts of water because larger wetted areas were always obtained by increasing the volume of water applied hutmacher et al 1994 for instance found a strong relationship between almond tree growth and amount of water applied under drip and attributed the increase in growth not only to the increased water volumes but also to the increased volume of soil wetted as the applied water volumes increased in a french prunes deficit irrigation experiment lampinen et al 2001 found that well drip irrigated trees showed a worse water status than the expected according to the relationship between vpd and stem water potential obtained by mccutchan and shackel 1992 for prunes they pointed out as a possible explanation that in their experiments the amount of wetted soil was limited whereas the relationship found by mccutchan and shackel 1992 was obtained from orchards where the entire soil surface was wetted the confusion between the effects on crop production of variable water amounts and of changing soil wetting patterns could also explain why in almond some studies conclude that applying more water than the estimated as full requirements promotes vegetative growth shackel et al 1998 torrecillas et al 1989 while girona et al 2005 applying 130 of estimated crop water requirements did not observe greater yields that when applying 100 note that girona et al 2005 used a micro sprinkler irrigation system and thus wetted a significant fraction of the soil surface regardless of the irrigation treatment while in the other experiments a drip irrigation system was used and presumable the volume of wetted soil increased with the irrigation level then t of low and even in high irrigation treatments could have been limited by small volume of soil wetted if the volume of wetted soil has an influence on tree response even when trees are supplied with adequate water the implications for the design and operation of drip and other microirrigation systems would be highly relevant in this study we attempted to a determine if the volume of wetted soil actually limits transpiration under drip irrigation in almond trees that were receiving adequate amounts of water and b describe the response of almond trees to a sudden change in wetted soil volume under field conditions 2 materials and methods the experiments were performed in the summer of 2012 on four year old almond trees prunus dulcis mill cv guara growing in the experimental orchard alameda del obispo of ifapa in córdoba spain tree spacing was 6 7 m average canopy volume was 31 m3 and approximately 34 of the ground was covered by the trees the climate is semi arid mediterranean average annual rainfall is 615 mm concentrated from autumn to spring and annual reference evapotranspiration eto is 1350 mm with 920 mm occurring from june to september the irrigation system was a single drip line per tree row with emitters spaced 1 m apart discharging 2 4 l h a total of six emitters per tree irrigation frequency was daily no rainfall occurred throughout the course of the experiment irrigation requirements were calculated using the crop coefficients recommended by allen et al 1998 and corrected by a reduction coefficient to adjust for incomplete cover relative to the etc of a mature crop fereres et al 2012 the kc used for the experimental period was 0 96 and the reduction coefficient kr t was 0 63 for a shaded area by trees of 34 a tree placed in a weighing lysimeter in the orchard lorite et al 2012 which had 20 emitters in the 9 m2 of the lysimeter surface provided actual consumptive use records which were used to adjust the calculated applied water the soil of sandy loam texture is deep of alluvial origin and is lighter below the 150 cm depth the upper and lower limits of soil water storage are 0 23 and 0 08 cm3 cm3 respectively the soil profile in 2012 was partially dry at the start of the irrigation season as the rainfall between 21 december and 1 april was 54 mm while eto was 215 mm as no irrigation to refill the soil profile was applied the soil water reservoir was partially depleted at the start of the experiments the experiment was carried out between 11 july and 10 august two different wetted soil volume situations were recreated in the field corresponding to the two treatments a control treatment large volume to represent a situation where the volume of soil wetted by irrigation is large and where it is not expected that transpiration would be limited this was done by the application of a micro sprinkler irrigation at the beginning of the measurement period to substantially increase the soil volume previously wetted by the drip system the micro sprinklers were run for 50 h spread over three days to apply 100 mm starting in july 12th applications were scheduled as follows july 12th 18 h july 13rd 16 h july 17th 16 h during the micro sprinkler irrigation there was no irrigation applications through the drip system from then on irrigation was applied via drip as in the small volume treatment and the rest of the orchard a treatment where irrigation is applied in a small volume of soil small volume this was the situation in the whole field irrigated by the drip system irrigation was applied daily to ensure that in the case that t was lower in the small volume than in the large volume treatment the differences were due to a smaller volume of soil wetted and not due to insufficient applied water a slight excess 5 in the calculated irrigation amount was applied daily if we consider as wetted patch that area of soil surface with soil moisture above 20 cm3 cm3 the percentage of soil wetted area by the drip system was 18 of tree spacing at the beginning of the experiment but this percentage increased due to the indicated excess in irrigation reaching 35 at the end of july in this treatment the volume of water applied was high enough to guarantee maximum crop water requirements as indicated by the etc calculations and the lysimeter measurements each replication consisted of three adjacent trees in which the middle one was used for measurements and the others served as experimental guard trees the number of replications was three in the case of large volume treatment and four in the case of small volume treatment during the experiment and after the micro sprinkler irrigation application to the large volume treatment the irrigation amounts in the two treatments were identical and applied by the drippers the irrigation was suspended from 9th of august in the whole orchard to avoid bark damage at harvest volumetric soil water content was measured every week with a neutron probe campbell pacific nuclear model 503 eight aluminium access tubes were installed on the central trees of one replication per treatment as shown in fig 1 the arrangement was two rows of four tubes which were installed perpendicular to the drip line one row in front of a dripper and the other between two drippers distances from drip line were 15 60 140 and 270 cm measurements of soil moisture were performed also in the central trees of one more replication in the large volume treatment and of two more replications in the small volume treatment in these cases two tubes per tree were installed one placed 40 cm apart from the drip line and between drippers and the other 160 cm apart from the drip line readings were taken weekly at 30 cm intervals down to the 150 cm depth except for the first two readings taken between 0 and 15 cm and 15 30 cm total soil water content down to the 150 cm depth was calculated for each tree as the weighted average by ascribing an area of influence for each of the eight or two tubes for the replications with eight access tubes contour graphs delimiting areas with the same moisture were developed using sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc transpiration was measured with a sap flow system device developed and assembled at the institute of sustainable agriculture in cordoba as described in testi and villalobos 2009 transpiration was determined in the central trees of the replications where soil moisture was monitored with neutron probes measurements the sap flow system uses the compensated heat pulse chp method green et al 2003 plus the calibrated average gradient cag technique testi and villalobos 2009 the latter is used when low sap velocities below than 12 cm h 1 prevent the use of the chp method or reduce its accuracy to measure sap flow velocity a set of probes and associated electronics connected to a logger are needed one set of probes consists of one linear heater and two probes with four temperature sensors to characterize the sap flow velocity profile at different depths from the cambium two set of probes per tree were installed at the appropriate depth in order to measure sap velocity at the 5 15 25 and 35 mm depths from the cambium the heat pulse velocity is calculated by measuring the time from the pulse needed for both temperature sensors to reach the same gradient they show before the pulse these values are then converted to sap velocity and are integrated first along the trunk radius using the radial velocity profile curve given by the probe and then around the azimuth angle green et al 2003 to convert them to t data were recorded every 15 min transpiration measurements in trees of the same orchard have been validated in several occasions using a weighing lysimeter as we reported in espadafor et al 2015 and by water balance as reported in lópez lópez et al 2018 canopy conductance gc was calculated from t data by inverting the penman monteith equation assuming a negligible aerodynamic resistance e g villalobos et al 2013 the stem water potential ψ was measured around midday using a scholander type pressure chamber model 3005f01 santa barbara ca usa shaded leaves near the tree trunk previously covered with foil during 30 min were excised and immediately placed in the chamber following the recommendations of hsiao 1990 the same ψ measurements were performed at pre dawn for assessing an estimate of the root soil water potential between three and four leaves per tree and time of measurement were measured in the central trees of all the replications twice during the experimental period once before and once after the micro sprinkler irrigation application the diurnal course of ψ was determined by measuring every 2 3 h from dawn to dusk in both treatments the resistance found by water in its way from soil to stems was calculated as 2 r s o i l s t e m δ ψ t where t is transpiration l h measured with sap flow δψ is the difference between soil and stem water potential mpa canopy volume was calculated at the beginning and at the end of the experiment by measuring horizontal and vertical radii and approximating its shape to that of an ellipsoid as a measure of tree growth trunk cross sectional tcsa area was calculated from trunk perimeter at 30 cm height was measured once a month from june to september these measurements were carried out in the central trees of all the replications the statistical treatment of the data anova and tukey hsd test and linear regression comparison were performed with the statistix program statistix 9 analytical software tallahassee fl usa 3 results 3 1 soil water content fig 2 shows the evolution of soil water content swc down to a depth of 150 cm for the central trees of the two replications with eight access tubes for neutron probe measurements the effect of the micro sprinkler irrigation ms can be observed in large volume treatment soil moisture measurements where swc increased a total of 85 mm going from 175 mm to 260 mm of stored soil water then after a slight decrease following the end of ms the swc in this treatment was maintained relatively constant until the irrigation was cut off in august in the case of small volume treatment swc was constant or even increased throughout the experimental period due to the slight excess 5 in applied water above the calculated water requirements fig 2 the rest of replications showed a similar behaviour than the ones showed in fig 2 fig 3 shows the soil moisture distribution under the central trees of the two replications with 8 access tubes for neutron probe measurements observations of the soil wetted areas in the two treatments just before the ms irrigation of large volume treatment indicated that their shapes were clearly defined by sharp changes in volumetric soil water content the wetting front depth extended to 90 and 120 cm under the dripper and the radius of the wet patch at the 30 cm depth was around 50 cm after the ms soil moisture at the 30 cm depth extended over the whole distance between trees in large volume treatment later soil moisture in the shallow depths decreased by evaporation while it increased in the lower depths as the water deepened in the soil profile little change occurred in the large volume central tree soil moisture from 17 july to 31 july but a decrease in the wetted area can be observed by 9 august in the case of small volume treatment the shape of wetted soil was clearly defined throughout the experiment the slight excess in irrigation increased the wetted volume of soil the moisture content above 0 15 cm3 cm3 at the 30 cm depth reached a distance from tree trunk of 80 cm from the drip line on 11 july and a distance of more than 125 cm on 31 july losses of water to zones of the soil profile below the root zone were likely to occur as the soil moisture in the last measured depth continued to increase with time 3 2 evolution of transpiration as daily transpiration t is related to daily reference eto the ratio between these two parameters termed the transpiration coefficient kt is used here to document the changes in t as affected by the ms application fig 4 depicts the average kt of large volume and small volume treatments throughout the experiment before the ms application the kt of both treatments was nearly identical with differences never exceeding 5 a slight increase of kt of large volume relative to small volume treatments began to be observed just 2 days after the start of the ms on 14 july the t of the two treatments continued to diverge as time went on and around 20 july the large volume kt was 15 higher than small volume kt from 18 july to 23 july the difference between treatments was constant around 12 then coinciding with a decrease in eto from 24 july the difference between the two treatments decreased once the eto increased again the difference in kt between treatments also increased reaching a maximum difference of 0 10 a relative difference of 22 on 9 august the average increase in kt in large volume after the ms application relative to that of small volume was 14 over a period of 25 days the detailed t responses to the ms application are presented in fig 5 at 15 min steps together with the time course of the ms irrigation the first part of the ms application 36 mm was completed on the morning of 13 july and a slight increase in the t of large volume treatment is observed fig 5 such an increase became more noticeable as the next 32 mm application took place on 13 and 14 july even though the application was discontinued until day 16 july t of large volume increased more every day relative to that of small volume treatment fig 5 probably because the wetting front advanced slowly in depth through unsaturated flow by the time the planned 100 mm ms application was completed there were substantial differences between the t of large volume and that of small volume treatment fig 5 such differences were most noticeable during the central hours of the day when evaporative demand was highest as time went on the t differences increased as shown in fig 5 even though both treatments were reverted to drip irrigation and received the same water amounts 3 3 tree water status the evolution of midday stem water potential ψ before and during the experimental period is shown in fig 6 periodic measurements taken from june until the ms application showed that the ψ values were almost identical in all the experimental trees the first statistically significant difference in ψ was detected on 16 july four days after ms application started fig 6 the ψ difference between treatments remained about the same throughout the experimental period being statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level the maximum ψ difference occurred during the first week following the ms application with ψ values in large volume 0 3 mpa higher than in small volume treatment a minimum difference between treatments of 0 1 mpa occurred on 1 august a cloudy day on average the ψ of large volume was about 0 2 mpa greater than that of small volume treatment after the ms application to assess the ψ differences at a daily scale two diurnal ψ cycles were performed fig 7 a and b show the diurnal course of ψ measured every two hours on one day before the ms application 11 july fig 7a and on the 20 july fig 7b the eto of those days was 7 2 and 8 3 mm respectively for the first date fig 7a the ψ was nearly identical for the two treatments throughout the day in fig 7a the ψ decreased during the morning from a maximum value of 0 4 mpa at pre dawn to a minimum value of 1 2 mpa that was reached approximately at noon and it was maintained until 1600 h after which the ψ recovered to 0 8 mpa at 1830 h for the second date fig 7b ψ differed between the two treatments at all measurement hours with large volume always exhibiting better water status differences ranged from 0 1 mpa in the morning to a maximum of 0 3 mpa at around 1230 h late in the afternoon ψ of both treatments recovered and showed similar values all the differences observed on this date were statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level 3 4 assessment of tree hydraulic resistance hydraulic resistance from the soil to the stems r soil stem of the trees was calculated from ψ measurements and the corresponding t values recorded by sap flow from the diurnal course of ψ of fig 7 the pattern of r soil stem could be derived and is shown in fig 8 the day before the ms irrigation fig 8a r soil stem did not differ between treatments the r soil stem was constant from 1000 h solar to the last measurement at 1800 h solar after the ms irrigation fig 8b the r soil stem of large volume and small volume treatments coincided during the early hours but from 1200 h onwards the two treatments clearly separated this day the whole plant resistance was more fluctuating it increased up to a maximum value at 1500 h and then diminished again at 1700 h to recover partially at 1700 h the difference between the soil water potential estimated as the predawn ψ and the stem water potential was plotted against the t rate fig 9 the slope of this relationship is the r soil stem cfr eq 2 measurements at different times of the day on four dates 20 july 27 july 1 august 8 august all of them after the application of the ms are shown the first measurement of each date was discarded because the small magnitude of t at that hour produced high calculation errors large volume exhibited less apparent hydraulic resistance than small volume as shown by the different slopes in fig 9 0 11 mpah l for large volume vs 0 15 mpah l for small volume the slopes of the regression lines for small volume and large volume were statistically different at the 0 05 level the results of fig 9 are confirmed by the midday r soil stem values depicted in fig 10 for the duration of the experiment for all measurement dates the r soil stem of large volume was less than that of small volume with a maximum difference of 0 004 mpah l which occurred on 20 july when the eto was the highest of all the measurement days on the other measurement days the differences between treatments were similar about 0 002 mpah l 3 5 tree growth and canopy conductance the bulk canopy conductance gc derived from t measurements and the inversion of the penman monteith equation exhibited significant differences between the two treatments as shown in fig 11 even though gc was similar for both treatments until 1000 h from that time until 2000 h large volume trees had greater gc than small volume treatment trees during most of daytime hours the gc curve presented in fig 11 is that of 20 july subsequent days showed the same pattern of difference between treatments data not presented a significant increase in trunk growth was detected as a result of the ms application fig 12 shows that while in june the growth of trunk perimeter was similar for large volume and small volume treatments after the ms application the growth of large volume treatment was greater than that of small volume 4 discussion in this work the response of field grown drip irrigated almond trees cv guara to a change in the volume of soil wetted by irrigation was investigated the hypothesis was that even when the amount of water is not a limiting factor the tree transpiration t may be limited if the rooting density in the small volume of soil wetted by irrigation is not sufficient we recreated two situations in the field where the only difference was the size of wetted soil volume one with wetted volume restricted to the area near and under the emitters small volume treatment and the other with all the soil wetted by an initial application of a micro sprinkler ms irrigation large volume treatment fig 3 previous research to identify the minimum soil wetted volume was carried out in the 1980 s in other species but no definitive results were reported bielorai 1982 moreshet et al 1983 porras et al 1988 there is an inherent difficulty in determining experimentally the tree responses to wetted soil volume given that an increase in wetted soil volume may lead to a higher level of available water and the plant would respond to that increase directly if its supply was previously limited thus it is difficult to separate the response to increased wetted soil volume from that to increased availability of water and this has impaired most attempts to study tree responses to wetted soil volume under field conditions e g gispert et al 2012 then as an essential point of our work we made sure that the amount of water provided to the crop was enough to cover its maximum water requirements or in other words that the amount of water was not a limiting factor in either treatment this fact is demonstrated by fig 2 where a slight increment in soil water content swc of the small volume treatment is observed throughout the experimental period and even more clearly the increase in size of the wetted bulb can be observed in the small volume treatment fig 3 and then leaving no room for doubt as to whether the limitation in t was due to a lack of water following the ms application the t and the stem water potential ψ of large volume increased relative to the values of small volume figs 4 5 6 and 7 which stayed more or less the same even though its soil water content slightly increased during the course of the experiment fig 2 the increase of t in large volume treatment was detected around 4 days from the start of ms irrigation fig 5 while the first measurements of ψ carried out 2 days after the end of the ms application already detected significant differences between treatments fig 7 to our knowledge this is the first time that continuous measurements of sap flow have been used to characterize the tree response in a field experiment where the volume of wet soil was suddenly changed as can be seen in fig 6 the negative effect of a small wetted soil volume decreases when the evaporative demand is lower this relation between the magnitude of the effect and the evaporative demand has been recently tested by simulation of olive trees t under different wetting patterns using a spac model garcía tejera et al 2017 at the diurnal scale fig 11 gc in the early morning was identical for both treatments but from 1000 h solar large volume showed higher gc values than small volume when the stem water potential also had separated between the two treatments the rsoil stem was higher in small volume than in large volume figs 8 9 and 10 suggesting that under the experimental conditions drip irrigation limited tree transpiration the hypothesis is that insufficient root density in the wetted zone produced an increment in plant resistance which lead to a reduction in t mediated by a lower stem water potential in the small volume which reduces the canopy conductance during the hours of high transpiration rates these results indicate that a hydraulic limitation is present nevertheless it cannot be discarded the hypothesis of a chemical signal from the roots in contact with dry soil that induces a stomatal closure and a subsequent decrease in t supported by many studies davies and zhang 1991 tardieu et al 2010 this limitation in t can lead to situations as the observed by andreu et al 1997 in which despite being irrigated below its needs the crop is not able to extract all the applied water and part is lost through percolation causing a decrease in water use efficiency the increase in t agrees with earlier reports in other tree species that suggested a positive response in terms of growth and production to increasing the wetted soil volume under some conditions moreshet et al 1983 pastor et al 1997 porras et al 1988 schwankl et al 1999 cell expansion is driven by turgor pressure taiz and zeiger 2002 therefore a situation that lead to a higher ψ should always be more favourable to tree growth the results from fig 12 support this idea as the relative trunk growth of the large volume treatment increased after the begging of the ms application the fact that the difference in t between the two treatments was not constant but continued increasing with time fig 4 could be explained by the different growth rate of the trees faster in large volume than in small volume the sudden increase of root surface provided with available water generated a relatively quick increase in both stem water potential stomatal conductance and transpiration figs 4 5 6 and 11 whereas the higher ψ induced an acceleration in growth rate which but more slowly further increase transpiration over time through new leaf area the trunk cross sectional area tcsa was well related to cumulative pruning weights by bryla et al 2003 indicating that it may be useful as an indicator of tree growth they found significant differences among tcsa of treatments receiving the same amount of water but under different irrigation systems in peaches in particular they concluded that for the first three years after plantation the highest productions were reached with the irrigation systems that wetted the largest surface areas in peaches similar results were found in almond by schwankl et al 1999 in conclusion an increase in the wetted soil volume of drip irrigated almond trees led to an increase in t and growth of young almond trees even though the drip irrigated trees were supplied with adequate water to avoid any water stress effect their water status improved after the increment of wetted soil volume suggesting that the small area wetted by the common use of a single drip irrigation line per tree line may be restricting the potential growth of the trees then the use of two drip irrigation lines per tree line or the use of other micro irrigation systems such as microsprinklers to wet a larger area should be considered this issue acquires greater importance in areas of arid or semi arid climates where the soil is usually dry during the irrigation season however the optimal strategy in each case must be studied considering the climate soil and crop as well as the availability of water for instance the fact that high evaporative demand enhances the root surface limitation in t may have an impact on designing the irrigation system at different locations allowing for example to adopt a design that wet a smaller percentage of soil surface in regions where evaporative demand is low this study was carried out in one specific soil type the determination of the minimum wetted volume of soil for maximum almond tree growth and t requires further research efforts in modelling and experimentation
