24445,natural resources of semi arid rangelands in the sub tropics are major pillars of food security and livelihoods to millions of people besides increasing pressure due to human population growth high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation leading to highly erratic production of primary biomass has high potential to render the exploitation of ephemeral concentrations of these resources unsustainable while future climate models predict a general decrease in precipitation for many semi arid rangelands the increase in variability of rainfall and its dynamics are important aspects in assessments of climate change impact that only recently gained scientific attention building on a spatially explicit agent based model of free ranging livestock herds in semi arid rangelands ramdry that accounts for the metabolic energy budget of foraging animals we assessed the vulnerability of rangelands and livestock production systems as a result of the effects of ongoing changes in precipitation and its variation as well as its temporal distribution based on a coupled reservoir model conceptually relying on a two stage cascaded linear reservoir we developed implemented and validated a refined forage production module in ramdry to predict primary productivity of semi arid grassland and its impacts on livestock production from daily rainfall our results show a highly significant effect of increased temporal diffusion of precipitation events on the ecosystem and its productivity the anticipated diminution in total precipitation and increased inter annual variation indicated no severe aggravation of the general situation for livestock keepers in terms of system productivity however alterations in timing of individual precipitation events resulted in substantial temporal reduction of forage resources in terms of their quantity and quality and major negative impact on livestock body weights our findings shed light on the profound consequences of inter seasonal dry spells as one important aspect of climatic changes on livestock production systems in sub tropical semi arid rangelands keywords agent based model livestock production inter seasonal dry spell coupled reservoir model software and data availability the agent based model has been implemented in the software netlogo version 6 0 2 which is freely available

introduction rangelands in semi arid tropical and subtropical environment provide natural resources of high importance to the local communities globally millions of livestock keeping households depend on the ecosystem services of rangelands ilri et al 2021 which as such directly or indirectly contribute to food security and livelihoods of many people often living in marginally productive environments given the dry climates prevailing in these areas production of primary biomass is highly erratic steinfeld et al 2006 mainly as a result of high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation mobile forms of livestock production have proved most adapted to the exploitation of ephemeral concentrations of natural resources under those conditions particularly in countries of sub saharan africa kraetli et al 2013 here pasture vegetation and crop residues constitute the main feed resource for ruminant livestock lazzarini et al 2009 still due to the very dynamic climatic conditions in these areas pastures provide feed of highly variable amount and quality both highly depending on rainfall and air temperature traditionally livestock keepers reacted to the temporal changes in feed availability with strategic mobility kraetli et al 2013 leading their herds to the best available pastures throughout the year behnke et al 2011 increase in human population combined with restricted access to shrinking rangelands as a result of lack of land ownership or clearly defined use rights however more and more constrains free herd movements and as such threatens the sustainable utilization of these natural resources hobbs et al 2008 turner and schlecht 2019 to minimize the risk of local over exploitation and environmental degradation and to increase efficiency of herd and rangeland management a sound understanding of the dynamics of ecological processes governing biomass production and utilization in semi arid rangelands is needed fust and schlecht 2018 in view of the strong reliance of mobile as well as sedentary livestock production on rainfall in these drylands the predictions of future changes of climate and their consequences are particularly alarming making traditional agro pastoralists one of the globally most vulnerable group to climate change dong et al 2011 herrero et al 2016 future climate models largely agree upon a general decrease in precipitation amounts in tropical and subtropical land regions ipcc 2014 whilst at the same time the variability of weather and frequency of extreme events is supposed to increase dunning et al 2018 and has even been directly observed mpandeli et al 2019 beside seasonal amount of rainfall and its variability the dynamics of these changes need careful consideration timing and temporal distribution of rainfall had long been neglected in studies and only recently gained more attention pohl et al 2017 ayanlade et al 2018 martinez valderrama et al 2021 roffe et al 2021 although their impact on changes in the length of dry spells pascale et al 2016 and on gross primary production guo et al 2015 had been demonstrated the potential impacts of climate change on livestock production in the arid and semi arid tropics and subtropics are thereby manifold directly as well as indirectly rivera ferre et al 2016 increasing air temperatures are assumed to lead to elevated heat load for animals resulting in lower performance and reproduction thornton et al 2007 assan 2014 desalegn 2016 the most evident effects on livestock productivity however are predicted to be mediated through indirect effects such as changes in water and feed resources changes in precipitation might alter the availability of drinking water for animals restricting as such and in combination with increased air temperature the usability of foraging resources in regions far off water points yet the availability of forage resources for livestock will be affected most significantly by climatic changes through a multitude of pathways thornton et al 2007 thornton et al 2009a rust and rust 2013 namely by i a reduction in primary productivity of the rangelands and rainfed agriculture herrero et al 2016 as a result of the reduced growth ii the intensified use of rangelands due to climate induced land use changes such as conversion from mixed crop livestock to rangeland based systems in consequence of higher resilience of livestock against dry spells and increasing probability of complete crop failure jones and thornton 2009 iii a change in plant species composition in rangelands through altered co2 and temperature levels e g towards an increased proportion of shrub bush encroachment which will result in loss of pasturable areas in particular for grazers stevens et al 2016 and iv reduced forage quality by increased lignification and shift from c4 grasses to mono and dicotyledonous c3 plants leading to reduced nutrient availability for livestock while many agricultural studies have assessed the impact of climatic change on global continental and regional scale e g herrero et al 2016 large local variation in climate and the high level of spatial heterogeneity of environmental parameters that affect plant growth in semi arid rangelands ask for much higher resolution assessment thornton et al 2009a fine scale modeling of the resulting spatial distribution of resources allows the consideration of animal movements and their energetic costs as important factors in grazing efficiency and therefore also livestock productivity wallis de fries 1996 dijkman and lawrence 1997 the integration of the intra annual dynamics in quality of the forage is crucial for the analysis of the performance of livestock production systems in tropical and subtropical semi arid environment fust and schlecht 2018 as it has proved to be a major limiting factor in such systems assan 2014 currently most forage assessments are based on aboveground net primary production anpp green matter despite the importance of availability and digestibility of dry forage as key resource during significant periods of the dry season fern√°ndez rivera et al 2005 briske et al 2020 nutritional quality of available forage resources and thereby grazer performance are influenced by a variety of factors such as herbage species composition and trait functional composition which in turn are a result of soil properties nutrient availability grazing intensity and other management practices many of these factors are significantly affected by climatic variables such as precipitation air temperature and wind fay et al 2003 craine et al 2012 underlining also from this angle the need for a sound understanding of the environmental impacts of climate on livestock production in semi arid regions while multiple experiments and field based observational studies have investigated the role of climate change on botanical composition and anpp of rangelands its indirect effect on grazing animals and particularly the influence of climatic variability has rarely been studied explicitly craine 2013 several studies dealing with climate change effects on grassland biomass production have found that consideration of summarizing yearly or seasonal values for climatic variables was insufficient since their variability and timing could considerably affect productivity of grazing resources e g sloat et al 2018 felton et al 2020 griffin nolan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and livestock as such nevertheless investigations on how the temporal distribution of precipitation events might affect grazers are sparse tietjen and jeltsch 2007 craine et al 2012 although several researchers reported only a weak link between precipitation amount and rangeland productivity in a study on semi arid rangeland in west africa soil moisture as an important driver for plant growth has exposed only a poor correlation with cumulative rainfall rockstr√∂m and de rouw 1997 in other experiments on semi arid grassland inter annual variability in anpp was only marginally 30 40 explained by annual precipitation amounts heisler white et al 2008 a recent study on mesic habitats found a lack of correlation between herbaceous anpp and mean annual rainfall indicating that the temporal variation in rainfall can have instead a much higher potential effect golodets et al 2013 in turn dynamic change in grass cover has even been found to help maximizing water use of whole savanna ecosystems by buffering effects of precipitation variability scanlon et al 2005 the importance of temporal distribution of rainfall in terms of pulses and interpulse periods of anpp in arid and semi arid environment has been acknowledged by several studies e g xiong et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 gong et al 2020 liu et al 2020 liang et al 2021 recognizing thereby that lower seasonal productivity was not necessarily caused by reduced rainfall amount but by changes in rainfall distribution the effect of rainfall distribution on the dynamics of soil water content particularly in the shallow soil layers which is most important for many herbaceous plant species particularly c3 has been highlighted as major reason for the change in the seasonal productivity of rangelands fay et al 2002 liang et al 2021 alterations in rainfall distribution most prominently affect grassland dominated savannas while effects on woodland are smaller guan et al 2014 changes in seasonal rainfall distribution have the potential to result in increased frequency and duration of mid season dry spells and interruptions of vegetation growth giving rise to decreased primary productivity of rangelands depending on the timing of the growth interruption as observed already in southern africa zhang et al 2018 and increasing as such the risk for grazer based livestock production systems furthermore leaf physiological activity has been identified as being responsive to rainfall distribution fay et al 2003 the significant effect of precipitation distribution throughout the growing season has also been recognized for crop production as ellis and galvin 1994 showed in a comparison of two sites in west and east africa that received similar amounts of rainfall during the growth season a badly distributed rainfall of 700 mm per year might still be insufficient to sustain crop production while recent vegetation models are getting capable to capture rainfall variability in increasingly high temporal resolution e g adgvm2 scheiter et al 2013 most existing rangeland models that assess the effects of climate change on productivity of livestock in semi arid regions still rely on continuous growth periods and are as such often at best based only on length of growing period lgp and its inter annual variability e g kuckertz et al 2011 herrero et al 2016 descheemaeker et al 2018 guerrin 2020 but see guo et al 2015 the potentially negative impact of the combination of these predicted climate change phenomena is expected to heighten the vulnerability of livestock production systems particularly in african countries e g assan 2014 porter et al 2014 which underpins the regional importance of this topic despite this recognized significance the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc identified a lack of studies on the impact of climate change on livestock systems in comparison to crop production and linked this deficiency to the system complexity as a result of the multiple drivers involved porter et al 2014 this complexity of ecological processes in rangelands and the resulting difficulty in predicting impacts of future climate changes on livestock nutrition and productivity in developing countries has been recognized in several studies thornton et al 2009a assan 2014 a lately proposed integrative framework for dealing with the complex multi functionality of savannah landscapes underlines the potential of a combination of multiple dynamic model types roetter et al 2021 including rule based modeling approaches agent based modeling abm techniques are well suited to predict effects of environmental dynamics on complex ecological systems including the temporal dynamics and high spatial heterogeneity of forage resource availability as found in semi arid rangelands fust and schlecht 2018 abms thereby support the study of dynamic adaptive relations between entities and furthermore allow the integration of stochastic events such as climatic influences in a spatially explicit context grimm and railsback 2005 grimm et al 2005 we therefore investigate in this paper the potential of abms for assessing ecological effects of precipitation related parameters on semi arid rangelands and associated extensive agro pastoral livestock production systems incorporating dynamic forage quality and a spatially heterogeneous forage distribution to that end we took advantage of the potential of the spatially explicit agent based savanna rangeland model ramdry fust and schlecht 2018 which we extended and adapted accordingly for the specific purpose of this study ramdry aims in its original form at assessing the potential of adaptive livestock production in a highly dynamic heterogeneous semi arid rangeland system integrating thereby the foraging movements and feeding metabolism of domesticated animals based on data from the mahafaly plateau a region in southwestern madagascar we extended ramdry to assess the local effects of future changes in precipitation and its variation as well as its temporal distribution on free ranging zebu cattle bos indicus based livestock production in an african rangeland to account for the necessary fine temporal resolution of the analysis the original climate sub module of ramdry has been modified and re validated using the updated model we aimed in particular at analyzing the impact of the application of sequences of individual daily rain events on rangeland livestock systems effects of daily precipitation and the consequent intermissions of the vegetation growth season on the modeled systems were then compared with the outcomes from continuous seasonal growth periods based on monthly precipitation sums we thereby hypothesized that i the predicted reduction in precipitation amount and higher temporal variation in precipitation result in a general reduction of livestock productivity ii interrupted growth seasons due to prolonged mid seasonal dry spells lead to significant reduction in available green and dry forage biomass and thereby also in livestock productivity finally based on the model findings we assessed the predictability of effects of altered rainfall distribution on anpp of semi arid rangelands and free ranging livestock production systems and the model s suitability as a climate based rangeland and grazing management tool to foster food security of livestock keepers in marginal semi arid environments in the tropics and subtropics 2 materials and methods 2 1 agent based rangeland model ramdry the agent based model ramdry represents a spatially explicit rangeland model simulating the dynamics of pasture vegetation and its utilization by domestic herbivores within a highly heterogeneous semi arid environment a detailed description of the general processes simulated in ramdry can be found in fust and schlecht 2018 the model integrates detailed metabolic processes of domesticated ruminants focusing on energy costs and gains as a result of herd movements in search and by the digestion of forage resources furthermore it specifically incorporates seasonal dynamics in both forage quantity and quality in terms of feed digestibility and availability and relates these factors to climatic conditions as such ramdry allows studying the consequences of spatio temporal variability in resource availability and quality as a result of climatic dynamics on rangeland utilization it simulates the growth or maturation of grass biomass in daily steps over several years in an area composed of a grid of 111 111 square cells as a response to seasonal growth conditions based on predicted precipitation mobile agents representing foraging herds of zebu cattle are simulated to roam through this area gain energy by feeding on the available resource and loose metabolic energy for maintaining metabolic functions and movements thereby they respond to the changing rangeland condition by losing or gaining body weight and by an according reproduction rate resulting in an incessant adjustment of the livestock system productivity 2 2 study area the region from which data has been used for the study is located in the southwestern corner of madagascar this region is characterized by semi arid steppe climate with an annual mean temperature of 24 c 500 mm of annual precipitation and a dry season usually lasting from march to october the area of the simulation includes the surrounding 100 km2 10 km x 10 km of the mahafaly village miarantsoa gps 23 837 s 44 106 e

scenarios of the ipcc and downscaled by the weather simulator marksim jones and thornton 2000 jones and thornton 2013 for the study area has been downloaded from the online marksim dssat weather file generator http gisweb ciat cgiar org marksimgcm for the model analysis ten replicates of data sets for the geographical center point of the model area 23 823566 s 44 102424 e for the period 2010 2035 have been generated using the average of polynomial functions of 17 currently available gcms supplementary tab s1 and applying the scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 the marksim dssat data sets have subsequently been processed and consolidated per scenario and replication into individual csv comma separated values files for each rcp scenario by the software package r version 3 2 0 r core team 2015 for later analysis and import in the agent based model the selection of the replicates for the individual years was performed randomly the final data sets of climate variables included daily values of minimum air temperature maximum air temperature and precipitation amount climatic data for model calibration has been collected by an automatic data logging weather station in the study area between 18th august 2012 and 31st october 2015 hanisch et al 2015 the recorded fine resolution rain amounts have been totaled up to daily sums for subsequent analysis 2 4 climate module the initial climate evaluation model within ramdry calculated start and end of the growing season based on fortnightly sums of rainfall despite its good correlation with recorded weather data for the region fust and schlecht 2018 the model was poorly adapted to assess effects of rainfall intensity and mid seasonal dry spells could not be reliably identified and handled as a result of its averaging summing algorithm a review of the available climate evaluation models for semi arid rangeland and grazing management revealed that fine scale links between climatic variables and primary productivity often require profound knowledge about the hydrological processes and soil properties to reliably predict growth affecting parameters such as soil moisture e g coughenour 1994 jouven et al 2006 richardson and hahn 2007 johnson 2008 graux et al 2011 however a few more conceptual modeling approaches have been developed and used to directly investigate plant response to rainfall events based on the pulse reserve hypothesis noy meir 1973 or the threshold delay model ogle and reynolds 2004 these concepts allow the prediction of plant growth in water limited ecosystems as a result of rainfall pulses without need for detailed information about the soil and hydrological pathways li et al 2013 due to the lack of information on soil for our study area we adapted an elementary phenomenological model that had been developed to predict productivity of semi arid grassland from daily rainfall hermance et al 2015 this simple four parameter coupled reservoir model relies conceptually on a two stage cascaded linear reservoir i e the sequential flow through two leaky buckets fig 2 the two stages thereby simulate a the pulse like entry of rain water into the soil and its distribution as soil moisture and b the uptake of water by plant roots and short term biomass development in compliance with the threshold delay model of ogle and reynolds 2004 we assessed on a daily basis the output of the coupled reservoir model in terms of minimum thresholds that would stimulate a plant growth response in contrast to the original coupled reservoir model we defined parameter values for the time constants of the two stages individually allowing thereby independently adjustable time delays in the response for the soil t1 for 1st stage and the plant related t2 for 2nd stage section equations i and ii show the resulting definitions of the outflows from the first and second stages respectively i q 1 out t Œ¥ v t 1 e t t 1 where Œ¥v is the impulse input and t1 the time delay of stage 1 ii q 2 out t c 1 t q 1 out t x t 2 e t x t 2 dx where c is a scale factor and t2 the time delay of stage 2 to consider effects of intra seasonal gradients e g temperature on growth we furthermore applied time dependency on these parameters as suggested by the refined coupled reservoir model of hermance et al 2015 table 1 shows the full list of parameters of the model while the detailed mathematical description of the model is found in the appendix a1 2 5 parametrization to find the best fitting values of the parameters describing the refined coupled reservoir model we utilized the collected precipitation data of the weather station and compared the simulated output of the coupled reservoir model in terms of growth period timing length and interruptions with time series of estimated productivity of primary vegetation derived from satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to ensure a temporal high resolution assessment of the timing of growth relevant precipitation events a combination of satellite data with different temporal and spatial resolutions has been utilized daily mod09gq 8 day composites mod09q1 and 16 day composites mod13q1 of data sets of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis instrument were downloaded from the archives of the u s geological survey usgs https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov molt for the location of an ungrazed reference plot in the study area gps coordinates 23 852 s 44 124 e and in case of the surface reflectance products processed to ndvi time series onset and cessation of vegetation growth between october 2012 and june 2015 were identified visually from these time series fig 3 table 2 using 1000 randomly created sets of model parameters the best fitting parameter combination was evaluated by calculating the minimal sum of differences between the vegetation growth dynamics derived from ndvi and calculated by the coupled reservoir model the best fitting combination of parameters table 3 resulted in a summed up deviation of 35 days from the ndvi based dynamics for the assessed period of three growth periods fig 4 2 6 data set selection all ipcc marksim data sets were assessed in terms of yearly total precipitation and its variation for the three growth seasons between 2012 and 2015 table 4 the differences between the individual scenarios were minor leading to yearly precipitation sums of 516 559 mm and cvs coefficients of variance between 24 and 40 as suspected comparison with weather station data for the period 2012 2015 revealed a then higher average yearly rainfall amount of 567 mm and a lower variation of 22 for further analysis the modeled data set which corresponded best to the average of all the rcp scenarios was selected therefore all further simulations were conducted using the data set of the first replicate n 1 of rcp 6 0 that is characterized by an average yearly precipitation of 529 mm and a variation of 22 2 7 ramdry modifications the original model ramdry fust and schlecht 2018 has been modified to integrate the new refined climate module and its effects prediction on vegetation growth or maturation is made on a day by day basis instead of the pre analysis of the start and duration of the subsequent continuous growth period at the end of each growth season on top of the obvious adaptations in the model process climate and season see fig 3 and section 2 3 in fust and schlecht 2018 we furthermore adjusted the original model s dynamics of forage digestibility this adjustment was made to account for effects of possible multiple growth interruptions per season on the quality of forage resources in terms of biomass digestibility as in the original version of ramdry the digestibilities of fresh forage resources had been reset to maximum values at each beginning of a rain period the new version of the model calculates daily an averaged digestibility of forage biomass for each spatial cell based on the current amount and respective digestibility of the already existent and the potentially new re grown green biomass according to equation iii iii digestibilit y new biomas s old digestibilit y old biomas s freshly grown digestibilit y max biomas s old biomas s freshly grown as the green biomass at the end of the dry season i e the first term in equation 3 is supposed to equal zero the resulting digestibility of green biomass at the beginning of the rainy season is maximal in correspondence with the original version of the model the explanation of all changes applied to the original model is found in appendix a2 while appendix a3 shows the updated model code as implemented in netlogo version 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 2 8 model analysis and statistics based on the measured climate data set 1 from weather station and the rcp data set data set 2 we first assessed the effect of reduced precipitation and its higher variation on the livestock production system applying a scenario of continuous growth periods to this end the grazing intensity related breakdowns of the modeled system due to the over exploitation of foraging resources described by its tipping points were calculated for both input data sets following the principle described by fust and schlecht 2018 in multiple simulation runs with varying initial values for herd sizes i e the number of cattle in one herd and herd numbers total number of cattle herds in the model area all of same size initially the influence of foraging intensity on long term system productivity has been assessed by comparing the initial sum of weights of all animals to the weight sum at the end of the simulation to exclude here the potential influence of the temporal distribution of rain and possible mid seasonal dry spells the total annual numbers of growth days have been calculated and translated into continuous growth periods due to the restricted availability of actual weather data simulations based on real data were run for the time period between 2012 and 2015 while model analysis based on predicted precipitation data covered the period between 2012 and 2023 thereby and during all further analyses that focused on impacts of climate changes on the herd productivity the number of animals per herd was limited to an initial herd size of maximum 75 animals in order to minimize the potential influence of excessive grazing pressure over the study period as a result of reproduction caused herd size growth age structure and sex ratio in the herd has been kept constant throughout the simulation runs and the initial body weight of an adult female animal was set at 210 kg based on output of the updated climate module and the chosen rcp climate data set total yearly sums of growth days were analyzed regarding their direct correlation with total yearly precipitation thereby applying linear correlation models to test the effects of intra seasonal interruptions of growth periods for the rcp climate data set as compared to results based on continuous growth period approaches system responses were assessed in a stepwise manner starting with the impact on growth periods and biomass built up of herbaceous vegetation followed by a closer analysis of the link to livestock production all reflections concerning plant biomass are based on dry matter in order to permit direct comparison between forage biomass and necromass first the temporal availability of forage biomass and of necromass for both cases were contrasted to include the two aspects namely temporal biomass availability and the respective amount in further analysis annual time integrals of forage biomass from the start of the growth season until the end of the following dry season were calculated as proxy for feed resource availability statistical comparison between the two growth scenarios were thereby based on paired t tests in order to assess the predictability of primary production based on precipitation data the yearly integrals of biomass were analyzed for correlation with the number of growth days using a linear regression approach the additional impact of intra seasonal dry spells on the quality of the available forage resources has furthermore been assessed by multiplying the adjusted digestibilities with the according green biomass and integrating the sum of those products over the same annual period secondly the dynamics of the sum of body weights of all animals in the system were compared between the two growth cases to reduce the risk of effects of over utilization in this analysis simulations were run at low grazing intensity based on 375 animals i e 5 herds of 75 animals each because of the stochastic nature of processes involved in the modeled grazing behavior which results in experimental error variance analyses were based on averaged results of ten repeated simulations as suggested by fust and schlecht 2018 weight gain and loss of the animals during the rainy and dry season respectively as a result of changes in forage availability in terms of quantity and quality was assessed yearly by calculating the difference between the weight of all animals at the last day of the dry season and their respective annual maximal weight these yearly differences were subsequently tested for correlation with data from yearly integrals of available biomass and necromass using linear regression models similarly the yearly weight changes were compared with the numbers of growth days per year as a direct proxy for the available forage biomass in doing so the level of predictability of herd productivity from climatic data was assessed all statistical analyses were performed in the software package r version 3 2 0 r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 general effects of predicted climate in terms of reduced total amount and higher inter annual variation in precipitation the predicted climate conditions according to the selected ipcc marksim dataset data set n 1 of rcp scenario 6 0 resulted in an average annual precipitation sum of 520 mm for the analyzed period 2012 23 fig 5 shows a comparison of the measured and simulated frequencies of rainfall events for different rainfall size classes according to the new climate module in ramdry the resulting average annual length of the growth season is 95 days with a corresponding variation of 23 8 yearly precipitation ranged from 355 779 mm table 5 the time series of yearly precipitation sums and their corresponding yearly lengths of the growth seasons indicate a series of two consecutive years of particularly low annual precipitation and growth length in 2015 16 and 2016 17 as comparison applying the model on measured rain data for the period 2012 15 resulted in an average annual sum of 81 growth days and a corresponding variation of 13 3 the impact of increasing grazing pressure on the system for continuous growth seasons under the predicted climate regime according to rcp scenario 6 0 as well as under current climatic conditions as recorded between 2012 and 2015 is shown in fig 6 displaying the tipping point curves of total livestock production under the predicted climate the system reaches its peak production level at a grazing intensity exerted by 1950 zebus 26 herds of 75 animals each equal to an initial total body weight of 334 490 kg equivalent to a grassland carrying capacity of 3 9 ha animal above which over utilization results in the collapse of the system in comparison despite the higher mean precipitation and lower variability in the recorded rain data the resulting shorter growth period lengths of 90 69 and 84 days effected a peak production level at the grazing pressure of 1875 animals 25 herds of 75 animals each equivalent to a grassland carrying capacity of 4 1 ha animal slightly lower than for the predicted scenario the absolute maxima of the end sum of herd weights are thereby less important as they are primarily influenced by the quality of the last growth season s in terms of number of consecutive growth days not primarily by the whole simulation period results of linear models indicated that yearly sums of rainfall amount correlated with the yearly sum of the resulting growth days for the period 2012 23 adjusted r2 0 65 p 0 002 n 11 as well as for the period 2023 32 adjusted r2 0 68 p 0 004 n 9 when considering only rainfall events bigger than 4 8 mm linear regression analysis on the annual numbers of rainy days and growth days for the period 2012 23 indicate even higher correlation adjusted r2 0 757 n 11 p 0 001 as fig 7 displays values of the two periods exhibit a good overlap and relatively good fit at total rainfall amounts below 500 mm while scattering is more pronounced at increased rainfall sums it furthermore shows an even enhanced goodness of fit with linear log models adjusted r2 0 70 p 0 002 n 11 and adjusted r2 0 81 p 0 001 n 9 for periods 2012 23 and 2023 32 respectively which makes also more sense from an ecological point of view constraining as such the number of growth days at very high precipitation amount 3 2 herbaceous vegetation response to interrupted growth seasons the growth seasons resulting from the rcp data set consisted of multiple short periods of growth that were frequently separated by short intra seasonal dry spells fig 8 the average length of the individual bouts of continuous growth was thereby 27 days cv 106 min 2 days max 122 days n 35 detailed growth period related data can be found in appendix a4 during the eleven modeled growth seasons between summer 2012 and summer 2023 the number of intra seasonal interruptions was on average 2 36 min 1 max 6 with lengths between 1 and 66 days mean 22 9 days cv 81 n 26 the resulting total annual length of the theoretical growth seasons measured from start of the first growth day until the last day of the last growth bout accumulated at levels between 96 and 246 days mean 149 2 days cv 31 n 11 the percentage of growth days per growth season which we defined as inverse index for temporal fragmentation of the growth season ranged from 36 season 2020 21 to 86 season 2019 20 table 6 the seasonal dynamics of biomass availability in terms of dry matter of green and dry forage in the modeled system is shown in fig 9 it displays the results for the two cases considering continuous as well as interrupted growth periods as a result of daily rainfall dynamics the timing of the continuous growth has thereby been evaluated for best temporal synchronization with the interrupted growth based on the temporal distribution of its individual growth days throughout the season while the total annual number of growth days within the years was equal in both cases distinct differences in the amount of available green biomass and necromass at a given point in time were recognizable prolonged interruptions in growth could easily be identified from the growth dynamics of green biomass as the corresponding resulting peak biomass levels were often considerably lower in comparison with the regime based on continuous growth periods e g during the growth season 2020 21 the peak values of green biomass at un interrupted growth were on average 42 higher however a more detailed comparison revealed a less clear pattern as certain prolonged interruptions had only minor effects on peak biomass values such as in the case of the growth season 2021 22 when a growth discontinuity of 30 days separated the total growth period into two bouts of 25 and 82 days which resulted in a decrease of the peak biomass value of only 7 5 furthermore the duration of the time periods during which the amount of available green biomass was considerably high was often not influenced by any intra seasonal growth interruptions as exemplified by the growth periods of 2017 18 or 2018 19 unsurprisingly the annual integrals of available green biomass in the interrupted growth scenario were on average 25 lower than in the un interrupted scenario min 2 max 45 n 11 p 0 001 total annual precipitation amount and total annual sum of growth days proved reliable predictors for annual time integrals of available green forage biomass for the simulated period 2012 23 assuming continuous growth periods without interruptions annual sums of rainfall and total days of growth were both statistically significantly correlated with the annual integrals of green biomass showing adjusted determination coefficients r2 of 0 66 p 0 002 n 11 and 0 97 p 0 001 n 11 respectively likewise in the case of interrupted growth the linear regression model of annual rain and integrated green forage biomass indicated a statistically significant though lower level of fit adjusted r2 0 61 p 0 003 n 11 similarly the number of growth days per year predicted much better the corresponding annual integral of green biomass leading to an adjusted determination coefficient of r2 0 91 p 0 001 n 11 considering additionally the level of growth interruption in terms of the beforehand calculated temporal fragmentation index in the regression analysis significantly improved the goodness of fit of the linear model further adjusted r2 0 97 p 0 001 n 11 results of the regression analysis indicated that the fragmentation index t value 4 93 table 7 was able to explain further 24 of the variation in the annual integral of green biomass in comparison to the annual sum of growth days t value 15 38 as such annual integrals of green biomass could be predicted most reliably by the total number of growth days and their respective indices of temporal fragmentation the results for necromass availability in terms of time integrals between annual minima were similar to the ones for green biomass leading to 21 less necromass available on average in the interrupted growth scenario min 5 max 49 n 11 p 0 001 in line with the findings for green biomass necromass availability could best be predicted by the annual sum of growth days alone in the case of un interrupted growth adjusted r2 0 98 p 0 001 n 11 and in case of interrupted growth by the combination of this parameter with the temporal fragmentation index adjusted r2 0 98 p 0 001 n 11 omitting the fragmentation index in the regression model resulted in a reduction of around 10 in prediction accuracy adjusted r2 0 89 p 0 001 n 11 annual integrals of the product of daily values for digestibility and available green biomass differed between the two growth scenarios continuous growth periods resulted in 17 higher values on average compared to their interrupted growth equivalents n 10 p 0 01 3 3 livestock productivity response to interrupted growth seasons total sum of body weight of all animals exhibited clear seasonal fluctuations while absolute values in case of interrupted growth were consistently lower mean 5 min 0 max 10 n 3650 p 0 001 compared to the un interrupted scenario fig 10 changes in the difference of the values between the two cases proved strongest within the periods 2012 13 2016 17 and 2020 21 when effects of high levels of growth period fragmentation and prolonged below average rainfall resulted in increased weight losses among the herds most remarkable was the modeled rainy season 2020 21 when a dry spell interrupted the vegetation growth during 45 days with most significant effect on herd weights resulting in only minor seasonal weight gain seasonal herd weight gains in terms of weight at the start of the growth season and the subsequent maximum seasonal peak weight were on average 861 kg higher for un interrupted growth periods although not statistically significant p 0 13 according to the conducted paired t test the difference was particularly pronounced in the years of low total rainfall similarly seasonal weight losses during the dry period i e difference between maximum peak weight and weight at the start of the subsequent growing season relative to the maximum weight were higher in the un interrupted scenario though statistically not significant paired t test p 0 12 in sum annual changes and fluctuations in total herd weight were comparable in the two cases though livestock production occurred on a significantly reduced general level if high resolution climate influences resulting in occasional intra seasonal dry spells and interruption in biomass growth were considered seasonal weight gains of all herds correlated well with the annual integral of the product of green biomass and its digestibilities best fit of the linear model was reached by considering values of two subsequent years i e the current and the preceding year n 9 adjusted r2 0 89 p 0 001 table 8 for the analysis of dry season weight losses the value for the first year has been neglected because of the direct influence of the arbitrary start weight i e unrelated to the simulated precipitation and as such to the available vegetation biomass on the first maximum weight value excluding the first year dry season weight losses were best predicted by the combination of annual maximum weight and the product of green biomass and its digestibilities adjusted r2 0 73 p 0 008 n 9 annual weight changes between subsequent onsets of the rainy season i e annual weight losses correlated also very well with the annual time integral of the products of green biomass and its digestibilities in accordance with the results for seasonal weight changes best predictions were made when using the values of the preceding and current year adjusted r2 0 91 p 0 001 n 9 table 9 the number of total growth days per year predicted annual weight changes also significantly well though less accurately than biomass and digestibility in line with the findings for these parameters the combination of growth days of the current and the preceding year yielded a good fit for the linear model 83 of the variation in annual weight change could be explained by applying only this single climatic parameter n 9 p 0 002 table 10 underlining as such its suitability as reliable predictor 4 discussion results from our study provide important insights into the impact of mid seasonal dry spells during periods of vegetation growth on herbaceous above ground biomass forage availability and thereby livestock production in semi arid rangelands in response to requests and suggestions of the scientific community tietjen and jeltsch 2007 thornton et al 2009a we developed and applied a spatially explicit agent based modeling approach and an elementary climate based vegetation growth model to assess the largely neglected impact of intra annual precipitation variability in a semi arid grazing system thereby we have been able to separately assess the implications of effects of simulated climate change in south western madagascar for rangeland ecosystems in terms of overall reduction of total annual precipitation in combination with higher inter annual variation and increased temporal diffusion of singular rain events as such our results highlight that a good accuracy of predictions of local effects of future climatic changes on these ecological systems can only be ensured by the sound and quantitative understanding of these dynamic processes allowing in consequence the sustainable use of their natural resources contrary to our expectations the model results for the anticipated reduction in total precipitation and increased inter annual variation indicated no aggravation of the general situation for livestock keepers in terms of system productivity under maximum stocking supposedly partly as an effect of the high level of resilience of vegetation in semi arid ecosystems as indicated by other studies shafran nathan et al 2013 taking the increased temporal diffusion of precipitation events into account resulting per se in a significant fragmentation of the growth periods we were able to identify a remarkable reduction in available green and dry herbaceous biomass as expected body weights of livestock kept under such conditions were consistently lower compared to the cases of growth seasons of similar lengths without intra seasonal dry spells even though seasonal changes in body weight proved comparable despite the high complexity of interactive processes involved the level of predictability of effects of precipitation changes within the studied parameter range on primary vegetation and secondary livestock production was high based on annual rainfall sums which correlated well with the number of growth days per year and the ratio of growth days per growth season fragmentation index the time integrated amount of herbaceous green biomass and necromass could be well predicted while significant correlation of herbaceous biomass and digestibility with seasonal body weight changes of livestock was expected the model exhibited furthermore surprisingly good results in the prediction of livestock weight changes by annual precipitation sums and yearly sums of growth days respectively this result emphasizes the capabilities of the modified version of ramdry as a climate based rangeland and grazing management tool in marginal semi arid environments in the tropics and subtropics the precipitation based phenomenological model of primary productivity founded on the concept of cascaded linear reservoirs hermance et al 2015 has proved specifically suitable to describe vegetation dynamics in water limited semi arid grasslands yet despite its broad recognition in hydrology e g gatot et al 2001 sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 this model concept has rarely been implemented in ecological studies so far hermance et al 2016 supposedly due to its simplifying mechanistic approach conjoining many details of soil properties plant physiology and hydrology the increase in its complexity by the implementation of individual dynamics of the two reservoir modeling parameters allowed to simulate phenophase dependent processes and thereby increase model prediction accuracy as the climate growth model is not considering any intrinsic effect of temperature seasonal gradients of temperature influenced rates of eco physiological processes can be simulated through these seasonal adaptations of model parameters the decrease of air temperature in the study area towards the end of the growth season data not shown results in a lower evaporation rate and potentially an increase in foliage surface it furthermore has the potential of increasing the average soil moisture and thereby shortening the response time of plants to precipitation pulses the observed reduction of the response time for the primary stage of the two reservoir model representing the infiltration of rain water into the soil and its distribution as soil moisture throughout the growth season from 11 t1sos to 2 t1eos days agrees with results of other studies indicating temporal variation in delayed responses to rainfall e g schwinning and sala 2004 as the response time variable of a reservoir determines the dynamics of the outflow i e the outflow is influenced by the inverse of the time variable higher values correspond to lower outflows per time lower inflows to the next stage consequently and a slower flow through the stage as such in the case of the response time t1 the observed gradient which resulted in best model fit represents a slower effect of rain pulses on growth effective soil moisture at the beginning of the growth season as compared to the end of the rainy season as many biological processes involved in plant growth have not been modeled explicitly the observed seasonal variation might not only represent the alteration in soil moisture as a result of water input but also a change in soil microbial activity in soils with very low physiological activity due to prolonged lack of soil moisture the reactivation of microbial processes after a drought period has proved to significantly influence the stimulation of autotrophic activity in the soil huxman et al 2004b in contrast the low temporal change of the response time variable of the second stage of the cascaded reservoir model stands for a nearly constant delay between soil moisture increase and resulting plant growth underlining thereby the need for separate variable gradients for the individual stages while biomass build up might instinctively seem a more important effort for plants in early phenological state as compared to mature plants the results of our coupled reservoir model don t display such a potential trait as it favored a seasonal dependence only in the first stage depicting somewhat the limits of implicit mimicry by the simplified approach depending on the duration of pre rain dryness total lags from rain pulse to maximum productivity in the range of 4 14 days and 4 10 days have been recorded in african savanna williams et al 2009 and in the inner mongolian plateau fan et al 2016 respectively confirming as such the range of time response variables evaluated in our model the reliable prediction of vegetation phenological characteristics by satellite derived metrics has been demonstrated in several studies e g vrieling et al 2018 watson et al 2019 research on different types of grasslands in particular reported the potential of accurate identification of onset and end of greenness and time of maximum photosynthesis by time series of normalized difference vegetation index data liu et al 2017 cui et al 2019 which justified its application in our study validation of the climate growth model parameters based on remote sensed data time series indicated a relatively high average residual of more than 10 days per year suggesting as such a general low prediction accuracy of the model in view of the variable temporal resolution of the available satellite data of up to 16 days and the accumulative effect of deferred predicted growth periods by contributing double to the residuals despite potentially correct growth lengths the accuracy of the model appears sufficient to our needs though probably not particularly suited for applications requesting fine temporal resolution a variety of weather generating algorithms have been developed and utilized for climate prediction in areas with limited or lack of observed data the accuracy of the simulated climatic data has proved variable depending on the models regional specifics and the output requested e g mzirai et al 2005 kahimba et al 2014 although the marksim weather generator integrated in dssat which was used in our model to generate the daily precipitation and temperature data has been widely applied in studies on climate change e g thornton et al 2009b sinclair et al 2014 rao et al 2015 and seems to perform acceptably under certain conditions e g in unimodal climatic areas its variable accuracy particularly in predicting precipitation has been criticized trotochaud et al 2016 specific validation of the predicted climate data has not been performed explicitly within this study however kahimba et al 2014 identified the marksim weather generator to partly overestimate the occurrence probability and length of dry spells in the context of bimodal climate areas while giving fairly good estimates of total annual rain amounts they therefore recommended the use of the giovanni weather generator of the goddard earth science data and information services centre acker and leptoukh 2007 for their application and a future assessment of the adaptability of these two weather generators or available field observed climate data to our application might be advisable comparison of current and predicted future climate conditions based on ipcc marksim dssat data consistently showed a decrease in total annual rain amount in combination with an increase in its inter annual variation as predicted by other authors for the area of the study region e g thornton et al 2007 feng et al 2013 while the decrease in annual rainfall was only in the range of 10 the increase in climatic variability was much more significant aligning as such with other studies herrero et al 2016 despite this apparent worsening scenario our updated climate module yielded for climate data of rcp 6 0 a substantial increase in total number and inter annual variation of growth days per year as compared to current values which is in contradiction to other predictions that indicate a decrease in growth length of 20 until 2050 thornton et al 2006 thornton et al 2011 besides the obvious difference in study period length which we restricted in our study to 10 years 2012 23 a reason for this contradiction may also lie in the differing definitions of growth days which relies in thornton s study on averaged conditions for soil water holding capacity of 100 mm and a fix threshold of 0 5 for the actual to potential evapotranspiration ratio in contrary decision on growth no growth was based in our study on empirically ascertained model threshold values the results of our study suggest the assumption that future climate as predicted by the rcp and marksim for the study area would be characterized by more growth relevant days relying on small rain events each a similar increasing trend in the rainfall event frequency with decreasing rainfall size has been observed in other arid and semi arid regions rainy days with daily rain amounts below 5 mm are with 67 7 of all the cases most frequent in our study data set comparable to the frequencies measured on typical steppe on the inner mongolian plateau fan et al 2016 despite the high frequency of occurrence of such small rain events fan and colleagues found that small size rainfall pulses alone contributed only marginally to changes in primary productivity as measured by ndvi and studies therefore frequently excluded rain events below 5 mm from their analysis e g williams et al 2009 nevertheless we argue that even if the effects of these small rain pulses might hardly be measurable in anpp change depending on their occurrence they nevertheless contribute to the ecological processes that indirectly affect vegetation growth in grasslands e g in terms of wetting soil surfaces as described by fan et al 2016 elevated numbers of growth relevant days as found in our study might therefore be caused by such differences in approach considering either only major pulses or all accumulative effects as in our model the increased correlation of the annual numbers of rainy days and growth days by omitting small 4 8 mm day rainfall events confirms findings of studies relying on non accumulative single event based approaches e g sala and lauenroth 1982 li et al 2013 our results of system collapse analysis based on continuous growth seasons indicated that despite the higher mean precipitation and lower variability in the recorded current rain data as compared to the predicted climatic scenario the production system withstood comparable maximum pressure before collapsing close investigation revealed that the two compared time series data sets had similar values for minimum annual growth length 69 days between 2013 and 14 as measured 65 days between 2015 and 16 in the predicted scenario in agreement with the non equilibrium persistent rangeland model briske et al 2017 these lean periods describe in general the temporal bottleneck in resource availability and system breakdown under comparable pressure seems obvious as such we emphasize that studies on sustainability of maximal productivity of livestock should primarily focus on lean periods however we furthermore accentuate the importance of time series analysis detailed investigation of simulation periods with different sequences of years with growth lengths of similar average total precipitation and precipitation variability showed that the conditions for system collapse furthermore rely on constrains during consecutive years data not shown in contradiction to our first hypothesis on the effect of lowered annual rainfall and higher inter annual variation results of our study revealed a general higher system productivity under the predicted climate scenario based on the common approach of continuous or often undefined structure of growth periods of specified annual lengths as such we agree with the findings of other researchers e g nippert et al 2006 heisler white et al 2008 shafran nathan et al 2013 and emphasize that conclusions on livestock ecosystem production performance based on general climate parameters such as annual precipitation and or precipitation variation can be highly misleading in turn our findings confirm our hypothesis on the importance of the consideration of temporal distribution of single rain events and the resulting growth periods in productivity and sustainability analyses in particular regarding the increased significance of mid seasonal dry spells the observed number of mid seasonal interruptions of the growth seasons under the predicted climate scenario was significant giving rise to an average of 2 36 discontinuities per year with an average length of almost 23 days while the utilized weather generator marksim is charged to be prone to over estimation of dry spell frequency kahimba et al 2014 we nevertheless stress the importance of consideration of this issue such intra annual amplification of the hydrological cycle driven by climatic changes has already been predicted and proved on a global scale and for southern africa in particular wilcox et al 2017 gherardi and sala 2019 godde et al 2020 ritter et al 2020 meng et al 2021 depending on the timing of such dry spells with regard to the vegetative phenophase the effect of varying water availability on plant growth has proved to be significant jia et al 2016 varying in its temporal significance furthermore by plant species craine et al 2012 although we did not explicitly simulate phenophases in function of different species but rather phenophase dependent herbaceous biomass growth rates we noted variable but significant decrease in available green as well as dry biomass at a time as a result of such interruptions as we realize from the simulated output of biomass dynamics prolonged growth breaks in the early phase of the growth season as particularly displayed in the period 2012 13 interruption length 28 days after 28 days of growth and 2021 22 interruption length 45 days after 49 days of growth resulted in major reduction of peak maximum green and dry biomass fig 9 however we acknowledge that the effect of dry spells on vegetation biomass availability depended on a combination of three parameters namely the timing within the growth period the length of the interruption as well as the total length of the growth season which we did not attempt to disentangle in this study experiments have indicated that infrequent big rain events lead to increased anpp as compared to frequent smaller sized events that lead to reduced plant production heisler white et al 2008 del grosso et al 2018 which would contradict our findings however it is notable that these experiments in general compared cases of different event sizes and frequency by keeping seasonal rainfall amount constant as such aligning approximately with our conditions while keeping also the total length of the growth season constant in our case however we found that due to the interruptions throughout the whole growth season the total length of the growth season was significantly increased to more than 150 days as such the effects of dry spells and growth interruptions became much more severe for the productivity of the ecosystem as growth effective rain events occurred much more sporadically unfortunately to our knowledge there is no comparable study analyzing the accumulative effect of stochastic rain pulses on sub tropical semi arid grassland vegetation and corresponding livestock production systems based on similar climate scenarios to validate the correctness and accuracy of our results studies on vegetation phenology in eastern africa however confirm in certain areas a trend towards elongated growing periods combined with lower precipitation amounts workie and debella 2018 as observed in our study such decreases in temporal primary productivity lead to a general decrease in productivity of livestock systems depending entirely on these resources as a logical consequence of the generally reduced biomass availability body weights of ruminant herbivores were lower in case of interrupted growth scenarios the effect of reduction in anpp on animal performance might thereby not only have been of direct causal nature but also related to increased energy expenditure of grazers for movement in search of sparser food and or the general reduction in quality of available resources as suggested by other studies craine et al 2012 rivera ferre et al 2016 fust and schlecht 2018 while we have not implemented changes in vegetation structure and species communities in our model as such digestibility dynamics of green biomass in combination with increased dependency of grazers on dried necromass resources led to a decrease in overall quality of the available forage in response to altered precipitation regimes the assessed scenario of low intensity grazing pressure resulted in an average decrease of animal body weight of 5 as a sole consequence of consideration of mid seasonal growth interruptions this general reduction in livestock productivity was equivalent to a decrease of 0 4 in body condition score bcs nrc 1996 in contrast to this general diminution of body weight our study indicated no significant difference in seasonal annual weight losses and gains in the wake of increased frequency of dry spells this at first glance surprising result might be an indicator for the system s resilient functioning in a comparable manner on a lower general level assured by continuously available forage resources in terms of above minimum levels of vegetation biomass comparison of grass biomass availability in the cases of interrupted and continuous growth seasons portends largely conformable lengths of periods with above minimum biomass fig 9a according to our findings mid seasonal dry spells and consequent temporal interruptions of vegetation growth have proved their significant role in predictions of sustainable grassland management in the semi arid sub tropics providing as such corroboration of our second hypothesis in accordance with other studies e g fynn and o connor 2000 peng et al 2013 total annual rain amount could only partly predict anpp in terms of peak green biomass r2 0 71 n 11 p 0 001 while the number of growth days per year increased prediction accuracy in both cases interrupted and continuous growth periods r2 0 82 and r2 0 89 respectively n 11 p 0 001 potential reasons for the significant level of unpredictable variability in anpp response to precipitation have been found e g in the size of individual rain events huxman et al 2004b parton et al 2012 effects of soil moisture on root activity knapp et al 2002 fay et al 2003 heisler white et al 2008 timing of rain events in view of vegetation phenophase huxman et al 2004a and local topographic heterogeneity hoover et al 2021 our prediction accuracy for peak green biomass considering mid seasonal dry spells however increased substantially by the integration of aspects of temporal distribution of growth phases explaining in combination with the number of growth days 92 of its variation data not shown with regard to the importance of continual availability of forage biomass and its quality for livestock production systems it was crucial that our model has been able to predict these aspects through average available forage biomass combined with its respective quality with utmost accuracy i e explaining 99 of its variation based on the total number of growth days and their temporal distribution this high level of correlation between feed resources and precipitation respectively the resulting vegetation growth laid the foundation of the good predictability of livestock productivity by precipitation based parameters in accordance with fynn and o connor 2000 we found that livestock productivity was not best predicted by actual peak green biomass but by including previous year s data underlining the importance of consideration of time series analysis for accurate production forecasting our results however also indicated that absolute values for animals body weights could barely be predicted directly neither by precipitation nor by forage resource parameters r2 0 56 data not shown underlining the complexity of the system and the importance of knowledge of precedent conditions nevertheless results of our model indicated that changes in livestock productivity under future climate conditions can be predicted with good accuracy allowing as such easy monitoring with simple measurements e g rain amount at daily resolution that can be conducted in the field involving only minor investment although the updated version of our rangeland model ramdry has been able to simulate effects of climate change on semi arid rangelands and the associated livestock production the abstraction of natural processes in the model implies limitations in its capabilities the already mentioned lack of implementation of vegetation structure and species communities limits the prediction abilities of combined long term effects of over grazing and increased climate variability as such land cover conversion as a result of encroachment of shrubs as well as changes in the ratio of annual to perennial plant species cannot be assessed in the current model the lack of a simulated seed bank prevents an analysis of the impact of prolonged dry periods as debated by various authors e g kiss et al 2018 basto et al 2018 loydi and collins 2021 and of increased grazing pressure erfanzadeh et al 2020 gonzalez and ghermandi 2021 on plant communities the chosen study area located on a flat plateau facilitated the parametrization and validation of the model as specific topographic features were basically absent hence topography related effects of climate on vegetation such as the explicit separation of precipitation into runoff and infiltrated water as well as potential habitat degradation by soil erosion have not been a focus of our study and are therefore not represented in the model limiting its accuracy when transferred to topographically more structured regions due to a shortage in detailed data on air humidity and wind for the study area evapotranspiration could not be assessed and hence is not accounted for in ramdry despite being a major determinant of soil water content in particular in shallow soil layers the future implementation of additional management strategies such as the supply of additional feed and or crop residues to livestock in lean periods would furthermore increase the capabilities of ramdry as a tool for scenario evaluation given these current limitations of ramdry and their importance in rangeland ecology we encourage further developments on the model as well as its potential implementation in an integrated modeling framework with detailed vegetation and hydrologic models as proposed by roetter et al 2021 5 summary and conclusion the sustainable utilization and management of rangelands in semi arid regions of sub saharan africa is of major importance for the livelihood of people often living on marginal resources predicted future changes in climate threaten to increase pressure on these erratically available natural resources due to their decreased predictability and productivity the changes in precipitation amount variability and timing ask for particular attention as their combined impact on rangeland and livestock production can be detrimental but have rarely been assessed despite the partially simplistic approach of our model we were able to identify and quantify risks in prediction of effects of climatic changes which have not been taken into account so far our findings for the study area in southwestern madagascar indicate that decreased annual precipitation amount and the increase of its inter annual variability might change the behavior of the system under critical conditions only marginally while the alterations in timing of individual precipitation events could result in substantial temporal reduction of forage resources in terms of their quantity and quality thus the impact of consideration of temporal precipitation distribution and corresponding predicted climate conditions can be highly significant for analysis of climate changes in semi arid grazing systems the predicted climate suggests a prolongation of the vegetation growth period with increased risk of extended dry spells leading to mid seasonal growth interruptions our spatially explicit model includes important metabolic aspects of ruminants and integrates aspects of forage quality dynamics and energy expenditure of moving animals in search of limited feed supplies as a result of these highly dynamic conditions for vegetation growth the forecasted temporal pattern of precipitation distribution resulted in a significant reduction of available forage green biomass and necromass in general and thereby a worrying loss in livestock productivity our findings thus provide important insights on the impact of the temporal distribution of rainfall events as one important aspect of climatic changes on livestock production

24445,natural resources of semi arid rangelands in the sub tropics are major pillars of food security and livelihoods to millions of people besides increasing pressure due to human population growth high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation leading to highly erratic production of primary biomass has high potential to render the exploitation of ephemeral concentrations of these resources unsustainable while future climate models predict a general decrease in precipitation for many semi arid rangelands the increase in variability of rainfall and its dynamics are important aspects in assessments of climate change impact that only recently gained scientific attention building on a spatially explicit agent based model of free ranging livestock herds in semi arid rangelands ramdry that accounts for the metabolic energy budget of foraging animals we assessed the vulnerability of rangelands and livestock production systems as a result of the effects of ongoing changes in precipitation and its variation as well as its temporal distribution based on a coupled reservoir model conceptually relying on a two stage cascaded linear reservoir we developed implemented and validated a refined forage production module in ramdry to predict primary productivity of semi arid grassland and its impacts on livestock production from daily rainfall our results show a highly significant effect of increased temporal diffusion of precipitation events on the ecosystem and its productivity the anticipated diminution in total precipitation and increased inter annual variation indicated no severe aggravation of the general situation for livestock keepers in terms of system productivity however alterations in timing of individual precipitation events resulted in substantial temporal reduction of forage resources in terms of their quantity and quality and major negative impact on livestock body weights our findings shed light on the profound

introduction rangelands in semi arid tropical and subtropical environment provide natural resources of high importance to the local communities globally millions of livestock keeping households depend on the ecosystem services of rangelands ilri et al 2021 which as such directly or indirectly contribute to food security and livelihoods of many people often living in marginally productive environments given the dry climates prevailing in these areas production of primary biomass is highly erratic steinfeld et al 2006 mainly as a result of high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation mobile forms of livestock production have proved most adapted to the exploitation of ephemeral concentrations of natural resources under those conditions particularly in countries of sub saharan africa kraetli et al 2013 here pasture vegetation and crop residues constitute the main feed resource for ruminant livestock lazzarini et al 2009 still due to the very dynamic climatic conditions in these areas pastures provide feed of highly variable amount and quality both highly depending on rainfall and air temperature traditionally livestock keepers reacted to the temporal changes in feed availability with strategic mobility kraetli et al 2013 leading their herds to the best available pastures throughout the year behnke et al 2011 increase in human population combined with restricted access to shrinking rangelands as a result of lack of land ownership or clearly defined use rights however more and more constrains free herd movements and as such threatens the sustainable utilization of these natural resources hobbs et al 2008 turner and schlecht 2019 to minimize the risk of local over exploitation and environmental degradation and to increase efficiency of herd and rangeland management a sound understanding of the dynamics of ecological processes governing biomass production and utilization in semi arid rangelands is needed fust and schlecht 2018 in view of the strong reliance of mobile as well as sedentary livestock production on rainfall in these drylands the predictions of future changes of climate and their consequences are particularly alarming making traditional agro pastoralists one of the globally most vulnerable group to climate change dong et al 2011 herrero et al 2016 future climate models largely agree upon a general decrease in precipitation amounts in tropical and subtropical land regions ipcc 2014 whilst at the same time the variability of weather and frequency of extreme events is supposed to increase dunning et al 2018 and has even been directly observed mpandeli et al 2019 beside seasonal amount of rainfall and its variability the dynamics of these changes need careful consideration timing and temporal distribution of rainfall had long been neglected in studies and only recently gained more attention pohl et al 2017 ayanlade et al 2018 martinez valderrama et al 2021 roffe et al 2021 although their impact on changes in the length of dry spells pascale et al 2016 and on gross primary production guo et al 2015 had been demonstrated the potential impacts of climate change on livestock production in the arid and semi arid tropics and subtropics are thereby manifold directly as well as indirectly rivera ferre et al 2016 increasing air temperatures are assumed to lead to elevated heat load for animals resulting in lower performance and reproduction thornton et al 2007 assan 2014 desalegn 2016 the most evident effects on livestock productivity however are predicted to be mediated through indirect effects such as changes in water and feed resources changes in precipitation might alter the availability of drinking water for animals restricting as such and in combination with increased air temperature the usability of foraging resources in regions far off water points yet the availability of forage resources for livestock will be affected most significantly by climatic changes through a multitude of pathways thornton et al 2007 thornton et al 2009a rust and rust 2013 namely by i a reduction in primary productivity of the rangelands and rainfed agriculture herrero et al 2016 as a result of the reduced growth ii the intensified use of rangelands due to climate induced land use changes such as conversion from mixed crop livestock to rangeland based systems in consequence of higher resilience of livestock against dry spells and increasing probability of complete crop failure jones and thornton 2009 iii a change in plant species composition in rangelands through altered co2 and temperature levels e g towards an increased proportion of shrub bush encroachment which will result in loss of pasturable areas in particular for grazers stevens et al 2016 and iv reduced forage quality by increased lignification and shift from c4 grasses to mono and dicotyledonous c3 plants leading to reduced nutrient availability for livestock while many agricultural studies have assessed the impact of climatic change on global continental and regional scale e g herrero et al 2016 large local variation in climate and the high level of spatial heterogeneity of environmental parameters that affect plant growth in semi arid rangelands ask for much higher resolution assessment thornton et al 2009a fine scale modeling of the resulting spatial distribution of resources allows the consideration of animal movements and their energetic costs as important factors in grazing efficiency and therefore also livestock productivity wallis de fries 1996 dijkman and lawrence 1997 the integration of the intra annual dynamics in quality of the forage is crucial for the analysis of the performance of livestock production systems in tropical and subtropical semi arid environment fust and schlecht 2018 as it has proved to be a major limiting factor in such systems assan 2014 currently most forage assessments are based on aboveground net primary production anpp green matter despite the importance of availability and digestibility of dry forage as key resource during significant periods of the dry season fern√°ndez rivera et al 2005 briske et al 2020 nutritional quality of available forage resources and thereby grazer performance are influenced by a variety of factors such as herbage species composition and trait functional composition which in turn are a result of soil properties nutrient availability grazing intensity and other management practices many of these factors are significantly affected by climatic variables such as precipitation air temperature and wind fay et al 2003 craine et al 2012 underlining also from this angle the need for a sound understanding of the environmental impacts of climate on livestock production in semi arid regions while multiple experiments and field based observational studies have investigated the role of climate change on botanical composition and anpp of rangelands its indirect effect on grazing animals and particularly the influence of climatic variability has rarely been studied explicitly craine 2013 several studies dealing with climate change effects on grassland biomass production have found that consideration of summarizing yearly or seasonal values for climatic variables was insufficient since their variability and timing could considerably affect productivity of grazing resources e g sloat et al 2018 felton et al 2020 griffin nolan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and livestock as such nevertheless investigations on how the temporal distribution of precipitation events might affect grazers are sparse tietjen and jeltsch 2007 craine et al 2012 although several researchers reported only a weak link between precipitation amount and rangeland productivity in a study on semi arid rangeland in west africa soil moisture as an important driver for plant growth has exposed only a poor correlation with cumulative rainfall rockstr√∂m and de rouw 1997 in other experiments on semi arid grassland inter annual variability in anpp was only marginally 30 40 explained by annual precipitation amounts heisler white et al 2008 a recent study on mesic habitats found a lack of correlation between herbaceous anpp and mean annual rainfall indicating that the temporal variation in rainfall can have instead a much higher potential effect golodets et al 2013 in turn dynamic change in grass cover has even been found to help maximizing water use of whole savanna ecosystems by buffering effects of precipitation variability scanlon et al 2005 the importance of temporal distribution of rainfall in terms of pulses and interpulse periods of anpp in arid and semi arid environment has been acknowledged by several studies e g xiong et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 gong et al 2020 liu et al 2020 liang et al 2021 recognizing thereby that lower seasonal productivity was not necessarily caused by reduced rainfall amount but by changes in rainfall distribution the effect of rainfall distribution on the dynamics of soil water content particularly in the shallow soil layers which is most important for many herbaceous plant species particularly c3 has been highlighted as major reason for the change in the seasonal productivity of rangelands fay et al 2002 liang et al 2021 alterations in rainfall distribution most prominently affect grassland dominated savannas while effects on woodland are smaller guan et al 2014 changes in seasonal rainfall distribution have the potential to result in increased frequency and duration of mid season dry spells and interruptions of vegetation growth giving rise to decreased primary productivity of rangelands depending on the timing of the growth interruption as observed already in southern africa zhang et al 2018 and increasing as such the risk for grazer based livestock production systems furthermore leaf physiological activity has been identified as being responsive to rainfall distribution fay et al 2003 the significant effect of precipitation distribution throughout the growing season has also been recognized for crop production as ellis and galvin 1994 showed in a comparison of two sites in west and east africa that received similar amounts of rainfall during the growth season a badly distributed rainfall of 700 mm per year might still be insufficient to sustain crop production while recent vegetation models are getting capable to capture rainfall variability in increasingly high temporal resolution e g adgvm2 scheiter et al 2013 most existing rangeland models that assess the effects of climate change on productivity of livestock in semi arid regions still rely on continuous growth periods and are as such often at best based only on length of growing period lgp and its inter annual variability e g kuckertz et al 2011 herrero et al 2016 descheemaeker et al 2018 guerrin 2020 but see guo et al 2015 the potentially negative impact of the combination of these predicted climate change phenomena is expected to heighten the vulnerability of livestock production systems particularly in african countries e g assan 2014 porter et al 2014 which underpins the regional importance of this topic despite this recognized significance the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc identified a lack of studies on the impact of climate change on livestock systems in comparison to crop production and linked this deficiency to the system complexity as a result of the multiple drivers involved porter et al 2014 this complexity of ecological processes in rangelands and the resulting difficulty in predicting impacts of future climate changes on livestock nutrition and productivity in developing countries has been recognized in several studies thornton et al 2009a assan 2014 a lately proposed integrative framework for dealing with the complex multi functionality of savannah landscapes underlines the potential of a combination of multiple dynamic model types roetter et al 2021 including rule based modeling approaches agent based modeling abm techniques are well suited to predict effects of environmental dynamics on complex ecological systems including the temporal dynamics and high spatial heterogeneity of forage resource availability as found in semi arid rangelands fust and schlecht 2018 abms thereby support the study of dynamic adaptive relations between entities and furthermore allow the integration of stochastic events such as climatic influences in a spatially explicit context grimm and railsback 2005 grimm et al 2005 we therefore investigate in this paper the potential of abms for assessing ecological effects of precipitation related parameters on semi arid rangelands and associated extensive agro pastoral livestock production systems incorporating dynamic forage quality and a spatially heterogeneous forage distribution to that end we took advantage of the potential of the spatially explicit agent based savanna rangeland model ramdry fust and schlecht 2018 which we extended and adapted accordingly for the specific purpose of this study ramdry aims in its original form at assessing the potential of adaptive livestock production in a highly dynamic heterogeneous semi arid rangeland system integrating thereby the foraging movements and feeding metabolism of domesticated animals based on data from the mahafaly plateau a region in southwestern madagascar we extended ramdry to assess the local effects of future changes in precipitation and its variation as well as its temporal distribution on free ranging zebu cattle bos indicus based livestock production in an african rangeland to account for the necessary fine temporal resolution of the analysis the original climate sub module of ramdry has been modified and re validated using the updated model we aimed in particular at analyzing the impact of the application of sequences of individual daily rain events on rangeland livestock systems effects of daily precipitation and the consequent intermissions of the vegetation growth season on the modeled systems were then compared with the outcomes from continuous seasonal growth periods based on monthly precipitation sums we thereby hypothesized that i the predicted reduction in precipitation amount and higher temporal variation in precipitation result in a general reduction of livestock productivity ii interrupted growth seasons due to prolonged mid seasonal dry spells lead to significant reduction in available green and dry forage biomass and thereby also in livestock productivity finally based on the model findings we assessed the predictability of effects of altered rainfall distribution on anpp of semi arid rangelands and free ranging livestock production systems and the model s suitability as a climate based rangeland and grazing management tool to foster food security of livestock keepers in marginal semi arid environments in the tropics and subtropics 2 materials and methods 2 1 agent based rangeland model ramdry the agent based model ramdry represents a spatially explicit rangeland model simulating the dynamics of pasture vegetation and its utilization by domestic herbivores within a highly heterogeneous semi arid environment a detailed description of the general processes simulated in ramdry can be found in fust and schlecht 2018 the model integrates detailed metabolic processes of domesticated ruminants focusing on energy costs and gains as a result of herd movements in search and by the digestion of forage resources furthermore it specifically incorporates seasonal dynamics in both forage quantity and quality in terms of feed digestibility and availability and relates these factors to climatic conditions as such ramdry allows studying the consequences of spatio temporal variability in resource availability and quality as a result of climatic dynamics on rangeland utilization it simulates the growth or maturation of grass biomass in daily steps over several years in an area composed of a grid of 111 111 square cells as a response to seasonal growth conditions based on predicted precipitation mobile agents representing foraging herds of zebu cattle are simulated to roam through this area gain energy by feeding on the available resource and loose metabolic energy for maintaining metabolic functions and movements thereby they respond to the changing rangeland condition by losing or gaining body weight and by an according reproduction rate resulting in an incessant adjustment of the livestock system productivity 2 2 study area the region from which data has been used for the study is located in the southwestern corner of madagascar this region is characterized by semi arid steppe climate with an annual mean temperature of 24 c 500 mm of annual precipitation and a dry season usually lasting from march to october the area of the simulation includes the surrounding 100 km2 10 km x 10 km of the mahafaly village miarantsoa gps 23 837 s 44 106 e

scenarios of the ipcc and downscaled by the weather simulator marksim jones and thornton 2000 jones and thornton 2013 for the study area has been downloaded from the online marksim dssat weather file generator http gisweb ciat cgiar org marksimgcm for the model analysis ten replicates of data sets for the geographical center point of the model area 23 823566 s 44 102424 e for the period 2010 2035 have been generated using the average of polynomial functions of 17 currently available gcms supplementary tab s1 and applying the scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 the marksim dssat data sets have subsequently been processed and consolidated per scenario and replication into individual csv comma separated values files for each rcp scenario by the software package r version 3 2 0 r core team 2015 for later analysis and import in the agent based model the selection of the replicates for the individual years was performed randomly the final data sets of climate variables included daily values of minimum air temperature maximum air temperature and precipitation amount climatic data for model calibration has been collected by an automatic data logging weather station in the study area between 18th august 2012 and 31st october 2015 hanisch et al 2015 the recorded fine resolution rain amounts have been totaled up to daily sums for subsequent analysis 2 4 climate module the initial climate evaluation model within ramdry calculated start and end of the growing season based on fortnightly sums of rainfall despite its good correlation with recorded weather data for the region fust and schlecht 2018 the model was poorly adapted to assess effects of rainfall intensity and mid seasonal dry spells could not be reliably identified and handled as a result of its averaging summing algorithm a review of the available climate evaluation models for semi arid rangeland and grazing management revealed that fine scale links between climatic variables and primary productivity often require profound knowledge about the hydrological processes and soil properties to reliably predict growth affecting parameters such as soil moisture e g coughenour 1994 jouven et al 2006 richardson and hahn 2007 johnson 2008 graux et al 2011 however a few more conceptual modeling approaches have been developed and used to directly investigate plant response to rainfall events based on the pulse reserve hypothesis noy meir 1973 or the threshold delay model ogle and reynolds 2004 these concepts allow the prediction of plant growth in water limited ecosystems as a result of rainfall pulses without need for detailed information about the soil and hydrological pathways li et al 2013 due to the lack of information on soil for our study area we adapted an elementary phenomenological model that had been developed to predict productivity of semi arid grassland from daily rainfall hermance et al 2015 this simple four parameter coupled reservoir model relies conceptually on a two stage cascaded linear reservoir i e the sequential flow through two leaky buckets fig 2 the two stages thereby simulate a the pulse like entry of rain water into the soil and its distribution as soil moisture and b the uptake of water by plant roots and short term biomass development in compliance with the threshold delay model of ogle and reynolds 2004 we assessed on a daily basis the output of the coupled reservoir model in terms of minimum thresholds that would stimulate a plant growth response in contrast to the original coupled reservoir model we defined parameter values for the time constants of the two stages individually allowing thereby independently adjustable time delays in the response for the soil t1 for 1st stage and the plant related t2 for 2nd stage section equations i and ii show the resulting definitions of the outflows from the first and second stages respectively i q 1 out t Œ¥ v t 1 e t t 1 where Œ¥v is the impulse input and t1 the time delay of stage 1 ii q 2 out t c 1 t q 1 out t x t 2 e t x t 2 dx where c is a scale factor and t2 the time delay of stage 2 to consider effects of intra seasonal gradients e g temperature on growth we furthermore applied time dependency on these parameters as suggested by the refined coupled reservoir model of hermance et al 2015 table 1 shows the full list of parameters of the model while the detailed mathematical description of the model is found in the appendix a1 2 5 parametrization to find the best fitting values of the parameters describing the refined coupled reservoir model we utilized the collected precipitation data of the weather station and compared the simulated output of the coupled reservoir model in terms of growth period timing length and interruptions with time series of estimated productivity of primary vegetation derived from satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to ensure a temporal high resolution assessment of the timing of growth relevant precipitation events a combination of satellite data with different temporal and spatial resolutions has been utilized daily mod09gq 8 day composites mod09q1 and 16 day composites mod13q1 of data sets of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis instrument were downloaded from the archives of the u s geological survey usgs https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov molt for the location of an ungrazed reference plot in the study area gps coordinates 23 852 s 44 124 e and in case of the surface reflectance products processed to ndvi time series onset and cessation of vegetation growth between october 2012 and june 2015 were identified visually from these time series fig 3 table 2 using 1000 randomly created sets of model parameters the best fitting parameter combination was evaluated by calculating the minimal sum of differences between the vegetation growth dynamics derived from ndvi and calculated by the coupled reservoir model the best fitting combination of parameters table 3 resulted in a summed up deviation of 35 days from the ndvi based dynamics for the assessed period of three growth periods fig 4 2 6 data set selection all ipcc marksim data sets were assessed in terms of yearly total precipitation and its variation for the three growth seasons between 2012 and 2015 table 4 the differences between the individual scenarios were minor leading to yearly precipitation sums of 516 559 mm and cvs coefficients of variance between 24 and 40 as suspected comparison with weather station data for the period 2012 2015 revealed a then higher average yearly rainfall amount of 567 mm and a lower variation of 22 for further analysis the modeled data set which corresponded best to the average of all the rcp scenarios was selected therefore all further simulations were conducted using the data set of the first replicate n 1 of rcp 6 0 that is characterized by an average yearly precipitation of 529 mm and a variation of 22 2 7 ramdry modifications the original model ramdry fust and schlecht 2018 has been modified to integrate the new refined climate module and its effects prediction on vegetation growth or maturation is made on a day by day basis instead of the pre analysis of the start and duration of the subsequent continuous growth period at the end of each growth season on top of the obvious adaptations in the model process climate and season see fig 3 and section 2 3 in fust and schlecht 2018 we furthermore adjusted the original model s dynamics of forage digestibility this adjustment was made to account for effects of possible multiple growth interruptions per season on the quality of forage resources in terms of biomass digestibility as in the original version of ramdry the digestibilities of fresh forage resources had been reset to maximum values at each beginning of a rain period the new version of the model calculates daily an averaged digestibility of forage biomass for each spatial cell based on the current amount and respective digestibility of the already existent and the potentially new re grown green biomass according to equation iii iii digestibilit y new biomas s old digestibilit y old biomas s freshly grown digestibilit y max biomas s old biomas s freshly grown as the green biomass at the end of the dry season i e the first term in equation 3 is supposed to equal zero the resulting digestibility of green biomass at the beginning of the rainy season is maximal in correspondence with the original version of the model the explanation of all changes applied to the original model is found in appendix a2 while appendix a3 shows the updated model code as implemented in netlogo version 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 2 8 model analysis and statistics based on the measured climate data set 1 from weather station and the rcp data set data set 2 we first assessed the effect of reduced precipitation and its higher variation on the livestock production system applying a scenario of continuous growth periods to this end the grazing intensity related breakdowns of the modeled system due to the over exploitation of foraging resources described by its tipping points were calculated for both input data sets following the principle described by fust and schlecht 2018 in multiple simulation runs with varying initial values for herd sizes i e the number of cattle in one herd and herd numbers total number of cattle herds in the model area all of same size initially the influence of foraging intensity on long term system productivity has been assessed by comparing the initial sum of weights of all animals to the weight sum at the end of the simulation to exclude here the potential influence of the temporal distribution of rain and possible mid seasonal dry spells the total annual numbers of growth days have been calculated and translated into continuous growth periods due to the restricted availability of actual weather data simulations based on real data were run for the time period between 2012 and 2015 while model analysis based on predicted precipitation data covered the period between 2012 and 2023 thereby and during all further analyses that focused on impacts of climate changes on the herd productivity the number of animals per herd was limited to an initial herd size of maximum 75 animals in order to minimize the potential influence of excessive grazing pressure over the study period as a result of reproduction caused herd size growth age structure and sex ratio in the herd has been kept constant throughout the simulation runs and the initial body weight of an adult female animal was set at 210 kg based on output of the updated climate module and the chosen rcp climate data set total yearly sums of growth days were analyzed regarding their direct correlation with total yearly precipitation thereby applying linear correlation models to test the effects of intra seasonal interruptions of growth periods for the rcp climate data set as compared to results based on continuous growth period approaches system responses were assessed in a stepwise manner starting with the impact on growth periods and biomass built up of herbaceous vegetation followed by a closer analysis of the link to livestock production all reflections concerning plant biomass are based on dry matter in order to permit direct comparison between forage biomass and necromass first the temporal availability of forage biomass and of necromass for both cases were contrasted to include the two aspects namely temporal biomass availability and the respective amount in further analysis annual time integrals of forage biomass from the start of the growth season until the end of the following dry season were calculated as proxy for feed resource availability statistical comparison between the two growth scenarios were thereby based on paired t tests in order to assess the predictability of primary production based on precipitation data the yearly integrals of biomass were analyzed for correlation with the number of growth days using a linear regression approach the additional impact of intra seasonal dry spells on the quality of the available forage resources has furthermore been assessed by multiplying the adjusted digestibilities with the according green biomass and integrating the sum of those products over the same annual period secondly the dynamics of the sum of body weights of all animals in the system were compared between the two growth cases to reduce the risk of effects of over utilization in this analysis simulations were run at low grazing intensity based on 375 animals i e 5 herds of 75 animals each because of the stochastic nature of processes involved in the modeled grazing behavior which results in experimental error variance analyses were based on averaged results of ten repeated simulations as suggested by fust and schlecht 2018 weight gain and loss of the animals during the rainy and dry season respectively as a result of changes in forage availability in terms of quantity and quality was assessed yearly by calculating the difference between the weight of all animals at the last day of the dry season and their respective annual maximal weight these yearly differences were subsequently tested for correlation with data from yearly integrals of available biomass and necromass using linear regression models similarly the yearly weight changes were compared with the numbers of growth days per year as a direct proxy for the available forage biomass in doing so the level of predictability of herd productivity from climatic data was assessed all statistical analyses were performed in the software package r version 3 2 0 r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 general effects of predicted climate in terms of reduced total amount and higher inter annual variation in precipitation the predicted climate conditions according to the selected ipcc marksim dataset data set n 1 of rcp scenario 6 0 resulted in an average annual precipitation sum of 520 mm for the analyzed period 2012 23 fig 5 shows a comparison of the measured and simulated frequencies of rainfall events for different rainfall size classes according to the new climate module in ramdry the resulting average annual length of the growth season is 95 days with a corresponding variation of 23 8 yearly precipitation ranged from 355 779 mm table 5 the time series of yearly precipitation sums and their corresponding yearly lengths of the growth seasons indicate a series of two consecutive years of particularly low annual precipitation and growth length in 2015 16 and 2016 17 as comparison applying the model on measured rain data for the period 2012 15 resulted in an average annual sum of 81 growth days and a corresponding variation of 13 3 the impact of increasing grazing pressure on the system for continuous growth seasons under the predicted climate regime according to rcp scenario 6 0 as well as under current climatic conditions as recorded between 2012 and 2015 is shown in fig 6 displaying the tipping point curves of total livestock production under the predicted climate the system reaches its peak production level at a grazing intensity exerted by 1950 zebus 26 herds of 75 animals each equal to an initial total body weight of 334 490 kg equivalent to a grassland carrying capacity of 3 9 ha animal above which over utilization results in the collapse of the system in comparison despite the higher mean precipitation and lower variability in the recorded rain data the resulting shorter growth period lengths of 90 69 and 84 days effected a peak production level at the grazing pressure of 1875 animals 25 herds of 75 animals each equivalent to a grassland carrying capacity of 4 1 ha animal slightly lower than for the predicted scenario the absolute maxima of the end sum of herd weights are thereby less important as they are primarily influenced by the quality of the last growth season s in terms of number of consecutive growth days not primarily by the whole simulation period results of linear models indicated that yearly sums of rainfall amount correlated with the yearly sum of the resulting growth days for the period 2012 23 adjusted r2 0 65 p 0 002 n 11 as well as for the period 2023 32 adjusted r2 0 68 p 0 004 n 9 when considering only rainfall events bigger than 4 8 mm linear regression analysis on the annual numbers of rainy days and growth days for the period 2012 23 indicate even higher correlation adjusted r2 0 757 n 11 p 0 001 as fig 7 displays values of the two periods exhibit a good overlap and relatively good fit at total rainfall amounts below 500 mm while scattering is more pronounced at increased rainfall sums it furthermore shows an even enhanced goodness of fit with linear log models adjusted r2 0 70 p 0 002 n 11 and adjusted r2 0 81 p 0 001 n 9 for periods 2012 23 and 2023 32 respectively which makes also more sense from an ecological point of view constraining as such the number of growth days at very high precipitation amount 3 2 herbaceous vegetation response to interrupted growth seasons the growth seasons resulting from the rcp data set consisted of multiple short periods of growth that were frequently separated by short intra seasonal dry spells fig 8 the average length of the individual bouts of continuous growth was thereby 27 days cv 106 min 2 days max 122 days n 35 detailed growth period related data can be found in appendix a4 during the eleven modeled growth seasons between summer 2012 and summer 2023 the number of intra seasonal interruptions was on average 2 36 min 1 max 6 with lengths between 1 and 66 days mean 22 9 days cv 81 n 26 the resulting total annual length of the theoretical growth seasons measured from start of the first growth day until the last day of the last growth bout accumulated at levels between 96 and 246 days mean 149 2 days cv 31 n 11 the percentage of growth days per growth season which we defined as inverse index for temporal fragmentation of the growth season ranged from 36 season 2020 21 to 86 season 2019 20 table 6 the seasonal dynamics of biomass availability in terms of dry matter of green and dry forage in the modeled system is shown in fig 9 it displays the results for the two cases considering continuous as well as interrupted growth periods as a result of daily rainfall dynamics the timing of the continuous growth has thereby been evaluated for best temporal synchronization with the interrupted growth based on the temporal distribution of its individual growth days throughout the season while the total annual number of growth days within the years was equal in both cases distinct differences in the amount of available green biomass and necromass at a given point in time were recognizable prolonged interruptions in growth could easily be identified from the growth dynamics of green biomass as the corresponding resulting peak biomass levels were often considerably lower in comparison with the regime based on continuous growth periods e g during the growth season 2020 21 the peak values of green biomass at un interrupted growth were on average 42 higher however a more detailed comparison revealed a less clear pattern as certain prolonged interruptions had only minor effects on peak biomass values such as in the case of the growth season 2021 22 when a growth discontinuity of 30 days separated the total growth period into two bouts of 25 and 82 days which resulted in a decrease of the peak biomass value of only 7 5 furthermore the duration of the time periods during which the amount of available green biomass was considerably high was often not influenced by any intra seasonal growth interruptions as exemplified by the growth periods of 2017 18 or 2018 19 unsurprisingly the annual integrals of available green biomass in the interrupted growth scenario were on average 25 lower than in the un interrupted scenario min 2 max 45 n 11 p 0 001 total annual precipitation amount and total annual sum of growth days proved reliable predictors for annual time integrals of available green forage biomass for the simulated period 2012 23 assuming continuous growth periods without interruptions annual sums of rainfall and total days of growth were both statistically significantly correlated with the annual integrals of green biomass showing adjusted determination coefficients r2 of 0 66 p 0 002 n 11 and 0 97 p 0 001 n 11 respectively likewise in the case of interrupted growth the linear regression model of annual rain and integrated green forage biomass indicated a statistically significant though lower level of fit adjusted r2 0 61 p 0 003 n 11 similarly the number of growth days per year predicted much better the corresponding annual integral of green biomass leading to an adjusted determination coefficient of r2 0 91 p 0 001 n 11 considering additionally the level of growth interruption in terms of the beforehand calculated temporal fragmentation index in the regression analysis significantly improved the goodness of fit of the linear model further adjusted r2 0 97 p 0 001 n 11 results of the regression analysis indicated that the fragmentation index t value 4 93 table 7 was able to explain further 24 of the variation in the annual integral of green biomass in comparison to the annual sum of growth days t value 15 38 as such annual integrals of green biomass could be predicted most reliably by the total number of growth days and their respective indices of temporal fragmentation the results for necromass availability in terms of time integrals between annual minima were similar to the ones for green biomass leading to 21 less necromass available on average in the interrupted growth scenario min 5 max 49 n 11 p 0 001 in line with the findings for green biomass necromass availability could best be predicted by the annual sum of growth days alone in the case of un interrupted growth adjusted r2 0 98 p 0 001 n 11 and in case of interrupted growth by the combination of this parameter with the temporal fragmentation index adjusted r2 0 98 p 0 001 n 11 omitting the fragmentation index in the regression model resulted in a reduction of around 10 in prediction accuracy adjusted r2 0 89 p 0 001 n 11 annual integrals of the product of daily values for digestibility and available green biomass differed between the two growth scenarios continuous growth periods resulted in 17 higher values on average compared to their interrupted growth equivalents n 10 p 0 01 3 3 livestock productivity response to interrupted growth seasons total sum of body weight of all animals exhibited clear seasonal fluctuations while absolute values in case of interrupted growth were consistently lower mean 5 min 0 max 10 n 3650 p 0 001 compared to the un interrupted scenario fig 10 changes in the difference of the values between the two cases proved strongest within the periods 2012 13 2016 17 and 2020 21 when effects of high levels of growth period fragmentation and prolonged below average rainfall resulted in increased weight losses among the herds most remarkable was the modeled rainy season 2020 21 when a dry spell interrupted the vegetation growth during 45 days with most significant effect on herd weights resulting in only minor seasonal weight gain seasonal herd weight gains in terms of weight at the start of the growth season and the subsequent maximum seasonal peak weight were on average 861 kg higher for un interrupted growth periods although not statistically significant p 0 13 according to the conducted paired t test the difference was particularly pronounced in the years of low total rainfall similarly seasonal weight losses during the dry period i e difference between maximum peak weight and weight at the start of the subsequent growing season relative to the maximum weight were higher in the un interrupted scenario though statistically not significant paired t test p 0 12 in sum annual changes and fluctuations in total herd weight were comparable in the two cases though livestock production occurred on a significantly reduced general level if high resolution climate influences resulting in occasional intra seasonal dry spells and interruption in biomass growth were considered seasonal weight gains of all herds correlated well with the annual integral of the product of green biomass and its digestibilities best fit of the linear model was reached by considering values of two subsequent years i e the current and the preceding year n 9 adjusted r2 0 89 p 0 001 table 8 for the analysis of dry season weight losses the value for the first year has been neglected because of the direct influence of the arbitrary start weight i e unrelated to the simulated precipitation and as such to the available vegetation biomass on the first maximum weight value excluding the first year dry season weight losses were best predicted by the combination of annual maximum weight and the product of green biomass and its digestibilities adjusted r2 0 73 p 0 008 n 9 annual weight changes between subsequent onsets of the rainy season i e annual weight losses correlated also very well with the annual time integral of the products of green biomass and its digestibilities in accordance with the results for seasonal weight changes best predictions were made when using the values of the preceding and current year adjusted r2 0 91 p 0 001 n 9 table 9 the number of total growth days per year predicted annual weight changes also significantly well though less accurately than biomass and digestibility in line with the findings for these parameters the combination of growth days of the current and the preceding year yielded a good fit for the linear model 83 of the variation in annual weight change could be explained by applying only this single climatic parameter n 9 p 0 002 table 10 underlining as such its suitability as reliable predictor 4 discussion results from our study provide important insights into the impact of mid seasonal dry spells during periods of vegetation growth on herbaceous above ground biomass forage availability and thereby livestock production in semi arid rangelands in response to requests and suggestions of the scientific community tietjen and jeltsch 2007 thornton et al 2009a we developed and applied a spatially explicit agent based modeling approach and an elementary climate based vegetation growth model to assess the largely neglected impact of intra annual precipitation variability in a semi arid grazing system thereby we have been able to separately assess the implications of effects of simulated climate change in south western madagascar for rangeland ecosystems in terms of overall reduction of total annual precipitation in combination with higher inter annual variation and increased temporal diffusion of singular rain events as such our results highlight that a good accuracy of predictions of local effects of future climatic changes on these ecological systems can only be ensured by the sound and quantitative understanding of these dynamic processes allowing in consequence the sustainable use of their natural resources contrary to our expectations the model results for the anticipated reduction in total precipitation and increased inter annual variation indicated no aggravation of the general situation for livestock keepers in terms of system productivity under maximum stocking supposedly partly as an effect of the high level of resilience of vegetation in semi arid ecosystems as indicated by other studies shafran nathan et al 2013 taking the increased temporal diffusion of precipitation events into account resulting per se in a significant fragmentation of the growth periods we were able to identify a remarkable reduction in available green and dry herbaceous biomass as expected body weights of livestock kept under such conditions were consistently lower compared to the cases of growth seasons of similar lengths without intra seasonal dry spells even though seasonal changes in body weight proved comparable despite the high complexity of interactive processes involved the level of predictability of effects of precipitation changes within the studied parameter range on primary vegetation and secondary livestock production was high based on annual rainfall sums which correlated well with the number of growth days per year and the ratio of growth days per growth season fragmentation index the time integrated amount of herbaceous green biomass and necromass could be well predicted while significant correlation of herbaceous biomass and digestibility with seasonal body weight changes of livestock was expected the model exhibited furthermore surprisingly good results in the prediction of livestock weight changes by annual precipitation sums and yearly sums of growth days respectively this result emphasizes the capabilities of the modified version of ramdry as a climate based rangeland and grazing management tool in marginal semi arid environments in the tropics and subtropics the precipitation based phenomenological model of primary productivity founded on the concept of cascaded linear reservoirs hermance et al 2015 has proved specifically suitable to describe vegetation dynamics in water limited semi arid grasslands yet despite its broad recognition in hydrology e g gatot et al 2001 sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 this model concept has rarely been implemented in ecological studies so far hermance et al 2016 supposedly due to its simplifying mechanistic approach conjoining many details of soil properties plant physiology and hydrology the increase in its complexity by the implementation of individual dynamics of the two reservoir modeling parameters allowed to simulate phenophase dependent processes and thereby increase model prediction accuracy as the climate growth model is not considering any intrinsic effect of temperature seasonal gradients of temperature influenced rates of eco physiological processes can be simulated through these seasonal adaptations of model parameters the decrease of air temperature in the study area towards the end of the growth season data not shown results in a lower evaporation rate and potentially an increase in foliage surface it furthermore has the potential of increasing the average soil moisture and thereby shortening the response time of plants to precipitation pulses the observed reduction of the response time for the primary stage of the two reservoir model representing the infiltration of rain water into the soil and its distribution as soil moisture throughout the growth season from 11 t1sos to 2 t1eos days agrees with results of other studies indicating temporal variation in delayed responses to rainfall e g schwinning and sala 2004 as the response time variable of a reservoir determines the dynamics of the outflow i e the outflow is influenced by the inverse of the time variable higher values correspond to lower outflows per time lower inflows to the next stage consequently and a slower flow through the stage as such in the case of the response time t1 the observed gradient which resulted in best model fit represents a slower effect of rain pulses on growth effective soil moisture at the beginning of the growth season as compared to the end of the rainy season as many biological processes involved in plant growth have not been modeled explicitly the observed seasonal variation might not only represent the alteration in soil moisture as a result of water input but also a change in soil microbial activity in soils with very low physiological activity due to prolonged lack of soil moisture the reactivation of microbial processes after a drought period has proved to significantly influence the stimulation of autotrophic activity in the soil huxman et al 2004b in contrast the low temporal change of the response time variable of the second stage of the cascaded reservoir model stands for a nearly constant delay between soil moisture increase and resulting plant growth underlining thereby the need for separate variable gradients for the individual stages while biomass build up might instinctively seem a more important effort for plants in early phenological state as compared to mature plants the results of our coupled reservoir model don t display such a potential trait as it favored a seasonal dependence only in the first stage depicting somewhat the limits of implicit mimicry by the simplified approach depending on the duration of pre rain dryness total lags from rain pulse to maximum productivity in the range of 4 14 days and 4 10 days have been recorded in african savanna williams et al 2009 and in the inner mongolian plateau fan et al 2016 respectively confirming as such the range of time response variables evaluated in our model the reliable prediction of vegetation phenological characteristics by satellite derived metrics has been demonstrated in several studies e g vrieling et al 2018 watson et al 2019 research on different types of grasslands in particular reported the potential of accurate identification of onset and end of greenness and time of maximum photosynthesis by time series of normalized difference vegetation index data liu et al 2017 cui et al 2019 which justified its application in our study validation of the climate growth model parameters based on remote sensed data time series indicated a relatively high average residual of more than 10 days per year suggesting as such a general low prediction accuracy of the model in view of the variable temporal resolution of the available satellite data of up to 16 days and the accumulative effect of deferred predicted growth periods by contributing double to the residuals despite potentially correct growth lengths the accuracy of the model appears sufficient to our needs though probably not particularly suited for applications requesting fine temporal resolution a variety of weather generating algorithms have been developed and utilized for climate prediction in areas with limited or lack of observed data the accuracy of the simulated climatic data has proved variable depending on the models regional specifics and the output requested e g mzirai et al 2005 kahimba et al 2014 although the marksim weather generator integrated in dssat which was used in our model to generate the daily precipitation and temperature data has been widely applied in studies on climate change e g thornton et al 2009b sinclair et al 2014 rao et al 2015 and seems to perform acceptably under certain conditions e g in unimodal climatic areas its variable accuracy particularly in predicting precipitation has been criticized trotochaud et al 2016 specific validation of the predicted climate data has not been performed explicitly within this study however kahimba et al 2014 identified the marksim weather generator to partly overestimate the occurrence probability and length of dry spells in the context of bimodal climate areas while giving fairly good estimates of total annual rain amounts they therefore recommended the use of the giovanni weather generator of the goddard earth science data and information services centre acker and leptoukh 2007 for their application and a future assessment of the adaptability of these two weather generators or available field observed climate data to our application might be advisable comparison of current and predicted future climate conditions based on ipcc marksim dssat data consistently showed a decrease in total annual rain amount in combination with an increase in its inter annual variation as predicted by other authors for the area of the study region e g thornton et al 2007 feng et al 2013 while the decrease in annual rainfall was only in the range of 10 the increase in climatic variability was much more significant aligning as such with other studies herrero et al 2016 despite this apparent worsening scenario our updated climate module yielded for climate data of rcp 6 0 a substantial increase in total number and inter annual variation of growth days per year as compared to current values which is in contradiction to other predictions that indicate a decrease in growth length of 20 until 2050 thornton et al 2006 thornton et al 2011 besides the obvious difference in study period length which we restricted in our study to 10 years 2012 23 a reason for this contradiction may also lie in the differing definitions of growth days which relies in thornton s study on averaged conditions for soil water holding capacity of 100 mm and a fix threshold of 0 5 for the actual to potential evapotranspiration ratio in contrary decision on growth no growth was based in our study on empirically ascertained model threshold values the results of our study suggest the assumption that future climate as predicted by the rcp and marksim for the study area would be characterized by more growth relevant days relying on small rain events each a similar increasing trend in the rainfall event frequency with decreasing rainfall size has been observed in other arid and semi arid regions rainy days with daily rain amounts below 5 mm are with 67 7 of all the cases most frequent in our study data set comparable to the frequencies measured on typical steppe on the inner mongolian plateau fan et al 2016 despite the high frequency of occurrence of such small rain events fan and colleagues found that small size rainfall pulses alone contributed only marginally to changes in primary productivity as measured by ndvi and studies therefore frequently excluded rain events below 5 mm from their analysis e g williams et al 2009 nevertheless we argue that even if the effects of these small rain pulses might hardly be measurable in anpp change depending on their occurrence they nevertheless contribute to the ecological processes that indirectly affect vegetation growth in grasslands e g in terms of wetting soil surfaces as described by fan et al 2016 elevated numbers of growth relevant days as found in our study might therefore be caused by such differences in approach considering either only major pulses or all accumulative effects as in our model the increased correlation of the annual numbers of rainy days and growth days by omitting small 4 8 mm day rainfall events confirms findings of studies relying on non accumulative single event based approaches e g sala and lauenroth 1982 li et al 2013 our results of system collapse analysis based on continuous growth seasons indicated that despite the higher mean precipitation and lower variability in the recorded current rain data as compared to the predicted climatic scenario the production system withstood comparable maximum pressure before collapsing close investigation revealed that the two compared time series data sets had similar values for minimum annual growth length 69 days between 2013 and 14 as measured 65 days between 2015 and 16 in the predicted scenario in agreement with the non equilibrium persistent rangeland model briske et al 2017 these lean periods describe in general the temporal bottleneck in resource availability and system breakdown under comparable pressure seems obvious as such we emphasize that studies on sustainability of maximal productivity of livestock should primarily focus on lean periods however we furthermore accentuate the importance of time series analysis detailed investigation of simulation periods with different sequences of years with growth lengths of similar average total precipitation and precipitation variability showed that the conditions for system collapse furthermore rely on constrains during consecutive years data not shown in contradiction to our first hypothesis on the effect of lowered annual rainfall and higher inter annual variation results of our study revealed a general higher system productivity under the predicted climate scenario based on the common approach of continuous or often undefined structure of growth periods of specified annual lengths as such we agree with the findings of other researchers e g nippert et al 2006 heisler white et al 2008 shafran nathan et al 2013 and emphasize that conclusions on livestock ecosystem production performance based on general climate parameters such as annual precipitation and or precipitation variation can be highly misleading in turn our findings confirm our hypothesis on the importance of the consideration of temporal distribution of single rain events and the resulting growth periods in productivity and sustainability analyses in particular regarding the increased significance of mid seasonal dry spells the observed number of mid seasonal interruptions of the growth seasons under the predicted climate scenario was significant giving rise to an average of 2 36 discontinuities per year with an average length of almost 23 days while the utilized weather generator marksim is charged to be prone to over estimation of dry spell frequency kahimba et al 2014 we nevertheless stress the importance of consideration of this issue such intra annual amplification of the hydrological cycle driven by climatic changes has already been predicted and proved on a global scale and for southern africa in particular wilcox et al 2017 gherardi and sala 2019 godde et al 2020 ritter et al 2020 meng et al 2021 depending on the timing of such dry spells with regard to the vegetative phenophase the effect of varying water availability on plant growth has proved to be significant jia et al 2016 varying in its temporal significance furthermore by plant species craine et al 2012 although we did not explicitly simulate phenophases in function of different species but rather phenophase dependent herbaceous biomass growth rates we noted variable but significant decrease in available green as well as dry biomass at a time as a result of such interruptions as we realize from the simulated output of biomass dynamics prolonged growth breaks in the early phase of the growth season as particularly displayed in the period 2012 13 interruption length 28 days after 28 days of growth and 2021 22 interruption length 45 days after 49 days of growth resulted in major reduction of peak maximum green and dry biomass fig 9 however we acknowledge that the effect of dry spells on vegetation biomass availability depended on a combination of three parameters namely the timing within the growth period the length of the interruption as well as the total length of the growth season which we did not attempt to disentangle in this study experiments have indicated that infrequent big rain events lead to increased anpp as compared to frequent smaller sized events that lead to reduced plant production heisler white et al 2008 del grosso et al 2018 which would contradict our findings however it is notable that these experiments in general compared cases of different event sizes and frequency by keeping seasonal rainfall amount constant as such aligning approximately with our conditions while keeping also the total length of the growth season constant in our case however we found that due to the interruptions throughout the whole growth season the total length of the growth season was significantly increased to more than 150 days as such the effects of dry spells and growth interruptions became much more severe for the productivity of the ecosystem as growth effective rain events occurred much more sporadically unfortunately to our knowledge there is no comparable study analyzing the accumulative effect of stochastic rain pulses on sub tropical semi arid grassland vegetation and corresponding livestock production systems based on similar climate scenarios to validate the correctness and accuracy of our results studies on vegetation phenology in eastern africa however confirm in certain areas a trend towards elongated growing periods combined with lower precipitation amounts workie and debella 2018 as observed in our study such decreases in temporal primary productivity lead to a general decrease in productivity of livestock systems depending entirely on these resources as a logical consequence of the generally reduced biomass availability body weights of ruminant herbivores were lower in case of interrupted growth scenarios the effect of reduction in anpp on animal performance might thereby not only have been of direct causal nature but also related to increased energy expenditure of grazers for movement in search of sparser food and or the general reduction in quality of available resources as suggested by other studies craine et al 2012 rivera ferre et al 2016 fust and schlecht 2018 while we have not implemented changes in vegetation structure and species communities in our model as such digestibility dynamics of green biomass in combination with increased dependency of grazers on dried necromass resources led to a decrease in overall quality of the available forage in response to altered precipitation regimes the assessed scenario of low intensity grazing pressure resulted in an average decrease of animal body weight of 5 as a sole consequence of consideration of mid seasonal growth interruptions this general reduction in livestock productivity was equivalent to a decrease of 0 4 in body condition score bcs nrc 1996 in contrast to this general diminution of body weight our study indicated no significant difference in seasonal annual weight losses and gains in the wake of increased frequency of dry spells this at first glance surprising result might be an indicator for the system s resilient functioning in a comparable manner on a lower general level assured by continuously available forage resources in terms of above minimum levels of vegetation biomass comparison of grass biomass availability in the cases of interrupted and continuous growth seasons portends largely conformable lengths of periods with above minimum biomass fig 9a according to our findings mid seasonal dry spells and consequent temporal interruptions of vegetation growth have proved their significant role in predictions of sustainable grassland management in the semi arid sub tropics providing as such corroboration of our second hypothesis in accordance with other studies e g fynn and o connor 2000 peng et al 2013 total annual rain amount could only partly predict anpp in terms of peak green biomass r2 0 71 n 11 p 0 001 while the number of growth days per year increased prediction accuracy in both cases interrupted and continuous growth periods r2 0 82 and r2 0 89 respectively n 11 p 0 001 potential reasons for the significant level of unpredictable variability in anpp response to precipitation have been found e g in the size of individual rain events huxman et al 2004b parton et al 2012 effects of soil moisture on root activity knapp et al 2002 fay et al 2003 heisler white et al 2008 timing of rain events in view of vegetation phenophase huxman et al 2004a and local topographic heterogeneity hoover et al 2021 our prediction accuracy for peak green biomass considering mid seasonal dry spells however increased substantially by the integration of aspects of temporal distribution of growth phases explaining in combination with the number of growth days 92 of its variation data not shown with regard to the importance of continual availability of forage biomass and its quality for livestock production systems it was crucial that our model has been able to predict these aspects through average available forage biomass combined with its respective quality with utmost accuracy i e explaining 99 of its variation based on the total number of growth days and their temporal distribution this high level of correlation between feed resources and precipitation respectively the resulting vegetation growth laid the foundation of the good predictability of livestock productivity by precipitation based parameters in accordance with fynn and o connor 2000 we found that livestock productivity was not best predicted by actual peak green biomass but by including previous year s data underlining the importance of consideration of time series analysis for accurate production forecasting our results however also indicated that absolute values for animals body weights could barely be predicted directly neither by precipitation nor by forage resource parameters r2 0 56 data not shown underlining the complexity of the system and the importance of knowledge of precedent conditions nevertheless results of our model indicated that changes in livestock productivity under future climate conditions can be predicted with good accuracy allowing as such easy monitoring with simple measurements e g rain amount at daily resolution that can be conducted in the field involving only minor investment although the updated version of our rangeland model ramdry has been able to simulate effects of climate change on semi arid rangelands and the associated livestock production the abstraction of natural processes in the model implies limitations in its capabilities the already mentioned lack of implementation of vegetation structure and species communities limits the prediction abilities of combined long term effects of over grazing and increased climate variability as such land cover conversion as a result of encroachment of shrubs as well as changes in the ratio of annual to perennial plant species cannot be assessed in the current model the lack of a simulated seed bank prevents an analysis of the impact of prolonged dry periods as debated by various authors e g kiss et al 2018 basto et al 2018 loydi and collins 2021 and of increased grazing pressure erfanzadeh et al 2020 gonzalez and ghermandi 2021 on plant communities the chosen study area located on a flat plateau facilitated the parametrization and validation of the model as specific topographic features were basically absent hence topography related effects of climate on vegetation such as the explicit separation of precipitation into runoff and infiltrated water as well as potential habitat degradation by soil erosion have not been a focus of our study and are therefore not represented in the model limiting its accuracy when transferred to topographically more structured regions due to a shortage in detailed data on air humidity and wind for the study area evapotranspiration could not be assessed and hence is not accounted for in ramdry despite being a major determinant of soil water content in particular in shallow soil layers the future implementation of additional management strategies such as the supply of additional feed and or crop residues to livestock in lean periods would furthermore increase the capabilities of ramdry as a tool for scenario evaluation given these current limitations of ramdry and their importance in rangeland ecology we encourage further developments on the model as well as its potential implementation in an integrated modeling framework with detailed vegetation and hydrologic models as proposed by roetter et al 2021 5 summary and conclusion the sustainable utilization and management of rangelands in semi arid regions of sub saharan africa is of major importance for the livelihood of people often living on marginal resources predicted future changes in climate threaten to increase pressure on these erratically available natural resources due to their decreased predictability and productivity the changes in precipitation amount variability and timing ask for particular attention as their combined impact on rangeland and livestock production can be detrimental but have rarely been assessed despite the partially simplistic approach of our model we were able to identify and quantify risks in prediction of effects of climatic changes which have not been taken into account so far our findings for the study area in southwestern madagascar indicate that decreased annual precipitation amount and the increase of its inter annual variability might change the behavior of the system under critical conditions only marginally while the alterations in timing of individual precipitation events could result in substantial temporal reduction of forage resources in terms of their quantity and quality thus the impact of consideration of temporal precipitation distribution and corresponding predicted climate conditions can be highly significant for analysis of climate changes in semi arid grazing systems the predicted climate suggests a prolongation of the vegetation growth period with increased risk of extended dry spells leading to mid seasonal growth interruptions our spatially explicit model includes important metabolic aspects of ruminants and integrates aspects of forage quality dynamics and energy expenditure of moving animals in search of limited feed supplies as a result of these highly dynamic conditions for vegetation growth the forecasted temporal pattern of precipitation distribution resulted in a significant reduction of available forage green biomass and necromass in general and thereby a worrying loss in livestock productivity our findings thus provide important insights on the impact of the temporal distribution of rainfall events as one important aspect of climatic changes on livestock production systems in sub tropical semi arid rangelands as such it might be useful for the development and ex ante assessment of suitable rangeland management strategies through public and private advisory

24446,ecological datasets often contain gaps outliers or even incorrect data ignoring the problem of missing data can lead to reduction in the statistical power of the models used estimation of biased parameters and incorrect conclusions about the phenomenon studied in this study using simulated and real ecological data seven year monitoring of offspring production in 239 white stork ciconia ciconia nests we show how results differ when ignoring missing data filling the gaps using single methods including fuzzy methods and using multiple imputation and aggregation techniques based on simulation data we showed that data gaps can be filled with high accuracy if the appropriate method model is used 96 5 of perfectly matched cases based on empirical data we showed how results can differ when accepting or filling the missing data these differences concerned both general indicators of breeding success e g total number of offspring mean annual productivity per nest differences in trends e g increase or decrease in productivity between years and more detailed analyses such as ranks of the most productive nests the observed differences in the results could lead to formulation of incorrect conclusions about the state of the stork population the condition of its habitat or conservation guidelines we highlight that well developed set of data imputation methods dedicated to monitoring the white stork could increase the accuracy of modern estimates and re analyse rich historical data similar data pre processing solutions to fill data gaps should also find wider application in other ecological research keywords ecological indicators missing data imputation strategies fuzzy method white stork breeding success 1 introduction the problem of missing values often concerns different types of datasets observational experimental or meta analytical the main reasons why an attribute value is missing are measurement error ignorance data corruption and equipment failure moussus et al 2010 raja et al 2020 nakagawa 2015 mentions that researchers often downplay the presence of missing data in their studies because it may be perceived as a weakness of their work for this reason data gaps are usually ignored or simply removed from analysis the most common method for handling missing data is list wise deletion in which cases or rows lists containing missing values are deleted and the statistical analysis is conducted using the dataset without missing values nakagawa 2015 in addition methods of list wise or pair wise deletion are often default procedures in commercial statistical software this method of handling missing data has two negative consequences it decreases input information e g reduction in statistical power of models used and may lead to estimation of biased parameters e g variance underestimation distribution distortion correlation depression luengo et al 2010 nakagawa and hauber 2011 onkelinx et al 2017a van buuren 2018 j√≥hannesson et al 2019 as a result incorrect conclusions about the studied phenomenon can be formulated the problems noted of the impact of missing data on analytical capabilities and the quality of the results obtained have resulted in the development of various pre processing methods to handle the missing values for simple gap filling single statistics such as the mean median or mode are usually calculated from the surrounding real data and used to fill the gaps nakagawa 2015 onkelinx et al 2017a however these single imputation methods sometimes complemented by clustering techniques do not deal with the missing values efficiently they solve the problem of maximising the input information but they do not always solve the problem of estimating uncertainty of the missing data nakagawa 2015 onkelinx et al 2017a 2017b van buuren 2018 raja et al 2020 one method for dealing with missing data uncertainty is fuzzy logic techniques e g fuzzy c means or fuzzy k means clustering e g li et al 2004 huang et al 2020 kiersztyn et al 2020 but they cannot fill in missing values with high accuracy even when the missing data represent less than 10 of the entire dataset luengo et al 2010 raja et al 2020 to increase the accuracy of filled gaps more advanced methods have been developed currently methods of multiple imputation originally developed by rubin 1987 1996 are gaining the greatest popularity among researchers from various fields and the number of applications of multiple imputation is growing exponentially van buuren 2018 missing data imputation techniques are also used in ecology but much less than in social or medical sciences van buuren 2018 even though ecological data by its nature often contain gaps outliers or even wrong data e g underhill and prys jones 1994 nakagawa and freckleton 2008 j√≥hannesson et al 2019 hallmann et al 2020 in ecological studies most data gaps are unfortunately ignored or removed or sometimes filled with single imputation methods nakagawa 2015 onkelinx et al 2017a of course the data collected for ecological research does not always contain gaps and a based on complete datasets are also published e g s√¶ther et al 2008 tryjanowski et al 2005b tryjanowski et al 2005a more research effort is needed to test the effectiveness of missing data imputation methods for different types of ecological data and popularize solving the problem of missing data or outliers other than by ignoring them j√≥hannesson et al 2019 see also the research discussion of onkelinx et al 2017a 2017b and bogaart et al 2017 ultimately models must be developed for each type of data because no imputation method performs best for all classifiers zhang et al 2012 the method used to fill in missing data may be of particular importance for calculating ecological indicators correct estimation of the parameters of a given ecological indicator influences inference about the subject of the indicator e g status of the environment process of interest the uncertainty in calculated indicators will decrease as the attention paid to pre processing of input data increases in this study using simulated and real ecological data for indicator species we show how results differ when ignoring missing data filling in the missing data using single methods including fuzzy methods and using multiple imputation techniques with aggregation of results we focus on empirical data on offspring production in a white stork ciconia ciconia population 7 year monitoring of 239 nests the white stork is widely regarded as an important indicator species because its occurrence and reproductive success reflect the biodiversity and naturalness of an area latus et al 2000 tob√≥≈Çka et al 2012 fasola matasaru et al 2018 kaminski et al 2020 we hypothesise that it is possible to find a method with a high accuracy of filling gaps 95 in datasets analysed and that one can obtain more correct inference about a studied phenomenon from the filled dataset than when ignoring missing data 2 methods 2 1 data origin study species and study area ornithologists frequently study the white stork because of its wide geographic range synanthropic nature periodicity of migration charismatic nature and positive perception and cultural embedding in local communities it leads an open non cryptic lifestyle and builds large and clearly visible nests often in or near human settlements many years of international interest in the white stork resulted in the development of a standard method for monitoring its population that allows for large scale comparisons over long time series profus 2006 tryjanowskiet al 2006 tob√≥≈Çka 2015 bialas et al 2020 one of the key elements monitored is stork s breeding success the number of young that fledge from the nest per year bairlein 1991 tob√≥≈Çka 2015 the main source of these data is regular monitoring performed directly at the nests nowakowski 2003 tucakov 2006 denac 2010 grishchenko and yablonovska grishchenko 2017 monitoring such large areas requires many observers and the assistance of amateur volunteers who usually have little field experience in bird research denac 2010 baltag et al 2009 tob√≥≈Çka 2015 as practice shows survey volunteers sometimes have considerable difficulty in determining the breeding success of white storks especially in difficult to observe nest locations the optimal solution is to climb to the nest or use a drone to inspect it directly but amateurs are not always able to do so kosicki 2010 therefore in monitoring reports nests with an unknown breeding success are quite often mentioned tucakov 2006 baltag et al 2009 denac 2010 grishchenko 2013 zbyryt et al 2014 it is also possible for nests not to be checked in a timely manner reports to be questioned and incorrect information to be obtained from an analytical viewpoint these situations are data gaps that can be filled using other verified data or data with other correlated covariates in this study we used field data on white stork breeding collected in south eastern poland in the foothills of the outer western carpathian mountains in mesoregions called pog√≥rze dynowskie and pog√≥rze przemyskie kondracki 2002 the study area covered ca 2 500 km2 the data were collected from 2014 2020 by professional ornithologists and amateurs the method of monitoring and describing stork reproduction was consistent with international standards used for this type of survey for many years sch√ºz 1952 jakubiec 1985 nowakowski 2003 mammeria et al 2019 in total complete or partial information on 239 white stork nests was collected 2 2 preparation of input data the original data were rearranged and changed only by replacing the symbols used in monitoring with quantitative ranks which showed real and potential impacts of the nest on the growth of the stork population i e whether the nest was occupied by the breeding pair and how many offspring were produced the following ranks were used a 5 4 3 2 1 and 0 the nest was occupied by a breeding pair of storks that produced a number of young storks that successfully left the nest equal to the value of the rank zero represented a breeding pair that occupied the nest throughout the season but laid no eggs b 0 5 a breeding pair occupied the nest but the eggs or young were lost for various reasons e g predation heavy storm human activity thus the nest had the potential to produce new individuals but was not successful in the given year c 0 5 non breeding individuals occasionally occupied the nest in the given year d 1 the nest was never occupied during the season e 2 a nest did not yet exist at this location or was destroyed in the given year 2 3 experimental data matrix and simulation data matrix the data collected for this study constituted the experimental data matrix edm which contained 239 rows individual stork nests and 7 columns years of monitoring 239 nests 7 years 1 673 records this matrix was filled with the ranks described previously and included 212 cases of missing data 12 7 we checked the randomness of missing data in the edm as suggested by nakagawa 2015 and confirmed that edm gaps were nearly random wald wolfowitz runs test Œ± 0 01 based on results of the edm a simulation data matrix sdm was developed to test the effectiveness of different methods of filling gaps all nests for which we had complete information from all 7 years i e 109 nests were used to create the sdm which thus contained 763 records 109 nests 7 years in the sdm missing data were simulated by randomly deleting 100 records so that it would have a similar percentage of missing data as the edm ca 13 the gaps generated in the sdm were then filled with a variety of methods and the imputed values rounded to the nearest 0 5 were compared to the known values that had been intentionally removed these activities and calculations with the sdm were repeated 20 times with new data gaps generated each time we analysed the sdm to assess the effectiveness of filling the gaps by each of the methods tested the following metrics were adopted to assess effectiveness 1 percentage of perfectly matched records 2 percentage of records with a small error in absolute rank i e 0 5 1 0 3 percentage of records with large errors in absolute rank 1 0 4 the mean and standard deviation of error for all records filled using a given method and 5 the minimum and maximum errors of the method the most effective method identified by this approach was then used as the benchmark for filling data gaps in the edm in which the true value of the existing data gaps was unknown after filling the data gaps in the edm we showed how results can differ when leaving gaps in the data or using a non optimally selected method of missing data imputation three indicators of monitored nests were used as metrics 1 productivity the total number of young storks produced per year 2 the mean number of offspring produced per nest per year and 3 the rank of the most productive nests i e the most important nests however when ranking the nests with the highest breeding success we found that calculating the total or mean number of offspring did not differentiate nests sufficiently to rank them for this reason additional index Œº k was calculated as i 2014 2020 x i k s k where x i k is the weighted breeding success for a given nest and s k is the standard deviation of x i k because the ranks were prepared mainly for practical reasons e g to prioritise conservation activities when calculating the index weights were used to increase the rank of breeding success in recent years values for 2020 were multiplied by 2 00 2019 by 1 75 2018 by 1 50 2017 by 1 25 and 2016 or earlier by 1 00 2 4 gap filling methods used data gaps were filled using nine single methods and four aggregation models a methods 1 arithmetic mean for a given year calculated from nests with known ranks i e arithmetic mean of the column for a given year 2 arithmetic mean for a particular nest from its known ranks from other years i e arithmetic mean of the row for a given nest 3 arithmetic mean for a given year from a cluster of nests clusters were calculated using the fuzzy c means clustering algorithm bezdek et al 1984 only the nests in the winning cluster were used to calculate the mean the winning cluster is one that the nest belongs to with the highest degree the sum of the degree of belongingness of the given nest to all clusters analysed was 1 4 arithmetic mean for the given year for a cluster combination the mean for each cluster was calculated the missing value in the data was then calculated as the mean for a given year of a given cluster x i multiplied by the degree to which the analysed nest belonged to the given cluster m i where i represents the cluster number x i 0 4 x i m i 5 increment of the annual mean calculated for the cluster relative increment calculated as x k x k 1 x k 1 first the annual mean of each cluster was calculated as the arithmetic mean of ranks of the year with the gap then the proportional change in the annual mean of each cluster Œ¥ck was determined the missing value in the data was then determined by multiplying the rank of the previous year by this proportional change plus one i e x k x k 1 1 Œ¥ c k where c k denotes the mean for a given cluster 6 two year arithmetic mean the missing value equals the mean of the values in the year preceding and following the year with no data 7 four year arithmetic mean the missing value equals the mean of the values in the two preceding years and two years following the year with no data 8 increment of the arithmetic mean calculated for all nests in the year preceding and following the year with no data the method is similar to method 5 except that the mean is calculated for all nests not for clusters in the year preceding and the year following the year with no data 9 increment of the median calculated for all nests for the year preceding and the year following the year with no data unlike method 8 medians are used instead of means b models 1 linear model with intercept Œ±0 in the form y Œ± 0 i 1 9 Œ± i m i where mi are

correctly overall 2 6 7 6 of filled data gaps had a large estimation error depending on the method used the maximum value of this error could be high even up to 7 i e rank 2 incorrectly predicted as 5 or vice versa table 1 after aggregating the results of single methods using models the imputation accuracy increased with 91 9 96 5 of missing data filled correctly the percentage of large errors 0 5 2 7 and their maximum value 4 also decreased model 4 gradient boosted trees model had the highest percentage of correctly filled missing data table 1 the mean errors of single methods were also larger than those of aggregation models model 4 also had the lowest error in estimated rank figure 1 3 2 results for the experimental data matrix for the edm we did not know the true values of the missing data therefore based on the analyses performed for the sdm we assumed that estimates of model 4 were the most reliable and this model was used as the benchmark for filling data gaps in the edm comparison of results showed that the edm with gaps estimated the productivity of the stork population over the 7 year period as 2 374 individuals single methods of completing the data estimated productivity of 2 453 2 788 individuals whereas the optimal model estimated productivity of 2 518 individuals i e 144 individuals 6 more than in the edm table 2 more detailed analysis of productivity in following years showed other differences table 2 for example based on the edm productivity of the white stork population was higher in 2020 than in 2019 but the filled dataset showed the opposite probably correct trend i e lower in 2020 than in 2019 the results also differed for the mean number of offspring produced per nest per year 2 35 individuals nest year based on the edm which is likely correct as the edm had a large sample size the optimal model however estimated only 2 19 individuals nest year figure 2 the results also differed when ranking nests with the highest breeding success fig 3 ranking nests based on the data with gaps rather than the imputed data may influence conclusions about the importance of a given nest the largest differences were observed when assigning a nest rank using mean index values when the assigned rank could differ by up to 61 4 discussion missing data is a common problem in statistical analysis and the problem of how to address data gaps is also important to ecological research underhill and prys jones 1994 nakagawa and freckleton 2008 j√≥hannesson et al 2019 as luengo et al 2010 state rates of missing data less than 1 are generally considered trivial 1 5 are manageable 5 15 require sophisticated methods to handle and more than 15 may have severe impacts on interpretations and decrease the accuracy of model results in this study we tested one such difficult situation because ca 13 of the data were missing our data also had no correlated covariates that would help estimate the values of missing data creating the sdm however helped find the best method among those tested and create a reliable reference point an optimal model which allowed us to assess the influence of leaving data gaps or filling them in on results and inferences the sdm clearly showed that using multiple data imputations but not sensu rubin 1987 and aggregating the results with a model is better than relying on a single gap filling method this is obvious because each of the single methods used enhances specific features of the data only by aggregating the features of single methods in a model can the single methods complement each other in our study however results of some simple models differed little from those of a single method e g method 2 vs model 1 or 2 table 1 fig 1 an optimal model i e model 4 estimated missing data much better than the best single method table 1 however the unsatisfactory results of fuzzy clustering e g method 3 were surprising many studies indicate that using fuzzy logic to fill in missing data is effective and useful raja et al 2020 huang et al 2020 kiersztyn et al 2020 our results show that the nature of the data and the number of clusters considered may be of great importance here and that an arithmetic mean may sometimes be more accurate than more sophisticated analyses e g method 2 vs method 3 table 1 the aim of our study however was not to test the effectiveness of methods using fuzzy sets theory but only to signal the potential to use them generally our simulations showed that for the data processed in this study it is possible to find a model that fills missing data with high accuracy and doing so before detailed statistical analysis is highly recommended the quantitative results support this claim the optimal model model 4 correctly filled 96 5 of the ca 13 of gaps in the edm and the errors in the 3 5 of the remaining gaps were probably small table 1 the optimal model thus decreased the percentage of incorrect data to 0 42 decreasing missing incorrect data from ca 13 to 0 42 shows the legitimacy of pre processing data to fill their gaps however that not all studies have obtained such good results even for much smaller percentages of missing data e g 3 9 of missing values in roja et al 2020 and that no single imputation method performs best for all classifiers zhang et al 2012 of course the argument for the need to pre process data is valid only if the results based on the original data with gaps differ from those based on the data with filled gaps and these differences lead to different conclusions for the data in this study differences in inference were possible for example the original data may have overestimated the mean offspring productivity of stork nests in the study area because the filled dataset indicated that it is lower the accuracy of estimates is important in the context of estimates of breeding success and inter population comparisons within the geographical range as it forms the basis for inferring the quality of the habitats occupied by this species and other conservation issues tryjanowski et al 2009a 2009b denac 2010 janiszewski et al 2014 vaitkuvienƒó and dagys 2015 fasola matasaru et al 2018 our calculations also indicate that based on the data with gaps conclusions about population trends could be incorrect data with gaps indicated that the studied population produced more offspring in 2020 than in 2019 while the filled data model 4 indicated that the downward trend since 2017 continued in 2020 which is more likely to be correct these examples show that clear differences even in general indicators can be seen between the data with gaps and the filled data however gap filling becomes more important when the objective is to conduct more detailed analyses or comparisons such as ranking nests by their productivity to identify the most important ones an incorrect estimate of the productivity rank may have specific theoretical and practical consequences such as erroneous conclusions about habitat quality around a given nest or suboptimal allocation of funds for conservation activities further research on pre processing of data on white stork reproduction would help expand the pool of gap filling methods and models and identify which ones are most effective models must be dedicated to a specific data type because there is no universal imputation method that performs best for all classifiers zhang et al 2012 developing an optimal method would allow further research on historical stork inventories because the white stork has been researched for over 100 years and the observation method has changed relatively little in that time this could be a unique opportunity to re examine pre existing data and perhaps better understand the long term dynamics of the white stork in many areas finally multiple imputation methods can also be used to address outliers data anomalies whose values may result from measurement errors these anomalies can be treated as a type of gap in datasets and filled with imputation methods hallmann et al 2020 used this approach successfully but for fewer records raja et al 2020 however point out that much less effort and progress have been made in processing uncertain information in datasets than on imputing missing data 5 conclusions data gaps are a common problem in ecological datasets this problem may be particularly important for analyses of indicator species because estimating metrics correctly influences correct inferences about the species based on simulation data we showed that gaps in monitoring data on the production of offspring in a white stork population can be successfully filled the data filled using an optimal model had high accuracy 96 5 of perfectly matched cases based on empirical data we showed that the way in which missing data are filled can influence the results obtained the differences observed concerned general indicators of population productivity i e total number of offspring mean productivity per nest differences in abundance trends i e increase or decrease in productivity between years and a detailed ranking of nest productivity the differences observed in the results could lead to incorrect conclusions about the dynamics of the population or the condition of the surrounding habitat and lead to improperly targeted conservation actions further research on developing optimal methods of filling gaps in data on the white stork population should be performed an optimally selected set of gap filling methods dedicated to white stork monitoring could increase the accuracy of modern estimates and provide the opportunity re analyse rich historical data see also wuczy≈Ñski et al 2021 similar pre processing methods to fill data gaps should also find wider application in other

24446,ecological datasets often contain gaps outliers or even incorrect data ignoring the problem of missing data can lead to reduction in the statistical power of the models used estimation of biased parameters and incorrect conclusions about the phenomenon studied in this study using simulated and real ecological data seven year monitoring of offspring production in 239 white stork ciconia ciconia nests we show how results differ when ignoring missing data filling the gaps using single methods including fuzzy methods and using multiple imputation and aggregation techniques based on simulation data we showed that data gaps can be filled with high accuracy if the appropriate method model is used 96 5 of perfectly matched cases based on empirical data we showed how results can differ when accepting or filling the missing data these differences concerned both general indicators of breeding success e g total number of offspring mean annual productivity per nest differences in trends e g increase or decrease in productivity between years and more detailed analyses such as ranks of the most productive nests the observed differences in the results could lead to formulation of incorrect conclusions about the state of the stork population the condition of its habitat or conservation guidelines we highlight that well developed set of data imputation methods dedicated to monitoring the white stork could increase the accuracy of modern estimates and re analyse rich historical data similar data pre processing solutions to fill data gaps should also find wider application in other ecological research keywords ecological indicators missing data imputation strategies fuzzy method white stork breeding success 1 introduction the problem of missing values often concerns different types of datasets observational experimental or meta analytical the main reasons why an attribute value is missing are measurement error ignorance data corruption and equipment failure moussus et al 2010 raja et al 2020 nakagawa 2015 mentions that researchers often downplay the presence of missing data in their studies because it may be perceived as a weakness of their work for this reason data gaps are usually ignored or simply removed from analysis the most common method for handling missing data is list wise deletion in which cases or rows lists containing missing values are deleted and the statistical analysis is conducted using the dataset without missing values nakagawa 2015 in addition methods of list wise or pair wise deletion are often default procedures in commercial statistical software this method of handling missing data has two negative consequences it decreases input information e g reduction in statistical power of models used and may lead to estimation of biased parameters e g variance underestimation distribution distortion correlation depression luengo et al 2010 nakagawa and hauber 2011 onkelinx et al 2017a van buuren 2018 j√≥hannesson et al 2019 as a result incorrect conclusions about the studied phenomenon can be formulated the problems noted of the impact of missing data on analytical capabilities and the quality of the results obtained have resulted in the development of various pre processing methods to handle the missing values for simple gap filling single statistics such as the mean median or mode are usually calculated from the surrounding real data and used to fill the gaps nakagawa 2015 onkelinx et al 2017a however these single imputation methods sometimes complemented by clustering techniques do not deal with the missing values efficiently they solve the problem of maximising the input information but they do not always solve the problem of estimating uncertainty of the missing data nakagawa 2015 onkelinx et al 2017a 2017b van buuren 2018 raja et al 2020 one method for dealing with missing data uncertainty is fuzzy logic techniques e g fuzzy c means or fuzzy k means clustering e g li et al 2004 huang et al 2020 kiersztyn et al 2020 but they cannot fill in missing values with high accuracy even when the missing data represent less than 10 of the entire dataset luengo et al 2010 raja et al 2020 to increase the accuracy of filled gaps more advanced methods have been developed currently methods of multiple imputation originally developed by rubin 1987 1996 are gaining the greatest popularity among researchers from various fields and the number of applications of multiple imputation is growing exponentially van buuren 2018 missing data imputation techniques are also used in ecology but much less than in social or medical sciences van buuren 2018 even though ecological data by its nature often contain gaps outliers or even wrong data e g underhill and prys jones 1994 nakagawa and freckleton 2008 j√≥hannesson et al 2019 hallmann et al 2020 in ecological studies most data gaps are unfortunately ignored or removed or sometimes filled with single imputation methods nakagawa 2015 onkelinx et al 2017a of course the data collected for ecological research does not always contain gaps and a based on complete datasets are also published e g s√¶ther et al 2008 tryjanowski et al 2005b tryjanowski et al 2005a more research effort is needed to test the effectiveness of missing data imputation methods for different types of ecological data and popularize solving the problem of missing data or outliers other than by ignoring them j√≥hannesson et al 2019 see also the research discussion of onkelinx et al 2017a 2017b and bogaart et al 2017 ultimately models must be developed for each type of data because no imputation method performs best for all classifiers zhang et al 2012 the method used to fill in missing data may be of particular importance for calculating ecological indicators correct estimation of the parameters of a given ecological indicator influences inference about the subject of the indicator e g status of the environment process of interest the uncertainty in calculated indicators will decrease as the attention paid to pre processing of input data increases in this study using simulated and real ecological data for indicator species we show how results differ when ignoring missing data filling in the missing data using single methods including fuzzy methods and using multiple imputation techniques with aggregation of results we focus on empirical data on offspring production in a white stork ciconia ciconia population 7 year monitoring of 239 nests the white stork is widely regarded as an important indicator species because its occurrence and reproductive success reflect the biodiversity and naturalness of an area latus et al 2000 tob√≥≈Çka et al 2012 fasola matasaru et al 2018 kaminski et al 2020 we hypothesise that it is possible to find a method with a high accuracy of filling gaps 95 in datasets analysed and that one can obtain more correct inference about a studied phenomenon from the filled dataset than when ignoring missing data 2 methods 2 1 data origin study species and study area ornithologists frequently study the white stork because of its wide geographic range synanthropic nature periodicity of migration charismatic nature and positive perception and cultural embedding in local communities it leads an open non cryptic lifestyle and builds large and clearly visible nests often in or near human settlements many years of international interest in the white stork resulted in the development of a standard method for monitoring its population that allows for large scale comparisons over long time series profus 2006 tryjanowskiet al 2006 tob√≥≈Çka 2015 bialas et al 2020 one of the key elements monitored is stork s breeding success the number of young that fledge from the nest per year bairlein 1991 tob√≥≈Çka 2015 the main source of these data is regular monitoring performed directly at the nests nowakowski 2003 tucakov 2006 denac 2010 grishchenko and yablonovska grishchenko 2017 monitoring such large areas requires many observers and the assistance of amateur volunteers who usually have little field experience in bird research denac 2010 baltag et al 2009 tob√≥≈Çka 2015 as practice shows survey volunteers sometimes have considerable difficulty in determining the breeding success of white storks especially in difficult to observe nest locations the optimal solution is to climb to the nest or use a drone to inspect it directly but amateurs are not always able to do so kosicki 2010 therefore in monitoring reports nests with an unknown breeding success are quite often mentioned tucakov 2006 baltag et al 2009 denac 2010 grishchenko 2013 zbyryt et al 2014 it is also possible for nests not to be checked in a timely manner reports to be questioned and incorrect information to be obtained from an analytical viewpoint these situations are data gaps that can be filled using other verified data or data with other correlated covariates in this study we used field data on white stork breeding collected in south eastern poland in the foothills of the outer western carpathian mountains in mesoregions called pog√≥rze dynowskie and pog√≥rze przemyskie kondracki 2002 the study area covered ca 2 500 km2 the data were collected from 2014 2020 by professional ornithologists and amateurs the method of monitoring and describing stork reproduction was consistent with international standards used for this type of survey for many years sch√ºz 1952 jakubiec 1985 nowakowski 2003 mammeria et al 2019 in total complete or partial information on 239 white stork nests was collected 2 2 preparation of input data the original data were rearranged and changed only by replacing the symbols used in monitoring with quantitative ranks which showed real and potential impacts of the nest on the growth of the stork population i e whether the nest was occupied by the breeding pair and how many offspring were produced the following ranks were used a 5 4 3 2 1 and 0 the nest was occupied by a breeding pair of storks that produced a number of young storks that successfully left the nest equal to the value of the rank zero represented a breeding pair that occupied the nest throughout the season but laid no eggs b 0 5 a breeding pair occupied the nest but the eggs or young were lost for various reasons e g predation heavy storm human activity thus the nest had the potential to produce new individuals but was not successful in the given year c 0 5 non breeding individuals occasionally occupied the nest in the given year d 1 the nest was never occupied during the season e 2 a nest did not yet exist at this location or was destroyed in the given year 2 3 experimental data matrix and simulation data matrix the data collected for this study constituted the experimental data matrix edm which contained 239 rows individual stork nests and 7 columns years of monitoring 239 nests 7 years 1 673 records this matrix was filled with the ranks described previously and included 212 cases of missing data 12 7 we checked the randomness of missing data in the edm as suggested by nakagawa 2015 and confirmed that edm gaps were nearly random wald wolfowitz runs test Œ± 0 01 based on results of the edm a simulation data matrix sdm was developed to test the effectiveness of different methods of filling gaps all nests for which we had complete information from all 7 years i e 109 nests were used to create the sdm which thus contained 763 records 109 nests 7 years in the sdm missing data were simulated by randomly deleting 100 records so that it would have a similar percentage of missing data as the edm ca 13 the gaps generated in the sdm were then filled with a variety of methods and the imputed values rounded to the nearest 0 5 were compared to the known values that had been intentionally removed these activities and calculations with the sdm were repeated 20 times with new data gaps generated each time we analysed the sdm to assess the effectiveness of filling the gaps by each of the methods tested the following metrics were adopted to assess effectiveness 1 percentage of perfectly matched records 2 percentage of records with a small error in absolute rank i e 0 5 1 0 3 percentage of records with large errors in absolute rank 1 0 4 the mean and standard deviation of error for all records filled using a given method and 5 the minimum and maximum errors of the method the most effective method identified by this approach was then used as the benchmark for filling data gaps in the edm in which the true value of the existing data gaps was unknown after filling the data gaps in the edm we showed how results can differ when leaving gaps in the data or using a non optimally selected method of missing data imputation three indicators of monitored nests were used as metrics 1 productivity the total number of young storks produced per year 2 the mean number of offspring produced per nest per year and 3 the rank of the most productive nests i e the most important nests however when ranking the nests with the highest breeding success we found that calculating the total or mean number of offspring did not differentiate nests sufficiently to rank them for this reason additional index Œº k was calculated as i 2014 2020 x i k s k where x i k is the weighted breeding success for a given nest and s k is the standard deviation of x i k because the ranks were prepared mainly for practical reasons e g to prioritise conservation activities when calculating the index weights were used to increase the rank of breeding success in recent years values for 2020 were multiplied by 2 00 2019 by 1 75 2018 by 1 50 2017 by 1 25 and 2016 or earlier by 1 00 2 4 gap filling methods used data gaps were filled using nine single methods and four aggregation models a methods 1 arithmetic mean for a given year calculated from nests with known ranks i e arithmetic mean of the column for a given year 2 arithmetic mean for a particular nest from its known ranks from other years i e arithmetic mean of the row for a given nest 3 arithmetic mean for a given year from a cluster of nests clusters were calculated using the fuzzy c means clustering algorithm bezdek et al 1984 only the nests in the winning cluster were used to calculate the mean the winning cluster is one that the nest belongs to with the highest degree the sum of the degree of belongingness of the given nest to all clusters analysed was 1 4 arithmetic mean for the given year for a cluster combination the mean for each cluster was calculated the missing value in the data was then calculated as the mean for a given year of a given cluster x i multiplied by the degree to which the analysed nest belonged to the given cluster m i where i represents the cluster number x i 0 4 x i m i 5 increment of the annual mean calculated for the cluster relative increment calculated as x k x k 1 x k 1 first the annual mean of each cluster was calculated as the arithmetic mean of ranks of the year with the gap then the proportional change in the annual mean of each cluster Œ¥ck was determined the missing value in the data was then determined by multiplying the rank of the previous year by this proportional change plus one i e x k x k 1 1 Œ¥ c k where c k denotes the mean for a given cluster 6 two year arithmetic mean the missing value equals the mean of the values in the year preceding and following the year with no data 7 four year arithmetic mean the missing value equals the mean of the values in the two preceding years and two years following the year with no data 8 increment of the arithmetic mean calculated for all nests in the year preceding and following the year with no data the method is similar to method 5 except that the mean is calculated for all nests not for clusters in the year preceding and the year following the year with no data 9 increment of the median calculated for all nests for the year preceding and the year following the year with no data unlike method 8 medians are used instead of means b models 1 linear model with intercept Œ±0 in the form y Œ± 0 i 1 9 Œ± i m i where mi are

than those of aggregation models model 4 also had the lowest error in estimated rank figure 1 3 2 results for the experimental data matrix for the edm we did not know the true values of the missing data therefore based on the analyses performed for the sdm we assumed that estimates of model 4 were the most reliable and this model was used as the benchmark for filling data gaps in the edm comparison of results showed that the edm with gaps estimated the productivity of the stork population over the 7 year period as 2 374 individuals single methods of completing the data estimated productivity of 2 453 2 788 individuals whereas the optimal model estimated productivity of 2 518 individuals i e 144 individuals 6 more than in the edm table 2 more detailed analysis of productivity in following years showed other differences table 2 for example based on the edm productivity of the white stork population was higher in 2020 than in 2019 but the filled dataset showed the opposite probably correct trend i e lower in 2020 than in 2019 the results also differed for the mean number of offspring produced per nest per year 2 35 individuals nest year based on the edm which is likely correct as the edm had a large sample size the optimal model however estimated only 2 19 individuals nest year figure 2 the results also differed when ranking nests with the highest breeding success fig 3 ranking nests based on the data with gaps rather than the imputed data may influence conclusions about the importance of a given nest the largest differences were observed when assigning a nest rank using mean index values when the assigned rank could differ by up to 61 4 discussion missing data is a common problem in statistical analysis and the problem of how to address data gaps is also

inference were possible for example the original data may have overestimated the mean offspring productivity of stork nests in the study area because the filled dataset indicated that it is lower the accuracy of estimates is important in the context of estimates of breeding success and inter population comparisons within the geographical range as it forms the basis for inferring the quality of the habitats occupied by this species and other conservation issues tryjanowski et al 2009a 2009b denac 2010 janiszewski et al 2014 vaitkuvienƒó and dagys 2015 fasola matasaru et al 2018 our calculations also indicate that based on the data with gaps conclusions about population trends could be incorrect data with gaps indicated that the studied population produced more offspring in 2020 than in 2019 while the filled data model 4 indicated that the downward trend since 2017 continued in 2020 which is more likely to be correct these examples show that clear differences even in general indicators can be seen between the data with gaps and the filled data however gap filling becomes more important when the objective is to conduct more detailed analyses or comparisons such as ranking nests by their productivity to identify the most important ones an incorrect estimate of the productivity rank may have specific theoretical and practical consequences such as erroneous conclusions about habitat quality around a given nest or suboptimal allocation of funds for conservation activities further research on pre processing of data on white stork reproduction would help expand the pool of gap filling methods and models and identify which ones are most effective models must be dedicated to a specific data type because there is no universal imputation method that performs best for all classifiers zhang et al 2012 developing an optimal method would allow further research on historical stork inventories because the white stork has been researched for over 100 years and the observation method has changed relatively little in that time this could be a unique opportunity to re examine pre existing data and perhaps better understand the long term dynamics of the white stork in many areas finally multiple imputation methods can also be used to address outliers data anomalies whose values may result from measurement errors these anomalies can be treated as a type of gap in datasets and filled with imputation methods hallmann et al 2020 used this approach successfully but for fewer records raja et al 2020 however point out that much less effort and progress have been made in processing uncertain information in datasets than on imputing missing data 5 conclusions data gaps are a common problem in ecological datasets this problem may be particularly important for analyses of indicator species because estimating metrics correctly influences correct inferences about the species based on simulation data we showed that gaps in monitoring data on the production of offspring in a white stork population can be successfully filled the data filled using an optimal model had high accuracy 96 5 of perfectly matched cases based on empirical data we showed that the way in which missing data are filled can influence the results obtained the differences observed concerned general indicators of population productivity i e total number of offspring mean productivity per nest differences in abundance trends i e increase or decrease in productivity between years and a detailed ranking of nest productivity the differences observed in the results could lead to incorrect conclusions about the dynamics of the population or the condition of the surrounding habitat and lead to improperly targeted conservation actions further research on developing optimal methods of filling gaps in data on the white stork population should be performed an optimally selected set of gap filling methods dedicated to white stork monitoring could increase the accuracy of modern estimates and provide the opportunity re analyse rich historical data see also wuczy≈Ñski et al 2021 similar pre processing methods to fill data gaps should also find wider application in other

24447,the balance between nutrition and energy needs has an important impact on the spatial distribution of foraging animals in the present paper we focus on the case of bumble bees moving around a landscape in search of pollen to meet nutritional needs and nectar to meet energy needs depending on the colony demands bumble bees can concentrate their foraging effort towards either pollen rich flower species or nectar rich flower species this behaviour allows us to establish a strategy a spatial landscape design which can maximize the pollination services of crops that are nutritionally deficient for pollinators by adding nutritionally rich wildflower patches to do this we formulate a mathematical partial integro differential equation model to predict the spatial distribution of foraging bumble bees we use our model to predict the location composition and quantity of the wildflower patches adjacent to crop fields that will be most beneficial for crop pollination services our results show that relatively small quantities of wildflowers in specific locations with respect to the nest sites and the crop can have a positive impact on pollination services when the composition i e pollen to nectar ratio of the added wildflowers is significantly different from the composition of the existing crop flowers keywords partial differential equations ecological modelling pollination services bumblebees memory pollen 1 introduction bumble bees are the predominant or exclusive pollinators of a large number of wild plants goulson 2003 in addition and most importantly for the economy bumble bees provide important pollination services to many crops around the world goulson et al 2003 corbet et al 1991 goulson et al 2008 kremen et al 2002 understanding the foraging behaviour of bumble bees is critical for the management of bumble bee mediated crops such as cucumber pumpkin watermelon blueberry and cranberry richards 2001 kremen et al 2002 delaplane et al 2000 as well as bumble bee populations which are in global decline bommarco et al 2012 bartomeus et al 2013 klein et al 2017 finding ways to support these remaining populations in agricultural landscapes is key to prevent further declines in places where managed honey bees apis mellifera the most commonly used pollinator to meet crop pollination requirements carreck and williams 1998 are declining a good understanding of the foraging behaviour of bumble bees is especially important in the united states for example the critical services of honeybees is compromised by the decline in beekeeping which has been estimated to be of around 50 during the last 50 years and expected to decline further as the africanized race of a mellifera continues to spread kremen et al 2002 carvalheiro et al 2011 buhk et al 2018 feltham et al 2015 and blaauw and isaacs 2014 provide empirical evidence that the addition of wildflowers adjacent to a crop can lead to an increase in pollination services by wild pollinators such as bumble bees however a quantification of the location quantity and type of wildflowers needed to optimize crop pollination is lacking and so the need for a model is clear h√§ussler et al 2017 model crop pollination services and show that due to an increase of pollinator population size adding strips of wildflowers around crops can have a positive long term effect over multiple seasons on crop pollination however in the same study it is also said that adding strips of wildflower can have a negative short term effect within a single season due to the competition for pollinators between flower species capera aragones et al 2021 use a spatially explicit modelling approach to show that wildflower strips can be advantageous even in the short term if the appropriate location quantity and type of wildflowers are used their model includes more complexity in bumble bee foraging behaviour than previous work particularly with respect to the influence of memory in the present work we are interested in understanding how the balance between nutritional and energy needs in bumble bee colonies changes the results predicted in capera aragones et al 2021 during their foraging bouts bees gather two different resources nectar and pollen nectar provides water and sugar and is the main source of energy for bees while pollen provides proteins lipids vitamins and minerals and is important for rearing and development nicolson 2011 ball 2007 bumble bees therefore need to forage for both pollen and nectar different flower species have different compositions of nectar and pollen hence offering different nutritional and energy resources thus pollen and nectar foraging decisions will affect the rates at which the bees visit different types of flowers these choices in turn will affect the pollination services provided to the different flower species free 1955 and recently kraus et al 2019 studied the division of labour within bumblebee colonies including the division of foragers into nectar and pollen foragers free 1955 classified bees as pollen foragers if they carry a pollen load in their corbiculae and as nectar foragers if not pollen foragers may also transport nectar but nectar foragers do not carry pollen bees showed constancy i e bees that in the last bout collected pollen were more likely to collect pollen in the next bout the proportion of pollen nectar foragers is strongly related to the needs of the colony dornhaus and chittka 2005 kraus et al 2019 free 1955 before a foraging bout bees make an evaluation of the nectar and pollen stored in the nest and then decide which resource to forage depending on which one is most limiting in this paper we first expand the model in capera aragones et al 2021 to study how the division of labour between pollen and nectar foragers and the effect of the interaction between the resource availability on the landscape and the resource needs of the colony impact the dynamics of bee movement foraging behaviour and crop pollination services we then show that our model can effectively reproduce the results of the empirical studies from free 1955 and kraus et al 2019 at the end we use our model to quantify the relationship between crop pollination services and the quantity location and relative pollen nectar proportion of the wildflower patch added adjacent to the crop it is important to note that in this work we do not include population dynamics focusing instead on the effect of the spatial distribution and type of resources on the landscape in particular agricultural landscapes tend to have plentiful monotype resources from a crop for a few weeks followed by many more weeks of much less abundant but mixed wildflower resources in our work we find that pollen rich wildflower patches planted near pollen deficient crops can result in increased pollination services to the crop even in the absence of any demographic effect if the wildflowers are planted in the correct location and provide the necessary complement to the crop resources 2 model and methods we begin with a brief overview of previous work upon which our model is built in tyson et al 2011 a spatially explicit model of honey bee dispersal is presented in this model the foraging population is divided into two sub populations one engaged in an intensive search mode bees that are actively harvesting on resource modelled using diffusion and the other engaged in an extensive search mode bees that are scouting for new resources to harvest modelled by advection in the same paper it is shown that dividing the population into two sub populations provides a better fit to organism movement data than models in which the population is considered homogeneous based on tyson et al 2011 capera aragones et al 2021 recently developed a mathematical model for wild bees in which the foraging population is split into three different interacting sub populations harvesting bees h those individuals that are collecting floral resources on the landscape and moving randomly from one flower to another by diffusion scouting bees with memory s those bees that have knowledge of the landscape and use directed flight advection to move efficiently over larger distances from one patch of flowers to another or from the nest to a patch of flowers these bees can be identified as exploiters if we follow the notation used in the empirical work done by woodgate et al 2016 scouting bees without memory s n those bees that do not have knowledge of the landscape and use directed flights advection as well as diffusion to explore the landscape and find new patches of flowers these bees are identified as explorers in woodgate et al 2016 as discussed below the division into three sub populations is necessary for a detailed description of the foraging distribution of wild bees with memory in the present paper we also divide foraging bees into these three sub populations performing different movement modes similarly to capera aragones et al 2021 in our work model bees move between the mentioned sub populations at rates that depend on both resource density and the density of bees of each type for example scouting bees with memory at location x are likely to become harvesters at x as the floral resource density at x increases the density of resource in the landscape affects the transitions between bee sub populations and the sub populations affect the density of resource in the landscape via resource depletion bees are required to return to the nest to unload the resource collected after each foraging bout that is they are central place foragers in contrast to previous work from moorcroft et al 2006 and capera aragones et al 2021 where the central place foraging behaviour is included by adding a constant bias advection towards the nest to the foraging population in the present work we model the central place foraging by assuming that harvesters are continually teleported to the nest at a constant rate see eq 2 1 teleporting is used because it implies that harvesters reach the nest at a specific moment in time which is not the case with a linear advection term at which time bees can decide between becoming a pollen or a nectar scouting bee depending on the pollen and nectar storage in the nest one of the key contributions in capera aragones et al 2021 is the inclusion of memory effects in a spatial differential equation model for bee foraging memory is an important tool used by bees to improve their foraging efficiency based on findings of radar tracking studies of bees woodgate et al 2017 2016 lihoreau et al 2012 2013 capera aragones et al 2021 include memory by making the sub population of scouting bees with memory to be more likely to fly advectively in a chosen flight direction that is those bees with knowledge of the landscape are less likely to use direct motion advection on a random direction and more likely to use the direct motion towards those locations where they remember finding resources by contrast to other recent approaches such shi et al 2019a b and oliveira and berbert 2020 in this work we use the one developed in capera aragones et al 2021 the main difference and contribution of this paper with respect to the model in capera aragones et al 2021 is the division of food into two different variables pollen and nectar with the consequent division of the bee population into two pollen foragers and nectar foragers this division means that the new model doubles the number of sub populations now foraging bees can be in six different states instead of only three pollen harvesters h p pollen memory scouts s p pollen no memory scouts s n p nectar harvesters h n nectar memory scouts s n and nectar no memory scouts s n n fig 1 is the compartmental diagram of the model presented in this paper table 1 is a description of the state variables used in the model for simplicity we assume that pollen foragers including pollen harvesters pollen memory scouts and pollen no memory scouts do not interact with nectar foragers nectar harvesters nectar memory scouts and nectar no memory scouts outside the nest that is once a forager has decided to harvest pollen it cannot become a nectar forager or vice versa until its current foraging bout has finished this resource specialization to either pollen or nectar broadly not type of pollen or nectar during a single foraging bout is based on the empirical results found in free 1955 and hagbery and nieh 2012 following this empirical evidence the interaction between pollen and nectar foragers occurs only in the nest at the beginning of each foraging bout the interaction is such that nectar foragers are likely to become pollen foragers if the proportion of pollen stores relative to the pollen requirements of the colony Œ∏ p r p is smaller than the proportion of nectar stores relative to the nectar requirements of the colony Œ∏ n r n and are likely to continue as a nectar forager if the colony s needs are reversed similarly former pollen foragers may or may not switch to nectar foraging at the beginning of a new foraging bout our model considers the time evolution of the pollen stored r p and nectar stored r n in the nest to be a function of the pollen nectar collected by harvesters and the pollen nectar consumed by all bees mathematically we can express the model presented in this paper by the set of partial integro differential eqs 2 1 given as in box i where all parameters are defined in the table 2 œï b c b a c k n represents the nectar production at time t and position x by crop flowers b wildflowers w and background flowers b a c k all together œï b c b a c k p is equivalent to œï b c b a c k n but for pollen production m r l n p are the memory functions which are defined for each pollen and nectar forager independently and take the same form as in capera aragones et al 2021 2 2a m r n p x t Œ∫ m r n p x Œ∑ 0 x h n p x 2 œÄ œÉ

memory over time and œÉ the standard deviation of the spatial memory kernel m r n p and m l n p are respectively the rates at which a left right moving scout switches direction i e becomes right left

transition rate from scouting to harvesting in the presence of n or p and Œ± is the half saturation constant that determines when the switching rates Œ≥ 1 and Œ≥ 2 are strongly or weakly resource dependent the parameter k h s gives the maximum transition rate from harvesting to scouting see box i 2 1 metrics in the next section we will use the model described to evaluate crop pollination services depending on the location quantity and pollen nectar proportion of the wildflower patch added adjacent to the crop fig 2 is a schematic representation of the one dimensional landscapes that we will be studying in this section we define the metrics that we will use to describe and quantify the output of our model apart from measuring the number of harvesting bees scouting bees with memory and scouting bees without memory on pollen and nectar h n h p s n s p s n n s n p we are interested in measuring the resource collected pollen and nectar across the landscape which we consider to be

pollen produced by wildflowers and œï b w b a c k n and œï b w b a c k p are the nectar and pollen produced by crop wildflowers and background flowers all together using eqs 2 4d we can determine the quantity of pollen and nectar collected from crop flowers and wildflowers in a specific location at a specific time we can also compute it over the entire landscape integrating with respect to space at a particular time or during a specific time interval integrating with respect to time note that in eq 2 4a the term œï b p œï b w b a c k p h p refers to the amount of pollen harvesters which are collecting pollen from crop flowers and k h u p p p Œ± p refers to the saturating dependence of resource collection similarly for the other cases in eqs 2 4d 2 2 numerical approach the model described

no flux boundary conditions to all the state variables involving movement 2 7 h n p x t x s n p x t x s n n p x 0 for x 0 l and t 0 to solve the system of equations we used a fractional step method to decouple the distinct modelling processes in eqs 2 1 and the best suited numerical method for each of the processes was applied sequentially see tyson et al 2000 in a first stage we solved the diffusion and advection terms using an implicit tr bdf2 method hosea and shampine 1996 and in a second stage we solved the non linear reaction terms using an explicit rk4 method la et al 2002 to solve the integrals in eqs 2 2b we used the simpson rule the spatial step used was 50 m and the time step 1 s 3 results 3 1 effect of the division of food into pollen and nectar on foraging spatial distributions in this section we show how the new mechanism added in model eqs 2 1 to account for the balance between nutrition and energy needs of foragers produce the characteristic behaviours of bumble bees observed in free 1955 first we investigate the changes in the proportion of nectar and pollen foragers as a consequence of changes in landscape resource availability fig 3 left we show that the higher the proportion of pollen nectar resource availability in the landscape the smaller the proportion of pollen nectar foragers in the colony this inverse proportion occurs because fewer bees are needed to gather the necessary quantity of the easily accessed resource second we examine the foraging behaviour responses to in nest nectar pollen storage depletion in fig 3 right we use our model to show how the numbers of pollen and nectar foragers depend on the quantities nectar and pollen stored in the nest to obtain the results in fig 3 down right we held the stored resource values r p r n constant at the values indicated in fig 3 top right for the rest of this paper we do not fix the resource stored in nest instead it increases or decreases over time according to eq 2 1 3 2 wildflower plantings benefit crop pollination in this section we evaluate how the balance between nutritional and energy needs affects the spatial distribution of bees in the presence of flower species with different pollen nectar proportions bees can be strongly biased towards the location of one flower species or another depending on the colony s needs the landscapes under consideration in this section will always consist of a crop and a nesting site at fixed locations a wildflower patch and a uniform low density wildflower matrix wildflower background see fig 4 top for a depiction of the linear landscape under consideration in order to study the possible benefits of a wildflower patch enhancement on crop pollination services we will look at the pollination services as a function of four different variables wildflower patch location the position of the wildflower patch is defined in a 4 km landscape where there is a nest site fixed at position l 2 km and a crop of width 0 5 km centred at l 2 5 km wildflower patch quantity the quantity of resource in the wildflower patch is defined relative to the quantity of resource in the crop for example a wildflower patch quantity of 10 means the total amount of resource in the wildflower patch is 10 times smaller than that in the crop wildflower patch differentiation type we define wildflower differentiation in relation to the crop that is we wish to define a metric where a wildflower differentiation of 100 means that the wildflower resources are completely different in pollen and nectar composition from the crop resources while a wildflower differentiation of 0 means that the compositions are exactly the same we thus define wildflower differentiation as a percentage given by 3 8 100 Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 2 where 3 9a Œ¥ a wf pollen quantity wf quantity crop nectar quantity crop quantity 3 9b Œ¥ b wf nectar quantity wf quantity crop pollen quantity crop quantity and Œ¥ a and Œ¥ b range between 0 and 2 and satisfy Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 2 we are assuming that the wildflower pollen quantity relative to the wildflower quantity is the same as the crop nectar quantity relative to the crop quantity and vice versa where nectar and pollen are swapped this assumption enables a simpler interpretation of the results using eqs 3 8 and 3 9 wildflower differentiation of 100 corresponds to Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 2 0 or 0 2 in the first case wildflowers only produce pollen whereas crop flowers only produce nectar the second case represents the opposite scenario in contrast wildflower differentiation 0 occurs when Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 1 1 and both wildflowers and crop flowers produce the same proportion of pollen and nectar wildflower background density in addition to the crop field and the added wildflower patch the landscape under consideration also includes a low density uniform distributed wildflower background the density of the wildflower background is a measure of agricultural intensity where low densities represent intensively farmed landscapes with few wildflower resources other than the crop we can measure the wildflower background density by comparing its integral over all the landscape to the quantity of resource in the crop fig 4 shows the crop pollination services as a function of the wildflower patch location left plot and the crop pollination services as a function of the wildflower patch location and wildflower patch quantity right plot we show the pollination services for six different wildflower differentiation values ranging from 0 to 100 regarding the location of the wildflower patch enhancement our results in fig 4 show that planting the wildflowers in a location such that the crop is between the wildflowers and the nest site wildflowers at l 3 km where the nest is at l 2 km and the crop is at l 2 5 km is a consistently good location regardless of changes in the wildflower differentiation and wildflower quantity we can also observe that wildflowers planted close to the nest site l 2 km can lead to the highest increase in crop pollination services if the differentiation is large differentiation 100 but lead to the highest decrease in crop pollination services if the differentiation is low differentiation 100 planting the wildflowers in the same location as the crop l 2 5 km appears to be disadvantageous in the majority of cases whereas planting the wildflowers between the crop and the nest site appears to be in all cases less advantageous than when the wildflowers are planted such that the crop is between them and the nest site regarding the quantity of the wildflower patch enhancement we observe that when the differentiation is large differentiation 80 higher quantities are always more advantageous than lower quantities by contrast for smaller differentiation values differentiation 80 intermediate quantity values are the most advantageous with high quantities located close to the nest site being the most disadvantageous and small quantity values located in the far edge of the crop with respect to the nest being the most advantageous with respect to the differentiation of the wildflower patch enhancement the tendency shown in fig 4 is clear the higher the differentiation the higher the increase in pollination services associated with planting wildflowers fig 5 shows how the wildflower background affects the predictions in fig 4 in fig 5 we can see that the smaller the wildflower background density the more intense the agriculture the larger the benefits of adding a wildflower patch to crop pollination services fig 6 shows the increase in crop pollination services as a function of the wildflower background density for three different wildflower patch densities and three different wildflower patch differentiation our results highlight that the greater the wildflower differentiation value the larger the benefits of adding a wildflower patch the increase in pollination services can vary between 0 to more than 80 the more dense the wildflower patch the higher the benefit though for wildflowers very similar to the crop low differentiation smaller wildflower densities give better results see fig 6 top the smaller the density of the wildflower background the larger the benefit of planting wildflowers that is the more intense the agriculture the greater the benefit of planting a wildflower patch for the simulations in figs 4 6 the total number of foragers is b 6000 and the total amount of resource produced by the crop is œï b n œï b p d x 25000 mg h the total amount of resource produced by the wildflower patch and wildflower background is scenario dependent it is important to note that rather than the absolute value of b or œï b n œï b p d x what changes the output of our simulations is their relative values i e how big is the crop with respect to the existent population of bees in the landscape in this work the relative values are chosen such that a significant fraction of the resources are consumed 4 discussion in this paper we expand the model presented in capera aragones et al 2021 to incorporate the effects of the balance between the two floral resources i e pollen nutrition and nectar energy on bumble bee spatial distributions we divide the forager population into two groups pollen foragers and nectar foragers and assume that foragers switch between groups depending on the colony needs this assumption is consistent with free 1955 and with the observation that colonies with a large amount of brood forage more often for pollen than colonies with a smaller brood population because of increasing pollen needs associated with brood development kraus et al 2019 in addition to the modelling of the two resource types and the two foraging populations associated to them in the present paper we applied central place foraging behaviour using a different method than in capera aragones et al 2021 it is relevant to note that the different method does not change the model predictions significantly if correct parameter values are used the method used in the present paper assumes that harvesters stop foraging and return to the nest at a constant per capita rate the result is a decrease in the harvesting population in order to keep the population of bees constant we add a source of scouting bees at the nest location so that the number of scouts emerging at the nest location is equal to the number of harvesters disappearing from the landscape in other words we assume that harvesting bees become scouts in the nest and ignore the travel time the advantage of using this approach to model central place foraging behaviour is that it enables foragers to constantly decide between becoming a pollen or a nectar scouting bee depending on the pollen and nectar storage in the nest see eq 2 1 thus allowing us to easily incorporate the effects of the balance between nutrition and energy needs 4 1 effects of the division of food into pollen and nectar free 1955 and vaudo et al 2015 find that bumblebees forage for pollen or nectar in proportion to the needs of the colony in our work we consider a relatively short period of time during which we can assume a constant population and constant colony needs based on free 1955 and vaudo et al 2015 we assumed that bumble bees forage for pollen and nectar with the goal of storing three times as much nectar as pollen as a consequence we found the proportion of pollen nectar foragers to be inversely proportional to the proportion of pollen nectar resource in the landscape but insensitive to the total amount of resource available see fig 3 further work is needed to determine whether it is simply the proportion of each type of resource that matters or if it is also the total quantity of resource or some combination of these two measures in fig 3 right we use our model to reproduce some of the experiments in free 1955 in which the reserves of pollen or nectar in nest are depleted and a subsequent increase of pollen or nectar foragers are respectively observed these results provide qualitative support for our model 4 2 wildflower plantings benefit crop pollination in our earlier work capera aragones et al 2021 we showed that adding intermediate wildflower quantities in a location such that the crop is between the nest site and the wildflowers lead to the largest increase in crop pollination services in the present paper in addition to the location and quantity of wildflowers we investigated the effects of the pollen and nectar composition of the wildflower patch differentiation or type relative to the crop and the effects of the density of the wildflower background matrix in the landscape our results in fig 4 show that the greater the difference between the pollen nectar composition of the wild and crop flowers the larger the benefit provided by planted wildflowers to crop pollination services in the differentiation 0 case in which the composition of the wild and crop flowers is the same the addition of wildflowers provides only a small benefit and only if planted in small quantities and in the right location if planted in large quantities and in a wrong location the presence of wildflowers can significantly decrease the pollination services of the crop this is due to competition between flower species for pollinators in the differentiation 100 case moment in which the resource composition of wild and crop flowers is completely different the benefits are significant independent of the location and quantity of wildflowers planted it is relevant to note that for the case in which the two flower species are completely different in composition they never compete for pollinators and so adding wildflowers never decreases the pollination services of the crop in the case of wildflowers with an intermediate differentiation value say 10 to 90 the interpretation of the results is harder to generalize since depending on the location and quantities adding wildflowers can lead to large increases or decreases in crop pollination services figs 5 and 6 show how the decrease of wildflower density in the background which represents an increase in agricultural intensity enhances the tendencies observed in fig 4 we can therefore conclude that intensively farmed landscapes stand most to benefit from the practice of planting wildflower patches adjacent to crops looking at fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 we arrive at the following conclusions regarding the benefits to crop pollination services of adding a wildflower patch the more different in pollen nectar composition is the wildflower patch with respect to the crop high differentiation the larger the benefits locating the wildflowers at the far side of the crop with respect to the nest site is consistently a good location with respect to changes in the differentiation or quantity of the wildflower patch enhancement or changes in the density of the wildflower background locating the wildflower patch close to the nest site can be most beneficial if the differentiation is high 100 but can be most detrimental for crop pollination if the differentiation is low large quantities of wildflower plantations are most beneficial if they have a high differentiation value but small quantities are better if the differentiation value is small see fig 6 the lower the density of the wildflower background the larger the benefit of planting wildflowers that is the more intense the agriculture the greater the benefit of planting a wildflower patch 5 conclusions in this paper we investigated how the balance between nutrition pollen and energy nectar needs affect the spatial distribution of foraging bumblebees and the resulting pollination services they provide to a crop we focused on a landscape consisting of two flower species the crop and a wildflower patch that can vary in pollen and nectar concentrations our findings show that in landscapes where pollen and nectar resources are not uniformly distributed the balance between nutrition and energy needs can significantly affect the spatial distribution of foraging bumblebees our result is consistent with field studies indicating that bumble bees are selective about the floral resources they gather vaudo et al 2015 we find that crop pollination is maximized when two conditions are satisfied first the crop is located between the nest and the wildflower patch and second the floral resources offered by the wildflowers are significantly different from the resources offered by the crop flowers this situation can occur for example if the crop flowers are deficient in certain nutrients that are present in the wildflower resources and vice versa in addition we find that only small quantities of wildflowers are needed to maximize crop pollination services when the composition of the wildflowers and the crop are similar whereas large quantities are most beneficial when the wildflowers are very different in composition from crop flowers we also showed how our predictions change as a function of the wildflower background density which is a measure of the intensity with which the landscape is farmed intensively farmed monoculture landscapes are often nutritionally deficient girard et al 2012 topitzhofer et al 2019 in our work we find that the benefits of planting wildflowers adjacent to a crop increase as the agriculture becomes more intense we note here that such landscapes are also subjected to high pesticide use which detrimentally affect bee foraging and populations the addition of wildflower patches that are not subjected to chemical control can potentially boost the benefits found in this work we emphasize that the benefits we found are not due to a pollinator population effect as our model does not include population dynamics but only to the effect of the balance between nutrition and energy on pollinator spatial distributions h√§ussler et al 2017 pointed out that demographic effects can further augment the benefits of planting wildflower patches our work is an indication that spatial aspects of the system are also important we therefore suggest that maximal effectiveness of wildflower patches can be achieved by combining spatial considerations with those aimed at supporting population dynamics credit authorship contribution statement pau capera aragones lead investigator

24447,the balance between nutrition and energy needs has an important impact on the spatial distribution of foraging animals in the present paper we focus on the case of bumble bees moving around a landscape in search of pollen to meet nutritional needs and nectar to meet energy needs depending on the colony demands bumble bees can concentrate their foraging effort towards either pollen rich flower species or nectar rich flower species this behaviour allows us to establish a strategy a spatial landscape design which can maximize the pollination services of crops that are nutritionally deficient for pollinators by adding nutritionally rich wildflower patches to do this we formulate a mathematical partial integro differential equation model to predict the spatial distribution of foraging bumble bees we use our model to predict the location composition and quantity of the wildflower patches adjacent to crop fields that will be most beneficial for crop pollination services our results show that relatively small quantities of wildflowers in specific locations with respect to the nest sites and the crop can have a positive impact on pollination services when the composition i e pollen to nectar ratio of the added wildflowers is significantly different from the composition of the existing crop flowers keywords partial differential equations ecological modelling pollination services bumblebees memory pollen 1 introduction bumble bees are the predominant or exclusive pollinators of a large number of wild plants goulson 2003 in addition and most importantly for the economy bumble bees provide important pollination services to many crops around the world goulson et al 2003 corbet et al 1991 goulson et al 2008 kremen et al 2002 understanding the foraging behaviour of bumble bees is critical for the management of bumble bee mediated crops such as cucumber pumpkin watermelon blueberry and cranberry richards 2001 kremen et al 2002 delaplane et al 2000 as well as bumble bee populations which are in global decline bommarco et al 2012 bartomeus et al 2013 klein et al 2017 finding ways to support these remaining populations in agricultural landscapes is key to prevent further declines in places where managed honey bees apis mellifera the most commonly used pollinator to meet crop pollination requirements carreck and williams 1998 are declining a good understanding of the foraging behaviour of bumble bees is especially important in the united states for example the critical services of honeybees is compromised by the decline in beekeeping which has been estimated to be of around 50 during the last 50 years and expected to decline further as the africanized race of a mellifera continues to spread kremen et al 2002 carvalheiro et al 2011 buhk et al 2018 feltham et al 2015 and blaauw and isaacs 2014 provide empirical evidence that the addition of wildflowers adjacent to a crop can lead to an increase in pollination services by wild pollinators such as bumble bees however a quantification of the location quantity and type of wildflowers needed to optimize crop pollination is lacking and so the need for a model is clear h√§ussler et al 2017 model crop pollination services and show that due to an increase of pollinator population size adding strips of wildflowers around crops can have a positive long term effect over multiple seasons on crop pollination however in the same study it is also said that adding strips of wildflower can have a negative short term effect within a single season due to the competition for pollinators between flower species capera aragones et al 2021 use a spatially explicit modelling approach to show that wildflower strips can be advantageous even in the short term if the appropriate location quantity and type of wildflowers are used their model includes more complexity in bumble bee foraging behaviour than previous work particularly with respect to the influence of memory in the present work we are interested in understanding how the balance between nutritional and energy needs in bumble bee colonies changes the results predicted in capera aragones et al 2021 during their foraging bouts bees gather two different resources nectar and pollen nectar provides water and sugar and is the main source of energy for bees while pollen provides proteins lipids vitamins and minerals and is important for rearing and development nicolson 2011 ball 2007 bumble bees therefore need to forage for both pollen and nectar different flower species have different compositions of nectar and pollen hence offering different nutritional and energy resources thus pollen and nectar foraging decisions will affect the rates at which the bees visit different types of flowers these choices in turn will affect the pollination services provided to the different flower species free 1955 and recently kraus et al 2019 studied the division of labour within bumblebee colonies including the division of foragers into nectar and pollen foragers free 1955 classified bees as pollen foragers if they carry a pollen load in their corbiculae and as nectar foragers if not pollen foragers may also transport nectar but nectar foragers do not carry pollen bees showed constancy i e bees that in the last bout collected pollen were more likely to collect pollen in the next bout the proportion of pollen nectar foragers is strongly related to the needs of the colony dornhaus and chittka 2005 kraus et al 2019 free 1955 before a foraging bout bees make an evaluation of the nectar and pollen stored in the nest and then decide which resource to forage depending on which one is most limiting in this paper we first expand the model in capera aragones et al 2021 to study how the division of labour between pollen and nectar foragers and the effect of the interaction between the resource availability on the landscape and the resource needs of the colony impact the dynamics of bee movement foraging behaviour and crop pollination services we then show that our model can effectively reproduce the results of the empirical studies from free 1955 and kraus et al 2019 at the end we use our model to quantify the relationship between crop pollination services and the quantity location and relative pollen nectar proportion of the wildflower patch added adjacent to the crop it is important to note that in this work we do not include population dynamics focusing instead on the effect of the spatial distribution and type of resources on the landscape in particular agricultural landscapes tend to have plentiful monotype resources from a crop for a few weeks followed by many more weeks of much less abundant but mixed wildflower resources in our work we find that pollen rich wildflower patches planted near pollen deficient crops can result in increased pollination services to the crop even in the absence of any demographic effect if the wildflowers are planted in the correct location and provide the necessary complement to the crop resources 2 model and methods we begin with a brief overview of previous work upon which our model is built in tyson et al 2011 a spatially explicit model of honey bee dispersal is presented in this model the foraging population is divided into two sub populations one engaged in an intensive search mode bees that are actively harvesting on resource modelled using diffusion and the other engaged in an extensive search mode bees that are scouting for new resources to harvest modelled by advection in the same paper it is shown that dividing the population into two sub populations provides a better fit to organism movement data than models in which the population is considered homogeneous based on tyson et al 2011 capera aragones et al 2021 recently developed a mathematical model for wild bees in which the foraging population is split into three different interacting sub populations harvesting bees h those individuals that are collecting floral resources on the landscape and moving randomly from one flower to another by diffusion scouting bees with memory s those bees that have knowledge of the landscape and use directed flight advection to move efficiently over larger distances from one patch of flowers to another or from the nest to a patch of flowers these bees can be identified as exploiters if we follow the notation used in the empirical work done by woodgate et al 2016 scouting bees without memory s n those bees that do not have knowledge of the landscape and use directed flights advection as well as diffusion to explore the landscape and find new patches of flowers these bees are identified as explorers in woodgate et al 2016 as discussed below the division into three sub populations is necessary for a detailed description of the foraging distribution of wild bees with memory in the present paper we also divide foraging bees into these three sub populations performing different movement modes similarly to capera aragones et al 2021 in our work model bees move between the mentioned sub populations at rates that depend on both resource density and the density of bees of each type for example scouting bees with memory at location x are likely to become harvesters at x as the floral resource density at x increases the density of resource in the landscape affects the transitions between bee sub populations and the sub populations affect the density of resource in the landscape via resource depletion bees are required to return to the nest to unload the resource collected after each foraging bout that is they are central place foragers in contrast to previous work from moorcroft et al 2006 and capera aragones et al 2021 where the central place foraging behaviour is included by adding a constant bias advection towards the nest to the foraging population in the present work we model the central place foraging by assuming that harvesters are continually teleported to the nest at a constant rate see eq 2 1 teleporting is used because it implies that harvesters reach the nest at a specific moment in time which is not the case with a linear advection term at which time bees can decide between becoming a pollen or a nectar scouting bee depending on the pollen and nectar storage in the nest one of the key contributions in capera aragones et al 2021 is the inclusion of memory effects in a spatial differential equation model for bee foraging memory is an important tool used by bees to improve their foraging efficiency based on findings of radar tracking studies of bees woodgate et al 2017 2016 lihoreau et al 2012 2013 capera aragones et al 2021 include memory by making the sub population of scouting bees with memory to be more likely to fly advectively in a chosen flight direction that is those bees with knowledge of the landscape are less likely to use direct motion advection on a random direction and more likely to use the direct motion towards those locations where they remember finding resources by contrast to other recent approaches such shi et al 2019a b and oliveira and berbert 2020 in this work we use the one developed in capera aragones et al 2021 the main difference and contribution of this paper with respect to the model in capera aragones et al 2021 is the division of food into two different variables pollen and nectar with the consequent division of the bee population into two pollen foragers and nectar foragers this division means that the new model doubles the number of sub populations now foraging bees can be in six different states instead of only three pollen harvesters h p pollen memory scouts s p pollen no memory scouts s n p nectar harvesters h n nectar memory scouts s n and nectar no memory scouts s n n fig 1 is the compartmental diagram of the model presented in this paper table 1 is a description of the state variables used in the model for simplicity we assume that pollen foragers including pollen harvesters pollen memory scouts and pollen no memory scouts do not interact with nectar foragers nectar harvesters nectar memory scouts and nectar no memory scouts outside the nest that is once a forager has decided to harvest pollen it cannot become a nectar forager or vice versa until its current foraging bout has finished this resource specialization to either pollen or nectar broadly not type of pollen or nectar during a single foraging bout is based on the empirical results found in free 1955 and hagbery and nieh 2012 following this empirical evidence the interaction between pollen and nectar foragers occurs only in the nest at the beginning of each foraging bout the interaction is such that nectar foragers are likely to become pollen foragers if the proportion of pollen stores relative to the pollen requirements of the colony Œ∏ p r p is smaller than the proportion of nectar stores relative to the nectar requirements of the colony Œ∏ n r n and are likely to continue as a nectar forager if the colony s needs are reversed similarly former pollen foragers may or may not switch to nectar foraging at the beginning of a new foraging bout our model considers the time evolution of the pollen stored r p and nectar stored r n in the nest to be a function of the pollen nectar collected by harvesters and the pollen nectar consumed by all bees mathematically we can express the model presented in this paper by the set of partial integro differential eqs 2 1 given as in box i where all parameters are defined in the table 2 œï b c b a c k n represents the nectar production at time t and position x by crop flowers b wildflowers w and background flowers b a c k all together œï b c b a c k p is equivalent to œï b c b a c k n but for pollen production m r l n p are the memory functions which are defined for each pollen and nectar forager independently and take the same form as in capera aragones et al 2021 2 2a m r n p x t Œ∫ m r n p x Œ∑ 0 x h n p x 2 œÄ œÉ

memory over time and œÉ the standard deviation of the spatial memory kernel m r n p and m l n p are respectively the rates at which a left right moving scout switches direction i e becomes right left

transition rate from scouting to harvesting in the presence of n or p and Œ± is the half saturation constant that determines when the switching rates Œ≥ 1 and Œ≥ 2 are strongly or weakly resource dependent the parameter k h s gives the maximum transition rate from harvesting to scouting see box i 2 1 metrics in the next section we will use the model described to evaluate crop pollination services depending on the location quantity and pollen nectar proportion of the wildflower patch added adjacent to the crop fig 2 is a schematic representation of the one dimensional landscapes that we will be studying in this section we define the metrics that we will use to describe and quantify the output of our model apart from measuring the number of harvesting bees scouting bees with memory and scouting bees without memory on pollen and nectar h n h p s n s p s n n s n p we are interested in measuring the resource collected pollen and nectar across the landscape which we consider to be

quantity of pollen and nectar collected from crop flowers and wildflowers in a specific location at a specific time we can also compute it over the entire landscape integrating with respect to space at a particular time or during a specific time interval integrating with respect to time note that in eq 2 4a the term œï b p œï b w b a c k p h p refers to the amount of pollen harvesters which are collecting pollen from crop flowers and k h u p p p Œ± p refers to the saturating dependence of resource collection similarly for the other cases in eqs 2 4d 2 2 numerical approach the model described

no flux boundary conditions to all the state variables involving movement 2 7 h n p x t x s n p x t x s n n p x 0 for x 0 l and t 0 to solve the system of equations we used a fractional step method to decouple the distinct modelling processes in eqs 2 1 and the best suited numerical method for each of the processes was applied sequentially see tyson et al 2000 in a first stage we solved the diffusion and advection terms using an implicit tr bdf2 method hosea and shampine 1996 and in a second stage we solved the non linear reaction terms using an explicit rk4 method la et al 2002 to solve the integrals in eqs 2 2b we used the simpson rule the spatial step used was 50 m and the time step 1 s 3 results 3 1 effect of the division of food into pollen and nectar on foraging spatial distributions in this section we show how the new mechanism added in model eqs 2 1 to account for the balance between nutrition and energy needs of foragers produce the characteristic behaviours of bumble bees observed in free 1955 first we investigate the changes in the proportion of nectar and pollen foragers as a consequence of changes in landscape resource availability fig 3 left we show that the higher the proportion of pollen nectar resource availability in the landscape the smaller the proportion of pollen nectar foragers in the colony this inverse proportion occurs because fewer bees are needed to gather the necessary quantity of the easily accessed resource second we examine the foraging behaviour responses to in nest nectar pollen storage depletion in fig 3 right we use our model to show how the numbers of pollen and nectar foragers depend on the quantities nectar and pollen stored in the nest to obtain the results in fig 3 down right we held the stored resource values r p r n constant at the values indicated in fig 3 top right for the rest of this paper we do not fix the resource stored in nest instead it increases or decreases over time according to eq 2 1 3 2 wildflower plantings benefit crop pollination in this section we evaluate how the balance between nutritional and energy needs affects the spatial distribution of bees in the presence of flower species with different pollen nectar proportions bees can be strongly biased towards the location of one flower species or another depending on the colony s needs the landscapes under consideration in this section will always consist of a crop and a nesting site at fixed locations a wildflower patch and a uniform low density wildflower matrix wildflower background see fig 4 top for a depiction of the linear landscape under consideration in order to study the possible benefits of a wildflower patch enhancement on crop pollination services we will look at the pollination services as a function of four different variables wildflower patch location the position of the wildflower patch is defined in a 4 km landscape where there is a nest site fixed at position l 2 km and a crop of width 0 5 km centred at l 2 5 km wildflower patch quantity the quantity of resource in the wildflower patch is defined relative to the quantity of resource in the crop for example a wildflower patch quantity of 10 means the total amount of resource in the wildflower patch is 10 times smaller than that in the crop wildflower patch differentiation type we define wildflower differentiation in relation to the crop that is we wish to define a metric where a wildflower differentiation of 100 means that the wildflower resources are completely different in pollen and nectar composition from the crop resources while a wildflower differentiation of 0 means that the compositions are exactly the same we thus define wildflower differentiation as a percentage given by 3 8 100 Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 2 where 3 9a Œ¥ a wf pollen quantity wf quantity crop nectar quantity crop quantity 3 9b Œ¥ b wf nectar quantity wf quantity crop pollen quantity crop quantity and Œ¥ a and Œ¥ b range between 0 and 2 and satisfy Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 2 we are assuming that the wildflower pollen quantity relative to the wildflower quantity is the same as the crop nectar quantity relative to the crop quantity and vice versa where nectar and pollen are swapped this assumption enables a simpler interpretation of the results using eqs 3 8 and 3 9 wildflower differentiation of 100 corresponds to Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 2 0 or 0 2 in the first case wildflowers only produce pollen whereas crop flowers only produce nectar the second case represents the opposite scenario in contrast wildflower differentiation 0 occurs when Œ¥ a Œ¥ b 1 1 and both wildflowers and crop flowers produce the same proportion of pollen and nectar wildflower background density in addition to the crop field and the added wildflower patch the landscape under consideration also includes a low density uniform distributed wildflower background the density of the wildflower background is a measure of agricultural intensity where low densities represent intensively farmed landscapes with few wildflower resources other than the crop we can measure the wildflower background density by comparing its integral over all the landscape to the quantity of resource in the crop fig 4 shows the crop pollination services as a function of the wildflower patch location left plot and the crop pollination services as a function of the wildflower patch location and wildflower patch quantity right plot we show the pollination services for six different wildflower differentiation values ranging from 0 to 100 regarding the location of the wildflower patch enhancement our results in fig 4 show that planting the wildflowers in a location such that the crop is between the wildflowers and the nest site wildflowers at l 3 km where the nest is at l 2 km and the crop is at l 2 5 km is a consistently good location regardless of changes in the wildflower differentiation and wildflower quantity we can also observe that wildflowers planted close to the nest site l 2 km can lead to the highest increase in crop pollination services if the differentiation is large differentiation 100 but lead to the highest decrease in crop pollination services if the differentiation is low differentiation 100 planting the wildflowers in the same location as the crop l 2 5 km appears to be disadvantageous in the majority of cases whereas planting the wildflowers between the crop and the nest site appears to be in all cases less advantageous than when the wildflowers are planted such that the crop is between them and the nest site regarding the quantity of the wildflower patch enhancement we observe that when the differentiation is large differentiation 80 higher quantities are always more advantageous than lower quantities by contrast for smaller differentiation values differentiation 80 intermediate quantity values are the most advantageous with high quantities located close to the nest site being the most disadvantageous and small quantity values located in the far edge of the crop with respect to the nest being the most advantageous with respect to the differentiation of the wildflower patch enhancement the tendency shown in fig 4 is clear the higher the differentiation the higher the increase in pollination services associated with planting wildflowers fig 5 shows how the wildflower background affects the predictions in fig 4 in fig 5 we can see that the smaller the wildflower background density the more intense the agriculture the larger the benefits of adding a wildflower patch to crop pollination services fig 6 shows the increase in crop pollination services as a function of the wildflower background density for three different wildflower patch densities and three different wildflower patch differentiation our results highlight that the greater the wildflower differentiation value the larger the benefits of adding a wildflower patch the increase in pollination services can vary between 0 to more than 80 the more dense the wildflower patch the higher the benefit though for wildflowers very similar to the crop low differentiation smaller wildflower densities give better results see fig 6 top the smaller the density of the wildflower background the larger the benefit of planting wildflowers that is the more intense the agriculture the greater the benefit of planting a wildflower patch for the simulations in figs 4 6 the total number of foragers is b 6000 and the total amount of resource produced by the crop is œï b n œï b p d x 25000 mg h the total amount of resource produced by the wildflower patch and wildflower background is scenario dependent it is important to note that rather than the absolute value of b or œï b n œï b p d x what changes the output of our simulations is their relative values i e how big is the crop with respect to the existent population of bees in the landscape in this work the relative values are chosen such that a significant fraction of the resources are consumed 4 discussion in this paper we expand the model presented in capera aragones et al 2021 to incorporate the effects of the balance between the two floral resources i e pollen nutrition and nectar energy on bumble bee spatial distributions we divide the forager population into two groups pollen foragers and nectar foragers and assume that foragers switch between groups depending on the colony needs this assumption is consistent with free 1955 and with the observation that colonies with a large amount of brood forage more often for pollen than colonies with a smaller brood population because of increasing pollen needs associated with brood development kraus et al 2019 in addition to the modelling of the two resource types and the two foraging populations associated to them in the present paper we applied central place foraging behaviour using a different method than in capera aragones et al 2021 it is relevant to note that the different method does not change the model predictions significantly if correct parameter values are used the method used in the present paper assumes that harvesters stop foraging and return to the nest at a constant per capita rate the result is a decrease in the harvesting population in order to keep the population of bees constant we add a source of scouting bees at the nest location so that the number of scouts emerging at the nest location is equal to the number of harvesters disappearing from the landscape in other words we assume that harvesting bees become scouts in the nest and ignore the travel time the advantage of using this approach to model central place foraging behaviour is that it enables foragers to constantly decide between becoming a pollen or a nectar scouting bee depending on the pollen and nectar storage in the nest see eq 2 1 thus allowing us to easily incorporate the effects of the balance between nutrition and energy needs 4 1 effects of the division of food into pollen and nectar free 1955 and vaudo et al 2015 find that bumblebees forage for pollen or nectar in proportion to the needs of the colony in our work we consider a relatively short period of time during which we can assume a constant population and constant colony needs based on free 1955 and vaudo et al 2015 we assumed that bumble bees forage for pollen and nectar with the goal of storing three times as much nectar as pollen as a consequence we found the proportion of pollen nectar foragers to be inversely proportional to the proportion of pollen nectar resource in the landscape but insensitive to the total amount of resource available see fig 3 further work is needed to determine whether it is simply the proportion of each type of resource that matters or if it is also the total quantity of resource or some combination of these two measures in fig 3 right we use our model to reproduce some of the experiments in free 1955 in which the reserves of pollen or nectar in nest are depleted and a subsequent increase of pollen or nectar foragers are respectively observed these results provide qualitative support for our model 4 2 wildflower plantings benefit crop pollination in our earlier work capera aragones et al 2021 we showed that adding intermediate wildflower quantities in a location such that the crop is between the nest site and the wildflowers lead to the largest increase in crop pollination services in the present paper in addition to the location and quantity of wildflowers we investigated the effects of the pollen and nectar composition of the wildflower patch differentiation or type relative to the crop and the effects of the density of the wildflower background matrix in the landscape our results in fig 4 show that the greater the difference between the pollen nectar composition of the wild and crop flowers the larger the benefit provided by planted wildflowers to crop pollination services in the differentiation 0 case in which the composition of the wild and crop flowers is the same the addition of wildflowers provides only a small benefit and only if planted in small quantities and in the right location if planted in large quantities and in a wrong location the presence of wildflowers can significantly decrease the pollination services of the crop this is due to competition between flower species for pollinators in the differentiation 100 case moment in which the resource composition of wild and crop flowers is completely different the benefits are significant independent of the location and quantity of wildflowers planted it is relevant to note that for the case in which the two flower species are completely different in composition they never compete for pollinators and so adding wildflowers never decreases the pollination services of the crop in the case of wildflowers with an intermediate differentiation value say 10 to 90 the interpretation of the results is harder to generalize since depending on the location and quantities adding wildflowers can lead to large increases or decreases in crop pollination services figs 5 and 6 show how the decrease of wildflower density in the background which represents an increase in agricultural intensity enhances the tendencies observed in fig 4 we can therefore conclude that intensively farmed landscapes stand most to benefit from the practice of planting wildflower patches adjacent to crops looking at fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 we arrive at the following conclusions regarding the benefits to crop pollination services of adding a wildflower patch the more different in pollen nectar composition is the wildflower patch with respect to the crop high differentiation the larger the benefits locating the wildflowers at the far side of the crop with respect to the nest site is consistently a good location with respect to changes in the differentiation or quantity of the wildflower patch enhancement or changes in the density of the wildflower background locating the wildflower patch close to the nest site can be most beneficial if the differentiation is high 100 but can be most detrimental for crop pollination if the differentiation is low large quantities of wildflower plantations are most beneficial if they have a high differentiation value but small quantities are better if the differentiation value is small see fig 6 the lower the density of the wildflower background the larger the benefit of planting wildflowers that is the more intense the agriculture the greater the benefit of planting a wildflower patch 5 conclusions in this paper we investigated how the balance between nutrition pollen and energy nectar needs affect the spatial distribution of foraging bumblebees and the resulting pollination services they provide to a crop we focused on a landscape consisting of two flower species the crop and a wildflower patch that can vary in pollen and nectar concentrations our findings show that in landscapes where pollen and nectar resources are not uniformly distributed the balance between nutrition and energy needs can significantly affect the spatial distribution of foraging bumblebees our result is consistent with field studies indicating that bumble bees are selective about the floral resources they gather vaudo et al 2015 we find that crop pollination is maximized when two conditions are satisfied first the crop is located between the nest and the wildflower patch and second the floral resources offered by the wildflowers are significantly different from the resources offered by the crop flowers this situation can occur for example if the crop flowers are deficient in certain nutrients that are present in the wildflower resources and vice versa in addition we find that only small quantities of wildflowers are needed to maximize crop pollination services when the composition of the wildflowers and the crop are similar whereas large quantities are most beneficial when the wildflowers are very different in composition from crop flowers we also showed how our predictions change as a function of the wildflower background density which is a measure of the intensity with which the landscape is farmed intensively farmed monoculture landscapes are often nutritionally deficient girard et al 2012 topitzhofer et al 2019 in our work we find that the benefits of planting wildflowers adjacent to a crop increase as the agriculture becomes more intense we note here that such landscapes are also subjected to high pesticide use which detrimentally affect bee foraging and populations the addition of wildflower patches that are not subjected to chemical control can potentially boost the benefits found in this work we emphasize that the benefits we found are not due to a pollinator population effect as our model does not include population dynamics but only to the effect of the balance between nutrition and energy on pollinator spatial distributions h√§ussler et al 2017 pointed out that demographic effects can further augment the benefits of planting wildflower patches our work is an indication that spatial aspects of the system are also important we therefore suggest that maximal effectiveness of wildflower patches can be achieved by combining spatial considerations with those aimed at supporting population dynamics credit authorship contribution statement pau capera aragones lead investigator

24448,modeling the forest fire phenomena represents one of the most challenging and difficult problems which need further investigations many research works have tackled this issue by developing simulation models in order to investigate the impact of climate change on fire spread behavior in our previous work a forest fire spread model has been introduced the developed model takes into account some parameters that affect this phenomenon such as topography land use nature and density of vegetation humidity and wind by only considering uniform wind direction and speed the work presented in this paper provides an improvement of this model for being integrated in real sitting scenarios in fact a model of wind flow has been proposed it is able to determine accurately the wind direction and speed according to the topography and land use the proposed model was evaluated using dataset from a region in the north of morocco and results are reported to show the impact of the dynamic behavior of the wind on fire propagation keywords modeling and simulation cellular automata wind flow forest fire 1 introduction the research community from the fire ecology has put more emphasize as a scientific discipline on the development of models in order to further study and investigate the fire spread and its relationship with the surrounding environment developing accurate models represents the most challenging and difficult problems in this discipline albini and brown 1996 the aim is to predict the fire spread in order to efficiently controlling and limiting its propagation while forest fires are essential for renewing the contributor of the ecological cycle russo et al 2016 shatford et al 2007 they cause however irreversible environmental and socio economic damages the scientific apprehension of the phenomenon still remains impregnated by an attraction for the local explanation of the conditions of appearance and propagation of fires thus the usual assessment of a natural phenomenon in a territory is most often carried out according to a dynamic approach which built on the basis of climatic variables wind humidity temperature topographic and land use variables nature and porosity of vegetation human density agricultural areas etc maciel et al 2021 lichtenegger and schappacher 2009 bettaibi and jellouli 2021 many researchers have developed models in order to study the impact of climate change on fire spread encinas et al 2007 progias and sirakoulis 2013 rothermel 1972 for instance authors in bergeron and flannigan 1995 and jenkins et al 2001 explored the link between climate change and fire frequency they have used daily data from the canadian atmospheric environment service s general circulation model in order to calculate components of the canadian forest fire weather index fwi system a large study in cochrane 2003 addressed the fire behavior land cover effects environmental impacts and climate feedbacks in order to understand the coupling atmosphere fire it is worth noting that wind and slope are considered as one of the most environmental factors affecting the way in which forest fire spread bountzouklis et al 2021 viegas 2004 these two parameters have a significant effect on fire behavior byram 1959 bettaibi and jellouli 2021 the wind effect is twofold on the one hand it accelerates the combustion by oxygen supply and on the other hand it covers the flames and increases the influence of fire on the vegetation the slope effect is often described as similar as the wind effect in fact at high altitudes the influence of the earth s surface on the wind flow is practically insignificant while in the lower air layers the friction against the surface of the ground has a significant influence on the direction and the speed of the wind morandini et al 2002 2005 an overall understanding of the interaction between the wind and fire is one of the key challenges in predicting the forest fires spread the question is how these two parameters influence the dynamic behavior of the wind is there any impact of a dynamic behavior of the wind on forest fire spread numerous works have been carried out using cellular automata ca approach for modeling the forest fire phenomena ca was introduced by von neumann in 1966 has been extensively used as an approach for modeling complex systems hoekstra et al 2010 it has been applied to investigate several phenomena in different disciplines where local interactions are involved such as in biology fluid dynamics nerves model excitable media forest fire and training patterns some of these research works have studied the simulation structure of a fire growth model and proposed methods of planning forest management activities in a spatial scheme scattered grouped random and regular ager et al 2020 ntinas et al 2016 finney 2004 while others have developed ca models in order to describe the dynamics of forest fire propagation taking into account the factors that influence this phenomenon jiang et al 2021 alexandridis et al 2011 in our previous work we have introduced a model of forest fire spread using the ca approach jellouli et al 2016 the proposed model takes into account the main parameters that affect this phenomenon like nature and density of vegetation humidity wind and altitude we developed a decision aided tool with java which allows to analyze and format several hybrid collected data satellite images digital terrain model relatively to each studied area the generated scenarios of forest fire spread in the study area were considered as a guide for strategies in control and prevention of forest fires as an application we considered the watershed oued laou morocco in the present work a wind flow model has been proposed it is able to determine the wind direction and speed taking into account the topography and climate data of the studied area the improvement of the forest fire model is made by coupling it with the wind flow model in order to have a dynamic behavior of wind on fire spread a software tool is developed to couple the two models and to compare results to forest fire historical data in the region of oued boukhalef area north morocco this tool can be used to simulate and evaluate the performance of fire spread models as well as to better design the protection and rescue infrastructure in particular firebreak vegetation cuts access tracks and water points jellouli et al 2019 2 materials and methods in this work we will study on one hand the influence of the wind and the slope on the dynamic behavior of the wind and in another hand to investigate the impacts of this dynamic behavior on forest fire spread the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 1 and consists of the following modeling the wind flow using ca approach by taking into account the physical terrain attributes altitude and land use coupling the developed ca model with the forest fire model taking into account the fundamental parameters that impact the fire trajectory and their combined effects humidity uniform wind direction and speed vegetation types and density and the altitude levels obtained results from the wind flow model are provided as input data wind direction and speed saved in each cell computing as an output the fire propagation and the vulnerable areas according to the dynamic wind behavior 2 1 ca approach an overview ca first introduced by von neumann in 1966 has been extensively used as an approach for modeling complex systems it has been applied to investigate several phenomena in different discipline where local interactions are involved such as in biology fluid dynamics nerves model excitable media forest fire and training patterns ca is considered as a discrete dynamical system formed by a set of cells each cell contains a state which changes at every discrete step of time according to transition rules chopard and droz 2005 deutsch and dormann 2007 slimi and el yacoubi 2009 more formally definition 2 1 a ca is defined by the quadruple a l s n f where l called lattice or cellular space is a set of cells c spread a cell is denoted by c i j in a two dimensional domain s called states set is a discrete set of values numbers or symbol it includes the possible states that take each cell c at each time n named neighborhood is a set of cells for a c cell affecting its evolution over time n is the neighborhood size which is the cardinality of the set n c f is a transition function that defines the local dynamics of the studied system lattice geometry the lattice geometry in the regular case l depends on its dimension d in the mono dimensional l is limited to a linear cord where the elements can be arranged in a straight line in the two dimensions the lattices can be triangular rectangular or hexagonal while in three dimensions the lattice used and relatively easy to represent is the cubic geometry neighborhood types the cell s neighborhood is a set of cells that are interconnected with it see fig 2 1d is the uniform type which considers the two cells in right and left it is represented as a segment 2d the well known is the von neumann neighborhood which consider 4 neighbor cells and moore neighborhood which consider 8 neighbor cells for the square geometry of the lattice as well as the uniform neighborhood for the hexagonal geometry of the lattice which consider neighbor cells 3d the uniform type is the most used boundary conditions in the formal definition of cellular automata it is generally necessary to let the lattice be infinite however it is impossible to implement and simulate an infinite network on a computer therefore we must introduce boundary condition mainly we deal with three kinds of conditions periodic reflexible and fixed the periodic boundary condition simultaneously glue the opposite sides of the lattice which causes a loop for a 1d lattice and leads to the topology of torus for a two dimensional lattice for an infinite lattice the periodic boundary condition remains the most efficient way to simulate them therefore they are often used the reflective boundary condition it is obtained by reflecting the lattice at the border this is an appropriate approach where the system to be simulated has a limit but the values of physical quantities are not fixed e g diffusion system the fixed boundary condition obtained by simple prescription of a fixed value for the cell on the border this boundary condition corresponds to the limit state of dirichlet for the partial differential equation edp it is summarized in fig 3 initial conditions in most cases the initial conditions or the initial configuration determine the evolution of a considered model the initial conditions which are in the initial time noted t 0 are arbitrarily constructed based on the problem considered or are generated randomly it is expressed by the function 1 s t 0 l s c i j s t 0 c i j transition rules the most important aspect of a cellular automata is constituted by the set of transition rules these rules are defined by the function f depending on the geometry of the lattice the neighborhood the state set and the considered phenomenon it defines maps from n c to s i e the state s t œÑ 1 at time t œÑ 1 in a cell c is determined in function of the state s t œÑ of neighbor cells n c at time s t œÑ it can be given by f s n c s s t œÑ n c s t œÑ 1 c 2 2 wind flow model using ca te wind flow constitutes a spatio temporal dynamical system we denote the ca model of the wind flow phenomena by a w l s w n f w 1 the lattice l w it is the results of a discretized space by two dimensional cells each cell denoted by c i j has its own physical attributes topographic slope land use 2 the states set s w it contains different combinations of wind directions and speeds level we consider the following s w n and e for the direction from north to south from east to west from south to north and from west to east respectively we denoted the combination of two or three directions in the same cell i e double or triple generally observed when there is an obstacle we denote sw s w double direction nsw n s w triple direction etc see fig 4 in addition we denote i and r as no wind and riptide wind respectively we summarize the states set in the table 1 standard weak medium and strong wind speeds are represented respectively by the levels 0 1 2 and 3 remark 1 the wind speed levels are made by a classification of the maximum and the minimum wind speed of the studied area in fact we determine the maximum and the minimum wind speed from meteorological data of the studied area and the difference between them is devised by the levels number that we choose the states set of wind flow model is then given as s w i r n 0 n 1 n 2 n 3 s 0 s e w 3 so the state set contains 50 states c a r d s w 50 3 the neighborhood n w we consider the von neumann neighborhood type this choice was made in order to seamlessly couple this model with the forest fire model in jellouli et al 2016 in which the von neumann neighborhood type was used 4 the transition rules f w as mentioned in the problem statement we take account of two parameters land use and topographic slopes in order to determine the wind direction and speed in each cell fig 4 illustrates some behavior of the wind flow principle i e the wind flow in the same direction of the initial wind source when the wind finds a higher altitude it distributes in directions covering the obstacle which increases the wind speed and changes its direction when the wind finds a less altitude it turns in circle which we called riptide wind so we consider that each cell is characterized by two parameters t t œÑ p t œÑ we consider the following notations a l t c i j altitude level c c i j neighbor of c i j upwind c i j œÄ 2 obtained by œÄ 2 rotation from the cell c i j c i j œÄ 2 obtained by œÄ 2 rotation from the cell c i j we illustrate in the following example the position of the above denoted cells when the wind is blowing from west to east auto Œ± t œÑ c i j wind flow index between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 t t œÑ c i j wind type at time t œÑ riptide normal unidirectional double double direction triple triple direction t r t œÑ c i j wind type received from neighboring cells between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 p t œÑ c i j wind speed at time t œÑ level 0 of wind speed p s level 1 of wind speed level 2 of wind speed level 3 of wind speed p r t œÑ c i j wind speed received from neighboring cells between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 the transition rules is considered as the effect of two processes of wind receive distribute that occur between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 locally in a cell in order to determine the wind flow f w r e c e i v e d i s t r i b u t e where the sign refers to a mutual action those parameters are determined in two phases phase of exchanging wind between cells in which we associate a received type and speed of wind to a neighboring cell upwind between iterations i e between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 by taking into account the two characterization t t œÑ p t œÑ of the cell first we compare the altitude level which represents the land use and the topographic slopes the wind will be distributed after crashing with higher altitude or it will continue flowing when finding the same altitude otherwise it will turn in circle in a lower altitude if a l t c c i j a l t c i j then t r t œÑ c c i j r i p t i d e p r t œÑ c c i j p s else t r t œÑ c c i j n o r m a l p r t œÑ c c i j p t œÑ c i j Œ± t œÑ c i j we consider Œ± t œÑ c i j as the number of cells in which the wind will be distributed after crashing with higher altitude thus in our case using the von neumann neighborhood type Œ± t œÑ c i j 1 2 3 the rare case of wind volteface is not considered to determine the value of Œ± t œÑ c i j we have to compare furthermore the altitude of c i j cell with that of c i j œÄ 2 and c i j œÄ 2 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then t r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 n o r m a l p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 p t œÑ c i j Œ± t œÑ c i j else t r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 r i p t i d e p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 p s if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then t r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 n o r m a l p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 p t œÑ c i j Œ± t œÑ c i j else t r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 r i p t i d e p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 p s consequently we can determine the value of Œ± t œÑ c i j as follow if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 1 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 3 phase of determining the wind characteristic for each own cell we determine the two characterization of the cell at t œÑ 1 i e t t œÑ 1 c i j p t œÑ 1 c i j according to t r t œÑ c i j p t œÑ c i j and Œ± t œÑ c i j direction it is established according to the altitude level of the upwind cells indeed Œ± t œÑ c i j determines the wind flow as normal or it splits double or triple direction according to a parameter if t t œÑ c i j n o r m a l then if Œ± t œÑ c i j 1 then t t œÑ 1 c i j n o r m a l if Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 then t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e if Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 then t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e if Œ± t œÑ c i j 3 then t t œÑ 1 c i j t r i p l e if t t œÑ c i j r i p t i d e then t t œÑ 1 c i j r i p t i d e speed the wind speed level of each cell is a function of the received wind speed from the neighboring cells it is defined by p t œÑ 1 c i j p r t œÑ c c i j Œ± t œÑ c c i j p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 Œ± t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 Œ± t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 this function determines the speed s level in the cell at t œÑ 1 it has no physical aspect example to explain how the state is determined we consider these examples the wind source is from west to east s t œÑ 1 n e 2 if t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e and p t œÑ 1 c i j 2 the wind source is from west to east s t œÑ 1 s e 3 if t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e and p t œÑ 1 c i j 3 the wind source is from south to north s t œÑ 1 n e w 1 if t t œÑ 1 c i j t r i p l e and p t œÑ 1 c i j 1 the wind source is from east to west s t œÑ 1 w 2 if t t œÑ 1 c i j n o r m a l and p t œÑ 1 c i j 2 5 initial conditions to study how the wind flows in the space we need as initial conditions the wind source and initial wind speed which will be taken from the weather data of the studied area 6 boundary conditions we choose the reflexive boundary conditions in order to ensure the exchange of a wind flow between inside and outside of the lattice in through the lattice border 2 3 coupling wind and fire models the ca model a i l s i n f i for the dynamical prediction of the forest fires spread developed in jellouli et al 2016 took into account the fundamental parameters which impact the speed and the direction of fire and their combined effects humidity wind direction and speed vegetation types and density and the altitude levels while an uniform wind direction and speed has been considered the model of the wind flow determining the wind direction and speed in each cell is used to improve the forest fire spread model this has allowed us to study the effect of the wind flow on fire spread rate as illustrated in fig 1 the model is based on the states set s i 0 1 2 3 4 of the fire spread model where we improved the transition rules given in jellouli et al 2016 by incorporating the wind flow and the fire spread models to illustrate their dynamical behavior the flow chart of fig 1 presents the coupling approach between the two models the parameters affecting the fire spread tacked into account in the transition rules f i are 1 vegetation type and density we determine a burning velocity in each cell which changed with time according to the vegetation type and density represented by a burning duration t f i r e 2 humidity three rates of humidity are considered Œ± 0 Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 and represent respectively dry wet and very wet rate the humidity denoted by h affects the burning duration t f i r e i e if h Œ± 0 then t f i r e is short if h Œ± 1 then t f i r e is long and if h Œ± 2 then t f i r e is very long which means that the fire will not propagate at all 3 wind direction we made a modification to the transition rules to set a specific fire spread direction by neglecting inactive cells where the wind flow will not spread when verifying neighborhood set n c i j 4 wind speed when determining speed s level by the wind flow model described in section 2 2 we define radius of the neighborhood set n c i j 5 altitude the fire spread always follows the growing slope and it can rarely spread in decreasing slope mainly when the wind intervenes to ensure that we have to exclude the neighboring cells with an inferior level the transition rules are represented as follows fire spreads if there is a plant cover the humidity is weak and the existence of a burned cell in the neighboring cells which depend on the wind if s t œÑ c i j 0 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 1 if s t 0 c i j contains plant and k l c k l n c i j with s t œÑ c k l 1 a n d h Œ± 2 0 otherwise ignited vegetation state to burning vegetation state if s t œÑ c i j 1 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 2 after a combustion period t fire burning vegetation state becomes cold burning vegetation state ash if s t œÑ c i j 2 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 2 if r r r t fire 3 o t h e r w i s e cells become empty if s t œÑ c i j 3 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 4 in this paper we do not consider vegetation recovery thus the cell remains empty if s t œÑ c i j 4 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 4 for more details about our previous model we refer reader to jellouli et al 2016 3 performance evaluation the oued boukhalef watershed region was used as a case study for model application and validation 3 1 studied area the oued boukhalef watershed is a plain region located in the tangier city in northern morocco between the northern latitudes 35 702 and 35 775 and the longitudes west 5 855 and 5 948 fig 5 a leading to the atlantic ocean it covers an area of 34 29 km 2 and it stretches from the northeast to the southwest over a length of 8200 km and an average of 5 km from the southeast to the northwest this basin has a large variation in elevations ranging from 3 to 275 m fig 5 b the watershed of oued boukhalef is subject to a periodic forest fires occurring especially in summer it is usually due to the high temperatures and favorable windy conditions 3 2 simulation tool data collection and processing a simulation software tool has been developed in our previous work in jellouli et al 2016 it allows us to perform several tasks such as data import layer management data analysis and simulation together with results visualization the graphical interface of this software tool is depicted in fig 6 the tool s interface includes two parts option and data using the option bar we are able to define the states of the fundamental parameters that act according to the nature of the phenomenon such as wind direction humidity etc as for the data bar it allows loading the txt ascii files by processing actual data of the dtm it allows also manual data processing by drawing a domain and integrating our own data in this work we extended the tool in order to simulate the wind flow model and then use the obtained results as input data to the forest fire spread model before any data processing it is first necessary to collect the required and available data first of all it is a question of carrying out the processing of satellite images by an unsupervised isodata classification in the image to highlight the land use classes of a region then we are called upon to produce or create the digital terrain model dtm from the digitization of contour lines and points on topographic maps of a region and then collect the meteorological data wind direction and speed humidity the data collected is subsequently restructured in a way that respects the requirements of our software but this remains relatively ambiguous in order to do so we have developed an appropriate methodology for formatting the data which consists mainly of converting the formatted data raster image or pixel into a file txt ascii at the same time all data was digitized and processed using gis and algorithms developed under java in order to be imported into our software tool 3 3 simulation process and results after collecting and formatting the data in its appropriate form the pixels are stored according to a lattice of cells throughout columns and rows this mesh is automatically established by our software based on the ca model and the extracted data dtm and land use of the study area through developed algorithms that process ca data and transition rules the number type and size of the lattice cells are determined based on the resolution of the scale in the satellite image then the data is loaded into the appropriate software environment using the data import algorithms developed through java technology after loading the dtm data and land cover into our software on the one hand we generate a synthetic map of the dtm that represents the altitude map for the study area with a classification of altitude levels distributed in ten classes and on the other hand a synthetic map of land use that exposes us the targeted region with all types of land use in each cell the final map is obtained by consisting of superimposing the layers of information since this region is characterized generally in summer period of forest fire by west to east winds we have the wind source coming from west to east the flowchart in fig a 12 summarizes all the steps taken during this process after all these steps simulations can be conducted and results will be reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach we first show results related to the wind flow model and then those related to its integration with the forest fire model are reported 3 3 1 simulation results of the wind flow model first we simulate the wind flow by taking into account the land use and the topographic slopes of the watershed of oued boukhalef using the proposed ca model the software tool generates as results the wind distribution and speed maps as shown in figs 7 c and 7 d respectively the simulation results shown in fig 8 reveal that the wind speed obtained from our software is always powerful in height altitude levels indeed cells with high speed level red color in fig 8 a match with cells of higher topographic slopes in fig 8 b this is consistent with the fact that wind referring to the airflow from a higher pressure region to a lower pressure region the airflow is slowed by friction between the air and adjacent objects since obstacles that are close to the ground such as building structures plants etc disturb the airflow causing a greater friction force the airflow close to the ground is therefore slower on the contrary there is less friction in a higher area that is more exposed the air circulates faster and therefore stronger winds the wind direction and speed in each cell obtained from the wind flow model is then used in forest fire model as input data and output results are presented in next section 3 3 2 simulation results of the improved forest fire model in order to illustrate the effect of wind flow on forest fire spread rate we consider the same studied area in section 2 3 the watershed of oued boukhalef we choose 4 random fire launching points geznaya boukhalef jebila and mesnana and ones knowing by periodic forest fire mediouna in different regions of the oued boukhalef watershed as illustrated in fig 9 b after simulating the wind flow model and extracting the wind data for each cell direction and speed 7 b 7 c we made two separate simulations ones with an uniform wind direction and speed and others with coupling the forest fire spread model with the wind flow model to take account of the dynamic behavior of the wind at the end we compare results 3 4 discussion as result we find that the areas of gznaya boukhalef jebila and mesnana are not vulnerable since the fire does not spread fig 10 comparing the results obtained by our software fig 11 a and the history of the fire in the watershed fig 11 b we note that they agree on the fact that the fires are triggered and spread only in the mediouna area indeed unlike the area of mediouna which seems to be very vulnerable since the fire spreads widely these area do not contain a consistent amount of vegetation cover and are known by a large urban sprawl which prevents the fire from being visible in addition by comparing the results with uniform and dynamic wind behavior we found that the burned area in the mediouna area using the model with dynamic wind parameters is larger than the one with uniform wind parameters this is consistent with the fact that the wind flow has a significant effect on forest fire spread thus the increased fire intensity and heat transfer capacity of recurrent fires make the fire deadly to even larger thick barked trees and enlarge the vulnerable areas this was predictable due to the wind multi directions and speeds the recent example that confirms the impact of the wind on the forest fire spread and the vulnerability area is the historical fire that ravaged the mediouna forest in tangier in 08 07 2015 5 hectares of vegetation was ravaged by fire which was finally controlled thanks to the civil protection who received the help of the high commission for water and forests and the fight against desertification hceflcd of tangier also in 01 07 2017 in less than two days about 230 hectares of the forest was ravaged by fire sunday learned at the hceflcd excessive heat and strong winds 80 km h have complicated efforts to control the fire the source said 4 conclusions and perspectives in this work we first introduced a wind flow model by ca approach taking into account the topographic slope and the land uses we then investigated the impact of the dynamic behavior of wind on the forest fire spread the wind flow model determines the wind direction and speed in each cell and how it spreads thus using these results we improved subsequently the forest fire spread model proposed in jellouli et al 2016 in fact the proposed approach has been applied to simulate the wind flow and the forest fire spread in the studied area of watershed oued boukhalef using the developed computer aided simulation tool simulation results showed that the impact of a dynamic wind behavior is more important on forest fire spread as perspective the wind flow has been applied in real regions with assumed input data it would be interesting to couple the model with actual past data from a real region to determine the proper wind turbine positions furthermore the forest fire model has been applied to real regions with remotely sensed input data and selected excitation points based on the fire outbreak history it would be interesting to confirm the fire vulnerable areas that we have identified and then predict areas that might be vulnerable to fire we will then have to take into account the stochastic aspect of the cas and the coupling with the models of climate change in order to evaluate the climatic parameters that intervene in the different

24448,modeling the forest fire phenomena represents one of the most challenging and difficult problems which need further investigations many research works have tackled this issue by developing simulation models in order to investigate the impact of climate change on fire spread behavior in our previous work a forest fire spread model has been introduced the developed model takes into account some parameters that affect this phenomenon such as topography land use nature and density of vegetation humidity and wind by only considering uniform wind direction and speed the work presented in this paper provides an improvement of this model for being integrated in real sitting scenarios in fact a model of wind flow has been proposed it is able to determine accurately the wind direction and speed according to the topography and land use the proposed model was evaluated using dataset from a region in the north of morocco and results are reported to show the impact of the dynamic behavior of the wind on fire propagation keywords modeling and simulation cellular automata wind flow forest fire 1 introduction the research community from the fire ecology has put more emphasize as a scientific discipline on the development of models in order to further study and investigate the fire spread and its relationship with the surrounding environment developing accurate models represents the most challenging and difficult problems in this discipline albini and brown 1996 the aim is to predict the fire spread in order to efficiently controlling and limiting its propagation while forest fires are essential for renewing the contributor of the ecological cycle russo et al 2016 shatford et al 2007 they cause however irreversible environmental and socio economic damages the scientific apprehension of the phenomenon still remains impregnated by an attraction for the local explanation of the conditions of appearance and propagation of fires thus the usual assessment of a natural phenomenon in a territory is most often carried out according to a dynamic approach which built on the basis of climatic variables wind humidity temperature topographic and land use variables nature and porosity of vegetation human density agricultural areas etc maciel et al 2021 lichtenegger and schappacher 2009 bettaibi and jellouli 2021 many researchers have developed models in order to study the impact of climate change on fire spread encinas et al 2007 progias and sirakoulis 2013 rothermel 1972 for instance authors in bergeron and flannigan 1995 and jenkins et al 2001 explored the link between climate change and fire frequency they have used daily data from the canadian atmospheric environment service s general circulation model in order to calculate components of the canadian forest fire weather index fwi system a large study in cochrane 2003 addressed the fire behavior land cover effects environmental impacts and climate feedbacks in order to understand the coupling atmosphere fire it is worth noting that wind and slope are considered as one of the most environmental factors affecting the way in which forest fire spread bountzouklis et al 2021 viegas 2004 these two parameters have a significant effect on fire behavior byram 1959 bettaibi and jellouli 2021 the wind effect is twofold on the one hand it accelerates the combustion by oxygen supply and on the other hand it covers the flames and increases the influence of fire on the vegetation the slope effect is often described as similar as the wind effect in fact at high altitudes the influence of the earth s surface on the wind flow is practically insignificant while in the lower air layers the friction against the surface of the ground has a significant influence on the direction and the speed of the wind morandini et al 2002 2005 an overall understanding of the interaction between the wind and fire is one of the key challenges in predicting the forest fires spread the question is how these two parameters influence the dynamic behavior of the wind is there any impact of a dynamic behavior of the wind on forest fire spread numerous works have been carried out using cellular automata ca approach for modeling the forest fire phenomena ca was introduced by von neumann in 1966 has been extensively used as an approach for modeling complex systems hoekstra et al 2010 it has been applied to investigate several phenomena in different disciplines where local interactions are involved such as in biology fluid dynamics nerves model excitable media forest fire and training patterns some of these research works have studied the simulation structure of a fire growth model and proposed methods of planning forest management activities in a spatial scheme scattered grouped random and regular ager et al 2020 ntinas et al 2016 finney 2004 while others have developed ca models in order to describe the dynamics of forest fire propagation taking into account the factors that influence this phenomenon jiang et al 2021 alexandridis et al 2011 in our previous work we have introduced a model of forest fire spread using the ca approach jellouli et al 2016 the proposed model takes into account the main parameters that affect this phenomenon like nature and density of vegetation humidity wind and altitude we developed a decision aided tool with java which allows to analyze and format several hybrid collected data satellite images digital terrain model relatively to each studied area the generated scenarios of forest fire spread in the study area were considered as a guide for strategies in control and prevention of forest fires as an application we considered the watershed oued laou morocco in the present work a wind flow model has been proposed it is able to determine the wind direction and speed taking into account the topography and climate data of the studied area the improvement of the forest fire model is made by coupling it with the wind flow model in order to have a dynamic behavior of wind on fire spread a software tool is developed to couple the two models and to compare results to forest fire historical data in the region of oued boukhalef area north morocco this tool can be used to simulate and evaluate the performance of fire spread models as well as to better design the protection and rescue infrastructure in particular firebreak vegetation cuts access tracks and water points jellouli et al 2019 2 materials and methods in this work we will study on one hand the influence of the wind and the slope on the dynamic behavior of the wind and in another hand to investigate the impacts of this dynamic behavior on forest fire spread the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 1 and consists of the following modeling the wind flow using ca approach by taking into account the physical terrain attributes altitude and land use coupling the developed ca model with the forest fire model taking into account the fundamental parameters that impact the fire trajectory and their combined effects humidity uniform wind direction and speed vegetation types and density and the altitude levels obtained results from the wind flow model are provided as input data wind direction and speed saved in each cell computing as an output the fire propagation and the vulnerable areas according to the dynamic wind behavior 2 1 ca approach an overview ca first introduced by von neumann in 1966 has been extensively used as an approach for modeling complex systems it has been applied to investigate several phenomena in different discipline where local interactions are involved such as in biology fluid dynamics nerves model excitable media forest fire and training patterns ca is considered as a discrete dynamical system formed by a set of cells each cell contains a state which changes at every discrete step of time according to transition rules chopard and droz 2005 deutsch and dormann 2007 slimi and el yacoubi 2009 more formally definition 2 1 a ca is defined by the quadruple a l s n f where l called lattice or cellular space is a set of cells c spread a cell is denoted by c i j in a two dimensional domain s called states set is a discrete set of values numbers or symbol it includes the possible states that take each cell c at each time n named neighborhood is a set of cells for a c cell affecting its evolution over time n is the neighborhood size which is the cardinality of the set n c f is a transition function that defines the local dynamics of the studied system lattice geometry the lattice geometry in the regular case l depends on its dimension d in the mono dimensional l is limited to a linear cord where the elements can be arranged in a straight line in the two dimensions the lattices can be triangular rectangular or hexagonal while in three dimensions the lattice used and relatively easy to represent is the cubic geometry neighborhood types the cell s neighborhood is a set of cells that are interconnected with it see fig 2 1d is the uniform type which considers the two cells in right and left it is represented as a segment 2d the well known is the von neumann neighborhood which consider 4 neighbor cells and moore neighborhood which consider 8 neighbor cells for the square geometry of the lattice as well as the uniform neighborhood for the hexagonal geometry of the lattice which consider neighbor cells 3d the uniform type is the most used boundary conditions in the formal definition of cellular automata it is generally necessary to let the lattice be infinite however it is impossible to implement and simulate an infinite network on a computer therefore we must introduce boundary condition mainly we deal with three kinds of conditions periodic reflexible and fixed the periodic boundary condition simultaneously glue the opposite sides of the lattice which causes a loop for a 1d lattice and leads to the topology of torus for a two dimensional lattice for an infinite lattice the periodic boundary condition remains the most efficient way to simulate them therefore they are often used the reflective boundary condition it is obtained by reflecting the lattice at the border this is an appropriate approach where the system to be simulated has a limit but the values of physical quantities are not fixed e g diffusion system the fixed boundary condition obtained by simple prescription of a fixed value for the cell on the border this boundary condition corresponds to the limit state of dirichlet for the partial differential equation edp it is summarized in fig 3 initial conditions in most cases the initial conditions or the initial configuration determine the evolution of a considered model the initial conditions which are in the initial time noted t 0 are arbitrarily constructed based on the problem considered or are generated randomly it is expressed by the function 1 s t 0 l s c i j s t 0 c i j transition rules the most important aspect of a cellular automata is constituted by the set of transition rules these rules are defined by the function f depending on the geometry of the lattice the neighborhood the state set and the considered phenomenon it defines maps from n c to s i e the state s t œÑ 1 at time t œÑ 1 in a cell c is determined in function of the state s t œÑ of neighbor cells n c at time s t œÑ it can be given by f s n c s s t œÑ n c s t œÑ 1 c 2 2 wind flow model using ca te wind flow constitutes a spatio temporal dynamical system we denote the ca model of the wind flow phenomena by a w l s w n f w 1 the lattice l w it is the results of a discretized space by two dimensional cells each cell denoted by c i j has its own physical attributes topographic slope land use 2 the states set s w it contains different combinations of wind directions and speeds level we consider the following s w n and e for the direction from north to south from east to west from south to north and from west to east respectively we denoted the combination of two or three directions in the same cell i e double or triple generally observed when there is an obstacle we denote sw s w double direction nsw n s w triple direction etc see fig 4 in addition we denote i and r as no wind and riptide wind respectively we summarize the states set in the table 1 standard weak medium and strong wind speeds are represented respectively by the levels 0 1 2 and 3 remark 1 the wind speed levels are made by a classification of the maximum and the minimum wind speed of the studied area in fact we determine the maximum and the minimum wind speed from meteorological data of the studied area and the difference between them is devised by the levels number that we choose the states set of wind flow model is then given as s w i r n 0 n 1 n 2 n 3 s 0 s e w 3 so the state set contains 50 states c a r d s w 50 3 the neighborhood n w we consider the von neumann neighborhood type this choice was made in order to seamlessly couple this model with the forest fire model in jellouli et al 2016 in which the von neumann neighborhood type was used 4 the transition rules f w as mentioned in the problem statement we take account of two parameters land use and topographic slopes in order to determine the wind direction and speed in each cell fig 4 illustrates some behavior of the wind flow principle i e the wind flow in the same direction of the initial wind source when the wind finds a higher altitude it distributes in directions covering the obstacle which increases the wind speed and changes its direction when the wind finds a less altitude it turns in circle which we called riptide wind so we consider that each cell is characterized by two parameters t t œÑ p t œÑ we consider the following notations a l t c i j altitude level c c i j neighbor of c i j upwind c i j œÄ 2 obtained by œÄ 2 rotation from the cell c i j c i j œÄ 2 obtained by œÄ 2 rotation from the cell c i j we illustrate in the following example the position of the above denoted cells when the wind is blowing from west to east auto Œ± t œÑ c i j wind flow index between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 t t œÑ c i j wind type at time t œÑ riptide normal unidirectional double double direction triple triple direction t r t œÑ c i j wind type received from neighboring cells between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 p t œÑ c i j wind speed at time t œÑ level 0 of wind speed p s level 1 of wind speed level 2 of wind speed level 3 of wind speed p r t œÑ c i j wind speed received from neighboring cells between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 the transition rules is considered as the effect of two processes of wind receive distribute that occur between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 locally in a cell in order to determine the wind flow f w r e c e i v e d i s t r i b u t e where the sign refers to a mutual action those parameters are determined in two phases phase of exchanging wind between cells in which we associate a received type and speed of wind to a neighboring cell upwind between iterations i e between t œÑ and t œÑ 1 by taking into account the two characterization t t œÑ p t œÑ of the cell first we compare the altitude level which represents the land use and the topographic slopes the wind will be distributed after crashing with higher altitude or it will continue flowing when finding the same altitude otherwise it will turn in circle in a lower altitude if a l t c c i j a l t c i j then t r t œÑ c c i j r i p t i d e p r t œÑ c c i j p s else t r t œÑ c c i j n o r m a l p r t œÑ c c i j p t œÑ c i j Œ± t œÑ c i j we consider Œ± t œÑ c i j as the number of cells in which the wind will be distributed after crashing with higher altitude thus in our case using the von neumann neighborhood type Œ± t œÑ c i j 1 2 3 the rare case of wind volteface is not considered to determine the value of Œ± t œÑ c i j we have to compare furthermore the altitude of c i j cell with that of c i j œÄ 2 and c i j œÄ 2 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i

œÄ 2 n o r m a l p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 p t œÑ c i j Œ± t œÑ c i j else t r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 r i p t i d e p r t œÑ c i j œÄ 2 p s consequently we can determine the value of Œ± t œÑ c i j as follow if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 1 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 if a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j a n d a l t c i j œÄ 2 a l t c i j then Œ± t œÑ c i j 3 phase of determining the wind characteristic for each own cell we determine the two characterization of the cell at t œÑ 1 i e t t œÑ 1 c i j p t œÑ 1 c i j according to t r t œÑ c i j p t œÑ c i j and Œ± t œÑ c i j direction it is established according to the altitude level of the upwind cells indeed Œ± t œÑ c i j determines the wind flow as normal or it splits double or triple direction according to a parameter if t t œÑ c i j n o r m a l then if Œ± t œÑ c i j 1 then t t œÑ 1 c i j n o r m a l if Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 then t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e if Œ± t œÑ c i j 2 then t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e if Œ± t œÑ c i j 3 then t t œÑ 1 c i j t r i p l e if t t œÑ c i j r i p t i d e then t t œÑ 1 c i j r i p t i d e speed the wind speed level of each cell is a function of the received wind speed from the neighboring cells it is defined by p t œÑ 1 c

aspect example to explain how the state is determined we consider these examples the wind source is from west to east s t œÑ 1 n e 2 if t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e and p t œÑ 1 c i j 2 the wind source is from west to east s t œÑ 1 s e 3 if t t œÑ 1 c i j d o u b l e and p t œÑ 1 c i j 3 the wind source is from south to north s t œÑ 1 n e w 1 if t t œÑ 1 c i j t r i p l e and p t œÑ 1 c i j 1 the wind source is from east to west s t œÑ 1 w 2 if t t œÑ 1 c i j n o r m a l and p t œÑ 1 c i j 2 5 initial conditions to study how the wind flows in the space we need as initial conditions the wind source and initial wind speed which will be taken from the weather data of the studied area 6 boundary conditions we choose the reflexive boundary conditions in order to ensure the exchange of a wind flow between inside and outside of the lattice in through the lattice border 2 3 coupling wind and fire models the ca model a i l s i n f i for the dynamical prediction of the forest fires spread developed in jellouli et al 2016 took into account the fundamental parameters which impact the speed and the direction of fire and their combined effects humidity wind direction and speed vegetation types and density and the altitude levels while an uniform wind direction and speed has been considered the model of the wind flow determining the wind direction and speed in each cell is used to improve the forest fire spread model this has allowed us to study the effect of the wind flow on fire spread rate as illustrated in fig 1 the model is based on the states set s i 0 1 2 3 4 of the fire spread model where we improved the transition rules given in jellouli et al 2016 by incorporating the wind flow and the fire spread models to illustrate their dynamical behavior the flow chart of fig 1 presents the coupling approach between the two models the parameters affecting the fire spread tacked into account in the transition rules f i are 1 vegetation type and density we determine a burning velocity in each cell which changed with time according to the vegetation type and density represented by a burning duration t f i r e 2 humidity three rates of humidity are considered Œ± 0 Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 and represent respectively dry wet and very wet rate the humidity denoted by h affects the burning duration t f i r e i e if h Œ± 0 then t f i r e is short if h Œ± 1 then t f i r e is long and if h Œ± 2 then t f i r e is very long which means that the fire will not propagate at all 3 wind direction we made a modification to the transition rules to set a specific fire spread direction by neglecting inactive cells where the wind flow will not spread when verifying neighborhood set n c i j 4 wind speed when determining speed s level by the wind flow model described in section 2 2 we define radius of the neighborhood set n c i j 5 altitude the fire spread always follows the growing slope and it can rarely spread in decreasing slope mainly when the wind intervenes to ensure that we have to exclude the neighboring cells with an inferior level the transition rules are represented as follows fire spreads if there is a plant cover the humidity is weak and the existence of a burned cell in the neighboring cells which depend on the wind if s t œÑ c i j 0 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 1 if s t 0 c i j contains plant and k l c k l n c i j with s t œÑ c k l 1 a n d h Œ± 2 0 otherwise ignited vegetation state to burning vegetation state if s t œÑ c i j 1 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 2 after a combustion period t fire burning vegetation state becomes cold burning vegetation state ash if s t œÑ c i j 2 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 2 if r r r t fire 3 o t h e r w i s e cells become empty if s t œÑ c i j 3 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 4 in this paper we do not consider vegetation recovery thus the cell remains empty if s t œÑ c i j 4 then s t œÑ 1 c i j 4 for more details about our previous model we refer reader to jellouli et al 2016 3 performance evaluation the oued boukhalef watershed region was used as a case study for model application and validation 3 1 studied area the oued boukhalef watershed is a plain region located in the tangier city in northern morocco between the northern latitudes 35 702 and 35 775 and the longitudes west 5 855 and 5 948 fig 5 a leading to the atlantic ocean it covers an area of 34 29 km 2 and it stretches from the northeast to the southwest over a length of 8200 km and an average of 5 km from the southeast to the northwest this basin has a large variation in elevations ranging from 3 to 275 m fig 5 b the watershed of oued boukhalef is subject to a periodic forest fires occurring especially in summer it is usually due to the high temperatures and favorable windy conditions 3 2 simulation tool data collection and processing a simulation software tool has been developed in our previous work in jellouli et al 2016 it allows us to perform several tasks such as data import layer management data analysis and simulation together with results visualization the graphical interface of this software tool is depicted in fig 6 the tool s interface includes two parts option and data using the option bar we are able to define the states of the fundamental parameters that act according to the nature of the phenomenon such as wind direction humidity etc as for the data bar it allows loading the txt ascii files by processing actual data of the dtm it allows also manual data processing by drawing a domain and integrating our own data in this work we extended the tool in order to simulate the wind flow model and then use the obtained results as input data to the forest fire spread model before any data processing it is first necessary to collect the required and available data first of all it is a question of carrying out the processing of satellite images by an unsupervised isodata classification in the image to highlight the land use classes of a region then we are called upon to produce or create the digital terrain model dtm from the digitization of contour lines and points on topographic maps of a region and then collect the meteorological data wind direction and speed humidity the data collected is subsequently restructured in a way that respects the requirements of our software but this remains relatively ambiguous in order to do so we have developed an appropriate methodology for formatting the data which consists mainly of converting the formatted data raster image or pixel into a file txt ascii at the same time all data was digitized and processed using gis and algorithms developed under java in order to be imported into our software tool 3 3 simulation process and results after collecting and formatting the data in its appropriate form the pixels are stored according to a lattice of cells throughout columns and rows this mesh is automatically established by our software based on the ca model and the extracted data dtm and land use of the study area through developed algorithms that process ca data and transition rules the number type and size of the lattice cells are determined based on the resolution of the scale in the satellite image then the data is loaded into the appropriate software environment using the data import algorithms developed through java technology after loading the dtm data and land cover into our software on the one hand we generate a synthetic map of the dtm that represents the altitude map for the study area with a classification of altitude levels distributed in ten classes and on the other hand a synthetic map of land use that exposes us the targeted region with all types of land use in each cell the final map is obtained by consisting of superimposing the layers of information since this region is characterized generally in summer period of forest fire by west to east winds we have the wind source coming from west to east the flowchart in fig a 12 summarizes all the steps taken during this process after all these steps simulations can be conducted and results will be reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach we first show results related to the wind flow model and then those related to its integration with the forest fire model are reported 3 3 1 simulation results of the wind flow model first we simulate the wind flow by taking into account the land use and the topographic slopes of the watershed of oued boukhalef using the proposed ca model the software tool generates as results the wind distribution and speed maps as shown in figs 7 c and 7 d respectively the simulation results shown in fig 8 reveal that the wind speed obtained from our software is always powerful in height altitude levels indeed cells with high speed level red color in fig 8 a match with cells of higher topographic slopes in fig 8 b this is consistent with the fact that wind referring to the airflow from a higher pressure region to a lower pressure region the airflow is slowed by friction between the air and adjacent objects since obstacles that are close to the ground such as building structures plants etc disturb the airflow causing a greater friction force the airflow close to the ground is therefore slower on the contrary there is less friction in a higher area that is more exposed the air circulates faster and therefore stronger winds the wind direction and speed in each cell obtained from the wind flow model is then used in forest fire model as input data and output results are presented in next section 3 3 2 simulation results of the improved forest fire model in order to illustrate the effect of wind flow on forest fire spread rate we consider the same studied area in section 2 3 the watershed of oued boukhalef we choose 4 random fire launching points geznaya boukhalef jebila and mesnana and ones knowing by periodic forest fire mediouna in different regions of the oued boukhalef watershed as illustrated in fig 9 b after simulating the wind flow model and extracting the wind data for each cell direction and speed 7 b 7 c we made two separate simulations ones with an uniform wind direction and speed and others with coupling the forest fire spread model with the wind flow model to take account of the dynamic behavior of the wind at the end we compare results 3 4 discussion as result we find that the areas of gznaya boukhalef jebila and mesnana are not vulnerable since the fire does not spread fig 10 comparing the results obtained by our software fig 11 a and the history of the fire in the watershed fig 11 b we note that they agree on the fact that the fires are triggered and spread only in the mediouna area indeed unlike the area of mediouna which seems to be very vulnerable since the fire spreads widely these area do not contain a consistent amount of vegetation cover and are known by a large urban sprawl which prevents the fire from being visible in addition by comparing the results with uniform and dynamic wind behavior we found that the burned area in the mediouna area using the model with dynamic wind parameters is larger than the one with uniform wind parameters this is consistent with the fact that the wind flow has a significant effect on forest fire spread thus the increased fire intensity and heat transfer capacity of recurrent fires make the fire deadly to even larger thick barked trees and enlarge the vulnerable areas this was predictable due to the wind multi directions and speeds the recent example that confirms the impact of the wind on the forest fire spread and the vulnerability area is the historical fire that ravaged the mediouna forest in tangier in 08 07 2015 5 hectares of vegetation was ravaged by fire which was finally controlled thanks to the civil protection who received the help of the high commission for water and forests and the fight against desertification hceflcd of tangier also in 01 07 2017 in less than two days about 230 hectares of the forest was ravaged by fire sunday learned at the hceflcd excessive heat and strong winds 80 km h have complicated efforts to control the fire the source said 4 conclusions and perspectives in this work we first introduced a wind flow model by ca approach taking into account the topographic slope and the land uses we then investigated the impact of the dynamic behavior of wind on the forest fire spread the wind flow model determines the wind direction and speed in each cell and how it spreads thus using these results we improved subsequently the forest fire spread model proposed in jellouli et al 2016 in fact the proposed approach has been applied to simulate the wind flow and the forest fire spread in the studied area of watershed oued boukhalef using the developed computer aided simulation tool simulation results showed that the impact of a dynamic wind behavior is more important on forest fire spread as perspective the wind flow has been applied in real regions with assumed input data it would be interesting to couple the model with actual past data from a real region to determine the proper wind turbine positions furthermore the forest fire model has been applied to real regions with remotely sensed input data and selected excitation points based on the fire outbreak history it would be interesting to confirm the fire vulnerable areas that we have identified and then predict areas that might be vulnerable to fire we will then have to take into account the stochastic aspect of the cas and the coupling with the models of climate change in order to evaluate the climatic parameters that intervene in the different

24449,in a model plankton ecosystem containing phytoplankton and zooplankton the later usually avoids toxic phytoplankton and prefers nontoxic species by modulating its grazing rate the toxins released by toxic phytoplankton can lead to a decreased grazing rate of zooplankton on both phytoplankton and the presence of nontoxic phytoplankton in the system also reduces the grazing pressure of zooplankton on the toxic phytoplankton in this study a set of functions were given that model the selective grazing of zooplankton on various phytoplankton preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient were introduced in the selective grazing functions to measure the level of zooplankton preference of nontoxic phytoplankton and avoidance of toxic phytoplankton respectively a dynamics model was established in a nontoxic phytoplankton toxic phytoplankton zooplankton system based on the grazing functions of zooplankton to study the existence and stability of an interior equilibrium and hopf bifurcation our results show that zooplankton selective grazing promotes both zooplankton and toxic phytoplankton biomass and contributes to maintain the coexistence of all species low grazing selectivity i e low values of preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient decreases the zooplankton population and increases the opportunity for phytoplankton blooms a moderate level of grazing selectivity helps keep the system in balance with high grazing selectivity on phytoplankton toxic phytoplankton becomes the dominant species resulting in a rapid algal succession and eventual toxic phytoplankton blooms when the preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient in the dynamics model crossed critical values respectively the ecosystem enters into a hopf bifurcation around the interior equilibrium inducing oscillations of these populations keywords phytoplankton zooplankton selective grazing functions ecosystem dynamics model hopf bifurcation 1 introduction selective grazing behavior has attracted the attention of ecologists for decades and the focus varies from individual behavior to the dynamics of a predator prey system many predators can distinguish different types of prey thus avoiding the ingestion of undesirable prey which is termed selective grazing mitra and flynn 2006 linhart et al 1976 ghorai et al 2021 in the marine plankton ecosystem zooplankton shows a similar synergistic behavior by distinguishing between toxin producing phytoplankton tpp and nontoxic phytoplankton ntp species lewis et al 2013 schultz and ki√∏rboe 2009 yuan et al 2017 the cause of this phenomenon remains unknown and the hypothesized mechanisms for selective grazing include morphology size shape and colony formation viable gut passage and toxic chemicals produced by the prey porter 1973 frost 1972 zhao et al 2018 sterner 1989 liu et al 2014 selective grazing by copepods on toxic algae has been extensively investigated due to the potential significance of toxic algae to red tide and harmful algal bloom formations uye and takamatsu 1990 sole et al 2006 agnihotri and kaur 2021 in selective grazing laboratory experiments of acartia spinicauda a copepod zooplankton on alexandrium tamarense tpp in the presence of platymonas subcordiformis ntp the grazing rate of a spinicauda on a tamarense increased gradually to a maximum at a critical density of a tamarense and then decreased and continued to decline with an increasing p subcordiformis density qi et al 2004 these experiments suggested that a spinicauda avoided the toxic a tamarense and preferred the nontoxic p subcordiformis selective grazing not only promotes the survival of tpp populations but it also plays an important role in their dominance over various competitors chakraborty et al 2012 the population balance of zooplankton and phytoplankton is a complicated dynamic process in the marine plankton ecosystem nonlinear mathematical models for interacting populations have often been used to explain the dynamic behavior of the plankton system rosenzweig 1971 mccann et al 1998 meng and zhang 2016 zhang et al 2020 chattopadhyay et al 2004 proposed a model with three components ntp tpp and zooplankton z to investigate the effect of the toxin released by tpp on zooplankton grazing they proved that all three species coexist if the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp is bounded they observed that when the tpp is presented the equilibrium level of ntp increases while the equilibrium level of zooplankton decreases the result indicated that tpp plays a key role in zooplankton bloom termination the model incorporates the holling 1959 type ii functional response to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp holling type ii functional response is often used to explain the grazing behavior of zooplankton on phytoplankton in the predator prey model system it describes that the grazing rate of zooplankton tends to a maximum value as phytoplankton density increases but holling type ii is not accurate to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp because the grazing rate declines instead of remaining at a maximum level when tpp density is high as observed in some experiments qi et al 2004 holling 1961 type iv incorporating prey interference with predation indicated that the per capita predation rate increased to a maximum at a critical prey density and then decreased sabelis 1985 taylor 1984 collings 1997 this suggests that some phytoplankton species produce defense mechanism that reduces the grazing pressure by zooplankton berdalet et al 2014 banerjee and venturino 2011 proposed a mathematical model for ntp tpp z system by using holling type iv to simulate this situation their results indicated that the avoidance behavior of zooplankton in the presence of large quantities of tpp ensured that the toxin released by tpp does not drive the zooplankton populations toward extinction holling type iv reflects the inhibitory effect of toxins released by tpp on zooplankton grazing but does not take account of the ability of zooplankton to distinguish between the two species known as grazing selectivity to investigate the effect of selective grazing on the survival and dominance of tpp over its nontoxic competitors pal et al 2009 modified the ntp tpp z model by including competition terms between tpp and ntp in grazing functions they observed that competition was helpful for the coexistence of all three species when the competition coefficient crosses a critical value the ecosystem loses its stability and results in hopf bifurcation around the positive equilibrium depicting oscillations phenomena of the population chaktabort et al 2012 introduced a parameter Œ≤ in the grazing functions to measure the avoidance of zooplankton for tpp in the presence of ntp they found that high avoidance promoted the survival of the tpp population and helped to support the coexistence of all populations fiesal et al 2016 proposed and analyzed an ecological model that described the dynamical behavior of food web model nutrient ntp tpp z with lotka volterra type of functional response these models allow for selective grazing but ignore the fact that the large amount of toxins released by tpp would sharply reduce the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp some experimental results showed that zooplankton decreased the grazing rate on tpp with increasing toxins when ntp density remained unchanged qi et al 2004 based on this observation in this study we extended the model proposed by chaktabort et al 2012 by introducing the term d p 2 2 p 2 is the densities of tpp while d is the avoidance coefficient in the denominator of the grazing function to measure the avoidance of zooplankton for tpp due to its toxins we also investigate its effect on the dynamics of the system we focus on the explanation of selective grazing modulations on rapid algal succession and blooms in a marine environment to meet these goals we first establish the selective grazing functions in ntp tpp z system and then present an ecosystem dynamics model to analyze and simulate the nonlinear behaviors of the system fig 5 2 methods 2 1 selective grazing functions in the ntp tpp z system let p 1 p 2 be the densities of ntp and tpp respectively let i 2 be the grazing function of zooplankton on tpp i 2 is defined by the following equation 1 i 2 œÉ œâ Œ¥ i 2 p 2 where œÉ is the searching effectiveness which refers to the percentage of prey found by a predator in unit time œâ is the total time available for predation and Œ¥ is the handling time for attack and ingestion holling 1961 obviously a lower searching effectiveness and longer handling time equate to a lower grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp considering that the existence of ntp reduces searching effectiveness œÉ and that the toxins released by tpp prolong the handling time Œ¥ we modified the equations given by collings 1997 and define 2 œÉ œÉ 0 1 c 1 p 1 1 3 Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 1 d p 2 so that œÉ decreases and Œ¥ increases as p 1 and p 2 increase here œÉ 0 is maximum searching effectiveness and Œ¥ 0 is the minimum handling time the parameter c 1 0 measures the level of ntp interference with zooplankton searching for tpp d 0 indicates that the toxins released by tpp prolongs the handling time substitute 2 and 3 into 1 and solve for i 2 to get 4 i 2 œÉ 0 œâ p 2 1 c 1 p 1 œÉ 0 Œ¥ 0 1 d p 2 p 2 let a œâ Œ¥ 0 b 1 œÉ 0 Œ¥ 0 c c 1 œÉ 0 Œ¥ 0 we get the grazing function 5 i 2 a p 2 b c p 1 d p 2 2 p 2 the parameter c 0 termed the preference coefficient measures the preference of zooplankton for ntp c 0 produces a system where zooplankton does not discriminate between ntp and tpp whereas high c results in a decrease in tpp uptake by zooplankton in the presence of ntp the parameter d 0 termed the avoidance coefficient measures the avoidance of tpp by zooplankton d 0 represents that tpp does not release toxins and the grazing rate i 2 increases with tpp density to near the maximum a parameter a is the maximal zooplankton per capita grazing rate and b is the density of tpp necessary to achieve one half that rate when c 0 and d 0 when c 0 and d 0 a provides an upper boundary for the per capita grazing rate since i 2 attains a maximum of a 2 d b c p 1 1 at p 2 b c p 1 d we reduced 5 to the following function to indicate the grazing rate 6 i

in both 5 and 6 decrease with the increase of p 1 when p 2 remains constant formulas 5 and 6 reflect the experimental results of qi et al 2004 where the avoidance of tpp and preference for ntp reduces the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp c 0 d 0 formulas 5 and 6 are called selective grazing functions to facilitate the functional property analysis we modified 5 and 6 as follows 7 i 2 p 2 b c p 1 d p 2 2 e p 2 8 i 2 p 2 b c p 1 d p 2 2 here b b a c c a d d a e 1 a to investigate how the grazing of zooplankton on tpp changes with ntp and tpp densities we perform a multiple nonlinear regression analysis of models 7 and 8 using experimental data from qi et al 2004 from table 1 we find that the grazing rate of zooplankton on p 2 increased to a maximum at p 2 2000 and then decreased with the density of p 2 when p 1 600 1200 and 2300 it means that zooplankton reduced grazing p 2 to avoid the toxin the grazing rate decreased with the density of p 2 when p 1 4600 and had a small fluctuation in the decline when p 1 9000 when p 2 2000 the grazing rate decreased obviously with the increase of p 1 which means that the zooplankton preferred p 1 to p 2 when p 1 is abundant the grazing rate of zooplankton on p 2 was low when the density of p 2 was in very low and high levels so the decline trends of p 2 were not obvious when p 2 400 and 4000 for simplicity we let x p 1 10 3 y p 2 10 3 f i i 2 10 3 i 1 2 in 7 and 8 we got the regression coefficients of the model 7 and 8 by using a nonlinear regression analysis with the data in table 1 the r 2 and p value in table 2 indicate that 7 and 8 are reasonable to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp the results show that f 1 and f 2 fit the data well table 2 fig 1 provides the fitting surface of data in table 1 figs 2 and 3 provide the fitting surfaces of selective grazing models f 1 f 2 respectively when ntp density was low the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp increased to a maximum and then decreased with increasing density of tpp fig 4 provides the section lines of the fitting surface of f 2 on a series of planes parallel to the coordinate planes it shows two different trends of the grazing rate i 2 caused by the increasing densities of ntp and tpp we conclude that the selective grazing functions 5 and 6 have similar functional properties and they describe the characteristics of selective grazing behavior of zooplankton on phytoplankton in the ntp tpp z system considering that the form of function 5 is too complex to be analyzed for nonlinear dynamics although it fits the data better than function 6 we select 6 as a function of zooplankton grazing on tpp for its relatively simple form to build the ntp tpp z system models in the same way let i 1 be the grazing rate of zooplankton on ntp we defined the toxins released by tpp interfered with the searching effectiveness of zooplankton for ntp i 1 is defined by the equations 9 i 1 œÉ œâ Œ¥ i 1 p 1 10 œÉ œÉ 0 1 c 2 p 2 1 Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 where œâ œÉ 0 and Œ¥

in a deterministic model given by pal et al 2009 used to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on ntp when tpp exists 2 2 ntp tpp z model and nonlinear analysis we assumed that p 1 t p 2 t z t are the densities of ntp tpp and z at time t respectively we also assumed that ntp and tpp grow in a logistic function and that the growth of zooplankton depends on the predation of ntp only we assumed that ntp and tpp share the same environmental carrying capacity and resources for growth finally we assumed that the predation on tpp reduces the zooplankton population we selected 6 and 12 as the grazing functions of zooplankton on tpp and ntp respectively with these assumptions we proposed the following model to describe the variations of relationships among them 13 d p 1 d t r 1 p 1 1 p 1 k

biomass Œ∏ 1 denotes the rate of toxin liberation by tpp and Œº is the death rate of zooplankton the parameters d and c represent an avoidance coefficient and preference coefficient respectively while

rate of predator based on this equation the grazing rates of zooplankton on tpp and ntp were defined in eqs 1 and 9 in the ntp tpp z system considering the different characteristics of zooplankton grazing on tpp and ntp the selective grazing functions 5 and 12 were deduced respectively from these equations we reduced 5 to function 6 for its relatively simple form then the dynamics model of the ntp tpp z system was established and simulated to discuss the influence of zooplankton selective grazing on the system let p 1 p 2 be the densities of ntp and tpp and i 1 i 2 be the grazing rates of zooplankton on ntp and tpp the flow chart was given as follow in figure 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 boundedness of the system all of the solutions of 15 which initiate in r 3 x y z x 0 y 0 z 0 were

possibility of coexistence of all three species named e 5 x y z 0 x y z 1 3 3 eigenvalue analysis to establish local asymptotic stability by computing the jacobian matrix for the equilibriums of system 15 we found that e 0 e 1 e 2 are unstable and a feasible ntp and tpp steady state e 3 as well as a feasible ntp and zooplankton steady state e 4 exist if Œ≤ 2 Œ≥ Œ∏ 1 1 b 2 b 1 Œº 0 then e 3 is unstable if r Œ∏ z 1 b 1 x 0 then e 4 is unstable due to the complexity an analytical study of the stability properties of e 5 is difficult hence we next performed a numerical investigation to identify the existence of an interior equilibrium point e 5 in the next work 3 4 numerical analysis we performed a numerical analysis of the system 13 to study the effect of the preference coefficient c and avoidance coefficient d on the dynamical behavior of the system with different parameter setup scenarios table 3 we then observed the role of selective grazing for maintaining system stability and the occurrence of a plankton bloom by illustrating the existence of the interior equilibriums from fig 6 we found that the zooplankton population is extremely low when the values of the preference coefficient c 0 066 and avoidance coefficient d 0 02 e 0 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 are saddle points while the interior equilibrium e 5 is locally asymptotically stable zooplankton tends to become extinct in the system resulting in algal blooms when the value of d increased from 0 02 to 0 044 retaining other parameter values the same as in fig 6 we observed that all populations coexist through oscillation depicting regular recurrent phytoplankton blooms fig 7 from fig 8 we observed that the interior e 5 is a stable limit cycle when the value of c increases to 17 which indicates that the high preference for ntp develops in zooplankton populations and induces a rapid phytoplankton succession e 5 changes to a stable focus when the value of c increases from 17 to 40 fig 9 it shows that the preference coefficient has a critical value c 17 c 40 while the avoidance coefficient is low d 0 044 the stable coexistence equilibrium changes to a limit cycle when the preference coefficient c crosses that critical value c 17 c 40 resulting in a hopf bifurcation around the positive equilibrium depicting oscillation phenomena of all populations and increasing the opportunity of tpp blooms from figs 10 and 11 we find that the stable focus e 5 changes to a limit cycle when the avoidance coefficient d crosses a critical value d 0 15 d 0 25 at c 6 6 resulting in a hopf bifurcation around the stable equilibrium this suggests that the high avoidance of tpp by zooplankton develops both tpp and zooplankton populations in the system fig 12 indicates that three species achieve the internal stable equilibrium point after a long period of oscillation when the selective grazing level of zooplankton is low c 0 8 d 0 25 when the selective grazing level is high c 10 d 2 5 tpp dominates in the system and tends to the environmental carrying capacity implying the development of tpp blooms three scenarios were studied in numerical simulations when the zooplankton grazing selectivity level was low i e the ability of zooplankton to distinguish tpp from ntp was low c 0 066 d 0 02 zooplankton populations tended to become extinct in the system resulting in algal blooms when zooplankton grazing selectivity increases c 6 6 d 0 25 the system enters a stable equilibrium point as selectivity levels continued to rise c 10 d 2 5 tpp blooms outbreak the simulation results show that when the zooplankton selectivity level remains at a high level there are critical values of preference coefficient c 17 c 40 and avoidance coefficient d 0 15 d 0 25 in the system and hopf bifurcation occurs when the two selective coefficients pass through their respective critical values from the numerical simulation results we conclude that the preference of ntp and the avoidance of tpp develop zooplankton in ntp tpp z system this analysis well explains the experimental results of pal et al 2010 in which they observed that if there were sufficient resources in the system to make ntp abundant zooplankton would be more inclined to graze ntp and develop zooplankton themselves however they also noted that if the resources in the system are insufficient resulting in a low density of ntp the zooplankton will become extinct by eating large amounts of tpp the results of the numerical simulation are also consistent with chaktabort et al 2012 that the high avoidance level of tpp helps support the coexistence of all species the grazing function in their models assumed that the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp would tend to gradually increase to the maximum with increasing tpp density when ntp density remained unchanged that is the amount of toxins released by tpp had no significant impact on the grazing rate of zooplankton therefore when the ntp density in the system was low zooplankton tended to become extinct in their models because zooplankton did not reduce grazing on tpp in fact because the toxins released by tpp reduce the grazing rates of zooplankton on both tpp and ntp yuan et al 2017 the three populations will remain in a stable state or coexist through oscillation describing rapid algal succession and blooms this is the advantage of the models established in our study that is it measures the selective grazing level of zooplankton from both preference of ntp and avoidance of tpp therefore the models established in this work has a better simulation of the real situation in terms of mathematical properties 4 conclusion in this work we modified the linear function of the densities of ntp and tpp proposed by chaktabort et al 2012 to a nonlinear one in the denominator of the grazing rate function through the regression analysis of experimental data the results from the numerical analysis showed that the level of avoidance to tpp by zooplankton plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the system the high avoidance of tpp by zooplankton develops both tpp and zooplankton populations in the system as the values of avoidance coefficient increases tpp populations dominate in the system and tend to increase the environmental carrying capacity implying the development of tpp blooms in ntp tpp z systems of the ocean zooplankton prefers ntp to tpp in this study two key parameters the avoidance coefficient and preference coefficient were introduced in the selective grazing function to measure the grazing selectivity of zooplankton in ntp tpp z system the advantage of this function is that the reduction of zooplankton grazing pressure on tpp can be attributed to the presence of ntp and the inhibition of toxins released by tpp on zooplankton grazing the results showed that selective grazing developed both zooplankton and tpp and helped to maintain the coexistence of them both low grazing selectivity i e low values of preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient decreased the zooplankton populations and increased the opportunity for phytoplankton blooms high grazing selectivity increased the zooplankton and tpp populations and make tpp become the dominant species resulting in a rapid algal succession and eventual tpp blooms evolutionary trade off between defense against grazing and competitive ability is well known in planktonic algae and it helps to maintain system stability yoshida et al 2004 grew algal populations for multiple generations in either the presence or absence of the grazing rotifer brachionus calyciflorus and then concluded that grazed algae were better defended yielding a rotifer growth rate 32 below that of animals fed non grazed algae however they also had a diminished competitive ability with a growth rate under nutrient limiting conditions 28 below that of non grazed algae in addition grazed algae had a smaller cell size which influenced the system stability for example zhao et al 2018 investigated that the system went into oscillation with the increasing cell size of phytoplankton and demonstrated that the cell size of phytoplankton increased the complexity of phytoplankton zooplankton interaction and the possibility of phytoplankton blooms therefore changes in phytoplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton lead to phytoplankton evolutionary in cell size and growth rate which in turn affect zooplankton grazing rate we noted that in ntp tpp z system the growth rate of phytoplankton and the toxin release rate of tpp were assumed to be constants for mathematical simplicity in fact when the selective grazing level was low the growth rate of tpp decreased and the toxin release rate increased as a defense against grazing then when grazing pressure was decreased a higher tpp growth rate was induced coupled with a lower toxin release rate this would eventually affect the selective grazing level of zooplankton considering the genetic variation of phytoplankton we should change the growth rate and toxin release rate from constants to functions of avoidance coefficient and preference coefficient in an analysis of the nonlinear behavior of the ntp tpp z system in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that cdocould have appeared to

24449,in a model plankton ecosystem containing phytoplankton and zooplankton the later usually avoids toxic phytoplankton and prefers nontoxic species by modulating its grazing rate the toxins released by toxic phytoplankton can lead to a decreased grazing rate of zooplankton on both phytoplankton and the presence of nontoxic phytoplankton in the system also reduces the grazing pressure of zooplankton on the toxic phytoplankton in this study a set of functions were given that model the selective grazing of zooplankton on various phytoplankton preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient were introduced in the selective grazing functions to measure the level of zooplankton preference of nontoxic phytoplankton and avoidance of toxic phytoplankton respectively a dynamics model was established in a nontoxic phytoplankton toxic phytoplankton zooplankton system based on the grazing functions of zooplankton to study the existence and stability of an interior equilibrium and hopf bifurcation our results show that zooplankton selective grazing promotes both zooplankton and toxic phytoplankton biomass and contributes to maintain the coexistence of all species low grazing selectivity i e low values of preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient decreases the zooplankton population and increases the opportunity for phytoplankton blooms a moderate level of grazing selectivity helps keep the system in balance with high grazing selectivity on phytoplankton toxic phytoplankton becomes the dominant species resulting in a rapid algal succession and eventual toxic phytoplankton blooms when the preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient in the dynamics model crossed critical values respectively the ecosystem enters into a hopf bifurcation around the interior equilibrium inducing oscillations of these populations keywords phytoplankton zooplankton selective grazing functions ecosystem dynamics model hopf bifurcation 1 introduction selective grazing behavior has attracted the attention of ecologists for decades and the focus varies from individual behavior to the dynamics of a predator prey system many predators can distinguish different types of prey thus avoiding the ingestion of undesirable prey which is termed selective grazing mitra and flynn 2006 linhart et al 1976 ghorai et al 2021 in the marine plankton ecosystem zooplankton shows a similar synergistic behavior by distinguishing between toxin producing phytoplankton tpp and nontoxic phytoplankton ntp species lewis et al 2013 schultz and ki√∏rboe 2009 yuan et al 2017 the cause of this phenomenon remains unknown and the hypothesized mechanisms for selective grazing include morphology size shape and colony formation viable gut passage and toxic chemicals produced by the prey porter 1973 frost 1972 zhao et al 2018 sterner 1989 liu et al 2014 selective grazing by copepods on toxic algae has been extensively investigated due to the potential significance of toxic algae to red tide and harmful algal bloom formations uye and takamatsu 1990 sole et al 2006 agnihotri and kaur 2021 in selective grazing laboratory experiments of acartia spinicauda a copepod zooplankton on alexandrium tamarense tpp in the presence of platymonas subcordiformis ntp the grazing rate of a spinicauda on a tamarense increased gradually to a maximum at a critical density of a tamarense and then decreased and continued to decline with an increasing p subcordiformis density qi et al 2004 these experiments suggested that a spinicauda avoided the toxic a tamarense and preferred the nontoxic p subcordiformis selective grazing not only promotes the survival of tpp populations but it also plays an important role in their dominance over various competitors chakraborty et al 2012 the population balance of zooplankton and phytoplankton is a complicated dynamic process in the marine plankton ecosystem nonlinear mathematical models for interacting populations have often been used to explain the dynamic behavior of the plankton system rosenzweig 1971 mccann et al 1998 meng and zhang 2016 zhang et al 2020 chattopadhyay et al 2004 proposed a model with three components ntp tpp and zooplankton z to investigate the effect of the toxin released by tpp on zooplankton grazing they proved that all three species coexist if the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp is bounded they observed that when the tpp is presented the equilibrium level of ntp increases while the equilibrium level of zooplankton decreases the result indicated that tpp plays a key role in zooplankton bloom termination the model incorporates the holling 1959 type ii functional response to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp holling type ii functional response is often used to explain the grazing behavior of zooplankton on phytoplankton in the predator prey model system it describes that the grazing rate of zooplankton tends to a maximum value as phytoplankton density increases but holling type ii is not accurate to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp because the grazing rate declines instead of remaining at a maximum level when tpp density is high as observed in some experiments qi et al 2004 holling 1961 type iv incorporating prey interference with predation indicated that the per capita predation rate increased to a maximum at a critical prey density and then decreased sabelis 1985 taylor 1984 collings 1997 this suggests that some phytoplankton species produce defense mechanism that reduces the grazing pressure by zooplankton berdalet et al 2014 banerjee and venturino 2011 proposed a mathematical model for ntp tpp z system by using holling type iv to simulate this situation their results indicated that the avoidance behavior of zooplankton in the presence of large quantities of tpp ensured that the toxin released by tpp does not drive the zooplankton populations toward extinction holling type iv reflects the inhibitory effect of toxins released by tpp on zooplankton grazing but does not take account of the ability of zooplankton to distinguish between the two species known as grazing selectivity to investigate the effect of selective grazing on the survival and dominance of tpp over its nontoxic competitors pal et al 2009 modified the ntp tpp z model by including competition terms between tpp and ntp in grazing functions they observed that competition was helpful for the coexistence of all three species when the competition coefficient crosses a critical value the ecosystem loses its stability and results in hopf bifurcation around the positive equilibrium depicting oscillations phenomena of the population chaktabort et al 2012 introduced a parameter Œ≤ in the grazing functions to measure the avoidance of zooplankton for tpp in the presence of ntp they found that high avoidance promoted the survival of the tpp population and helped to support the coexistence of all populations fiesal et al 2016 proposed and analyzed an ecological model that described the dynamical behavior of food web model nutrient ntp tpp z with lotka volterra type of functional response these models allow for selective grazing but ignore the fact that the large amount of toxins released by tpp would sharply reduce the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp some experimental results showed that zooplankton decreased the grazing rate on tpp with increasing toxins when ntp density remained unchanged qi et al 2004 based on this observation in this study we extended the model proposed by chaktabort et al 2012 by introducing the term d p 2 2 p 2 is the densities of tpp while d is the avoidance coefficient in the denominator of the grazing function to measure the avoidance of zooplankton for tpp due to its toxins we also investigate its effect on the dynamics of the system we focus on the explanation of selective grazing modulations on rapid algal succession and blooms in a marine environment to meet these goals we first establish the selective grazing functions in ntp tpp z system and then present an ecosystem dynamics model to analyze and simulate the nonlinear behaviors of the system fig 5 2 methods 2 1 selective grazing functions in the ntp tpp z system let p 1 p 2 be the densities of ntp and tpp respectively let i 2 be the grazing function of zooplankton on tpp i 2 is defined by the following equation 1 i 2 œÉ œâ Œ¥ i 2 p 2 where œÉ is the searching effectiveness which refers to the percentage of prey found by a predator in unit time œâ is the total time available for predation and Œ¥ is the handling time for attack and ingestion holling 1961 obviously a lower searching effectiveness and longer handling time equate to a lower grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp considering that the existence of ntp reduces searching effectiveness œÉ and that the toxins released by tpp prolong the handling time Œ¥ we modified the equations given by collings 1997 and define 2 œÉ œÉ 0 1 c 1 p 1 1 3 Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 1 d p 2 so that œÉ decreases and Œ¥ increases as p 1 and p 2 increase here œÉ 0 is maximum searching effectiveness and Œ¥ 0 is the minimum handling time the parameter c 1 0 measures the level of ntp interference with zooplankton searching for tpp d 0 indicates that the toxins released by tpp prolongs the handling time substitute 2 and 3 into 1 and solve for i 2 to get 4 i 2 œÉ 0

measures the preference of zooplankton for ntp c 0 produces a system where zooplankton does not discriminate between ntp and tpp whereas high c results in a decrease in tpp uptake by zooplankton in the presence of ntp the parameter d 0 termed the avoidance coefficient measures the avoidance of tpp by zooplankton d 0 represents that tpp does not release toxins and the grazing rate i 2 increases with tpp density to near the maximum a parameter a is the maximal zooplankton per capita grazing rate and b is the density of tpp necessary to achieve one half that rate when c 0 and d 0 when c 0 and

in both 5 and 6 decrease with the increase of p 1 when p 2 remains constant formulas 5 and 6 reflect the experimental results of qi et al 2004 where the avoidance of tpp and preference for ntp reduces the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp c 0 d 0 formulas 5 and 6 are called selective grazing functions to facilitate the functional property analysis we modified 5 and 6 as follows 7 i 2 p 2 b c p 1 d

analysis of models 7 and 8 using experimental data from qi et al 2004 from table 1 we find that the grazing rate of zooplankton on p 2 increased to a maximum at p 2 2000 and then decreased with the density of p 2 when p 1 600 1200 and 2300 it means that zooplankton reduced grazing p 2 to avoid the toxin the grazing rate decreased with the density of p 2 when p 1 4600 and had a small fluctuation in the decline when p 1 9000 when p 2 2000 the grazing rate decreased obviously with the increase of p 1 which means that the zooplankton preferred p 1 to p 2 when p 1 is abundant the grazing rate of zooplankton on p 2 was low when the density of p 2 was in very low and high levels so the decline trends of p 2 were not obvious when p 2 400 and 4000 for simplicity we let x p 1 10 3 y p 2 10 3 f i i 2 10 3 i 1 2 in 7 and 8 we got the regression coefficients of the model 7 and 8 by using a nonlinear regression analysis with the data in table 1 the r 2 and p value in table 2 indicate that 7 and 8 are reasonable to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp the results show that f 1 and f 2 fit the data well table 2 fig 1 provides the fitting surface of data in table 1 figs 2 and 3 provide the fitting surfaces of selective grazing models f 1 f 2 respectively when ntp density was low the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp increased to a maximum and then decreased with increasing density of tpp fig 4 provides the section lines of the fitting surface of f 2 on a series of planes parallel to the coordinate planes it shows two different trends of the grazing rate i 2 caused by the increasing densities of ntp and tpp we conclude that the selective grazing functions 5 and 6 have similar functional properties and they describe the characteristics of selective grazing behavior of zooplankton on phytoplankton in the ntp tpp z system considering that the form of function 5 is too complex to be analyzed for nonlinear dynamics although it fits the data better than function 6 we select 6 as a function of zooplankton grazing on tpp for its relatively simple form to build the ntp tpp z system models in the same way let i 1 be the grazing rate of zooplankton on ntp we defined

in a deterministic model given by pal et al 2009 used to describe the grazing rate of zooplankton on ntp when tpp exists 2 2 ntp tpp z model and nonlinear analysis we assumed that p 1 t p 2 t z t are the densities of ntp tpp and z at time t respectively we also assumed that ntp and tpp grow in a logistic function and that the growth of zooplankton depends on the predation of ntp only we assumed that ntp and tpp share the same environmental carrying capacity and resources for growth finally we assumed that the predation on tpp reduces the zooplankton population we selected 6 and 12 as the grazing functions of zooplankton on tpp and ntp respectively with these assumptions we proposed the following model to describe the variations of relationships among them 13 d p 1 d t r 1 p 1 1 p 1 k

rate of predator based on this equation the grazing rates of zooplankton on tpp and ntp were defined in eqs 1 and 9 in the ntp tpp z system considering the different characteristics of zooplankton grazing on tpp and ntp the selective grazing functions 5 and 12 were deduced respectively from these equations we reduced 5 to function 6 for its relatively simple form then the dynamics model of the ntp tpp z system was established and simulated to discuss the influence of zooplankton selective grazing on the system let p 1 p 2 be the densities of ntp and tpp and i 1 i 2 be the grazing rates of zooplankton on ntp and tpp the flow chart was given as follow in figure 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 boundedness of the system all of the solutions of 15 which initiate in r 3 x y z x 0 y 0 z 0 were

unstable if r Œ∏ z 1 b 1 x 0 then e 4 is unstable due to the complexity an analytical study of the stability properties of e 5 is difficult hence we next performed a numerical investigation to identify the existence of an interior equilibrium point e 5 in the next work 3 4 numerical analysis we performed a numerical analysis of the system 13 to study the effect of the preference coefficient c and avoidance coefficient d on the dynamical behavior of the system with different parameter setup scenarios table 3 we then observed the role of selective grazing for maintaining system stability and the occurrence of a plankton bloom by illustrating the existence of the interior equilibriums from fig 6 we found that the zooplankton population is extremely low when the values of the preference coefficient c 0 066 and avoidance coefficient d 0 02 e 0 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 are saddle points while the interior equilibrium e 5 is locally asymptotically stable zooplankton tends to become extinct in the system resulting in algal blooms when the value of d increased from 0 02 to 0 044 retaining other parameter values the same as in fig 6 we observed that all populations coexist through oscillation depicting regular recurrent phytoplankton blooms fig 7 from fig 8 we observed that the interior e 5 is a stable limit cycle when the value of c increases to 17 which indicates that the high preference for ntp develops in zooplankton populations and induces a rapid phytoplankton succession e 5 changes to a stable focus when the value of c increases from 17 to 40 fig 9 it shows that the preference coefficient has a critical value c 17 c 40 while the avoidance coefficient is low d 0 044 the stable coexistence equilibrium changes to a limit cycle when the preference coefficient c crosses that critical value c 17 c 40 resulting in a hopf bifurcation around the positive equilibrium depicting oscillation phenomena of all populations and increasing the opportunity of tpp blooms from figs 10 and 11 we find that the stable focus e 5 changes to a limit cycle when the avoidance coefficient d crosses a critical value d 0 15 d 0 25 at c 6 6 resulting in a hopf bifurcation around the stable equilibrium this suggests that the high avoidance of tpp by zooplankton develops both tpp and zooplankton populations in the system fig 12 indicates that three species achieve the internal stable equilibrium point after a long period of oscillation when the selective grazing level of zooplankton is low c 0 8 d 0 25 when the selective grazing level is high c 10 d 2 5 tpp dominates in the system and tends to the environmental carrying capacity implying the development of tpp blooms three scenarios were studied in numerical simulations when the zooplankton grazing selectivity level was low i e the ability of zooplankton to distinguish tpp from ntp was low c 0 066 d 0 02 zooplankton populations tended to become extinct in the system resulting in algal blooms when zooplankton grazing selectivity increases c 6 6 d 0 25 the system enters a stable equilibrium point as selectivity levels continued to rise c 10 d 2 5 tpp blooms outbreak the simulation results show that when the zooplankton selectivity level remains at a high level there are critical values of preference coefficient c 17 c 40 and avoidance coefficient d 0 15 d 0 25 in the system and hopf bifurcation occurs when the two selective coefficients pass through their respective critical values from the numerical simulation results we conclude that the preference of ntp and the avoidance of tpp develop zooplankton in ntp tpp z system this analysis well explains the experimental results of pal et al 2010 in which they observed that if there were sufficient resources in the system to make ntp abundant zooplankton would be more inclined to graze ntp and develop zooplankton themselves however they also noted that if the resources in the system are insufficient resulting in a low density of ntp the zooplankton will become extinct by eating large amounts of tpp the results of the numerical simulation are also consistent with chaktabort et al 2012 that the high avoidance level of tpp helps support the coexistence of all species the grazing function in their models assumed that the grazing rate of zooplankton on tpp would tend to gradually increase to the maximum with increasing tpp density when ntp density remained unchanged that is the amount of toxins released by tpp had no significant impact on the grazing rate of zooplankton therefore when the ntp density in the system was low zooplankton tended to become extinct in their models because zooplankton did not reduce grazing on tpp in fact because the toxins released by tpp reduce the grazing rates of zooplankton on both tpp and ntp yuan et al 2017 the three populations will remain in a stable state or coexist through oscillation describing rapid algal succession and blooms this is the advantage of the models established in our study that is it measures the selective grazing level of zooplankton from both preference of ntp and avoidance of tpp therefore the models established in this work has a better simulation of the real situation in terms of mathematical properties 4 conclusion in this work we modified the linear function of the densities of ntp and tpp proposed by chaktabort et al 2012 to a nonlinear one in the denominator of the grazing rate function through the regression analysis of experimental data the results from the numerical analysis showed that the level of avoidance to tpp by zooplankton plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the system the high avoidance of tpp by zooplankton develops both tpp and zooplankton populations in the system as the values of avoidance coefficient increases tpp populations dominate in the system and tend to increase the environmental carrying capacity implying the development of tpp blooms in ntp tpp z systems of the ocean zooplankton prefers ntp to tpp in this study two key parameters the avoidance coefficient and preference coefficient were introduced in the selective grazing function to measure the grazing selectivity of zooplankton in ntp tpp z system the advantage of this function is that the reduction of zooplankton grazing pressure on tpp can be attributed to the presence of ntp and the inhibition of toxins released by tpp on zooplankton grazing the results showed that selective grazing developed both zooplankton and tpp and helped to maintain the coexistence of them both low grazing selectivity i e low values of preference coefficient and avoidance coefficient decreased the zooplankton populations and increased the opportunity for phytoplankton blooms high grazing selectivity increased the zooplankton and tpp populations and make tpp become the dominant species resulting in a rapid algal succession and eventual tpp blooms evolutionary trade off between defense against grazing and competitive ability is well known in planktonic algae and it helps to maintain system stability yoshida et al 2004 grew algal populations for multiple generations in either the presence or absence of the grazing rotifer brachionus calyciflorus and then concluded that grazed algae were better defended yielding a rotifer growth rate 32 below that of animals fed non grazed algae however they also had a diminished competitive ability with a growth rate under nutrient limiting conditions 28 below that of non grazed algae in addition grazed algae had a smaller cell size which influenced the system stability for example zhao et al 2018 investigated that the system went into oscillation with the increasing cell size of phytoplankton and demonstrated that the cell size of phytoplankton increased the complexity of phytoplankton zooplankton interaction and the possibility of phytoplankton blooms therefore changes in phytoplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton lead to phytoplankton evolutionary in cell size and growth rate which in turn affect zooplankton grazing rate we noted that in ntp tpp z system the growth rate of phytoplankton and the toxin release rate of tpp were assumed to be constants for mathematical simplicity in fact when the selective grazing level was low the growth rate of tpp decreased and the toxin release rate increased as a defense against grazing then when grazing pressure was decreased a higher tpp growth rate was induced coupled with a lower toxin release rate this would eventually affect the selective grazing level of zooplankton considering the genetic variation of phytoplankton we should change the growth rate and toxin release rate from constants to functions of avoidance coefficient and preference coefficient in an analysis of the nonlinear behavior of the
