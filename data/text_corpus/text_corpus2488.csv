12440,this paper reports on the development of a model intended to provide an early warning indication of pollution caused by oil produced water and also serve as a predictive tool for compliance noncompliance to the set guidelines related to the discharge of wastewater into municipals channels the development of this model made use of the results obtained for the measurements of the various physico chemical parameters of the oil produced water samples collected from the treatment plant at an oil refiner depot in addition the development of the model made use of the rate of evaporations patterns observed for the oil produced water samples stored in a class a evaporation pan the modelling approach was based on experimental data collected at the oil depot in south africa for six months and a multiplicative model was developed to relate opwe as a function of influencing parameters the developed model indicated a reasonably well accuracy rmse 0 49 mm for the opwe estimation the evaporation and correlation study supported the hypothesis furthermore the model developed by this work has the potential to be used for fingerprinting since opwe from different processes may have similar chemical compositions but in different levels and ratios keywords oil produced water physico chemical properties oil depot model dimensional analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the advancement of technology industrial growth intense urbanization and population growth the quality of freshwater resources has become increasingly compromised 12 13 moreover climate change parameters have added to the strain by causing the decreased volume quantity of available water resources for human consumption it should be noted that water quantity is as important as water quality and therefore both aspects need to be given the due weight thus the appropriate strategies for minimizing industrial waste that are channelled to municipal waterways and which end up contaminating freshwater resources need to be devised and implemented for this reason managing environmental pollution is a legal requirement and it prompts all the involved stakeholders to ensure that the wastewater discharged from industries does not cause any harm to the environment 1 3 the discharge of untreated or partially treated produced water from oil and gas industries into receiving water bodies has caused the alteration and quality degradation of the environmental water making it not suitable for any human use 4 oil produced water opw is a term that is mostly used to refer to water containing oil as a by product during oil and gas exploration it is the largest waste stream emanating from petroleum production operations 5 normally opw exists as water trapped in an underground formation that is brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration and production since this water it is in contact with the hydrocarbon bearing formation for centuries it therefore carries some of the chemical components associated with the formation of hydrocarbon generally opw may include water from the reservoirs water entrapped in the formation and chemicals added during the oil or gas production and treatment process it is a complex mixture of organic acids hydrocarbons heavy metals phenols and oil production chemicals dissolved and dispersed 6 hence the chemical composition of the opw to be discharged into the receiving body needs to meet the stipulated criteria enforced by regulatory agencies to ensure compliance the opw effluents need to be analyzed frequently and this is laborious uneconomical and may even lead to secondary pollution due to the hazardous chemicals and materials depending on the method used during the physico chemical analysis of the effluent therefore this project investigated the possibility of using the evaporation patterns of opw to develop a reliable and predictive model that can be used to predict cases of non compliance for the effluents discharged from industries that deal with petroleum and petroleum products specifically this is possible because the magnitude of certain parameters normally present in oily wastewater has a direct mathematical relationship with the rate and patterns of evaporation since the study of evaporation has been reported by various researchers and has been applied to solve different issues related to the water crisis 7 8 it seemed plausible to use a similar approach to achieve the aim of this study normally laboratory testing of samples collected from the treatment processes presents a one way strategy to ensure that the chemical composition of the effluent meets the stipulated discharge limits enforced by the regulating authorities however this might be a challenge for many oilfields because it is time consuming and expensive since many oilfields do not have well equipped laboratories with relevant equipment to analyze the effluents moreover some testing techniques and approaches may even lead to secondary pollution because some tests involve the use of toxic chemicals and reagents many other studies have been reported on the analysis and mitigation of opw however the aspect of modelling the oil produced water evaporation opwe for compliance purposes has received little attention thus far driven by this knowledge gap this project focused on the development of a model to predict the compliance of opw effluents for both checking quality and attaining regulatory compliance therefore this study explored the possibility of developing a model to predict the compliance of effluent using dimensional analysis the justification for the choice of dimensional analysis stems from the fact that opwe is highly nonlinear in nature thus prompting the search for models that can address this tendency of non linearity in the process since it cannot be directly ascertained but only estimated depending on either the energy or water budget or mass transfer approaches 14 thus dimensional analysis based on buckingham π theorem was employed for this study 2 experimental 2 1 description of the area of study the oil depot where oil produced water opw where samples were obtained distributes petrol diesel and gas to various filling stations the influent wastewater at the depot is subjected to a mechanical treatment device using skimmers to collect contain and recover oil from the water surface the recovered oil is temporarily stored in a built tank on a floating storage unit after the recovery oil step the effluent is then discharged into the receiving water bodies however the oil depot effluent needs to meet the stipulated permissible limits of the local municipality the typical schematic diagram of the oil depot wastewater treatment works and sampling points s is shown in fig 1 2 2 establishing units of measurement in the model development the standard units of evaporation measurements of both the opwe and cwe were expressed in mm day the evaporation rate was measured in terms of water level changes based on the differences observed between two consecutive days and expressed in mm per day mm day the environmental parameters including tds tss tph toc cod and bod were all expressed in milligrams per liter mg l in addition the unit for ec of both clear water and opw was expressed in micro siemens per centimeter μs cm the water temperature of opw topw and air temperature ta were measured in degrees celsius c other parameters such as wind speed w was expressed in meter per second m s whereas solar radiation r was measured in lux but converted to joules per unit time to relate the energy balance of the system in modelling and generation of the real experimental data the main objective was to reduce the number of independent variables simplify the solution and generalize the results thereof following the dimensional analysis based on the buckingham π theorem 9 the parameters were expressed in terms of basic properties as shown in table 1 i e their dimensions length mass time and temperature 2 3 model development based on buckingham s pi theorem a model is a simplification of the reality on the ground and it is generally a representation between the source and a target 15 in this case the target represents an unknown phenomenon or object that needs to be explained and the source is a familiar phenomenon or object assisting the scientists to understand the target models play very central roles in expert scientists reasoning and problem solving 16 19 in addition they are instrumental in summarizing data making predictions justifying outcomes and facilitating communication in science izady et al 10 11 developed models for predicting the evaporation of wastewater effluents and this study is using a similar approach with minor modifications to predict compliance of the wastewater effluent and dimensional analysis based on buckingham pi theorem 9 to be used to formulate a multiplicative equation eq 1 1 opwe c r w 2 tds w 2 tds cwe r α r ec w 3 tds β tph tds γ tss tds δ toc tds ε bod tds μ cod tds ρ t opw t a ω where opwe is oil produced water evaporation

topw is the oil produced water temperature tph is total petroleum hydrocarbon cod is chemical oxygen demand bod is biological oxygen demand toc is the total organic carbon 2 4 statistical treatment of data the statistical package for social sciences ibm spss statistics version 25 was employed for data analysis the analysis of variance anova was used to determine statistically significant differences in the concentration of the opw collected at an oil depot at a 0 05 confidence level of significance 2 5 compliance study department of water affairs and water research commission 20 21 guidelines were used to assess compliance with the opw effluents due to the prevailing environmental conditions in south africa and the scope of parameters stated in the guidelines 3 results and discussion 3 1 opwe equation derivation the measured daily cumulative opwe daily cumulative cwe and opw variables included tph toc bod cod ec tds tss and topw while climatic variables included w ta

1 θ and mt 2 m mass t time l length θ degree therefore the number of variables was 13 and the number of basic dimensions was 4 meaning that all the variables can be combined into 9 13 4 dimensionless variables π terms to construct the final model since the key role of the water body temperature in relation to air temperature in influencing the trend of evaporation from water bodies 10 this work contemplated topw ta to be one of the dimensionless variables after an extensive search for the best model opwe cwe ec tph tss toc bod and cod were regarded as the best non repeating variables and hence tds w and r were chosen as repeating variables leading to the following dimensionless variables 2 π 1 w a 1 r b 1 tds c 1 opwe π 2 w a 2 r b 2 tds c 2 cwe π 3 w a 3 r b 3 tds c 3 ec π 4 w a 4 r

c7 and c8 are the powers of each variable making the π terms dimensionless and were solved by equating the units as follows 3 lmtθ 0 l t 1 a 1 m t 2 b 1 m l 3 c 1 l lmtθ 0 l t 1 a 2 m t 2 b 2 m l 3 c

dimensionless are constants to fit the equation to the true physical relationship holding in reality and were determined using regression analysis on the experimental data 3 2 obtaining the coefficients the physico chemical data collected from the oil field may december 2019 was randomized to minimize bias and the coefficients were determined by regression analysis using a software known as a statistical package for the social sciences spss 70 of the data was used for calibrating the coefficients obtained c α β γ δ ε ϑ μ and ω and the remaining 30 was used for validation the reason to subdivide the data into two sets is because the calibration curve is to train the data set and the validation is for estimating prediction error to compare models the data were fitted to a nonlinear regression analysis since opwe is nonlinear in nature to determine the coefficients spps was provided with the starting value for each constant and was then used an iterative method to change the values of the constants to get the best fit of nonlinear expression that fits the data therefore the spss gave an iteration history with an iterative table indicating how many steps the iteration takes from the starting value to the end to get the best fit results 3 3 statistical analysis based on the regression analysis from the statistical package for social sciences ibm spss statistics 22 the constants of eq 7 were obtained as c 200 337 α 0 8028 β 0 0487 γ 0 191 δ 1 130 ε 0 0326 ϑ 0 707 μ 1 1690 and ω 0 157 leading to the final mathematical model eq 7 7 opwe 200 34 r w 2 tds w 2 tds

estimated opwe was obtained by fitting the coefficient values to eq 7 and statistical chemometrics used to characterize the external predictivity of a model were coefficient of determination r2 and relative mean absolute error rmse to evaluate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed method the chemometrics was calculated using opwe measured and opwe estimated from the validation data set the opwe estimated was calculated and the chemometrics methods were also calculated using opwe measured and opwe estimated table 2 r2 is generally defined as the square of the correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values in a regression 22 the coefficient of determination analysis aimed to determine how well the model fits the data as table 2 showed the regression model for calibration accounted for 70 of the variance which can be explained by the entire data set of dependent variables while for validation purposes it accounted for 73 this suggests that the more variance that is accounted for by the regression model the closer the data points will fall to the fitted regression line moreover the derived equation fairly predicts the oil produced evaporation the r2 obtained in this study is similar to the one reported for modelling wastewater evaporation using dimensional analysis by izady et al 11 rmse is a common metric that is normally used to measure the accuracy of continuous variables and for this reason it was employed in model evaluation in this study it is defined as a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error it is the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation this metric has been used in many fields including meteorology air quality and climate research studies 23 as shown in table 2 the rmse statistic which is a measure of the global goodness of fit between the estimated and measured opwe evaporation is 0 43 mm which is satisfactory because lower values indicate better fit another useful metric was used for model evaluations which is known as the mean absolute error mae eq 8 which is used to quantify the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is 0 33 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i mae i 1 n abs y i y i n 3 5 model application for real environment simulation data that was obtained during the oil refinery experiments were applied to the multiplicative developed model to generate an output file predicted value the output data from the model were compared to the estimated obtained from the developed model therefore the developed model has the potential to be used to predict the compliance of the effluents from oil refinery industries therefore the evaluated eq 6 was reduced to a simple linear relationship let w 2

potential application of the derived model for the compliance of the wastewater effluent data that was obtained during the oil refinery experiments were applied to the multiplicative developed model to generate an output file predicted value the output data from the model were compared to the estimated obtained from the developed model the words prediction and estimation are sometimes used interchangeably in non technical writing and they seem to function similarly however in a statistical problem particularly for modelling there is a sharp difference between them it is imperative to note the difference because an estimator uses data to guess at a parameter while a predictor uses the data to guess at some random value that is not part of the dataset therefore the developed model has the potential to be used to predict the compliance of the effluents from oil refinery industries 4 conclusions in this study a multiplicative model was developed to predict compliance with the opw using dimensional analysis the study saw it fit to develop this model since industries dealing with activities that lead to the discharge of opw for instance petrochemical plants and petroleum refineries are facing the problem of disposing of the waste generated both solid water issues related to wastewater from petroleum industries contains different types of organic and inorganic pollutants such as sulfides btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene hydrocarbons phenol and heavy metals 24 27 the reason arising from these industries that face challenges in disposing of the wastewater include the effectiveness of the various treatments used to treat the water and appropriately checking the compliance of the wastewater prior to its discharge into the environment opw industries are among the fastest growing industries which imply that large quantities of toxic wastewater have to be released into the environment this implies that there is a huge amount of wastewater that needs to be verified for compliance moreover other tests such as cod analysis are known to involve the use of hazardous chemicals and reagents such as hexavalent chromium sulfuric acid mercury and other hazardous substances depending on the method used 28 all this is associated with the possibility that may lead to secondary pollution therefore the developed model can eliminate such mishaps and can also save time and costs for the industries opwe from different processes may have similar chemical compositions but at different levels and ratios this can be exploited to differentiate them using the same developed model as the pattern of the coefficients will be characteristic of a certain opw the model developed was based on experimental data collected on the oil depot in south africa for six months as a result of this analysis a multiplicative model to formulate opwe as a function of influencing parameters indicated a reasonably well accuracy rmse 0 49 for the opwe estimation the model can then be used to fingerprint and identify culprits in case of discrepancies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

estimated opwe was obtained by fitting the coefficient values to eq 7 and statistical chemometrics used to characterize the external predictivity of a model were coefficient of determination r2 and relative mean absolute error rmse to evaluate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed method the chemometrics was calculated using opwe measured and opwe estimated from the validation data set the opwe estimated was calculated and the chemometrics methods were also calculated using opwe measured and opwe estimated table 2 r2 is generally defined as the square of the correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values in a regression 22 the coefficient of determination analysis aimed to determine how well the model fits the data as table 2 showed the regression model for calibration accounted for 70 of the variance which can be explained by the entire data set of dependent variables while for validation purposes it accounted for 73 this suggests that the more variance that is accounted for by the regression model the closer the data points will fall to the fitted regression line moreover the derived equation fairly predicts the oil produced evaporation the r2 obtained in this study is similar to the one reported for modelling wastewater evaporation using dimensional analysis by izady et al 11 rmse is a common metric that is normally used to measure the accuracy of continuous variables and for this reason it was employed in model evaluation in this study it is defined as a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error it is the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation this metric has been used in many fields including meteorology air quality and climate research studies 23 as shown in table 2 the rmse statistic which is a measure of the global goodness of fit between the estimated and measured opwe evaporation is 0 43 mm which is satisfactory because lower values indicate better fit another useful metric was used for model evaluations which is known as the mean absolute error mae eq 8 which is used to quantify the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is 0 33 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i mae i 1 n abs y i y i n 3 5 model application for real environment simulation data that was obtained during the oil refinery experiments were applied to the multiplicative developed model to generate an output file predicted value the output data from the model were compared to the estimated obtained from the developed model therefore the

potential application of the derived model for the compliance of the wastewater effluent data that was obtained during the oil refinery experiments were applied to the multiplicative developed model to generate an output file predicted value the output data from the model were compared to the estimated obtained from the developed model the words prediction and estimation are sometimes used interchangeably in non technical writing and they seem to function similarly however in a statistical problem particularly for modelling there is a sharp difference between them it is imperative to note the difference because an estimator uses data to guess at a parameter while a predictor uses the data to guess at some random value that is not part of the dataset therefore the developed model has the potential to be used to predict the compliance of the effluents from oil refinery industries 4 conclusions in this study a multiplicative model was developed to predict compliance with the opw using dimensional analysis the study saw it fit to develop this model since industries dealing with activities that lead to the discharge of opw for instance petrochemical plants and petroleum refineries are facing the problem of disposing of the waste generated both solid water issues related to wastewater from petroleum industries contains different types of organic and inorganic pollutants such as sulfides btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene hydrocarbons phenol and heavy metals 24 27 the reason arising from these industries that face challenges in disposing of the wastewater include the effectiveness of the various treatments used to treat the water and appropriately checking the compliance of the wastewater prior to its discharge into the environment opw industries are among the fastest growing industries which imply that large quantities of toxic wastewater have to be released into the environment this implies that there is a huge amount of wastewater that needs to be verified for compliance moreover other tests such as cod analysis are known to involve the use of hazardous chemicals and reagents such as hexavalent chromium sulfuric acid mercury and other hazardous substances depending on the method used 28 all this is associated with the possibility that may lead to secondary pollution therefore the developed model can eliminate such mishaps and can also save time and costs for the industries opwe from different processes may have similar chemical compositions but at different levels and ratios this can be exploited to differentiate them using the same developed model as the pattern of the coefficients will be characteristic of a certain opw the model developed was based on experimental data collected on the oil depot in south africa for six months as a result of this analysis a multiplicative model to formulate opwe as a function of influencing parameters indicated a reasonably well accuracy rmse 0 49 for

12441,a novel alkali diffusion reactor using ceramic porous media ceram adr was newly developed for long term treatment of acidity and heavy metals in acid mine drainage amd without external energy the batch and column tests were performed to investigate the neutralization capabilities of six alkaline chemicals i e mgo caco3 cao sio2 na2co3 and nahco3 and the effects on pore size and hydraulic retention time hrt of ceram adrs among these six alkaline chemicals the ceram adr containing nahco3 yielded a suitable ph range for water quality guideline ph values from 5 0 to 9 5 for an hrt of 1 2 days as well as had the best efficiency in terms of consistent alkaline diffusion and long term heavy metal removal 99 the precipitation process was found to be a major mechanism in the removal of heavy metals based on the continuous column tests it was evaluated that the ceram adr successfully treated three consecutive runs with approximately 340 bed volumes of amd for neutralization and heavy metal removal indicating that the ceram adr can be maintained for over three years without a lapse in performance capsule abstract an alkali diffusion reactor based on porous ceramic media is developed for the long term remediation of acidity and heavy metals in amd graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acid mine drainage alkali diffusion ceramic reactor long term neutralization heavy metals data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd is one of the most significant environmental problems faced by the mining industry in general amd is caused by the oxidation of sulfide minerals in mine tailings under aerated conditions and the highly acidic water associated with metal rich wastewater 1 2 thus it is necessary to remediate the amd before its release into water bodies which could be hazardous to humans and ecosystems 3 5 over recent decades a variety of techniques have been developed for amd remediation including neutralization sorption oxidation reduction electrochemistry flocculation filtration settling sedimentation ion exchange and crystallization 6 9 among these techniques neutralization i e controlling the ph with alkaline chemicals is the most common and cost effective technology for amd treatment 10 because increasing the ph of wastewater can reduce the solubility of heavy metal ions which can be separated from the aqueous phase often in the form of hydroxide complexes 11 the amd treatment efficiency and operation costs are strongly related to the type of alkaline chemicals 10 12 limestone caco3 hydrated lime ca oh 2 caustic soda naoh soda ash na2co3 calcium oxide cao anhydrous ammonia nh3 magnesium oxide mgo and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 are the most commonly used alkaline chemical for neutralizing amd in existing treatment 13 16 the by products from industrial processes are also applied extensively to achieve the neutralization efficiencies and to reduce the costs of amd treatment including slag cement kiln dust and fly ash 17 20 controlling the ph using alkaline chemicals requires a diffusive alkaline system to ensure the continuous supply of alkalinity in the amd treatment system however unfortunately they are prone to passivation i e loss of reactivity due to coating and clogging i e loss of permeability due to the formation of precipitates on the surface of the grains or in the pore space of the system these problems would result in the subsequent loss of hydraulic conductivity and lead to the failure of the treatment operation 21 24 moreover long term treatment performance can be limited by the gradual depletion of the treatment agent and high operating energy although most of these materials could perform well initially 2 10 25 therefore more intensive research is needed to develop sustainable neutralization systems for the long term treatment of amd 10 in this study we newly i develop the alkali diffusion reactor composed of ceramic porous material for the long term treatment of amd because the ceramic porous material with a smaller pore size could prevent the excessive quick release of alkaline chemicals ii several essential parameters including types of the alkaline chemicals and hydraulic retention time hrt are determined to the optimal operating conditions of the alkali diffusion reactor iii the acid neutralization and their effects on heavy metal removal within the diffusion system are identified iv blockage of ceramic porous diffusion reactor caused by the formation of precipitates is investigated to evaluate the consistent performance of the reactor for the long term treatment of amd v finally the possibility of reusing the diffusion reactor for amd treatment is verified based on its effectiveness in neutralizing acidity and removing heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 alkaline chemicals alkaline chemicals such as calcium oxide cao calcium carbonate caco3 magnesium oxide mgo silicon dioxide sio2 sodium carbonate na2co3 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 have been widely used to neutralize amd in a conventional amd treatment system 13 26 28 in this study the six alkaline chemicals mentioned above 99 9 sigma aldrich were selected to determine the optimal neutralizing agents for use in the diffusion reactor the chemical and physical properties of these alkaline chemicals are presented in table s1 2 2 artificial amd synthesis artificial amd was synthesized based on the ph level and the composition of heavy metals in amd of mining site located in south korea 29 the artificial amd was prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 4h2o feso4 7h2o mnso4 h2o and znso4 7h2o 99 r m chemical in deionized water the concentrations of heavy metal were set to 9 0 mg l 1 for cd 50 mg l 1 for fe and 20 mg l 1 for mn and zn the target ph ph 2 5 of the solution was adjusted by adding 1 m h2so4 solution the artificial amd was stirred for 24 h hereinafter amd particles were filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter 2 3 preparation and characterization of alkali diffusion reactor alkali diffusion reactor based on porous ceramic media hereinafter ceram adr was fabricated using a commercial ceramic water filter doulton co w9222909 and filled with the alkaline chemicals the commercial ceramic water filter had a height of 40 mm and diameter of 39 mm with the top and bottom of the filter covered with silicon caps which acted as porous media fig 1 the ceram adr consisting of the porous ceramic media was dried for 24 h in an oven at 333 15 k after drying alkaline chemicals 20 0 g were added to the interior of the ceram adr and it was covered with a silicon cap to compare its efficiency with those of other types of porous media alkali diffusion reactor based on carbon hereinafter c adr was modified using a commercial sediment filter with the same preparation techniques as those used for ceram adr doulton w9240001 the chemical composition surface morphology and functional groups of the adr surfaces were characterized via x ray powder diffraction xrd d8 advance xrd bruker billerica ma usa with cukα radiation k 1 54051 å field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray analysis fesem edx fei quanta 450 waltham ma usa edx oxford su8010 hitachi chiyoda city tokyo japan the pore sizes of the porous media were analyzed using a hg porosimeter autopore 9520 micromeritics norcross ga usa 2 4 batch tests of c adr and ceram adr both standard and continuous batch studies were carried out to assess the applicability of the alkaline chemicals for long term treatment of amd standard batch tests were used to compare the neutralizing capacities of the six selected alkaline chemicals i e cao caco3 mgo sio2 na2co3 and nahco3 continuous batch tests were performed to select an optimal alkaline chemical effective porous medium and suitable hrt for amd remediation in the standard batch tests c adrs filled with the individual alkaline chemicals were immersed in 1 4 l of amd a magnetic stirrer was spun at 100 rpm at the bottom of the c adr as shown in fig 1 a the treated solution was sampled at 1 h intervals for the initial 6 h followed by continuous sampling every 6 h in the continuous batch tests ceram adrs filled with the alkaline chemicals i e na2co3 and nahco3 were tested to determine their long term neutralization capability for amd treatment 2 5 column tests using ceram adr a column test was performed to examine the acid neutralization and heavy metal removal efficiency of ceram adr filled with the alkaline chemical i e na2co3 and nahco3 fig s1 the column consisted of a nylon mesh disk gravel and ceram adr filled with the alkaline chemical as shown in fig 1 b two different sizes for the granular gravel 2 3 mm and 8 9 mm were placed in the column small sized gravel was placed at the bottom of the column to minimize clogging of the inlet large sized gravel was placed between the porous media and columns to adjust the void volume often referred to as the effective volume a nylon mesh disk was used to prevent clogging at the influent and effluent ports the empty bed volume ebv of the column was designed to be 1 l while the void volume was adjusted to 0 5 l using large sized gravel the void volume was calculated based on the ratio between the ebv and porosity while considering the specific gravity 30 the amd storage was located at a position higher than that of the column reactor to promote gravity flow the long term neutralization capacities and removal efficiencies of the heavy metals of the ceram adr filled with the alkaline chemical was examined at different hrts i e 1 day and 2 day prior to column operation the continuous column with the alkaline chemical was fully saturated with amd after the alkaline chemical was depleted the ceram adr was refilled with the alkaline chemical twice per day to understand the differences in the alkalinity diffusion flux between na2co3 and nahco3 in the ceram adrs fick s first law on diffusive flux is applied as follows 1 j i l i d μ i dx where j is the diffusion flux that measures the amount of substance i that flows through a unit area during a unit time interval l i is the diffusion coefficient which is proportional to the squared velocity of the diffusing particles μi is the concentration the amount of substance per unit volume and x is the position of which the dimension is length the driving force for one dimensional diffusion is the quantity dμi dx 1 which is the concentration gradient for ideal mixtures 2 6 alkalinity ph heavy metal analysis and numerical modeling the alkalinity ph and heavy metal concentrations of all amd samples were measured in the batch and column tests the alkalinity was measured once per day 10 min before changing the amd using the test methods specified by the american society for testing and materials astm d1067 16 the concentrations of heavy metals i e cd fe mn and zn were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 5300v perkin elmer waltham ma usa precipitates were washed by the ultrapure water and were then dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h the chemical and structural characterization of precipitate particles were identified using fesem edx xrd and ftir the particle size distribution of precipitate particles was measured using a digital sieve shaker with diameters of 5 25 25 38 and 53 μm analysette 3 pro fritsch idar oberstein germany the theoretical precipitation of the heavy metals was predicted using the visual minteq simulation spearman correlation analysis was conducted to figure out main operation parameters related with heavy metal removal rate specific functions of the modified sigmoid pseudo second order and exponential rise were used to simulate the kinetics of the cumulative alkalinity 31 33 table s2 more details on the pre treatment and instrumental analytical conditions were provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical properties of c adr and ceram adr the composition and structural properties of ceram adr were identified and compared with those of c adr fesem edx was used to analyze the physical morphologies of the c adr and ceram adr surfaces fig 2 the surface images of the carbon and porous ceramic media are presented in fig 2 a1 a3 the surface of ceram adr was more compact than that of c adr fig 2 b1 b3 resulting in smaller pore size in the ceramic porous media similar results were identified in the pore size analyses of the c adr and ceram adr using an hg porosimeter the primary pore size of the carbon and ceramic media ranged from 100 to 250 μm average of 226 4 μm and 2 6 μm average of 2 9 μm respectively fig 2 a5 and b5 it is expected that i water molecules i e 0 275 nm and ion species from the alkaline chemicals can penetrate the porous ceramic media and ii ceram adr with a smaller pore size can prevent the rapid release of alkaline chemicals resulting in the long term release of alkaline chemicals edx spectrum showed that the main component in the c adr was carbon 92 3 in c adr whereas the ceram adr was mainly composed of si 58 7 and al 21 8 indicating negligible heavy metal leaching from adr during long term treatment of amd fig 2 a4 and b4 3 2 assessment of alkaline chemicals for acid neutralization and heavy metals removal in the adr system the choice of alkaline chemicals is important for acid neutralization and heavy metal removal the neutralization capacities of the alkaline chemicals i e mgo sio2 caco3 cao naco3 and nahco3 were evaluated in the c adr as shown in fig 3 a the phs of the amd in all reactors filled with the six alkaline chemicals increased from 3 0 to 10 6 over 48 h the increasing ph could be explained by the consumption of a substantial amounts of alkaline chemicals for neutralization process moreover the neutralization process is assumed to be predominantly through the buffering capacity of hydroxyl and carbonate groups of the alkaline chemicals 34 35 the neutralizing process which involved the dissolution of the six alkaline chemicals in the acidic solution is controlled by the surface chemical reaction as shown in following eqs 2 7 36 2 mgo s 2h aq mg 2 aq h 2 o l 3 cao s 2h aq ca 2 aq h 2 o l 4 sio 2 s 2h aq si 2 aq h 2 o l 5 caco 3 s 2h aq ca 2 aq co 2 g h 2 o l 6 na 2 co 3 s 2h aq 2na aq co 2 g h 2 o l 7 nahco 3 s h aq na aq co 2 g h 2 o l notably the chemical reactions involve the transfer of cations and anions of alkaline chemicals from the solid to the solution in which the cations are hydrated the transfer of anions involves protonation or hydroxylation reactions at the surface of the solid forming water 36 the solution ph of two reactors filled with naco3 and nahco3 rapidly increased up to 10 6 and 8 3 respectively within 5 min of the initial reaction the neutralization capacity of na2co3 was significantly higher than that of nahco3 in the order of na2co3 nahco3 mgo cao sio2 caco3 the solidification of cao caco3 mgo and sio2 even occurred in the c adr fig s2 these results may be due to i the much higher solubility of na2co3 170 g l 1 at 293 15 k and nahco3 96 g l 1 at 293 15 k compared to other alkaline chemicals 2 0 g l 1 at 293 15 k table s1 37 and ii 2 fold more neutralization reaction per unit one mole of na2co3 eq 6 compared to nahco3 eq 7 it seems likely that na2co3 might be a potential alkaline chemical to be filled in the ceramic adr however there is need to examine whether the phs raised by alkaline chemicals could be contributed on removal of heavy metals from amd the ph is one of the important factors in controlling the removal of heavy metals the high ph can cause the chemical precipitation of heavy metals a process that removes heavy metal from amd 38 39 in the adrs with na2co3 and nahco3 the removal efficiencies of the heavy metals i e fe mn zn and cd were identified as shown in fig 3 b and c respectively the concentrations of fe mn zn and cd in the c adr filled with na2co3 and nahco3 were reduced up to 99 5 within 1 h it indicates that ph increased by na2co3 and nahco3 led to the simultaneous removal of heavy metals from amd however for the application of na2co3 and nahco3 as potential alkaline chemical more detail is needed on i the neutralizing capacity and heavy metals removal under continuous flow condition of amd and ii whether acidity and heavy metal levels in effluents from the ceram adr could be accepted by approved the general standards for discharge of environmental pollution in the following section 3 3 the i and ii are discussed in detail 3 3 long term treatment using ceram adr 3 3 1 simultaneous removal of heavy metals by long term neutralization continuous column tests were conducted to obtain detailed data on the efficiency of c adr and ceram adr filled with na2co3 and nahco3 for the long term neutralization and heavy metal removal from amd an hrt of 1 day represents a change in the amd every 24 h the levels of acidity and heavy metal i e cd fe mn and zn in the effluents from the two adrs were evaluated based on the acceptable limits ph 6 9 cd 2 0 mg l 1 fe 3 0 mg l 1 mn 2 0 mg l 1 zn 5 0 mg l 1 of the general standards for discharge of environmental pollution proposed by the us epa 38 39 figs 4 and 5 the ph of the effluent in the c adr with na2co3 was higher ph 10 by the second i e 2 days phases and exceeded the maximum acceptable limit i e ph 9 after that the ph was rapidly decreased to ph 2 5 at the third phase i e 3 days fig 4 a the concentrations of cd fe mn and zn were also higher than the acceptable limit after the second phase which could be due to rapid drop in ph within 2 days fig 4 b d the ph values of initial effluent from the c adr with nahco3 were maintained in range of ph 8 0 8 5 until the third phase i e 3 days the concentrations of cd fe mn and zn were also lower than the acceptable limit during the first three phases it shows that the phs of effluents would be maintained within an acceptable limit of ph and heavy metals during 3 days the phs of the initial effluents from the ceram adr containing na2co3 increased up to 10 5 and then was exceeded the maximum acceptable ph limit over the period of 9 days the ph in the nahco3 treated solution increased up to 8 3 and complied with the acceptable ph range over the period of 14 days fig 5 a the concentrations of cd fe mn and zn in effluent from the ceram adr with na2co3 and nahco3 simultaneously complied with the acceptable level range over the period of 10 days and 13 days respectively fig 5 b d the breakthrough points of mn were lower than that of other metals which may be due to precipitation such as metal hydroxide or carbonate at ph 7 8 and pe of 0 0 27 40 41 the results indicate that at alkaline ph value greater than ph 7 8 the cd fe mn and zn from the effluent can be simultaneously removed by chemical precipitation process moreover the ceramic adr with nahco3 may be more suitable for long term neutralization and heavy metal removal under continuous flow of amd compared to the c adr with nahco3 however if the retention time of the amd influent is extended it could cause a decrease in the neutralizing capacity of alkaline chemicals therefore it is necessary to compare the effects of long retention times on acid neutralization and heavy metal removal of the ceram adr with na2co3 and nahco3 3 3 2 effects of long retention time with slow influent the effects of a longer retention time on amd remediation i e neutralization and heavy metal removal were determined with ceram adr with na2co3 and nahco3 at hrt of 2 day fig 6 the initial ph values of the effluents discharged from ceram adrs with na2co3 and nahco3 increased to 10 8 and 8 7 respectively the ph of the effluent from ceram adrs with na2co3 exceeded the maximum acceptable limit of the guideline until 12 days after which the ph was reduced to the minimum acceptable ph until 16 days whereases the phs of the effluent treated by the ceram adr with nahco3 complied with the acceptable ph range during the first 20 days moreover the ph ph 7 8 corresponding to the simultaneous removal of heavy metals was also stably maintained for 20 days the concentration of all heavy metal in the effluents from the ceram adr with nahco3 were below guideline values for 18 days overall it took the ceram adr containing nahco3 20 days and 14 days to reduce the heavy metal content of amd to the acceptable level at hrts of 1 day and 2 day respectively this could be attributed to the increasing pore flux of the porous ceramic media with increasing external flow on the membrane surface during amd recharge into the ceram adr the pore flux in the ceramic media increases resulting in enhanced diffusion and consumption of alkaline chemicals in the reactor the results indicated that an hrt of 2 day in the ceram adr with nahco3 can be effective for neutralization and heavy metal removal but nahco3 would be quickly consumed compared with a shorter hrt the heavy metal concentrations in the effluents that are higher than acceptable standards due to the exhaustion of nahco3 in the ceram adr need to be treated through the consecutive operation of the alkali diffusion column reactors the feasibility of consecutive operation of the alkali diffusion column reactors is verified based on the reusability of ceram adr containing nahco3 for sustainable amd remediation in section 3 5 3 4 possible mechanisms of acid neutralization and heavy metals removal in ceram adr 3 4 1 diffusion of alkaline chemical in porous ceram adr the diffusion rate of the alkaline chemicals is strongly related to their neutralization efficiency 10 12 the diffusion processes across micro porous media such as the ceram adr can be classified into two mechanisms solution diffusion and pore flow mechanisms the solution diffusion mechanism is primarily driven by chemical potential gradients whereas the pore flow mechanism is primarily driven by pressure gradients 42 in this study the primary diffusion mechanism of the alkaline chemicals in ceram adr was dense solution diffusion driven by the differences in ionic strengths across the porous media ionized alkaline chemicals can cause a chemical potential gradient between the inside and outside of the ceram adr the removal mechanism of heavy metal ions in the amd was dominated by precipitation with diffused alkaline chemical in the ceram adr therefore the diffusion across the ceram adr may be driven by the following processes i the solvent i e water in the amd is gradually transported to the internal ceram adr whereas the dissolved heavy metal ions in the transferred solvent can be adsorbed by the micro pores ii the alkaline chemicals in ceram adr can be dissolved and diffused into the amd via osmotic pressure depending on the gradient of the molar concentration of the solute and iii the heavy metal ions in amd can be precipitated by reacting with the diffused alkaline chemicals resulting in acid neutralization and removal of heavy metal ions from the amd fig 7 to understand the differences in the alkalinity diffusion flux between na2co3 and nahco3 in the ceram adrs the alkalinity of the amd was measured daily before amd recharge into the reactor system fig 8 a the cumulative alkalinity was measured for 18 days fig 8 b the cumulative alkalinities of the ceram adrs filled with na2co3 and nahco3 reached equilibrium after 8 days and 13 days respectively indicating that the na2co3 release rate was approximately 1 6 fold higher than that of nahco3 the difference in release rates was similar to their water solubility ratios 1 7 fold 164 g l 1 for na2co3 and 96 g l 1 for nahco3 respectively table s1 the results showed that molecular solubility tends to exhibit a directly proportional relationship to diffusivity 43 the cumulative alkalinity indicated slow diffusion at the early stage before an exponential rise theoretically 20 g of na2co3 and nahco3 can be dissolved to yield 11 4 g of co3 2 and 14 5 g of hco3 respectively which would be converted to 18 7 g and 11 9 g of caco3 respectively the theoretical alkalinity was compared with the maximum cumulative alkalinity the difference was attributed to increase in ph and the generation of metal precipitates in the form of metal hydroxide or metal carbonate 33 moreover cumulative alkalinity was simulated with the modified sigmoid function these results were compared with the pseudo second order and exponential rise models table s2 the modified sigmoid function had the highest accuracy with a high r 2 value 0 99 for ceram adrs filled with na2co3 and nahco3 this result indicated that the alkaline chemicals have an initial slow diffusion phase and then an exponential rise phase sigmoid function resulting from the saturation of the alkaline chemicals in the media pores 42 3 4 2 precipitation process of heavy metals in porous ceram adr during neutralization with alkaline chemicals the heavy metal precipitate may result in clogging of the porous ceram adr the precipitates formed in the ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 were characterized using xrd ftir particle size analysis and sem edx as illustrated in fig 9 overall heavy metal ions mainly precipitate in the form of metal carbonate or metal hydroxide depending on the solution conditions i e the ph carbonate ion concentration and redox condition and characteristics of the heavy metals i e the pka values and reaction coefficients with hydroxide or carbonate cd mainly precipitated in the form of cdco3 as shown in fig 9 a which was because cd tends to form metal carbonate in carbonic rich solution 27 44 moreover fe precipitated in the form of feco3 rather than its hydroxide form fe oh 2 fig 9 a this may be due to the carbon rich solution which favored its precipitation as a carbonate and the higher kinetic rate constant k 3 2 10 11 of the alkaline solution as following reaction eqs 8 and 9 45 8 fe 2 2oh fe oh 2 s k fe oh 2 8 0 10 16 9 fe 2 co 3 2 feco 3 s k feco 3 3 2 10 11 mn prefers to react with carbonate group rather than hydroxide group in carbon rich solution at ph 7 8 27 however due to an ionic competition with iron ions manganese carbonate can be re ionized to mn2 as shown in eqs 10 and 11 46 10 2mnco 3 s o 2 g 2mno 2 s 2co 2 g 11 mno 2 s 2fe 2 2h 2 o l 2feooh s mn 2 2h similar to the above xrd results the metal carbonate concentrations cdco3 feco3 and mnco3 also prevail in the ph pe diagram obtained using vminteq table s3 and fig s5 respectively zn precipitates as zn oh 2 at ph 7 5 while znco3 is predominant in carbon rich solutions due to high kinetic rate 47 48 vminteq also showed high zinc hydroxide formation being favored at alkaline ph and zinc carbonate being favored at neutral ph table s3 contrarily zno was detected by xrd formation of zno is likely due to the oxidation of zinc hydroxide i e zn oh 2 and zinc carbonate i e znco3 while drying the samples for xrd analysis 49 51 specific functional groups formed in the precipitants from ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 were determined by ftir fig 9 b in precipitants from ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 the presence of hydroxyl groups o h is indicated by their stretching modes at 3200 cm 1 in precipitate from ceram adr containing nahco3 stretching bands corresponding to 1661 cm 1 and 1637 cm 1 indicated the presence of amide c o and carbonyl h o h groups respectively 52 54 the two stretching bands corresponding to amide and carbonyl groups at ph of 8 3 which may be due to i the predominance of bicarbonate group of hco at ph 8 0 and ii higher concentration of free carbon ions at ph 7 0 than at ph 10 i e free carbon ion concentration 22 10 3 at ph 7 0 and 6 82 10 4 at ph 10 55 additionally the stretching band corresponding to 865 cm 1 indicated the presence of fe o bonds 3 4 3 blockage of porous ceram adr by precipitates the particle size of metal precipitates is dependent on the type of heavy metal for example iron hydroxide particles range from 0 1 to 100 μm 56 58 particle sizes of iron carbonate precipitates are larger than 420 μm 45 in the study 85 of metal precipitates formed in ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 ranged in between 5 and 62 μm mean distribution of particle size 15 25 μm fig 9 which were bigger than the pore size average 2 9 μm of the ceramic media fig 2 a5 it indicated that the metal ions would form several precipitates in the solution after passing through the ceram adrs metal precipitates cannot infiltrate into the ceramic media therefore blockage of porous ceramic media by the metal precipitates was negligible in the present study this was supported by the results of the outer and inner surface analysis of ceram adrs after experiments the amount of fe precipitated on the outer surface was about 10 fold more than that on the inner surface fig s6 these results shed light on the applicability and performance of ceram adrs containing nahco3 for acid neutralization and heavy metal removal from amd in addition it is important to examine the reusability performance of the ceram adrs for sustainable amd remediation in the following section 3 5 the reusability of ceram adr is identified in detail 3 5 consecutive operation of ceram adr refilled with nahco3 the reusability of ceram adr containing nahco3 was examined using ceram adr column tests with the optimal hrt the column was designed to treat 365 bvs of amd and the experiment was simulated to represent a year of consistent usage without electricity and additional alkaline chemical fig 10 during the first operation the heavy metal concentration in the effluents at 340 bvs was within acceptable water quality limits with ph 7 8 the cd and zn concentrations in the effluents at 345 bvs exceeded the water quality limit with ph of 6 2 the fe concentration in the effluents at 365 bvs was higher than the acceptable water quality limit with ph of 5 01 the mn concentration in the effluent showed an increasing trend with increase in bvs and it exceeds the acceptable water quality limit at 340 bvs with ph values of 7 1 and 6 4 at 305 bvs and 340 bvs respectively among the heavy metals mn reached a breakthrough point faster than other heavy metals which could be attributed to the fact that mn can be precipitated at higher ph 7 8 than the other metals 40 the heavy metal concentrations in the effluents at bvs ranging from 340 to 350 were higher than acceptable standards with ph 6 3 the low alkalinity may result in low kinetics of metal precipitation at 345 bvs the alkalinity was 0 01 mg l 1 caco3 consistent results were observed in the continuous batch after exhaustion of alkaline chemical the ceram adr was refilled with nahco3 at 400 bvs and 800 bvs the neutralization and heavy metal removal results in the second and third phases were similar to those of the first operation the removal rate of the four metal ions in the amd had the following order fe cd zn mn the ceramic medium maintained its porosity throughout the test period these results indicated that the ceram adr can be operated for over three years as a diffusion reactor without loss in performance with hrt of 1 day another benefit of the proposed system is its flexibility because the operating parameters in alkali diffusion ceramic reactor such as the hrt bvs chemical quantity and flow rate are changeable depending on the system requirements the amount of alkaline chemicals can be also modified if long term or high efficiency operations are required however sludge i e precipitate particles and wastewater produced through the ceramic diffusion reactor with nahco3 during long term treatment of amd will require further metal recovery processing and final disposal therefore in order to mitigate the amd sludge further studies on full scale metal recovery techniques such as membrane distillation 59 nanofiltration 60 chemical oxidation techniques 61 electrochemical 62 selective precipitation 63 and solvent extraction 60 are needed to improve the environmental economic and technical feasibility of the ceramic diffusion reactor with nahco3 designed in our study 4 conclusions easily manageable adrs consisting of porous ceramic media filled with alkaline chemicals were newly designed to enhance the long term neutralization and heavy metal removal capability from amd among the two types of adr carbon and ceramic examined in this study the ceram adr containing nahco3 showed the best efficiency for amd remediation in terms of consistent alkali diffusion and long term heavy metal removal 99 the alkaline chemicals can consistently diffuse from the porous ceramic media of the reactor via a chemical gradient driven by osmotic force thus removing heavy metals e g cd fe mn and zn as metal carbonates or hydroxides the ceram adr with nahco3 treated three consecutive runs with approximately 340 bed volumes of amd for neutralization and heavy metal removal consequently it can be successfully evaluated that the ceram adr with nahco3 ware maintained for over three years without a lapse in performance another benefit of the proposed alkali diffusion ceramic reactor is its flexibility because the system design

12441,a novel alkali diffusion reactor using ceramic porous media ceram adr was newly developed for long term treatment of acidity and heavy metals in acid mine drainage amd without external energy the batch and column tests were performed to investigate the neutralization capabilities of six alkaline chemicals i e mgo caco3 cao sio2 na2co3 and nahco3 and the effects on pore size and hydraulic retention time hrt of ceram adrs among these six alkaline chemicals the ceram adr containing nahco3 yielded a suitable ph range for water quality guideline ph values from 5 0 to 9 5 for an hrt of 1 2 days as well as had the best efficiency in terms of consistent alkaline diffusion and long term heavy metal removal 99 the precipitation process was found to be a major mechanism in the removal of heavy metals based on the continuous column tests it was evaluated that the ceram adr successfully treated three consecutive runs with approximately 340 bed volumes of amd for neutralization and heavy metal removal indicating that the ceram adr can be maintained for over three years without a lapse in performance capsule abstract an alkali diffusion reactor based on porous ceramic media is developed for the long term remediation of acidity and heavy metals in amd graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acid mine drainage alkali diffusion ceramic reactor long term neutralization heavy metals data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd is one of the most significant environmental problems faced by the mining industry in general amd is caused by the oxidation of sulfide minerals in mine tailings under aerated conditions and the highly acidic water associated with metal rich wastewater 1 2 thus it is necessary to remediate the amd before its release into water bodies which could be hazardous to humans and ecosystems 3 5 over recent decades a variety of techniques have been developed for amd remediation including neutralization sorption oxidation reduction electrochemistry flocculation filtration settling sedimentation ion exchange and crystallization 6 9 among these techniques neutralization i e controlling the ph with alkaline chemicals is the most common and cost effective technology for amd treatment 10 because increasing the ph of wastewater can reduce the solubility of heavy metal ions which can be separated from the aqueous phase often in the form of hydroxide complexes 11 the amd treatment efficiency and operation costs are strongly related to the type of alkaline chemicals 10 12 limestone caco3 hydrated lime ca oh 2 caustic soda naoh soda ash na2co3 calcium oxide cao anhydrous ammonia nh3 magnesium oxide mgo and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 are the most commonly used alkaline chemical for neutralizing amd in existing treatment 13 16 the by products from industrial processes are also applied extensively to achieve the neutralization efficiencies and to reduce the costs of amd treatment including slag cement kiln dust and fly ash 17 20 controlling the ph using alkaline chemicals requires a diffusive alkaline system to ensure the continuous supply of alkalinity in the amd treatment system however unfortunately they are prone to passivation i e loss of reactivity due to coating and clogging i e loss of permeability due to the formation of precipitates on the surface of the grains or in the pore space of the system these problems would result in the subsequent loss of hydraulic conductivity and lead to the failure of the treatment operation 21 24 moreover long term treatment performance can be limited by the gradual depletion of the treatment agent and high operating energy although most of these materials could perform well initially 2 10 25 therefore more intensive research is needed to develop sustainable neutralization systems for the long term treatment of amd 10 in this study we newly i develop the alkali diffusion reactor composed of ceramic porous material for the long term treatment of amd because the ceramic porous material with a smaller pore size could prevent the excessive quick release of alkaline chemicals ii several essential parameters including types of the alkaline chemicals and hydraulic retention time hrt are determined to the optimal operating conditions of the alkali diffusion reactor iii the acid neutralization and their effects on heavy metal removal within the diffusion system are identified iv blockage of ceramic porous diffusion reactor caused by the formation of precipitates is investigated to evaluate the consistent performance of the reactor for the long term treatment of amd v finally the possibility of reusing the diffusion reactor for amd treatment is verified based on its effectiveness in neutralizing acidity and removing heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 alkaline chemicals alkaline chemicals such as calcium oxide cao calcium carbonate caco3 magnesium oxide mgo silicon dioxide sio2 sodium carbonate na2co3 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 have been widely used to neutralize amd in a conventional amd treatment system 13 26 28 in this study the six alkaline chemicals mentioned above 99 9 sigma aldrich were selected to determine the optimal neutralizing agents for use in the diffusion reactor the chemical and physical properties of these alkaline chemicals are presented in table s1 2 2 artificial amd synthesis artificial amd was synthesized based on the ph level and the composition of heavy metals in amd of mining site located in south korea 29 the artificial amd was prepared by dissolving cd no3 2 4h2o feso4 7h2o mnso4 h2o and znso4 7h2o 99 r m chemical in deionized water the concentrations of heavy metal were set to 9 0 mg l 1 for cd 50 mg l 1 for fe and 20 mg l 1 for mn and zn the target ph ph 2 5 of the solution was adjusted by adding 1 m h2so4 solution the artificial amd was stirred for 24 h hereinafter amd particles were filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter 2 3 preparation and characterization of alkali diffusion reactor alkali diffusion reactor based on porous ceramic media hereinafter ceram adr was fabricated using a commercial ceramic water filter doulton co w9222909 and filled with the alkaline chemicals the commercial ceramic water filter had a height of 40 mm and diameter of 39 mm with the top and bottom of the filter covered with silicon caps which acted as porous media fig 1 the ceram adr consisting of the porous ceramic media was dried for 24 h in an oven at 333 15 k after drying alkaline chemicals 20 0 g were added to the interior of the ceram adr and it was covered with a silicon cap to compare its efficiency with those of other types of porous media alkali diffusion reactor based on carbon hereinafter c adr was modified using a commercial sediment filter with the same preparation techniques as those used for ceram adr doulton w9240001 the chemical composition surface morphology and

microscopy with energy dispersive x ray analysis fesem edx fei quanta 450 waltham ma usa edx oxford su8010 hitachi chiyoda city tokyo japan the pore sizes of the porous media were analyzed using a hg porosimeter autopore 9520 micromeritics norcross ga usa 2 4 batch tests of c adr and ceram adr both standard and continuous batch studies were carried out to assess the applicability of the alkaline chemicals for long term treatment of amd standard batch tests were used to compare the neutralizing capacities of the six selected alkaline chemicals i e cao caco3 mgo sio2 na2co3 and nahco3 continuous batch tests were performed to select an optimal alkaline chemical effective porous medium and suitable hrt for amd remediation in the standard batch tests c adrs filled with the individual alkaline chemicals were immersed in 1 4 l of amd a magnetic stirrer was spun at 100 rpm at the bottom of the c adr as shown in fig 1 a the treated solution was sampled at 1 h intervals for the initial 6 h followed by continuous sampling every 6 h in the continuous batch tests ceram adrs filled with the alkaline chemicals i e na2co3 and nahco3 were tested to determine their long term neutralization capability for amd treatment 2 5 column tests using ceram adr a column test was performed to examine the acid neutralization and heavy metal removal efficiency of ceram adr filled with the alkaline chemical i e na2co3 and nahco3 fig s1 the column consisted of a nylon mesh disk gravel and ceram adr filled with the alkaline chemical as shown in fig 1 b two different sizes for the granular gravel 2 3 mm and 8 9 mm were placed in the column small sized gravel was placed at the bottom of the column to minimize clogging of the inlet large sized gravel was placed between the porous media and columns to adjust the void volume often referred to as the effective volume a nylon mesh disk was used to prevent clogging at the influent and effluent ports the empty bed volume ebv of the column was designed to be 1 l while the void volume was adjusted to 0 5 l using large sized gravel the void volume was calculated based on the ratio between the ebv and porosity while considering the specific gravity 30 the amd storage was located at a position higher than that of the column reactor to promote gravity flow the long term neutralization capacities and removal efficiencies of the heavy metals of the ceram adr filled with the alkaline chemical was examined at different hrts i e 1 day and 2 day prior to column operation the continuous column with the alkaline chemical was fully saturated with amd after the alkaline chemical was depleted the ceram adr was refilled with the alkaline chemical twice per day to understand the differences in the alkalinity diffusion flux between na2co3 and nahco3 in the ceram adrs fick s first law on diffusive flux is applied as follows 1 j i l i d μ i dx where j is the diffusion flux that measures the amount of substance i that flows through a unit area during a unit time interval l i is the diffusion coefficient which is proportional to the squared velocity of the diffusing particles μi is the concentration the amount of substance per unit volume and x is the position of which the dimension is length the driving force for one dimensional diffusion is the quantity dμi dx 1 which is the concentration gradient for ideal mixtures 2 6 alkalinity ph heavy metal analysis and numerical modeling the alkalinity ph and heavy metal concentrations of all amd samples were measured in the batch and column tests the alkalinity was measured once per day 10 min before changing the amd using the test methods specified by the american society for testing and materials astm d1067 16 the concentrations of heavy metals i e cd fe mn and zn were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 5300v perkin elmer waltham ma usa precipitates were washed by the ultrapure water and were then dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h the chemical and structural characterization of precipitate particles were identified using fesem edx xrd and ftir the particle size distribution of precipitate particles was measured using a digital sieve shaker with diameters of 5 25 25 38 and 53 μm analysette 3 pro fritsch idar oberstein germany the theoretical precipitation of the heavy metals was predicted using the visual minteq simulation spearman correlation analysis was conducted to figure out main operation parameters related with heavy metal removal rate specific functions of the modified sigmoid pseudo second order and exponential rise were used to simulate the kinetics of the cumulative alkalinity 31 33 table s2 more details on the pre treatment and instrumental analytical conditions were provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical properties of c adr and ceram adr the composition and structural properties of ceram adr were identified and compared with those of c adr fesem edx was used to analyze the physical morphologies of the c adr and ceram adr surfaces fig 2 the surface images of the carbon and porous ceramic media are presented in fig 2 a1 a3 the surface of ceram adr was more compact than that of c adr fig 2 b1 b3 resulting in smaller pore size in the ceramic porous media similar results were identified in the pore size analyses of the c adr and ceram adr using an hg porosimeter the primary pore size of the carbon and ceramic media ranged from 100 to 250 μm average of 226 4 μm and 2 6 μm average of 2 9 μm respectively fig 2 a5 and b5 it is expected that i water molecules i e 0 275 nm and ion species from the alkaline chemicals can penetrate the porous ceramic media and ii ceram adr with a smaller pore size can prevent the rapid release of alkaline chemicals resulting in the long term release of alkaline chemicals edx spectrum showed that the main component in the c adr was carbon 92 3 in c adr whereas the ceram adr was mainly composed of si 58 7 and al 21 8 indicating negligible heavy metal leaching from adr during long term treatment of amd fig 2 a4 and b4 3 2 assessment of alkaline chemicals for acid neutralization and heavy metals removal in the adr system the choice of alkaline chemicals is important for acid neutralization and heavy metal removal the neutralization capacities of the alkaline chemicals i e mgo sio2 caco3 cao naco3 and nahco3 were evaluated in the c adr as shown in fig 3 a the phs of the amd in all reactors filled with the six alkaline chemicals increased from 3 0 to 10 6 over 48 h the increasing ph could be explained by the consumption of a substantial amounts of alkaline chemicals for neutralization process moreover the neutralization process is assumed to be predominantly through the buffering capacity of hydroxyl and carbonate groups of the alkaline chemicals 34 35 the neutralizing process which involved the dissolution of the six alkaline chemicals in the acidic solution is controlled by the surface chemical reaction as shown in following eqs 2 7 36 2 mgo s 2h aq mg 2 aq h 2 o l 3 cao s 2h aq ca 2 aq h 2 o l 4 sio 2 s 2h aq si 2 aq h 2 o l 5 caco 3 s 2h aq ca 2 aq co 2 g h 2 o l 6 na 2 co 3 s 2h aq 2na aq co 2 g h 2 o l 7 nahco 3 s h aq na aq co 2 g h 2 o l notably the chemical reactions involve the transfer of cations and anions of alkaline chemicals from the solid to the solution in which the cations are hydrated the transfer of anions involves protonation or hydroxylation reactions at the surface of the solid forming water 36 the solution ph of two reactors filled with naco3 and nahco3 rapidly increased up to 10 6 and 8 3 respectively within 5 min of the initial reaction the neutralization capacity of na2co3 was significantly higher than that of nahco3 in the order of na2co3 nahco3 mgo cao sio2 caco3 the solidification of cao caco3 mgo and sio2 even occurred in the c adr fig s2 these results may be due to i the much higher solubility of na2co3 170 g l 1 at 293 15 k and nahco3 96 g l 1 at 293 15 k compared to other alkaline chemicals 2 0 g l 1 at 293 15 k table s1 37 and ii 2 fold more neutralization reaction per unit one mole of na2co3 eq 6 compared to nahco3 eq 7 it seems likely that na2co3 might be a potential alkaline chemical to be filled in the ceramic adr however there is need to examine whether the phs raised by alkaline chemicals could be contributed on removal of heavy metals from amd the ph is one of the important factors in controlling the removal of heavy metals the high ph can cause the chemical precipitation of heavy metals a process that removes heavy metal from amd 38 39 in the adrs with na2co3 and nahco3 the removal efficiencies of the heavy metals i e fe mn zn and cd were identified as shown in fig 3 b and c respectively the concentrations of fe mn zn and cd in the c adr filled with na2co3 and nahco3 were reduced up to 99 5 within 1 h it indicates that ph increased by na2co3 and nahco3 led to the simultaneous removal of heavy metals from amd however for the application of na2co3 and nahco3 as potential alkaline chemical more detail is needed on i the neutralizing capacity and heavy metals removal under continuous flow condition of amd and ii whether acidity and heavy metal levels in effluents from the ceram adr could be accepted by approved the general standards for discharge of environmental pollution in the following section 3 3 the i and ii are discussed in detail 3 3 long term treatment using ceram adr 3 3 1 simultaneous removal of heavy metals by long term neutralization continuous column tests were conducted to obtain detailed data on the efficiency of c adr and ceram adr filled with na2co3 and nahco3 for the long term neutralization and heavy metal removal from amd an hrt of 1 day represents a change in the amd every 24 h the levels of acidity and heavy metal i e cd fe mn and zn in the effluents from the two adrs were evaluated based on the acceptable limits ph 6 9 cd 2 0 mg l 1 fe 3 0 mg l 1 mn 2 0 mg l 1 zn 5 0 mg l 1 of the general standards for discharge of environmental pollution proposed by the us epa 38 39 figs 4 and 5 the ph of the effluent in the c adr with na2co3 was higher ph 10 by the second i e 2 days phases and exceeded the maximum acceptable limit i e ph 9 after that the ph was rapidly decreased to ph 2 5 at the third phase i e 3 days fig 4 a the concentrations of cd fe mn and zn were also higher than the acceptable limit after the second phase which could be due to rapid drop in ph within 2 days fig 4 b d the ph values of initial effluent from the c adr with nahco3 were maintained in range of ph 8 0 8 5 until the third phase i e 3 days the concentrations of cd fe mn and zn were also lower than the acceptable limit during the first three phases it shows that the phs of effluents would be maintained within an acceptable limit of ph and heavy metals during 3 days the phs of the initial effluents from the ceram adr containing na2co3 increased up to 10 5 and then was exceeded the maximum acceptable ph limit over the period of 9 days the ph in the nahco3 treated solution increased up to 8 3 and complied with the acceptable ph range over the period of 14 days fig 5 a the concentrations of cd fe mn and zn in effluent from the ceram adr with na2co3 and nahco3 simultaneously complied with the acceptable level range over the period of 10 days and 13 days respectively fig 5 b d the breakthrough points of mn were lower than that of other metals which may be due to precipitation such as metal hydroxide or carbonate at ph 7 8 and pe of 0 0 27 40 41 the results indicate that at alkaline ph value greater than ph 7 8 the cd fe mn and zn from the effluent can be simultaneously removed by chemical precipitation process moreover the ceramic adr with nahco3 may be more suitable for long term neutralization and heavy metal removal under continuous flow of amd compared to the c adr with nahco3 however if the retention time of the amd influent is extended it could cause a decrease in the neutralizing capacity of alkaline chemicals therefore it is necessary to compare the effects of long retention times on acid neutralization and heavy metal removal of the ceram adr with na2co3 and nahco3 3 3 2 effects of long retention time with slow influent the effects of a longer retention time on amd remediation i e neutralization and heavy metal removal were determined with ceram adr with na2co3 and nahco3 at hrt of 2 day fig 6 the initial ph values of the effluents discharged from ceram adrs with na2co3 and nahco3 increased to 10 8 and 8 7 respectively the ph of the effluent from ceram adrs with na2co3 exceeded the maximum acceptable limit of the guideline until 12 days after which the ph was reduced to the minimum acceptable ph until 16 days whereases the phs of the effluent treated by the ceram adr with nahco3 complied with the acceptable ph range during the first 20 days moreover the ph ph 7 8 corresponding to the simultaneous removal of heavy metals was also stably maintained for 20 days the concentration of all heavy metal in the effluents from the ceram adr with nahco3 were below guideline values for 18 days overall it took the ceram adr containing nahco3 20 days and 14 days to reduce the heavy metal content of amd to the acceptable level at hrts of 1 day and 2 day respectively this could be attributed to the increasing pore flux of the porous ceramic media with increasing external flow on the membrane surface during amd recharge into the ceram adr the pore flux in the ceramic media increases resulting in enhanced diffusion and consumption of alkaline chemicals in the reactor the results indicated that an hrt of 2 day in the ceram adr with nahco3 can be effective for neutralization and heavy metal removal but nahco3 would be quickly consumed compared with a shorter hrt the heavy metal concentrations in the effluents that are higher than acceptable standards due to the exhaustion of nahco3 in the ceram adr need to be treated through the consecutive operation of the alkali diffusion column reactors the feasibility of consecutive operation of the alkali diffusion column reactors is verified based on the reusability of ceram adr containing nahco3 for sustainable amd remediation in section 3 5 3 4 possible mechanisms of acid neutralization and heavy metals removal in ceram adr 3 4 1 diffusion of alkaline chemical in porous ceram adr the diffusion rate of the alkaline chemicals is strongly related to their neutralization efficiency 10 12 the diffusion processes across micro porous media such as the ceram adr can be classified into two mechanisms solution diffusion and pore flow mechanisms the solution diffusion mechanism is primarily driven by chemical potential gradients whereas the pore flow mechanism is primarily driven by pressure gradients 42 in this study the primary diffusion mechanism of the alkaline chemicals in ceram adr was dense solution diffusion driven by the differences in ionic strengths across the porous media ionized alkaline chemicals can cause a chemical potential gradient between the inside and outside of the ceram adr the removal mechanism of heavy metal ions in the amd was dominated by precipitation with diffused alkaline chemical in the ceram adr therefore the diffusion across the ceram adr may be driven by the following processes i the solvent i e water in the amd is gradually transported to the internal ceram adr whereas the dissolved heavy metal ions in the transferred solvent can be adsorbed by the micro pores ii the alkaline chemicals in ceram adr can be dissolved and diffused into the amd via osmotic pressure depending on the gradient of the molar concentration of the solute and iii the heavy metal ions in amd can be precipitated by reacting with the diffused alkaline chemicals resulting in acid neutralization and removal of heavy metal ions from the amd fig 7 to understand the differences in the alkalinity diffusion flux between na2co3 and nahco3 in the ceram adrs the alkalinity of the amd was measured daily before amd recharge into the reactor system fig 8 a the cumulative alkalinity was measured for 18 days fig 8 b the cumulative alkalinities of the ceram adrs filled with na2co3 and nahco3 reached equilibrium after 8 days and 13 days respectively indicating that the na2co3 release rate was approximately 1 6 fold higher than that of nahco3 the difference in release rates was similar to their water solubility ratios 1 7 fold 164 g l 1 for na2co3 and 96 g l 1 for nahco3 respectively table s1 the results showed that molecular solubility tends to exhibit a directly proportional relationship to diffusivity 43 the cumulative alkalinity indicated slow diffusion at the early stage before an exponential rise theoretically 20 g of na2co3 and nahco3 can be dissolved to yield 11 4 g of co3 2 and 14 5 g of hco3 respectively which would be converted to 18 7 g and 11 9 g of caco3 respectively the theoretical alkalinity was compared with the maximum cumulative alkalinity the difference was attributed to increase in ph and the generation of metal precipitates in the form of metal hydroxide or metal carbonate 33 moreover cumulative alkalinity was simulated with the modified sigmoid function these results were compared with the pseudo second order and exponential rise models table s2 the modified sigmoid function had the highest accuracy with a high r 2 value 0 99 for ceram adrs filled with na2co3 and nahco3 this result indicated that the alkaline chemicals have an initial slow diffusion phase and then an exponential rise phase sigmoid function resulting from the saturation of the alkaline chemicals in the media pores 42 3 4 2 precipitation process of heavy metals in porous ceram adr during neutralization with alkaline chemicals the heavy metal precipitate may result in clogging of the porous ceram adr the precipitates formed in the ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 were characterized using xrd ftir particle size analysis and sem edx as illustrated in fig 9 overall heavy metal ions mainly precipitate in the form of metal carbonate or metal hydroxide depending on the solution conditions i e the ph carbonate ion concentration and redox condition and characteristics of the heavy metals i e the pka values and reaction coefficients with hydroxide or carbonate cd mainly precipitated in the form of cdco3 as shown in fig 9 a which was because cd tends to form metal carbonate in carbonic rich solution 27 44 moreover fe precipitated in the form of feco3 rather than its hydroxide form fe oh 2 fig 9 a this may be due to the carbon rich solution which favored its precipitation as a carbonate and the higher kinetic rate constant k 3 2 10 11 of the alkaline solution as following reaction eqs 8 and 9 45 8 fe 2 2oh fe oh 2 s k fe oh 2 8 0 10 16 9 fe 2 co 3 2 feco 3 s k feco 3 3 2 10 11 mn prefers to react with carbonate group rather than hydroxide group in carbon rich solution at ph 7 8 27 however due to an ionic competition with iron ions manganese carbonate can be re ionized to mn2 as shown in eqs 10 and 11 46 10 2mnco 3 s o 2 g 2mno 2 s 2co 2 g 11 mno 2 s 2fe 2 2h 2 o l 2feooh s mn 2 2h similar to the above xrd results the metal carbonate concentrations cdco3 feco3 and mnco3 also prevail in the ph pe diagram obtained using vminteq table s3 and fig s5 respectively zn precipitates as zn oh 2 at ph 7 5 while znco3 is predominant in carbon rich solutions due to high kinetic rate 47 48 vminteq also showed high zinc hydroxide formation being favored at alkaline ph and zinc carbonate being favored at neutral ph table s3 contrarily zno was detected by xrd formation of zno is likely due to the oxidation of zinc hydroxide i e zn oh 2 and zinc carbonate i e znco3 while drying the samples for xrd analysis 49 51 specific functional groups formed in the precipitants from ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 were determined by ftir fig 9 b in precipitants from ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 the presence of hydroxyl groups o h is indicated by their stretching modes at 3200 cm 1 in precipitate from ceram adr containing nahco3 stretching bands corresponding to 1661 cm 1 and 1637 cm 1 indicated the presence of amide c o and carbonyl h o h groups respectively 52 54 the two stretching bands corresponding to amide and carbonyl groups at ph of 8 3 which may be due to i the predominance of bicarbonate group of hco at ph 8 0 and ii higher concentration of free carbon ions at ph 7 0 than at ph 10 i e free carbon ion concentration 22 10 3 at ph 7 0 and 6 82 10 4 at ph 10 55 additionally the stretching band corresponding to 865 cm 1 indicated the presence of fe o bonds 3 4 3 blockage of porous ceram adr by precipitates the particle size of metal precipitates is dependent on the type of heavy metal for example iron hydroxide particles range from 0 1 to 100 μm 56 58 particle sizes of iron carbonate precipitates are larger than 420 μm 45 in the study 85 of metal precipitates formed in ceram adrs containing na2co3 and nahco3 ranged in between 5 and 62 μm mean distribution of particle size 15 25 μm fig 9 which were bigger than the pore size average 2 9 μm of the ceramic media fig 2 a5 it indicated that the metal ions would form several precipitates in the solution after passing through the ceram adrs metal precipitates cannot infiltrate into the ceramic media therefore blockage of porous ceramic media by the metal precipitates was negligible in the present study this was supported by the results of the outer and inner surface analysis of ceram adrs after experiments the amount of fe precipitated on the outer surface was about 10 fold more than that on the inner surface fig s6 these results shed light on the applicability and performance of ceram adrs containing nahco3 for acid neutralization and heavy metal removal from amd in addition it is important to examine the reusability performance of the ceram adrs for sustainable amd remediation in the following section 3 5 the reusability of ceram adr is identified in detail 3 5 consecutive operation of ceram adr refilled with nahco3 the reusability of ceram adr containing nahco3 was examined using ceram adr column tests with the optimal hrt the column was designed to treat 365 bvs of amd and the experiment was simulated to represent a year of consistent usage without electricity and additional alkaline chemical fig 10 during the first operation the heavy metal concentration in the effluents at 340 bvs was within acceptable water quality limits with ph 7 8 the cd and zn concentrations in the effluents at 345 bvs exceeded the water quality limit with ph of 6 2 the fe concentration in the effluents at 365 bvs was higher than the acceptable water quality limit with ph of 5 01 the mn concentration in the effluent showed an increasing trend with increase in bvs and it exceeds the acceptable water quality limit at 340 bvs with ph values of 7 1 and 6 4 at 305 bvs and 340 bvs respectively among the heavy metals mn reached a breakthrough point faster than other heavy metals which could be attributed to the fact that mn can be precipitated at higher ph 7 8 than the other metals 40 the heavy metal concentrations in the effluents at bvs ranging from 340 to 350 were higher than acceptable standards with ph 6 3 the low alkalinity may result in low kinetics of metal precipitation at 345 bvs the alkalinity was 0 01 mg l 1 caco3 consistent results were observed in the continuous batch after exhaustion of alkaline chemical the ceram adr was refilled with nahco3 at 400 bvs and 800 bvs the neutralization and heavy metal removal results in the second and third phases were similar to those of the first operation the removal rate of the four metal ions in the amd had the following order fe cd zn mn the ceramic medium maintained its porosity throughout the test period these results indicated that the ceram adr can be operated for over three years as a diffusion reactor without loss in performance with hrt of 1 day another benefit of the proposed system is its flexibility because the operating parameters in alkali diffusion ceramic reactor such as the hrt bvs chemical quantity and flow rate are changeable depending on the system requirements the amount of alkaline chemicals can be also modified if long term or high efficiency operations are required however sludge i e precipitate particles and wastewater produced through the ceramic diffusion reactor with nahco3 during long term treatment of amd will require further metal recovery processing and final disposal therefore in order to mitigate the amd sludge further studies on full scale metal recovery techniques such as membrane distillation 59 nanofiltration 60 chemical oxidation techniques 61 electrochemical 62 selective precipitation 63 and solvent extraction 60 are needed to improve the environmental economic and technical feasibility of the ceramic diffusion reactor with nahco3 designed in our study 4 conclusions easily manageable adrs consisting of porous ceramic media filled with alkaline chemicals were newly designed to enhance the long term neutralization and heavy metal removal capability from amd among the two types of adr carbon and ceramic examined in this study the ceram adr containing nahco3 showed the best efficiency for amd remediation in terms of consistent alkali diffusion and long term heavy metal removal 99 the alkaline chemicals can consistently diffuse from the porous ceramic media of the reactor via a chemical gradient driven by osmotic force thus removing heavy metals e g cd fe mn and zn as metal carbonates or hydroxides the ceram adr with nahco3 treated three consecutive runs with approximately 340 bed volumes of amd for neutralization and heavy metal removal consequently it can be successfully evaluated that the ceram adr with nahco3 ware maintained for over three years without a lapse in performance another benefit of the proposed alkali diffusion ceramic reactor is its flexibility because the system design parameters such as the hrt bvs chemical quantity and flow rate are changeable depending on the system requirements therefore the ceram adr could be a potential option for amd remediation characterized

12442,water is a crucial resource in all economic activity from farming to manufacturing water supplies are under much stress due to the ever growing strain of the world population hence effective water management is crucial to civilized society for raising living standards to address the problems with drinking water quality groundwater quality has to be frequently checked utilizing the water quality index an effort has been made to comprehend groundwater quality wqi it is a technique for assessing water quality and a beneficial tool for determining how groundwater quality has changed over time and in different locations managing ecological systems and water resources can benefit greatly from machine learning approaches computation and considerable forecasting errors hence the deep neural network based long short term memory network lstm has been used for high performance this study presents a deep learning based bi lstm model to predict the variables affecting groundwater quality the suggested model s effectiveness was compared to several existing methods including lstm rnn and gru according to a comparative analysis the suggested model has 0 98 of accuracy and precision which exceeds all other approaches in terms of the best prediction performance and it may serve as a decision making basis for the comprehensive management of water quality keywords groundwater quality deep learning bi lstm method water quality index time series data data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction quality of drinking water has been a major issue for everyone globally especially in arid and semi arid locations underground provides one of the highest drinking water sources and perhaps the most significant source of water for commercial and agricultural uses in locations without access to fresh water groundwater is a crucial water supply for home and farming needs about 70 of the total land surface is covered by water which constitutes one of the most critical resources for maintaining life 1 traditional methods for estimating water quality involve costly and time consuming quantitative and laboratory tests making the concept of continuous surveillance irrelevant nowadays farming ecosystem management and environmental sensing benefit from accurate water quality predictions one of the goals of model creation and use which strives to ensure proper management throughout time is the valuation of water quality water process improvement is the prediction of the tendency of water quality to change at a specific future date an essential component of pollution management ecological sustainability and public health is reliable groundwater resource prediction furthermore early monitoring of cognitive farming is critical for detecting water quality 2 only 3 of the total of the earth s water is thought to be clean and only 30 1 of that is underground which is really critical for human health the environment the power sector and other water related issues the quality of groundwater has declined and freshwater availability has deteriorated in so many areas due to the rising demand from household commercial and agricultural users the need for an appropriate considerate of the intricacies of anthropogenic and natural progressions and how they affect ground water is increasing as awareness of sustainable freshwater usage within the framework of land use and global warming grows degradation of underground water is a well known phenomenon that has drawn a significant amount of attention since the industrial revolution despite this there are still numerous elements to comprehending and managing freshwater as a resource that are complicated and it could be challenging to locate reliable information a water cycle that can be described at several scales governs the amount and quality of groundwater the frequency and fragility of pure groundwater are primarily influenced by local weather patterns and climatic fluctuations the assumption of water quality is therefore extremely useful in real world situations water appears to be one of the most effective communication tools with a wide range as a result of rapid industrialization the level of water quality is rapidly declining 3 one of the main causes of the spread of serious illnesses is recognised to be poor water quality according to reports 2 5 billion people have been unwell and 5 million have died as a result of water borne diseases which account for 80 of illnesses in underdeveloped nations gastroenteritis cryptosporidium typhoid infections diarrhea some types of hepatitis and intestinal worms called giardiasis are the most prevalent of these illnesses in pakistan excessive drinking regularly can result in negative health outcomes such as hemolytic anemia often known as blue baby syndrome most commonly in newborns under six months old different cancers miscarriages in pregnant women ovarian cancer coronary heart disorders and thyroid hypertrophy nitrogen containing fertilisers pesticides inappropriate environmental services and waste dumping into the environment are some potential sources of nitrate contamination of groundwater because of the negative impacts on health this sort of groundwater contamination should be taken into account for protecting public health and the safety of water supply the amount and quality of water sources have been impacted in recent decades by growing populations urban growth industrialization and human made actions such as the disposal of commercial and municipal waste products as well as fertiliser waste these operations have also contaminated these assets 4 any form of physical chemical microbiological or radioactive contamination of groundwater that poses a risk to human health is considered given the rising requirement for groundwater resources total surveillance of the quality of water is a crucial technique for providing consumers with clean drinkable water as a result there has been an increase in the volume of material on communicating groundwater resources globally in recent years the correlation here among the intensity of these basic characteristics and non communicable disorders like cardiovascular disease is among the most crucial topics in the monitoring of water s pollutant concentrations water resources with bottom particles play a significant role in marine ecosystems and greatly influence water quality which has effects on environmental and human health 5 the world health organization estimates that around 80 of all human infections are water borne 6 once contaminated it is difficult to restore the groundwater s purity and quality by removing the contaminants at the source consequently it becomes crucial to constantly examine the quality of water and devise strategies for keeping it safe from pollution according to estimates 1 8 million people worldwide pass away each year from diarrheal disorders the majority of these diseases may well be brought on by drinking contaminated water 7 using a variety of physiological biological and chemical characteristics of groundwater it is possible to determine the quality of the groundwater it is a measurement of the cleanliness and safety of groundwater in relation to the need for and use of human consumption around the world 884 million people consume tainted water for drinking according to unicef changing climate a rise in population urbanisation and industrial growth are all contributing factors that are causing issues with groundwater pollution in various regions of the world water supplies are in grave danger as a consequence of population growth that is occurring quickly and randomly poor management and unsustainable use for agricultural and industrial applications 8 while polluted water supplies are acknowledged as one of the world s top causes of waterborne infections clean drinking water is crucial for maintaining human health one of the difficulties facing policymakers around the world is the appropriate use of groundwater for consumption measurements on water quality have been analysed using a variety of techniques but researchers have given the water quality index a significant amount of thought the wqi is a popular tool for evaluating water quality useful aggregating techniques reduce enormous volumes of groundwater resource information to a single value or score water quality index models are based on extensions that allow the study of massive datasets of water quality that fluctuate in time and space to produce a single value the wqi that defines the calibre of the body of water the wqi should be used as a technique that makes it easier to analyse water quality data by connecting a set of features to a grading scale which improves comprehension of the wqi the wqi is straightforward adaptable and robust with little vulnerability to raw data but it is yet unclear how sensitive it is to the weights of water quality criteria additionally because a variety of recommendations for categorization give varying weights to various quality criteria the wqi outcome depends on following the drinking water standards that are advised by those standards therefore due to the specific region or local groundwater resource conditions the history of the wqi and medical issues water quality standards also include ambiguities 9 for water quality criteria various studies have used various weights the objective of the wqi analysis method is to determine the potential effects that variations in the weights of the water quality factors may have on the final values insufficient knowledge of the unpredictable nature of water quality could result in less successful water quality management techniques the one and only indicator of the quality of water is the wqi which is determined by utilizing an amount of factors that are really illustrative of the quality of the water nine groundwater resource factors are needed to compute the wqi traditionally but even without all of them the wqi can be estimated using at least six established scales in light of many water quality parameters the wqi evaluates the overall groundwater quality in a straightforward straightforward and reproducible method at a certain time and location the wqi concept seems to have some issues because it was often created using site specific standards for a specific area and is not universal additionally they cause uncertainty when converting a sizable amount of information on the quality of water into a single indicator 10 a water quality index typically has four components or phases the most crucial measurements of quality of water are first picked after being processed the values for every water quality metric are then translated to a single dimensionless comment thread 2 eventually a function utilizes the sub indices and weighting components for all water quality metrics to build a complete single attribute wqi the factor loading for every water performance indicator is determined in the third phase fig 1 depicts the overall organization of wqi concepts and demonstrates that the majority of wqis include four key phases the wqi s findings could make it difficult to regulate water supplies the ability of bi lstm to function sequence data instantaneously in the anterior and posterior ways and thereafter feed that data back into the present output nodes generating correlation from the data of the two neighbourhoods prior to and after the processing thereby improving predictive ability this research used shapley additive explanations shap assessment to discover how the factors affected the forecasting outcomes shap are able to provide the ensured descriptions for them and providing the characteristic effects of the every single case 11 the remaining research work is illustrated as follows section 2 explained the prior work on ground water quality prediction the third section discusses the problem statement for detecting the ground water quality section 4 describes the suggested bi lstm technique that estimates ground water quality section 5 presents test findings as well as a comparison of the suggested system the performance of the intended work is examined in section 6 lastly section 7 discusses the findings and the work that has to be done in the future 2 related works purushottam agrawal et al investigated artificial intelligence methods for assessing groundwater quality one of the essential criteria for supporting human existence and development are the quality and quantity of freshwater 12 the most common metric for assessing the water quality is the wqi however because it requires managing big data sets and the computation of numerous subindices the conventional method for calculating the wqi is sometimes time consuming and difficult for forecasting the wqi researchers looked at how well artificial intelligence approaches such as support vector machine a naïve bayes classifier and particle swarm optimization performed in addition to pso for optimization researchers applied an nbc and svm for predictions groundwater water quality metrics and their related wqi were discovered for water gathered from chhattisgarh in order to verify the findings the findings demonstrate that the suggested nbo pso gave a greater wqi index prediction accuracy but the svm pso accuracy was lesser the outcomes of the study also point to the probability of using ensemble ml algorithms to calculate and forecast the wqi with a high degree of accurateness as a result the suggested framework may be utilized immediately to estimate the wqi utilizing the field data that have been measured conserving a significant amount effort and time the generated algorithm however does not thoroughly analyse its performance and fine tune of various input parameters a groundwater quality prediction method employing effective machine learning was proposed by singha et al 13 it is essential to comprehend the degree and quality of groundwater pollution in order to safeguard future supplies of clean drinking water the secret to reducing water pollution and improving water management is the very accurate forecast of water quality the study compares a deep learning based system with three different ml models ann rf and xgboost to calculate a ewqi groundwater samples are assessed several error metrics are introduced to assess the prediction capabilities of algorithms the better prediction approach with the maximum accuracy according to the findings is the dl approach by using the suggested technique 10 times with a freshly randomised dataset where modest variations in performance measures means are seen the uncertainties of the dl approach output is cross verified additionally computation of input variable significance by estimation approach reveals that the dl method provides the high accurate and realistic method for predicting groundwater quality the present study s shortcoming is that the forecasting models only take into account one monsoon dataset however data from many seasons could provide more knowledge about the groundwater quality 13 utilizing ensemble machine learning models amirhosein mosavi et al suggested the susceptibility estimation of groundwater hardness 14 in contrast to surface water groundwater resources are more susceptible to contaminations and disturbances since it takes a very long time as well as a lot of money to restore them therefore via well informed judgements and suggestions policymakers may be empowered by predictive modelling and preventative initiatives for effective groundwater governance the use of ml models for measuring hardness susceptibility has not yet been investigated because of the significance of groundwater quality modelling the current study set out to forecast groundwater hardness susceptibility employing ml techniques for the initial instance by the construction of a comparison research with multivariate discriminant assessment the effectiveness of two prediction methods of brt and rf is examined the soft and hard water are identified using the hardness values from groundwater quality monitoring wellheads and the groundwater hardness susceptibility chart is predicted using eleven predictor variables including land use dfs elevation dfr dtgw evaporation ph pcp gwl lithology and curvature according to the findings the variables dtgw dfr dfs and elevation contributed more to the model development therefore low dtgw low altitudes and close proximity to the sea and rivers are primarily associated with higher harness regions because these factors enhance the circumstances for the precipitation of minerals containing magnesium and calcium into underground water even though the study s findings were encouraging the hardness modelling outcomes in other areas may be impacted by the inclusion of more pertinent and readily accessible input factors hemant raheja et al proposed utilizing machine learning techniques to predict groundwater quality indexes the purpose of the study is to assess the ground water indexes over a research area in the haryana state of india by applying the three ml algorithms xgboost dnn and gbm in the study two wqi the water quality index and the ewqi are utilized to inspect the application of these approaches the findings indicate that dnn significantly improved in the forecasting of the both indices i e wqi and ewqi and that it had comparatively less error values in the predictions of wqi and ewqi using these three distinct methods electrical conductivity was found to be the most significant input variable and ph to be the least significant variable the latest findings are anticipated to be utilized to accurately forecast the wqi and ewqi of groundwater to determine its solubility although the hydrochemical parameters might vary in relevance there is no clear pattern when employing the three methods to estimate wqi and ewqi 15 groundwater quality evaluation utilizing a random forest technique based on groundwater quality indices was proposed by hossein norouzi and asghar asghari moghaddam a sizable amount of the region s needs for agricultural and drinking water are met by the miandoab plain aquifer because of the degradation of groundwater quality it has seen a considerable fall in water table in recent decades in order to effectively regulate groundwater resources quantitatively and qualitatively a scientific research of the research area s groundwater resources is required the determination of gqi which combines ion concentrations and their connection with trustworthy criteria serves as one of the leading factors for evaluating and regulating groundwater quality the fuzzified gqi approach employed the fuzzy gwi to reduce uncertainty for the evaluation of groundwater quality the rf approach a learning approach which is depending on ensembles of dt was also applied because of its excellent prediction accuracy capacity to understand nonlinear connections and ability to recognise key predictor variables the rf methodology offers benefits over other approaches the fuzzy gwi approach which has higher accuracy is shown to be a more dependable method in the valuation of groundwater quality for drinking the work findings demonstrated the reliability of the random forest approach as a technique for assessing the susceptibility of aquifers to groundwater contamination and for managing or monitoring them appropriately the rf results however do not take into account geological data land use water depth or other characteristics that could be utilized to determine what influences groundwater quality 16 estimating wqi in groundwater utilizing ann was an idea put forth by monika kulisz et al assessing the quality of groundwater around drilling sites is essential for safeguarding water supplies in the investigation specific physicochemical characteristics of waters were marked the gathered characteristics were used to calculate the wqi testing the ability of ann approaches to simulate the groundwater wqi was a secondary goal of the research a multi regression model was used to produce the 7 ann input parameters that were optimized and constrained then regression analysis was used to evaluate designs with progressively reduced variables the network with the optimal parameters has 5 input neurons such as ph as well as calcium electrical conductivity sodium and magnesium ions in addition to numerous hidden layer neurons the findings demonstrated that employing the variables is a practical method for accurately and satisfactorily simulating the wqi ann techniques have shown the ability to accurately anticipate the wqi at the desired level thus neural network models may be utilized especially in industrial locations to directly forecast the quality of groundwater the suggested approach can help with water treatment and management by utilizing cutting edge artificial intelligence however accurate water quality predictions are not done 17 assessment of machine learning techniques for groundwater quality modelling was proposed by sahour et al 18 through water sampling and laboratory examination the quality of groundwater is determined applying the field based measurements over a wide domain is time consuming and expensive in the study researchers created a machine learning based system to map the quality of groundwater in an open aquifer in kerman region 248 monitoring wells throughout the area collected groundwater samples for analysis according to their cut off values the gwqi in each well was evaluated and divided into four classes the gis environment was used to identify and analyse factors impacting groundwater quality such as the distances to industrial hubs the distances to residential regions density of population aquifer transmittance evaporation elevation and geology the gwqi and its regulating elements were correlated using six machine learning classifiers utilizing statistical efficiency and the roc the algorithms were assessed an accuracy study revealed that ml algorithms were very accurate in predicting the quality of groundwater however because of its greater accuracy rf was chosen as the best approach the whole region s gwqi classes were mapped using the learned rf models the research area is dominated by poor gwqi according to the findings whereas southwest is inhabited to good gwqi in the north a region that had an extremely poor gwqi was noted the key element impacting the quality of ground water in the area according to the results is its proximity to industrial areas the study offers a groundwater quality modelling technique that is both affordable and replicable in other areas with comparable hydrological and geophysical conditions however the method does not allow for a full assessment of groundwater quality 18 table 1 depicts the prior research comparative analysis treatment plants for waste water can save money time and energy by predicting the features of the wastewater they handle in order to enhance the efficiency of the system feature selection fs techniques are utilized at the pre processing stage this study intends to assess how seven distinct fs techniques such as filter wrapper and embedding techniques affect the ability to estimate total nitrogen tn in the wastewater treatment plants influent flow more accurately three supervised machine learning ml algorithms artificial neural network ann random forest rf and particularly gradient boosting machine gbm were used to design and assess four concepts depending on fs recommendations study employed regular time of input parameters such as ph do cod bod mlss mlvss nh4 n and tn concentrations the operational efficiency of all predictive models was assessed using the rmse mae and correlation coefficient for the data set that was separated into training and unseen testing data r2 findings indicated by common data seemed to have the best outcome when compared to other fs approaches such nh4 n cod bod and do moreover decision tree algorithms like rf and gbm outperformed neural network techniques in terms of effectiveness ann the usefulness of this cutting edge ml technique for wastewater element forecasting can be demonstrated in the way that gbm extended the dataset trends extremely well and delivered the greatest performance on unknown data sets 19 treatment facility expenses are primarily driven by the energy intensive procedure for treating municipal wastewater to fulfil strict effluent quality standards developing and running effective energy saving wastewater treatment plants requires evaluation and forecasting of energy usage based on information gathered over a six year period 2014 2019 this research examined the effect of wastewater hydraulic and weather based patterns factors on the daily electrical use of east melbourne wastewater treatment facilities the combination of characteristics from several sources was accomplished using data engineering techniques the relationships between those factors were revealed and then the most pertinent factors were chosen for training the machine learning ml systems using four different feature selection techniques also two decision tree methods gradient boosting machine gbm and random forest rf as well as the use of artificial neural networks ann were investigated in order to forecast ec data following by a 95 confidence level evaluation according to the outcomes of algorithms for selecting features total n chemical oxygen demand cod and inflow flow had the most effects on the energy use of treatment plants for wastewater of all regression methods gbm achieved the greatest performance prediction a fair predicted error range was shown by the 95 confidence level 20 a useful application depending on ml methods such as parallel artificial neural network ann and chain ml frameworks using scikit learn libraries in python followed by dynamic tweaking and k fold cross validation execution the optimization s uses simulation result from the aspen plus application to simulate how scheme yields including such fluidization temperature vapour rate of heat transfer and dryer residence time in sewage sludge behave in order to produce the best possible results for factors including such feed fume and air temperature steam flow rate moisture levels in the feedstock and vapours inlet temperature to dryer information obtained from a waste water treatment plant in gdynia poland were used to test the reliability and accuracy of the smart optimization in terms of the ideal heat transfer quantity and drying resident duration confirming the algorithm s high prediction the results were 0 85 0 94 and 0 91 for the parallel ann and chained ml techniques accordingly although the chained model showed somewhat good accuracy than the ann model the latter calculated the outcomes significantly faster as a result the chained framework was selected as the computing method for the optimization process in general study asserts that the technique described herein benefits from ca as a result of the geopolitical unrest in the region and the region s high costs of energy there was a 6 decrease in the overall energy used for the incinerator unit of the sewage sludge disposal facility 21 an important factor in assessing the emissions of greenhouse gases from wastewater treatment facilities is nitrous oxide n2o depending on a mechanical framework and machine learning ml method a new technique for forecasting liquid n2o generation during nitrification was created in this work the modelling of two 15 day experiments performed in a nitrification sequenced batch reactor was the initial application of the mechanical framework next the collected online observations of do ph and temperatures were utilized as data input for the ml models together with predicted results such as nh4 n no2 n no3 n mlss and mlvss several machine learning ml algorithms the support vector machine svm the gradient boosting machine gbm and the artificial neural network ann were trained and tested using the information from the tests conducted at 20 c and 12 c accordingly the ann method proved to be the most accurate prediction modelling and it was then put through a 95 confidence level evaluation to identify the genuine data probabilities and estimate the data population s erroneous range additionally the most important variables affecting estimates of liquid n2o were found using feature selection fs methods including pearson correlation and random forest according to the findings of the features extraction study nh4 n and no2 n exhibited the strongest correlations with the formation of liquid n2o using the suggested strategy a quick technique for improving liquid n2o concentrations estimation for short term investigations was produced despite the restricted accessibility of measurement values 22 3 problem statement dissolved oxygen do is a crucial element that is frequently taken into account when predicting quality of the water the prediction models anticipate using the do information as a time analysis according to this the sample tracking strategy uses fluid linear models these models employ a time correlation framework to produce real time prediction that can be helpful in the future a popular area of study in the field of water environmental engineering is how to preserve the trustworthiness of water quality prediction models by creating enhanced prediction model the shortcomings of conventional approaches are removed additionally the previous techniques do not take into account the effects of aspects related to hydraulics biology physics chemistry and meteorology artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic are some of the technologies now being offered to enhance the effectiveness of water evaluation techniques comparable to how lstm and bi lstm approaches have become quite popular in time prediction for data sets the current approaches are unable to handle the computation cost additionally the previous techniques do not take into account the effects of aspects related to hydraulics biology physics chemistry and meteorology artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic are some of the technologies now being offered to enhance the effectiveness of water evaluation techniques comparable to how lstm and bi lstm approaches have become quite popular in time prediction for data sets the current approaches are unable to handle the computation cost additionally as freshwater is one of kerman s most significant sources of water it is crucial to check its purity for agriculture and consumption purposes 4 contribution of the work the major goal of this effort is to create an automated deep learning technique that can accurately track and forecast kerman s groundwater quality furthermore the following is the work s key contribution the major goal of this effort is to create an automated deep learning technique that can accurately track and forecast kerman s groundwater quality furthermore the following is the work s key contribution water samples from a variety of locations in the kerman region were collected and they included a number of criteria that might be used to gauge the water s level of pollution wqi process incorporation and new bi directional lstm architecture bi lstm developed for improved water quality prediction the developed bi lstm technique has been compared with other conventional approaches such as rnn gru and lstm using shapley additive explanations shap evaluation system comparative investigation demonstrated the suggested model s robustness 5 methodology the complicated processes involved in the creation of contaminants in water and the non linear nature of intensity variations make it challenging to forecast water quality trends with high levels of accuracy by constantly training dnn to effectively achieve the properties of water quality cycles deep learning approaches can address these issues a few of an rnn s results can be given back to the network as inputs while processing time series allowing the network to utilize the past data in an effective manner furthermore rnns have a finite quantity of memory and space therefore slope explosion and vanishing issues are common since it is a dnn on time series lstm may to some extent adequately assess the interconnections of the inputs time series data and avoid slope vanishing and slope inflation issues the lstm model though struggles with long term relying and is unable to accurately describe both the most crucial elements for each time interval and the time association on every time unit fig 2 depicts the overall process flow of the proposed system time series are processed consecutively by conventional lstm models without taking into account forward and backward statistics on time series bi lstm is suggested to forecast water quality cycles by fully utilizing the knowledge of the two neighbourhoods before and after in order to achieve better extraction of features skills the ability of bi lstm to analyse information concurrently in the superior and inferior orientations and then transmit that data back to the existing output layer generating connection from the data of the two neighbourhoods before and after hence improving forecasting skills additionally because the hidden layer of an lstm is usually identified by a variable of a fixed length all data will be progressively condensed over time this unassigned compaction will deteriorate the time change between input characteristics to a particular extent causing some crucial data to not be emphasized and influencing accuracy rate since documentary evidence from groundwater resources sequence data adds to the forecast point differently during various periods the concentration system is used the study disregards certain irrelevant and ambiguous data this method can address the issue of limited recognition in the time series data of the framework in order to accurately incorporate the temporal correlation on every time step and the key characteristics within every time step bi lstm is used to the forecast of the water quality sequence this will increase the model s predictive performance 5 1 data collection kerman has sizable industrial and mining zones as well as the worldwide production of pistachios its latitude ranges from 28 43 n to 31 06 n and its longitude ranges from 55 36 e to 58 54 e the altitudes range from 1300 to 2950 m above the sea level the research area s underground water is impacted by a variety of air pollutants involving agricultural operations manufacturing zones in rafsanjan kerman sirjan and residential wastewaters the plains area has two main landmasses the mountain region which is almost stony and barren and the plains region which has sedimentary covering in the centre with grain growth in this area groundwater is frequently the sole supply of water and the availability of this supply is crucial for a variety of competing consumers the research region has an arid and semi arid environment with 138 mm of mean annual precipitation which is 45 lower than the nation as a whole due to the dry hot environment and no groundwater recharge about 77 of the precipitation quickly evaporates with an annual vapour pressure of more than 3000 mm year the sensitivity of groundwater quality has risen due to increasing water extraction from wells drilled in dry season the ministry of energy uses accepted techniques to gather information on groundwater quality monthly measurements of over ten parameters are made at the designated sample sites the following variables were used in this research ph calcium ca2 bicarbonate hco3 electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds magnesium mg2 alkalinity total hardness th sodium na chloride cl and sulphate so2 4 which is mentioned in table 2 the kerman provincial water department provided the datasets used in this investigation which included 1189 groundwater specimens throughout the research area for the dry and wet seasons assessments were carried out individually there were 559 and 630 groundwater resources in the datasets for the summer and winter seasons correspondingly 5 1 1 data pre processing prior to dl forecasting the information from the mechanical models and online sensors were cleaned using data engineering taking special care to remove any records that were incomplete or unusual 23 also the input data used to train and evaluate the systems were scaled and standardized among 0 0 and 1 0 values as determined by eq 1 z n z i z min z max z min when zn is the normalized data zmax zmin and zi are the highest and lowest values of the variables under consideration respectively the normalization aids in the assignment of pertinent weighting for the ml models taking into account the worth of every attribute 5 1 2 feature selection using pearson correlation among the simplest selecting features fs filter methods is the pearson correlation coefficient pcc which is also known as the fs filtering technique the pcc describes the linear connection between two variables that ranges from 1 to 1 with 0 denoting no correlations and 1 denoting the negative correlation 24 the pearson correlation coefficient is calculated as follows s k l c f k f l v f k v f l where c is covariance v is a variance and sk l is a correlation coefficient among a specific characteristic fk and all other characteristics fl in the entire data 5 2 water quality index wqi to convey the quality of the water at a specific locality and time dependent on numerous water quality criteria wqi is estimated to condense the vast amount of quality data into a single numerical result it may alternatively be described as a score that replicates the combined influence of many water quality metrics on the water s overall quality as per horton the idea of using metrics to show the progression of quality of water was originally put out the fundamental goal of the water quality parameters is to translate complex data on water quality into data that the general public can utilize and comprehend an easy way to gauge the water quality is to use the wqi which is depending on a few extremely significant characteristics 5 2 1 calculating the wqi the subsequent equation is used to determine the water quality index it was calculated using a weighted arithmetic technique utilizing the formulas the unit weight wk has been determined 1 w k c s p where c is represent the proportionality constant value 2 c 1 k 1 10 1 s p where wk is the unit weight of the kth factor and sp is the standard permitted value of the kth factor 3 wqi k 1 n q k w k k 1 n w k where qk is the quality ranking for the kth factor in sub index 4 q k v k s k 100 where vk is the laboratory observed value n the amount of variables measured and sk is the kth parameter s typical value this study uses the pollutant evaluating indices pei which is computed using formula 5 to identify the quality of the water the pei is a useful tool for determining the degree of heavy metals contamination 5 pei k 1 n h measure h max imum where for every heavy metal h measure and h maximum are the measurement and the highest permissible quantity expressed in g l accordingly the highest value for h maximum in this research is the benchmark for groundwater quality the pei outcomes categorize pollution levels as minimal moderate or severe 5 3 developed bi lstm approach in order to establish a foundation for the value allotment in the following phase this component conducts bidirectional non linear extraction of features on water quality sequence information for the purpose of obtaining bi directional data for the input data the entire bi lstm module includes a single output that connects two lstm networks with distinct durations numerous lstm cells make up the module which is represented in fig 3 to lay the groundwork for the subsequent step of allocating weights this module extracts bidirectional nonlinear features from water quality sequence information in order to collect bi directional data for the input vectors the whole bi lstm module connects two lstm systems with opposing timings by employing the same output a single bi lstm unit is illustrated in fig 4 and the module comprises several lstm cells the data that is extract from the cell state is determined by the forgotten gate which also determines the extent of the transit of the cell state z s 1 at the final second with eq 6 6 f s σ l f i s 1 a s y f here l f is the input loop weight a s is the input valuation of the current time node y f is the bias item z s 1 is the output of the s 1 moment cell i s is the state of the hidden layer at s 1 moments and is the sigmoid activation functional to select the data to forget the door reads i s 1 and a s and outputs a value of f s between 0 and 1 with 1 denoting full retention and 0 denoting total abandonment the input gate chooses which data to be added in the memory cells cell status z s updates are possible due to the forgotten door and input door combo z s is a representation of what is modified when it identifies what data has to be modified as given in eqs 7 8 and 9 7 u s σ l f i s 1 a s y f 8 z s θ l m i s 1 a s y m 9 z s f s z s 1 z s here l f and l m are the input weights and y f as well as y m are biassed the memory unit level quantity is divided by the output data after the cell state has been processed using the tanh activation function which is controlled by the output gate the hidden layer state variable is i s while r s is the output value as given in eqs 10 and 11 10 r s σ l r i s 1 a s y r 11 i s r s θ z s here y r stands for biases and l r for the input weight the prevent gradient invisibility and gradient explosion issues as well as long term and short term dependence on input time series information are well captured by such lstm gates the fundamental of lstm s long term memory is that every data prior to every cell may be modified deleted concealed and transmitted to the following cell two lstm nodes with opposing timings make up the bi lstm component which processes sequence data in both the front and back directions before feeding it back to the current output units the following eqs 12 13 and 14 illustrate the forward and reverse states of the bi hidden lstm s state in time 12 i s bl i s 1 a s z s 1 s 1 s 13 i s bl i s 1 a s z s 1 s s 1 14 i s i s i s the bi lstm layer s unfolding pattern is given in fig 5 the data included in the water quality measurements is eventually ignored over time since the hidden state of the lstm unit is often conveyed by a vector of a specific length that sort of negligent forgetting would somewhat reduce the temporal gap between the input characteristics making it harder to highlight certain crucial information and decreasing predictive performance 5 4 training process of bi lstm training validation and test sets of the water quality data have been created for this investigation prior to being tested using the validation set the modelling approach must first be developed using validation and training sets the following is a description of the main training steps step 1 input to increase the performance of the models a correlation study of the projected contaminants affecting water quality is conducted as well as the features with the strongest correlations are chosen as input step 2 in learning feature the input vector reaches the bi lstm hidden layer from the input layer which also involves the transfer of the lstm hidden state from the same surface mapping a s to i s in the lstm hidden layer where f is the nonlinear activation function lstm as well as the converting equation is as follows 15 i s f i s 1 a s step 3 in the output by using complete connection layer architecture the study can obtain the s moment predictive model output z s comes after the weighted input feature sequence the model s ultimate output is identified algorithm 1 provides a description of the equivalent technique for the bi lstm model s training phase algorithm 1 training procedure of bi lstm unlabelled image 5 5 sensitivity analysis the suggested bi lstm is compared to the following systems each of which has the corresponding visual appearance rnn a weighted connectivity among neurons in different levels of the system which consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer is established in this kind of recurrent neural network for evaluating sequence data gru with an updating gate and a reset gate this rnn variation is usual lstm a common rnn version called a long short term memory networks has three gates an output gate an input gate and a forgetting gate 5 6 shapley additive explanations shap in order to assess the significance of variables to modelling shap evaluation was carried out in comparison to earlier significance assessments shap technique extracts more reliable ranks and is regionally precise as well as consistent in features attribution shap values assign every predictive variable s marginal contribution to every estimation 25 eq 1 provides the equation for shap values ϕ k x sm k s m s 1 m x s k x s where s is a subgroup of m lacking element k and m is the entire quantity of input characteristics ϕ k is the allocation of an additional characteristic to the feature k commonly known as the shap value in contrast to x s which is a structure learned with feature s x s k is a models learned with characteristic s and k the disparity among x s k and x s is used to assess the impact of characteristic k and more significant this indication the higher the actual shap score for feature k good shap values meant the feature had a beneficial effect on the systems outcome while negative values meant the characteristic had a detrimental impact the python library shap 0 40 0 was applied in this research for shap evaluation 6 result this part presents the findings of testing the calibrated model on a testing set and compiling several experimental findings these findings are utilized to evaluate the baseline model s and the bi lstm model s effectiveness in predicting quality of the water the rnn gru and lstm methods were chosen as the baseline model for comparison tests in order to confirm the superior of the bi lstm model suggested in this work in terms of accuracy of water quality predictions table 3 depicts the proposed system compared in terms of true positive negative and false positive negative and its performance evaluation has been represented in fig 6 the developed model is validated utilizing k fold cross validation a strategy that has been quite common in many simulation research linked to water resource investigations utilizing a k value of 5 k fold cross validation is used in the current study to assess modelling generalization error the comparative result for the developed bi evaluation lstm s in terms of npv fpr fnr and mcc is shown in table 4 the performance analysis of fpr fnr and npv mcc is

was unfit for drinking the main worry is the existence of very hazardous metals the integrity of the groundwater is gradually declining as a result of seepage of the contaminated surface water brought on by uncontrolled sewage systems and industrial waste disposal for the recent research it is crucial to be able to forecast the water s quality this paper suggests an approach for predicting water quality using deep learning methods the suggested bi lstm approach could be utilized to forecast additional time series based contaminants in addition to water quality comparing the performance of the

12442,water is a crucial resource in all economic activity from farming to manufacturing water supplies are under much stress due to the ever growing strain of the world population hence effective water management is crucial to civilized society for raising living standards to address the problems with drinking water quality groundwater quality has to be frequently checked utilizing the water quality index an effort has been made to comprehend groundwater quality wqi it is a technique for assessing water quality and a beneficial tool for determining how groundwater quality has changed over time and in different locations managing ecological systems and water resources can benefit greatly from machine learning approaches computation and considerable forecasting errors hence the deep neural network based long short term memory network lstm has been used for high performance this study presents a deep learning based bi lstm model to predict the variables affecting groundwater quality the suggested model s effectiveness was compared to several existing methods including lstm rnn and gru according to a comparative analysis the suggested model has 0 98 of accuracy and precision which exceeds all other approaches in terms of the best prediction performance and it may serve as a decision making basis for the comprehensive management of water quality keywords groundwater quality deep learning bi lstm method water quality index time series data data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction quality of drinking water has been a major issue for everyone globally especially in arid and semi arid locations underground provides one of the highest drinking water sources and perhaps the most significant source of water for commercial and agricultural uses in locations without access to fresh water groundwater is a crucial water supply for home and farming needs about 70 of the total land surface is covered by water which constitutes one of the most critical resources for maintaining life 1 traditional methods for estimating water quality involve costly and time consuming quantitative and laboratory tests making the concept of continuous surveillance irrelevant nowadays farming ecosystem management and environmental sensing benefit from accurate water quality predictions one of the goals of model creation and use which strives to ensure proper management throughout time is the valuation of water quality water process improvement is the prediction of the tendency of water quality to change at a specific future date an essential component of pollution management ecological sustainability and public health is reliable groundwater resource prediction furthermore early monitoring of cognitive farming is critical for detecting water quality 2 only 3 of the total of the earth s water is thought to be clean and only 30 1 of that is underground which is really critical for human health the environment the power sector and other water related issues the quality of groundwater has declined and freshwater availability has deteriorated in so many areas due to the rising demand from household commercial and agricultural users the need for an appropriate considerate of the intricacies of anthropogenic and natural progressions and how they affect ground water is increasing as awareness of sustainable freshwater usage within the framework of land use and global warming grows degradation of underground water is a well known phenomenon that has drawn a significant amount of attention since the industrial revolution despite this there are still numerous elements to comprehending and managing freshwater as a resource that are complicated and it could be challenging to locate reliable information a water cycle that can be described at several scales governs the amount and quality of groundwater the frequency and fragility of pure groundwater are primarily influenced by local weather patterns and climatic fluctuations the assumption of water quality is therefore extremely useful in real world situations water appears to be one of the most effective communication tools with a wide range as a result of rapid industrialization the level of water quality is rapidly declining 3 one of the main causes of the spread of serious illnesses is recognised to be poor water quality according to reports 2 5 billion people have been unwell and 5 million have died as a result of water borne diseases which account for 80 of illnesses in underdeveloped nations gastroenteritis cryptosporidium typhoid infections diarrhea some types of hepatitis and intestinal worms called giardiasis are the most prevalent of these illnesses in pakistan excessive drinking regularly can result in negative health outcomes such as hemolytic anemia often known as blue baby syndrome most commonly in newborns under six months old different cancers miscarriages in pregnant women ovarian cancer coronary heart disorders and thyroid hypertrophy nitrogen containing fertilisers pesticides inappropriate environmental services and waste dumping into the environment are some potential sources of nitrate contamination of groundwater because of the negative impacts on health this sort of groundwater contamination should be taken into account for protecting public health and the safety of water supply the amount and quality of water sources have been impacted in recent decades by growing populations urban growth industrialization and human made actions such as the disposal of commercial and municipal waste products as well as fertiliser waste these operations have also contaminated these assets 4 any form of physical chemical microbiological or radioactive contamination of groundwater that poses a risk to human health is considered given the rising requirement for groundwater resources total surveillance of the quality of water is a crucial technique for providing consumers with clean drinkable water as a result there has been an increase in the volume of material on communicating groundwater resources globally in recent years the correlation here among the intensity of these basic characteristics and non communicable disorders like cardiovascular disease is among the most crucial topics in the monitoring of water s pollutant concentrations water resources with bottom particles play a significant role in marine ecosystems and greatly influence water quality which has effects on environmental and human health 5 the world health organization estimates that around 80 of all human infections are water borne 6 once contaminated it is difficult to restore the groundwater s purity and quality by removing the contaminants at the source consequently it becomes crucial to constantly examine the quality of water and devise strategies for keeping it safe from pollution according to estimates 1 8 million people worldwide pass away each year from diarrheal disorders the majority of these diseases may well be brought on by drinking contaminated water 7 using a variety of physiological biological and chemical characteristics of groundwater it is possible to determine the quality of the groundwater it is a measurement of the cleanliness and safety of groundwater in relation to the need for and use of human consumption around the world 884 million people consume tainted water for drinking according to unicef changing climate a rise in population urbanisation and industrial growth are all contributing factors that are causing issues with groundwater pollution in various regions of the world water supplies are in grave danger as a consequence of population growth that is occurring quickly and randomly poor management and unsustainable use for agricultural and industrial applications 8 while polluted water supplies are acknowledged as one of the world s top causes of waterborne infections clean drinking water is crucial for maintaining human health one of the difficulties facing policymakers around the world is the appropriate use of groundwater for consumption measurements on water quality have been analysed using a variety of techniques but researchers have given the water quality index a significant amount of thought the wqi is a popular tool for evaluating water quality useful aggregating techniques reduce enormous volumes of groundwater resource information to a single value or score water quality index models are based on extensions that allow the study of massive datasets of water quality that fluctuate in time and space to produce a single value the wqi that defines the calibre of the body of water the wqi should be used as a technique that makes it easier to analyse water quality data by connecting a set of features to a grading scale which improves comprehension of the wqi the wqi is straightforward adaptable and robust with little vulnerability to raw data but it is yet unclear how sensitive it is to the weights of water quality criteria additionally because a variety of recommendations for categorization give varying weights to various quality criteria the wqi outcome depends on following the drinking water standards that are advised by those standards therefore due to the specific region or local groundwater resource conditions the history of the wqi and medical issues water quality standards also include ambiguities 9 for water quality criteria various studies have used various weights the objective of the wqi analysis method is to determine the potential effects that variations in the weights of the water quality factors may have on the final values insufficient knowledge of the unpredictable nature of water quality could result in less successful water quality management techniques the one and only indicator of the quality of water is the wqi which is determined by utilizing an amount of factors that are really illustrative of the quality of the water nine groundwater resource factors are needed to compute the wqi traditionally but even without all of them the wqi can be estimated using at least six established scales in light of many water quality parameters the wqi evaluates the overall groundwater quality in a straightforward straightforward and reproducible method at a certain time and location the wqi concept seems to have some issues because it was often created using site specific standards for a specific area and is not universal additionally they cause uncertainty when converting a sizable amount of information on the quality of water into a single indicator 10 a water quality index typically has four components or phases the most crucial measurements of quality of water are first picked after being processed the values for every water quality metric are then translated to a single dimensionless comment thread 2 eventually a function utilizes the sub indices and weighting components for all water quality metrics to build a complete single attribute wqi the factor loading for every water performance indicator is determined in the third phase fig 1 depicts the overall organization of wqi concepts and demonstrates that the majority of wqis include four key phases the wqi s findings could make it difficult to regulate water supplies the ability of bi lstm to function sequence data instantaneously in the anterior and posterior ways and thereafter feed that data back into the present output nodes generating correlation from the data of the two neighbourhoods prior to and after the processing thereby improving predictive ability this research used shapley additive explanations shap assessment to discover how the factors affected the forecasting outcomes shap are able to provide the ensured descriptions for them and providing the characteristic effects of the every single case 11 the remaining research work is illustrated as follows section 2 explained the prior work on ground water quality prediction the third section discusses the problem statement for detecting the ground water quality section 4 describes the suggested bi lstm technique that estimates ground water quality section 5 presents test findings as well as a comparison of the suggested system the performance of the intended work is examined in section 6 lastly section 7 discusses the findings and the work that has to be done in the future 2 related works purushottam agrawal et al investigated artificial intelligence methods for assessing groundwater quality one of the essential criteria for supporting human existence and development are the quality and quantity of freshwater 12 the most common metric for assessing the water quality is the wqi however because it requires managing big data sets and the computation of numerous subindices the conventional method for calculating the wqi is sometimes time consuming and difficult for forecasting the wqi researchers looked at how well artificial intelligence approaches such as support vector machine a naïve bayes classifier and particle swarm optimization performed in addition to pso for optimization researchers applied an nbc and svm for predictions groundwater water quality metrics and their related wqi were discovered for water gathered from chhattisgarh in order to verify the findings the findings demonstrate that the suggested nbo pso gave a greater wqi index prediction accuracy but the svm pso accuracy was lesser the outcomes of the study also point to the probability of using ensemble ml algorithms to calculate and forecast the wqi with a high degree of accurateness as a result the suggested framework may be utilized immediately to estimate the wqi utilizing the field data that have been measured conserving a significant amount effort and time the generated algorithm however does not thoroughly analyse its performance and fine tune of various input parameters a groundwater quality prediction method employing effective machine learning was proposed by singha et al 13 it is essential to comprehend the degree and quality of groundwater pollution in order to safeguard future supplies of clean drinking water the secret to reducing water pollution and improving water management is the very accurate forecast of water quality the study compares a deep learning based system with three different ml models ann rf and xgboost to calculate a ewqi groundwater samples are assessed several error metrics are introduced to assess the prediction capabilities of algorithms the better prediction approach with the maximum accuracy according to the findings is the dl approach by using the suggested technique 10 times with a freshly randomised dataset where modest variations in performance measures means are seen the uncertainties of the dl approach output is cross verified additionally computation of input variable significance by estimation approach reveals that the dl method provides the high accurate and realistic method for predicting groundwater quality the present study s shortcoming is that the forecasting models only take into account one monsoon dataset however data from many seasons could provide more knowledge about the groundwater quality 13 utilizing ensemble machine learning models amirhosein mosavi et al suggested the susceptibility estimation of groundwater hardness 14 in contrast to surface water groundwater resources are more susceptible to contaminations and disturbances since it takes a very long time as well as a lot of money to restore them therefore via well informed judgements and suggestions policymakers may be empowered by predictive modelling and preventative initiatives for effective groundwater governance the use of ml models for measuring hardness susceptibility has not yet been investigated because of the significance of groundwater quality modelling the current study set out to forecast groundwater hardness susceptibility employing ml techniques for the initial instance by the construction of a comparison research with multivariate discriminant assessment the effectiveness of two prediction methods of brt and rf is examined the soft and hard water are identified using the hardness values from groundwater quality monitoring wellheads and the groundwater hardness susceptibility chart is predicted using eleven predictor variables including land use dfs elevation dfr dtgw evaporation ph pcp gwl lithology and curvature according to the findings the variables dtgw dfr dfs and elevation contributed more to the model development therefore low dtgw low altitudes and close proximity to the sea and rivers are primarily associated with higher harness regions because these factors enhance the circumstances for the precipitation of minerals containing magnesium and calcium into underground water even though the study s findings were encouraging the hardness modelling outcomes in other areas may be impacted by the inclusion of more pertinent and readily accessible input factors hemant raheja et al proposed utilizing machine learning techniques to predict groundwater quality indexes the purpose of the study is to assess the ground water indexes over a research area in the haryana state of india by applying the three ml algorithms xgboost dnn and gbm in the study two wqi the water quality index and the ewqi are utilized to inspect the application of these approaches the findings indicate that dnn significantly improved in the forecasting of the both indices i e wqi and ewqi and that it had comparatively less error values in the predictions of wqi and ewqi using these three distinct methods electrical conductivity was found to be the most significant input variable and ph to be the least significant variable the latest findings are anticipated to be utilized to accurately forecast the wqi and ewqi of groundwater to determine its solubility although the hydrochemical parameters might vary in relevance there is no clear pattern when employing the three methods to estimate wqi and ewqi 15 groundwater quality evaluation utilizing a random forest technique based on groundwater quality indices was proposed by hossein norouzi and asghar asghari moghaddam a sizable amount of the region s needs for agricultural and drinking water are met by the miandoab plain aquifer because of the degradation of groundwater quality it has seen a considerable fall in water table in recent decades in order to effectively regulate groundwater resources quantitatively and qualitatively a scientific research of the research area s groundwater resources is required the determination of gqi which combines ion concentrations and their connection with trustworthy criteria serves as one of the leading factors for evaluating and regulating groundwater quality the fuzzified gqi approach employed the fuzzy gwi to reduce uncertainty for the evaluation of groundwater quality the rf approach a learning approach which is depending on ensembles of dt was also applied because of its excellent prediction accuracy capacity to understand nonlinear connections and ability to recognise key predictor variables the rf methodology offers benefits over other approaches the fuzzy gwi approach which has higher accuracy is shown to be a more dependable method in the valuation of groundwater quality for drinking the work findings demonstrated the reliability of the random forest approach as a technique for assessing the susceptibility of aquifers to groundwater contamination and for managing or monitoring them appropriately the rf results however do not take into account geological data land use water depth or other characteristics that could be utilized to determine what influences groundwater quality 16 estimating wqi in groundwater utilizing ann was an idea put forth by monika kulisz et al assessing the quality of groundwater around drilling sites is essential for safeguarding water supplies in the investigation specific physicochemical characteristics of waters were marked the gathered characteristics were used to calculate the wqi testing the ability of ann approaches to simulate the groundwater wqi was a secondary goal of the research a multi regression model was used to produce the 7 ann input parameters that were optimized and constrained then regression analysis was used to evaluate designs with progressively reduced variables the network with the optimal parameters has 5 input neurons such as ph as well as calcium electrical conductivity sodium and magnesium ions in addition to numerous hidden layer neurons the findings demonstrated that employing the variables is a practical method for accurately and satisfactorily simulating the wqi ann techniques have shown the ability to accurately anticipate the wqi at the desired level thus neural network models may be utilized especially in industrial locations to directly forecast the quality of groundwater the suggested approach can help with water treatment and management by utilizing cutting edge artificial intelligence however accurate water quality predictions are not done 17 assessment of machine learning techniques for groundwater quality modelling was proposed by sahour et al 18 through water sampling and laboratory examination the quality of groundwater is determined applying the field based measurements over a wide domain is time consuming and expensive in the study researchers created a machine learning based system to map the quality of groundwater in an open aquifer in kerman region 248 monitoring wells throughout the area collected groundwater samples for analysis according to their cut off values the gwqi in each well was evaluated and divided into four classes the gis environment was used to identify and analyse factors impacting groundwater quality such as the distances to industrial hubs the distances to residential regions density of population aquifer transmittance evaporation elevation and geology the gwqi and its regulating elements were correlated using six machine learning classifiers utilizing statistical efficiency and the roc the algorithms were assessed an accuracy study revealed that ml algorithms were very accurate in predicting the quality of groundwater however because of its greater accuracy rf was chosen as the best approach the whole region s gwqi classes were mapped using the learned rf models the research area is dominated by poor gwqi according to the findings whereas southwest is inhabited to good gwqi in the north a region that had an extremely poor gwqi was noted the key element impacting the quality of ground water in the area according to the results is its proximity to industrial areas the study offers a groundwater quality modelling technique that is both affordable and replicable in other areas with comparable hydrological and geophysical conditions however the method does not allow for a full assessment of groundwater quality 18 table 1 depicts the prior research comparative analysis treatment plants for waste water can save money time and energy by predicting the features of the wastewater they handle in order to enhance the efficiency of the system feature selection fs techniques are utilized at the pre processing stage this study intends to assess how seven distinct fs techniques such as filter wrapper and embedding techniques affect the ability to estimate total nitrogen tn in the wastewater treatment plants influent flow more accurately three supervised machine learning ml algorithms artificial neural network ann random forest rf and particularly gradient boosting machine gbm were used to design and assess four concepts depending on fs recommendations study employed regular time of input parameters such as ph do cod bod mlss mlvss nh4 n and tn concentrations the operational efficiency of all predictive models was assessed using the rmse mae and correlation coefficient for the data set that was separated into training and unseen testing data r2 findings indicated by common data seemed to have the best outcome when compared to other fs approaches such nh4 n cod bod and do moreover decision tree algorithms like rf and gbm outperformed neural network techniques in terms of effectiveness ann the usefulness of this cutting edge ml technique for wastewater element forecasting can be demonstrated in the way that gbm extended the dataset trends extremely well and delivered the greatest performance on unknown data sets 19 treatment facility expenses are primarily driven by the energy intensive procedure for treating municipal wastewater to fulfil strict effluent quality standards developing and running effective energy saving wastewater treatment plants requires evaluation and forecasting of energy usage based on information gathered over a six year period 2014 2019 this research examined the effect of wastewater hydraulic and weather based patterns factors on the daily electrical use of east melbourne wastewater treatment facilities the combination of characteristics from several sources was accomplished using data engineering techniques the relationships between those factors were revealed and then the most pertinent factors were chosen for training the machine learning ml systems using four different feature selection techniques also two decision tree methods gradient boosting machine gbm and random forest rf as well as the use of artificial neural networks ann were investigated in order to forecast ec data following by a 95 confidence level evaluation according to the outcomes of algorithms for selecting features total n chemical oxygen demand cod and inflow flow had the most effects on the energy use of treatment plants for wastewater of all regression methods gbm achieved the greatest performance prediction a fair predicted error range was shown by the 95 confidence level 20 a useful application depending on ml methods such as parallel artificial neural network ann and chain ml frameworks using scikit learn libraries in python followed by dynamic tweaking and k fold cross validation execution the optimization s uses simulation result from the aspen plus application to simulate how scheme yields including such fluidization temperature vapour rate of heat transfer and dryer residence time in sewage sludge behave in order to produce the best possible results for factors including such feed fume and air temperature steam flow rate moisture levels in the feedstock and vapours inlet temperature to dryer information obtained from a waste water treatment plant in gdynia poland were used to test the reliability and accuracy of the smart optimization in terms of the ideal heat transfer quantity and drying resident duration confirming the algorithm s high prediction the results were 0 85 0 94 and 0 91 for the parallel ann and chained ml techniques accordingly although the chained model showed somewhat good accuracy than the ann model the latter calculated the outcomes significantly faster as a result the chained framework was selected as the computing method for the optimization process in general study asserts that the technique described herein benefits from ca as a result of the geopolitical unrest in the region and the region s high costs of energy there was a 6 decrease in the overall energy used for the incinerator unit of the sewage sludge disposal facility 21 an important factor in assessing the emissions of greenhouse gases from wastewater treatment facilities is nitrous oxide n2o depending on a mechanical framework and machine learning ml method a new technique for forecasting liquid n2o generation during nitrification was created in this work the modelling of two 15 day experiments performed in a nitrification sequenced batch reactor was the initial application of the mechanical framework next the collected online observations of do ph and temperatures were utilized as data input for the ml models together with predicted results such as nh4 n no2 n no3 n mlss and mlvss several machine learning ml algorithms the support vector machine svm the gradient boosting machine gbm and the artificial neural network ann were trained and tested using the information from the tests conducted at 20 c and 12 c accordingly the ann method proved to be the most accurate prediction modelling and it was then put through a 95 confidence level evaluation to identify the genuine data probabilities and estimate the data population s erroneous range additionally the most important variables affecting estimates of liquid n2o were found using feature selection fs methods including pearson correlation and random forest according to the findings of the features extraction study nh4 n and no2 n exhibited the strongest correlations with the formation of liquid n2o using the suggested strategy a quick technique for improving liquid n2o concentrations estimation for short term investigations was produced despite the restricted accessibility of measurement values 22 3 problem statement dissolved oxygen do is a crucial element that is frequently taken into account when predicting quality of the water the prediction models anticipate using the do information as a time analysis according to this the sample tracking strategy uses fluid linear models these models employ a time correlation framework to produce real time prediction that can be helpful in the future a popular area of study in the field of water environmental engineering is how to preserve the trustworthiness of water quality prediction models by creating enhanced prediction model the shortcomings of conventional approaches are removed additionally the previous techniques do not take into account the effects of aspects related to hydraulics biology physics chemistry and meteorology artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic are some

region were collected and they included a number of criteria that might be used to gauge the water s level of pollution wqi process incorporation and new bi directional lstm architecture bi lstm developed for improved water quality prediction the developed bi lstm technique has been compared with other conventional approaches such as rnn gru and lstm using shapley additive explanations shap evaluation system comparative investigation demonstrated the suggested model s robustness 5 methodology the complicated processes involved in the creation of contaminants in water and the non linear nature of intensity variations make it challenging to forecast water quality trends with high levels of accuracy by constantly training dnn to effectively achieve the properties of water quality cycles deep learning approaches can address these issues a few of an rnn s results can be given back to the network as inputs while processing time series allowing the network to utilize the past data in an effective manner furthermore rnns have a finite quantity of memory and space therefore slope explosion and vanishing issues are common since it is a dnn on time series lstm may to some extent adequately assess the interconnections of the inputs time series data and avoid slope vanishing and slope inflation issues the lstm model though struggles with long term relying and is unable to accurately describe both the most crucial elements for each time interval and the time association on every time unit fig 2 depicts the overall process flow of the proposed system time series are processed consecutively by conventional lstm models without taking into account forward and backward statistics on time series bi lstm is suggested to forecast water quality cycles by fully utilizing the knowledge of the two neighbourhoods before and after in order to achieve better extraction of features skills the ability of bi lstm to analyse information concurrently in the superior and inferior orientations and then transmit that data back to the existing output layer generating connection from the data of the two neighbourhoods before and after hence improving forecasting skills additionally because the hidden layer of an lstm is usually identified by a variable of a fixed length all data will be progressively condensed over time this unassigned compaction will deteriorate the time change between input characteristics to a particular extent causing some crucial data to not be emphasized and influencing accuracy rate since documentary evidence from groundwater resources sequence data adds to the forecast point differently during various periods the concentration system is used the study disregards certain irrelevant and ambiguous data this method can address the issue of limited recognition in the time series data of the framework in order to accurately incorporate the temporal correlation on every time step and the key characteristics within every time step bi lstm is used to the forecast of the water quality sequence this will increase the model s predictive performance 5 1 data collection kerman has sizable industrial and mining zones as well as the

main landmasses the mountain region which is almost stony and barren and the plains region which has sedimentary covering in the centre with grain growth in this area groundwater is frequently the sole supply of water and the availability of this supply is crucial for a variety of competing consumers the research region has an arid and semi arid environment with 138 mm of mean annual precipitation which is 45 lower than the nation as a whole due to the dry hot environment and no groundwater recharge about 77 of the precipitation quickly evaporates with an annual vapour pressure of more than 3000 mm year the sensitivity of groundwater quality has risen due to increasing water extraction from wells drilled in dry season the ministry of energy uses accepted techniques to gather

index wqi to convey the quality of the water at a specific locality and time dependent on numerous water quality criteria wqi is estimated to condense the vast amount of quality data into a single numerical result it may alternatively be described as a score that replicates the combined influence of many water quality metrics on the water s overall quality as per horton the idea of using metrics to show the progression of quality of water was originally put out the fundamental goal of the water quality parameters is to translate complex data on water quality into data that the general public can utilize and comprehend an easy way to gauge the water quality is to use the wqi which is depending on a few extremely significant characteristics 5 2 1 calculating the wqi the subsequent

establish a foundation for the value allotment in the following phase this component conducts bidirectional non linear extraction of features on water quality sequence information for the purpose of obtaining bi directional data for the input data the entire bi lstm module includes a single output that connects two lstm networks with distinct durations numerous lstm cells make up the module which is represented in fig 3 to lay the groundwork for the subsequent step of allocating weights this module extracts bidirectional nonlinear features from water quality sequence information in order to collect bi directional data for the input vectors the whole bi lstm module connects two lstm systems with opposing timings by employing the same output a single bi lstm unit is illustrated in fig 4 and the module comprises several lstm cells the data that is extract from the cell state is determined by the forgotten gate which also determines the extent of the transit of the cell state z s 1 at the final second with eq 6 6 f s σ l f i s 1 a s y f here l f is the input loop weight a s is the input valuation of the current time node y f is the bias item z s 1 is the output of the s 1 moment cell i s is the state of the hidden layer at s 1 moments and is the sigmoid activation functional to select the data to forget the door reads i s 1 and a s and outputs a value of f s between 0 and 1 with 1 denoting full retention and 0 denoting total abandonment the input gate chooses which data to be added in the memory cells cell status z s updates are possible due to the forgotten door and input door combo z s is a representation of what is modified when it identifies what data has to be modified as given in eqs 7 8 and 9 7 u s σ l f i s 1 a s y f 8 z s θ l m i s 1 a s y m 9 z s f s z s 1 z s here l f and l m are the input weights and y f as well as y m are biassed the memory unit level quantity is divided by the output data after the cell state has been processed using the tanh activation function which is controlled by the output gate the hidden layer state variable is i s while r s is the output value as given in eqs 10 and 11 10 r s σ l r i s 1 a s y r 11 i s r s θ z s here y r stands for biases and l r for the input weight the prevent gradient invisibility and gradient explosion issues as well as long term and short term dependence on input time series information are well captured by such lstm gates the fundamental of lstm s long term memory is that every data prior to every cell may be modified deleted concealed and transmitted to the following cell two lstm nodes with opposing timings make up the bi lstm component which processes sequence data in both the front and back directions before feeding it back to the current output units the following eqs 12 13

pattern is given in fig 5 the data included in the water quality measurements is eventually ignored over time since the hidden state of the lstm unit is often conveyed by a vector of a specific length that sort of negligent forgetting would somewhat reduce the temporal gap between the input characteristics making it harder to highlight certain crucial information and decreasing predictive performance 5 4 training process of bi lstm training validation and test sets of the water quality data have been created for this investigation prior to being tested using the validation set the modelling approach must first be developed using validation and training sets the following is a description of the main training steps step 1 input to increase the performance of the models a correlation study of the projected contaminants affecting water quality is conducted as well as the features with the strongest correlations are chosen as input step 2 in learning feature the input

kind of recurrent neural network for evaluating sequence data gru with an updating gate and a reset gate this rnn variation is usual lstm a common rnn version called a long short term memory networks has three gates an output gate an input gate and a forgetting gate 5 6 shapley additive explanations shap in order to assess the significance of variables to modelling shap evaluation was carried out in comparison to earlier significance assessments shap technique extracts more reliable ranks and is regionally precise as well as consistent in features attribution shap values assign every predictive variable s marginal contribution to every estimation 25 eq 1 provides the equation for shap values ϕ k x sm k s m s 1 m x s k x s where s is a subgroup of m lacking element k and m is the entire quantity of input characteristics ϕ k is the allocation of an additional characteristic to the feature k commonly known as the shap value in contrast to x s which is a structure learned with feature s x s k is a models learned with characteristic s and k the disparity among x s k and x s is used to assess the impact of characteristic k and more significant this indication the higher the actual shap score for feature k good shap values meant the feature had a beneficial effect on the systems outcome while negative values meant the characteristic had a detrimental impact the python

12443,this paper presented an effective approach utilizing artificial neural network ann to predict the vacuum membrane distillation vmd process of sulfuric acid solution firstly mathematical models have been developed and the influence mechanisms of critical parameters on the transfer resistance in the vmd process were explored via a simulation process furthermore an ann model from the experimental data under actual working conditions was developed and applied to simulate the effects of critical parameters on the vmd process performance including membrane flux and gained output ratio gor the simulation results revealed that decreasing feed concentration or vacuum side pressure and increasing feed temperature or feed velocity would contribute to the reduction of total transfer resistance then the operation data at multiple working conditions using actual sulfuric acid solution was divided into three sets training validation and test to develop the ann model the trained ann model was subsequently observed to have good agreement between the predicted and experimental data from the subsequent simulations with various variable controls increasing feed concentration or vacuum side pressure led to the declines of membrane flux and gor while increasing feed temperature or feed flow rate were helpful to improve membrane flux and gor obviously the developed ann model performed well to predict the vmd process performance with minimum error which could be effectively utilized to predict and optimize the vmd system for industrial wastewater

pollution caused by industrial development all around the world therefore industrial wastewater treatment has drawn extensive attentions by a great amount of scholars in various fields thereinto as an effective method to produce freshwater the recovery treatment of industrial sulfuric acid wastewater seems to be of great importance currently several treatment methods for the sulfuric acid wastewater have been proposed and developed gradually which mainly include neutralization solvent extraction chemical oxidation high temperature pyrolysis single effect evaporation multistage evaporation etc however the aforementioned methods have been restricted by the lower separation efficiency larger secondary pollution higher energy consumption and complicated configurations 1 2 as an emerging and promising separation method with high separation efficiency and strong corrosion resistance membrane distillation md technology on the basis of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polypropylene pp materials has been developed in recent years 3 md is a growing popular separation technology aiming at obtaining the freshwater from the aqueous solution in various fields md mainly employs the micro porous membrane with hydrophobicity to achieve the separation of the treated aqueous solution the pressure difference resulted from the transmembrane temperature difference mainly yields to fresh water production process md has several advantages over other conventional separation technologies such as simple technical process lower evaporation temperature higher separation efficiency and the possibility of coupling low grade heat energy 4 in recent years many scholars have developed several md modules including direct contact membrane distillation dcmd air gap membrane distillation agmd sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd and vacuum membrane distillation vmd for wastewater treatment desalination medical technology and so on 5 thereinto vmd can obtain the higher permeate flux due to a slight transmembrane heat conduction loss and a negative pressure environment at the permeate side applied by a vacuum system therefore vmd has gradually developed with extensive attentions all over the world the vmd technology can be used as an alternate for the treatment of industrial wastewater currently the vmd technology has been deeply investigated and put into reality to generate freshwater from different types industrial wastewater according to the existing reports dow 6 developed a vmd device to evaporate the municipal wastewater and the results revealed that the transmembrane mass transfer coefficient reached 0 16 kg m 2 h 1 bar 1 over the trial period nie 7 utilized a vmd system to deal with low level radioactive wastewater it was observed from the experiments that the membrane flux and separation efficiency could reach to 11 3 l m 2 h 1 and 99 99 respectively li 8 developed a multistage vmd system and explored the mass and heat transfer mechanism in the hypersaline water treatment process caputo 9 tried to adopt the md device with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe flat sheet membrane to deal with sulfuric acid solution and achieve better concentration effect li 10 developed a new multiple effect md device to treat sulfuric acid solution the maximum value of performance coefficient and membrane flux could reach 11 5 and 5 3 l m 2 h 1 respectively zhang 11 used the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane to build a vmd device for the sulfuric acid wastewater it was discovered that separation efficiency reached 100 apparently the vmd technology exhibits an excellent separation effect in the industrial wastewater treatment process however the vmd technology is still unable to achieve further industrial application owing to poor operation stability lower membrane flux and higher energy requirement resulted from the polarization effect membrane fouling as well as lack of heat recovery device 12 accordingly some researchers around the world have carried out a large number of experimental and simulation studies on improving the performance of the vmd system in industrial wastewater treatment process li 13 created a two phase flow within a vmd module by bubbling leading to strengthen the solution s turbulence degree and reduce the boundary layer resistance which contributed to the improvement of water production improvement kim 14 developed a combined system of solar and vmd aiming to utilize the solar to satisfy the energy requirement in the vmd process in their research the specific energy consumption reached to 220 kwh t 1 zhang 15 suggested a heat pump to meet the energy demand of the vmd system si 16 23 utilized the mechanical vapor recompression mvr technology with reference to the self heat recuperation theory to reuse the vaporization heat of the vapor in the vmd system the thermodynamic characteristics economic performance and environmental performance of the coupled system were studied by numerical simulation and experiments the results showed that the specific energy consumption was 81 95 kwh t 1 and the energy efficiency achieved a higher improvement and the coupled system had good energy saving economic performance and environmental benefits actually in the process of evaporating sulfuric acid solution with the vmd technology the solution concentration gradually increases with the evaporation process the solution corrosion becomes stronger accordingly the phenomenons of boiling point elevation and membrane fouling become more obvious resulting in the unstable operation of the vmd system and the nonlinear change of operation parameters which seriously affects the freshwater production performance therefore matching operation parameters reasonably is necessary to improve the system operation stability and achieve system process optimization accurate acquisition of process parameters is the key to match the system operation parameters reasonably the existing research methods are difficult to obtain accurate and reliable prediction results and the optimal operation conditions of the treatment process to overcome this drawback an attractive method based on artificial neural networks ann can be considered and employed to predict and optimize the vmd process the ann is widely accepted as the latest technology providing an alternative approach to solve the complex tasks in the scientific research and engineering applications 24 the ann is able to handle nonlinear problems and perform prediction faster by learning from examples has the potential to obtain the relationship between input and output variables of the process utilizing a limited number of experimental data as a nonlinear processing system the ann consists of neurons and connections which can be applied to map the input and output data at present the application of ann to optimize the vmd process parameters has also been investigated mittal 25 developed an ann model for the vmd system to simulate the influences from operation parameters on the evaporation process performance considering membrane fouling which was beneficial to achieve the vmd process optimization based on the above literature review it is concluded that there are still few studies on the vmd system for sulfuric acid solution and most of the earlier studies are focused on investigating the separation performance and thermodynamic characteristics of the vmd system over a short period of time and the transfer model of the heat and mass occurred in the system has been initially established nevertheless the distribution characteristics of internal heat and mass transfer resistance are not clear in addition it is complicated and dangerous to carry out experiments with high concentration sulfuric acid solution and it is not easy to obtain complete and reliable data under various working conditions through conventional experiments which can not be effectively used for the performance prediction and process optimization of sulfuric acid wastewater treatment by the vmd system therefore it is necessary to expand available data and improve the estimation accuracy of the vmd system to accomplish such task an effort is taken to predict the vmd system performance by utilizing a widely accepted ann technology although ann is gradually applied to the prediction and optimization of the md process the study on predicting the process performance of sulfuric acid solution in the vmd process has not been reported in this paper taking a vmd system as the research object the mathematical models according to the mass and heat conservation laws were built the influence mechanisms of operation parameters on transfer resistance were first investigated through the numerical simulation furthermore a vmd test bench with ptfe membrane was designed and built using the sulfuric acid solution as evaporation object large quantities of experiments were conducted under different working conditions finally an ann model was performed to understand and explore the relationships between input and output variables of system the relationships between these variables were examined and their effects on the vmd performance were evaluated in terms of membrane flux and gained output ratio gor by using the developed ann model the final research results lay an important foundation for the optimal design of the vmd system 2 theory 2 1 system description the vmd system is shown schematically in fig 1 mainly with feed tank vmd module feed pump condenser distilling tank and vacuum pump a feed tank was employed to store the sulfuric acid solution and an electrical heater was utilized to preheat the sulfuric acid solution the employed vmd module in this work is made from polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe microporous membrane tube and is divided into lumen side and shell side after reaching the set temperature the sulfuric acid solution was introduced to the shell side to evaporate by employing a feed pump while the lumen side module is created a certain vacuum with the aid of a vacuum pump as a result a vmd process occurs and a large amount of vapors generate in the vmd module the vapors are then introduced into the condenser and condensed into the freshwater by external cooling water the obtained freshwater is finally

scalar weight to obtain the product then the system updates the weights and biases of the network in the network the total process of ann can be expressed as follows 35 18 y i 1 n w i x i b where x i y i w i b and n stand for input variable output variable connection weight bias and input variable number respectively in this work the ann architecture is composed of four neurons x 1 t 1 m 1 p 3 in the input layer and two neurons n and gor in the output layer which can be presented in fig 2 3 experimental set up and procedure the vmd test bench applied for sulfuric acid solution treatment was presented in fig 3 for preparation of the feed solution sulfuric acid solution provided by suqian guorui technology in jiangsu province of china was employed the feed temperature was mainly controlled through an electric heater produced by minghuang in jiangsu province of china which was installed in the feed tank and the corresponding power was 6 kw the sulfuric acid solution was evaporated in the vmd module which was manufactured by nanjing langtian technology in jiangsu province of china with a pore size of 0 2 um a porosity of 80 and a membrane area of 1 m2 in order to prevent sulfuric acid corrosion from damaging the experimental equipment the feed tank feed pump valve and pipe and test instrument were all made from corrosion resistant material the feed tank and pipeline were made of corrosion resistant cpvc material the acid resistant magnetic feed pump was produced by xinxishan technology in shanghai of china with a type of mp 55r and a power of 90 w the vacuum pump adopted the acid resistant vacuum pump produced by shuange refrigeration equipment technology in shanghai of china with a type of 2xz 05 and a power of 180 w the condenser adopted acid resistant snake tube condenser produced by hongyuan technology in zhejiang province of china with a cooling area of 0 32 m2 the thermometer adopted the pt100 temperature sensor produced by chenyi technology in hangzhou of

measuring range of 0 1 0 mpa the flowmeter adopted the acid resistant float flowmeter produced by yumin technology in shanghai of china with a measuring range of 0 1000 l h 1 several vmd experiments using actual sulfuric acid solution were conducted under different working conditions and the operation data were taken at every 10 min interval 4 results and discussion 4 1 transfer resistance analysis for the current vmd system the influence mechanisms of critical parameters on the boundary layer resistance r b membrane resistance r m and total resistance r t were first focused on investigating which was conducive to weaken transfer resistance and enhance energy efficiency in this section the numerical simulation without considering the membrane foul resistance was performed with the aid of the matlab software the detailed solving process and design parameters were presented in fig 4 and table 1 4 1 1 model validation firstly a series of reliable experimental results under multiple working conditions were obtained via the built vmd platform and used to validate the established mathematical models fig 5 presented the comparison of experimental and simulated values of n by varying the value of x 1 as the a m t 1 v 1 and p 3 were fixed at 1 m2 60 c 0 6 m s 1 and 15 kpa respectively the relative error between the simulated and experimental values were all within 20 indicating that the established mathematical models had better reliability and accuracy 4 1 2 effects of feed concentration fig 6 showed the influences of x 1 on r b r m and r t at the conditions of t 1 of 85 c v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it was found that increasing the x 1 from 5 to 35 resulted in the elevation of the mass transfer resistance this was because under a higher feed concentration the bulk solution viscosity increased the activity of water molecule decreased while the activity of sulfuric acid molecule increased accordingly which led to the enhancement of mass transfer from the bulk solution to the membrane surface thus many sulfuric acid molecules accumulated at the membrane surface causing the boundary layer to thicken which contributed to the increase of the r b from 0 202 to 0 329 pa m2 h kg 1 and the r m from 2 028 to 3 838 pa m2 h kg 1 as a result the value of r t was found to be elevated from 2 230 to 4 166 pa m2 h kg 1 accordingly obviously the increase of x 1 would contribute to the increase of transfer resistances which reduced the system energy efficiency 4 1 3 effects of feed temperature figs 7 8 showed the influences of t 1 on r b r m and r t under different values of x 1 at the v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it was found that increasing t 1 significantly decreased the transfer resistance as the x 1 remained unchanged with the increase of t 1 from 80 to 90 c the bulk solution viscosity decreased and the value of re for the solution increased so that the activities both of water molecule and sulfuric acid molecule in the solution increased and intensified the mass transfer from the bulk solution to the membrane surface however due to the evaporation of part vapors at the membrane surface while the accumulation of more sulfuric acid molecules at the membrane surface the boundary layer thickness was increased to a certain therefore the r b was observed to be increased furthermore the value of r m showed a decrease tend that was because higher feed solution temperature caused a higher membrane surface temperature which caused higher vapor partial pressure at the hot side membrane surface and larger transmembrane vapor pressure difference as a result the diffusion rate of vapors at the membrane pores was increased and the value of r m was decreased since the r m accounted for the highest proportion of the r t in the vmd process the r t was also observed to be reduced with the elevation of t 1 taking the case of x 1 20 for instance by varying the value of t 1 from 80 to 90 c the r b was elevated from 0 209 to 0 227 pa m2 h kg 1 both of the r m and r t obviously descended from 4 340 to 1 726 pa m2 h kg 1 and from 4 549 to 1 954 pa m2 h kg 1 obviously higher value of t 1 could lead to higher energy efficiency due to lower transfer resistances 4 1 4 effects of feed velocity figs 9 10 showed the influences of v 1 on r b r m and r t under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 85 c and p 3 of 35 kpa as the x 1 kept constant increasing v 1 from 1 0 m s 1 to 1 8 m s 1significantly changed the feed solution flow state which contributed to increase the fluid turbulence intensity and reynolds number of solution as a result the mass transfer of water molecule and sulfuric acid molecule in the solution was strengthened however the boundary layer thickness tended to be decreased due to the improvement of fluid turbulence intensity resulting in the reduction of r b furthermore the membrane surface temperature was elevated due to the improvement of the mass and heat transfer process at higher flow velocity which led to the elevations of vapor partial pressure at the hot side membrane surface and transmembrane vapor pressure difference and then increased the diffusion rate of vapors at the membrane pores and reduced the value of r m consequently the r t was observed to be reduced taking the case of x 1 35 for instance in response to the v 1 from 1 0 to 1 8 m s 1 both of the r b and r m dropped from 0 329 to 0 149 pa m2 h kg 1 and from 3 838 to 2 954 pa m2 h kg 1 which led to the reduction of r t from 4 166 to 3 103 pa m2 h kg 1 4 1 5 effects of vacuum side pressure figs 11 12 showed the influences of p 3 on r b r m and r t under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 85 c and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 although the variation of p 3 had little effect on the solution flow state in the vmd module it might cause the variation of the transmembrane vapor pressure difference and determined the overall process performance it could be seen that when the x 1 remained unchanged and increasing the p 3 from 35 kpa to 45 kpa directly decreased the transmembrane vapor pressure difference which weakened the vaporization rate of water molecules at the membrane surface and decreased the vaporization heat from the bulk solution thus the increase of p 3 decreased the driving pressure difference and weakened transmembrane transfer process of mass as well as heat thus it was observed that the values of all the r b r m and r t increased taking the case of x 1 10 for instance with respect to the p 3 from 35 kpa to 45 kpa the value of r t increased from 2 311 to 4 709 pa m2 h kg 1 resulting from the increase of the r b from 0 204 to 0 211 pa m2 h kg 1 and the r m from 2 107 to 4 498 pa m2 h kg 1 the current vmd system had several variables including independent variables and dependent variables which often influenced and restricted each other in order to deeply understand the relationship between variables it was necessary to adopt statistical methods to analyze a large number of simulation data here multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the significance of independent variables on dependent variables taking feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity and vacuum side pressure as independent variables and total system resistance as dependent variables through data analysis software origin 8 5 and spss20 0 statistical analysis was carried out on the result data of the system total resistance under different conditions and the relevant correlation table 2 was obtained as follows it could be seen that f value was 33 425 and the test significance probability p was close to 0 000 which was less than 0 5 indicating that there was a significant correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable in addition it was found that the total resistance was positively correlated with the feed concentration and vacuum side pressure and negatively correlated with the feed temperature and feed velocity when all independent variables were 0 the constant coefficient was 10 567 when other conditions remained unchanged and the feed concentration increased by one unit the total resistance increased by 0 142 pa m2 h kg 1 when other conditions remained unchanged and the feed temperature increased by one unit the total resistance decreased by 0 352 pa m2 h kg 1 when other conditions remained unchanged and the feed velocity increased by one unit the total resistance decreased by 1 029 pa m2 h kg 1 when other conditions remained unchanged and the vacuum side pressure increased by one unit the total resistance increased by 0 585 pa m2 h kg 1 through the above multiple linear regression analysis the difference in results obtained at different conditions was significant in addition for the vmd system membrane fouling is inevitable in the actual operation process which will enhance the transfer resistance in different degrees apparently various kinds of resistances existed in the transmembrane transfer process resulting in the nonlinear change trend of the vmd process characteristics it is difficult to accurately predict the vmd system performance 4 2 vmd performance prediction based on ann model at present the ann can achieve effective prediction in this study about 81 groups of experiments for the vmd process were conducted under variable conditions to obtain a large number of available data for training and testing the ann model with the aid of statistical software as shown in table 3 thereinto 70 of the obtained experimental data was used for training 15 for testing and the remaining 15 for validation of the established ann model the following parameters including x 1 t 1 m 1 and p 3 were selected as the inputs of the ann model to predict the n and gor as an outputs to better establish the structure of the ann model it should use different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer to train the ann model and determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer according to the corresponding minimum mean square error mse fig 13 showed influences of number of nodes in hidden layer on mse in the ann model of n and gor it was found that the minimum values of mse for n and gor were 0 285 and 0 002 respectively it could be concluded that each hidden layer of the established ann model contained 10 neurons hyperbolic tangent transfer function tansig and levenberg marquardt lm algorithms were used in the establishment and training process of ann model fig 14 showed the training results of the ann model the predicted and experimental values were tallied with each other well with a higher values of r2 for the training validation and test sets respectively apparently it was considered that the current model created by ann had enough precision and could describe the vmd system accurately according to the above trained ann model fig 15 showed the simulation results representing the influences from x 1 and t 1 on n and gor as all other parameters were fixed constant including m 1 of 1000 l h 1 and p 3 of 20 kpa as the x 1 increased from 10 to 50 the value of n correspondingly decreased from 2 3 to 1 kg m 2 h 1 while the gor decreased from 0 723 to 0 489 higher x 1 would lead to thicker boundary layer thickness and membrane fouling layer thickness which would increase the resistance in the transfer process of mass and heat thereby reducing the n across the membrane as a result the energy efficiency would be reduced and the values of gor was observed to be decreased in addition with the elevation of t 1 from 70 to 90 c the value of n increased from 1 15 to 3 75 kg m 2 h 1 and the gor increased from 0 672 to 0 768 the bulk solution had higher energy at higher t 1 in the vmd module which made more water molecules evaporate at the membrane surface and diffuse to the vacuum side across the membrane pores therefore both of the n and gor were observed to be increased accordingly these results implied that the x 1 and t 1 were the crucial factors controlling the vmd process performance fig 16 presented the simulation results representing the influences from x 1 and m 1 on n and gor as all other parameters were fixed constant including t 1 of 80 c and p 3 of 20 kpa it was seen that increasing m 1 from 200 to 1000 l h 1 increased the n from 1 21 to 2 30 kg m 2 h 1 and gor from 0 707 to 0 723 the reason was that higher m 1 led to larger turbulence degree of bulk solution which was beneficial to reduce the boundary layer and membrane fouling thicknesses resulting in the reduction of the resistance in the transfer process of mass and heat as a result the transfer process of mass and heat was strengthened and the value of n across the membrane was observed to be increased accordingly the gor showed an increasing trend correspondingly fig 17 presented the simulation results representing the influences from x 1 and p 3 on n and gor as all other parameters were fixed constant including t 1 of 80 c and m 1 of 1000 l h 1 as could been seen that both of the n and gor decreased with the increase of p 3 from 20 to 40 kpa because higher p 3 directly reduced the driving pressure difference which led to a decline of evaporation rate of water molecule on the hot side membrane surface therefore both the values of the n and gor were found to be decreased at a higher level of vacuum side pressure 5 conclusions this paper was focused on a vmd system applied for the industrial sulfuric acid wastewater mathematical models were developed by considering relevant conservation laws of mass and heat firstly the impacts from critical factors on the system transfer resistance were investigated through the numerical simulation furthermore a system test bench was built and multiple working condition experiments were conducted for the purpose of depicting and optimizing the vmd process performance a prediction model constructed by artificial neural network was suggested according to the experimental data after the experiment and simulation the obtained conclusions were given out 1 simulation results indicated that increasing x 1 and p 3 or decreasing v 1 would contribute to the elevation of r b and r m which resulted in the increase of the r t in addition increasing t 1 also increased the r b slightly but decreased the r m significantly which contributed to the reduction of the r t 2 81 groups of experiments were conducted to developed the ann model high regression r2 value confirmed the precise prediction of the vmd process performance by the developed ann model thus the current ann model could be used to predict the membrane flux and gor of the vmd system with high accuracy 3 the simulation results based on the developed ann model showed that the increase in t 1 or m 1 led to the increase in the n and gor the increase of x 1 and p 3 implied the decrease in the n and gor from the above what we got confirms the potentiality of the vmd technology to purify the sulfuric acid wastewater the current technology has great prospect to deal with industrial wastewater more importantly the current ann model is a good way to solve the nonlinear problem and is considered as an important reference to predict and optimize the working conditions for the vmd system which is beneficial to further realize the commercialization of the vmd technology the focus of next step is to optimize the system and obtain the best operation control strategy declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this paper and paper is

12443,this paper presented an effective approach utilizing artificial neural network ann to predict the vacuum membrane distillation vmd process of sulfuric acid solution firstly mathematical models have been developed and the influence mechanisms of critical parameters on the transfer resistance in the vmd process were explored via a simulation process furthermore an ann model from the experimental data under actual working conditions was developed and applied to simulate the effects of critical parameters on the vmd process performance including membrane flux and gained output ratio gor the simulation results revealed that decreasing feed concentration or vacuum side pressure and increasing feed temperature or feed velocity would contribute to the reduction of total transfer resistance then the operation data at multiple working conditions using actual sulfuric acid solution was divided into three sets training validation and test to develop the ann model the trained ann model was subsequently observed to have good agreement between the predicted and experimental data from the subsequent simulations with various variable controls increasing feed concentration or vacuum side pressure led to the declines of membrane flux and gor while increasing feed temperature or feed flow rate were helpful to improve membrane flux and gor obviously the developed ann model performed well to predict the vmd process performance with minimum error which could be effectively utilized to predict and optimize the vmd system for industrial wastewater

pollution caused by industrial development all around the world therefore industrial wastewater treatment has drawn extensive attentions by a great amount of scholars in various fields thereinto as an effective method to produce freshwater the recovery treatment of industrial sulfuric acid wastewater seems to be of great importance currently several treatment methods for the sulfuric acid wastewater have been proposed and developed gradually which mainly include neutralization solvent extraction chemical oxidation high temperature pyrolysis single effect evaporation multistage evaporation etc however the aforementioned methods have been restricted by the lower separation efficiency larger secondary pollution higher energy consumption and complicated configurations 1 2 as an emerging and promising separation method with high separation efficiency and strong corrosion resistance membrane distillation md technology on the basis of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polypropylene pp materials has been developed in recent years 3 md is a growing popular separation technology aiming at obtaining the freshwater from the aqueous solution in various fields md mainly employs the micro porous membrane with hydrophobicity to achieve the separation of the treated aqueous solution the pressure difference resulted from the transmembrane temperature difference mainly yields to fresh water production process md has several advantages over other conventional separation technologies such as simple technical process lower evaporation temperature higher separation efficiency and the possibility of coupling low grade heat energy 4 in recent years many scholars have developed several md modules including direct contact membrane distillation dcmd air gap membrane distillation agmd sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd and vacuum membrane distillation vmd for wastewater treatment desalination medical technology and so on 5 thereinto vmd can obtain the higher permeate flux due to a slight transmembrane heat conduction loss and a negative pressure environment at the permeate side applied by a vacuum system therefore vmd has gradually developed with extensive attentions all over the world the vmd technology can be used as an alternate for the treatment of industrial wastewater currently the vmd technology has been deeply investigated and put into reality to generate freshwater from different types industrial wastewater according to the existing reports dow 6 developed a vmd device to evaporate the municipal wastewater and the results revealed that the transmembrane mass transfer coefficient reached 0 16 kg m 2 h 1 bar 1 over the trial period nie 7 utilized a vmd system to deal with low level radioactive wastewater it was observed from the experiments that the membrane flux and separation efficiency could reach to 11 3 l m 2 h 1 and 99 99 respectively li 8 developed a multistage vmd system and explored the mass and heat transfer mechanism in the hypersaline water treatment process caputo 9 tried to adopt the md device with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe flat sheet membrane to deal with sulfuric acid solution and achieve better concentration effect li 10 developed a new multiple effect md device to treat sulfuric acid solution the maximum value of performance coefficient and membrane flux could reach 11 5 and 5 3 l m 2 h 1 respectively zhang 11 used the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane to build a vmd device for the sulfuric acid wastewater it was discovered that separation efficiency reached 100 apparently the vmd technology exhibits an excellent separation effect in the industrial wastewater treatment process however the vmd technology is still unable to achieve further industrial application owing to poor operation stability lower membrane flux and higher energy requirement resulted from the polarization effect membrane fouling as well as lack of heat recovery device 12 accordingly some researchers around the world have carried out a large number of experimental and simulation studies on improving the performance of the vmd system in industrial wastewater treatment process li 13 created a two phase flow within a vmd module by bubbling leading to strengthen the solution s turbulence degree and reduce the boundary layer resistance which contributed to the improvement of water production improvement kim 14 developed a combined system of solar and vmd aiming to utilize the solar to satisfy the energy requirement in the vmd process in their research the specific energy consumption reached to 220 kwh t 1 zhang 15 suggested a heat pump to meet the energy demand of the vmd system si 16 23 utilized the mechanical vapor recompression mvr technology with reference to the self heat recuperation theory to reuse the vaporization heat of the vapor in the vmd system the thermodynamic characteristics economic performance and environmental performance of the coupled system were studied by numerical simulation and experiments the results showed that the specific energy consumption was 81 95 kwh t 1 and the energy efficiency achieved a higher improvement and the coupled system had good energy saving economic performance and environmental benefits actually in the process of evaporating sulfuric acid solution with the vmd technology the solution concentration gradually increases with the evaporation process the solution corrosion becomes stronger accordingly the phenomenons of boiling point elevation and membrane fouling become more obvious resulting in the unstable operation of the vmd system and the nonlinear change of operation parameters which seriously affects the freshwater production performance therefore matching operation parameters reasonably is necessary to improve the system operation stability and achieve system process optimization accurate acquisition of process parameters is the key to match the system operation parameters reasonably the existing research methods are difficult to obtain accurate and reliable prediction results and the optimal operation conditions of the treatment process to overcome this drawback an attractive method based on artificial neural networks ann can be considered and employed to predict and optimize the vmd process the ann is widely accepted as the latest technology providing an alternative approach to solve the complex tasks in the scientific research and engineering applications 24 the ann is able to handle nonlinear problems and perform prediction faster by learning from examples has the potential to obtain the relationship between input and output variables of the process utilizing a limited number of experimental data as a nonlinear processing system the ann consists of neurons and connections which can be applied to map the input and output data at present the application of ann to optimize the vmd process parameters has also been investigated mittal 25 developed an ann model for the vmd system to simulate the influences from operation parameters on the evaporation process performance considering membrane fouling which was beneficial to achieve the vmd process optimization based on the above literature review it is concluded that there are still few studies on the vmd system for sulfuric acid solution and most of the earlier studies are focused on investigating the separation performance and thermodynamic characteristics of the vmd system over a short period of time and the transfer model of the heat and mass occurred in the system has been initially established nevertheless the distribution characteristics of internal heat and mass transfer resistance are not clear in addition it is complicated and dangerous to carry out experiments with high concentration sulfuric acid solution and it is not easy to obtain complete and reliable data under various working conditions through conventional experiments which can not be effectively used for the performance prediction and process optimization of sulfuric acid wastewater treatment by the vmd system therefore it is necessary to expand available data and improve the estimation accuracy of the vmd system to accomplish such task an effort is taken to predict the vmd system performance by utilizing a widely accepted ann technology although ann is gradually applied to the prediction and optimization of the md process the study on predicting the process performance of sulfuric acid solution in the vmd process has not been reported in this paper taking a vmd system as the research object the mathematical models according to the mass and heat conservation laws were built the influence mechanisms of operation parameters on transfer resistance were first investigated through the numerical simulation furthermore a vmd test bench with ptfe membrane was designed and built using the sulfuric acid solution as evaporation object large quantities of experiments were conducted under different working conditions finally an ann model was performed to understand and explore the relationships between input and output variables of system the relationships between these variables were examined and their effects on the vmd performance were evaluated in terms of membrane flux and gained output ratio gor by using the developed ann model the final research results lay an important foundation for the optimal design of the vmd system 2 theory 2 1 system description the vmd system is shown schematically in fig 1 mainly with feed tank vmd module feed pump condenser distilling tank and vacuum pump a feed tank was employed to store the sulfuric acid solution and an electrical heater was utilized to preheat the sulfuric acid solution the employed vmd module in this work is made from polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe microporous membrane tube and is divided into lumen side and shell side after reaching the set temperature the sulfuric acid solution was introduced to the shell side to evaporate by employing a feed pump while the lumen side module is created a certain vacuum with the aid of a vacuum pump as a result a vmd process occurs and a large amount of vapors generate in the vmd module the vapors are then introduced into the condenser and condensed into the freshwater by external cooling water the obtained freshwater is finally

presented in fig 3 for preparation of the feed solution sulfuric acid solution provided by suqian guorui technology in jiangsu province of china was employed the feed temperature was mainly controlled through an electric heater produced by minghuang in jiangsu province of china which was installed in the feed tank and the corresponding power was 6 kw the sulfuric acid solution was evaporated in the vmd module which was manufactured by nanjing langtian technology in jiangsu province of china with a pore size of 0 2 um a porosity of 80 and a membrane area of 1 m2 in order to prevent sulfuric acid

measuring range of 0 1 0 mpa the flowmeter adopted the acid resistant float flowmeter produced by yumin technology in shanghai of china with a measuring range of 0 1000 l h 1 several vmd experiments using actual sulfuric acid solution were conducted under different working conditions and the operation data were taken at every 10 min interval 4 results and discussion 4 1 transfer resistance analysis for the current vmd system the influence mechanisms of critical parameters on the boundary layer resistance r b membrane resistance r m and total resistance r t were first focused on investigating which was conducive to weaken transfer resistance and enhance energy efficiency in this section the numerical simulation without considering the membrane foul resistance was performed with the aid of the matlab software the detailed solving process and design parameters were presented in fig 4 and table 1 4 1 1 model validation firstly a series of reliable experimental results under multiple working conditions were obtained via the built vmd platform and used to validate the established mathematical models fig 5 presented the comparison of experimental and simulated values of n by varying the value of x 1 as the a m t 1 v 1 and p 3 were fixed at 1 m2 60 c 0 6 m s 1 and 15 kpa respectively the relative error between the simulated and experimental values were all within 20 indicating that the established mathematical models had better reliability and accuracy 4 1 2 effects of feed concentration fig 6 showed the influences of x 1 on r b r m and r t at the conditions of t 1 of 85 c v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it was found that increasing the x 1 from 5 to 35 resulted in the elevation of the mass transfer resistance this was because under a higher feed concentration the bulk solution viscosity increased the activity of water molecule decreased while the activity of sulfuric acid molecule increased accordingly which led to the enhancement of mass transfer from the bulk solution to the membrane surface thus many sulfuric acid molecules accumulated at the membrane surface causing the boundary layer to thicken which contributed to the increase of the r b from 0 202 to 0 329 pa m2 h kg 1 and the r m from 2 028 to 3 838 pa m2 h kg 1 as a result the value of r t was found to be elevated from 2 230 to 4 166 pa m2 h kg 1 accordingly obviously the increase of x 1 would contribute to the increase of transfer resistances which reduced the system energy efficiency 4 1 3 effects of feed temperature figs 7 8 showed the influences of t 1 on r b r m and r t under different values of x 1 at the v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it was found that increasing t 1 significantly decreased the transfer resistance as the x 1 remained unchanged with the increase of t 1 from 80 to 90 c the bulk solution viscosity decreased and the value of re for the solution increased so that the activities both of water molecule and sulfuric acid molecule in the solution increased and intensified the mass transfer from the bulk solution to the membrane surface however due to the evaporation of part vapors at the membrane surface while the accumulation of more sulfuric acid molecules at the membrane surface the boundary layer thickness was increased to a certain therefore the r b was observed to be increased furthermore the value of r m showed a decrease tend that was because higher feed solution temperature caused a higher membrane surface temperature which caused higher vapor partial pressure at the hot side membrane surface and larger transmembrane vapor pressure difference as a result the diffusion rate of vapors at the membrane pores was increased and the value of r m was decreased since the r m accounted for the highest proportion of the r t in the vmd process the r t was also observed to be reduced with the elevation of t 1 taking the case of x 1 20 for instance by varying the value of t 1 from 80 to 90 c the r b was elevated from 0 209 to 0 227 pa m2 h kg 1 both of the r m and r t obviously descended from 4 340 to 1 726 pa m2 h kg 1 and from 4 549 to 1 954 pa m2 h kg 1 obviously higher value of t 1 could lead to higher energy efficiency due to lower transfer resistances 4 1 4 effects of feed velocity figs 9 10 showed the influences of v 1 on r b r m and r t under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 85 c and p 3 of 35 kpa as the x 1 kept constant increasing v 1 from 1 0 m s 1 to 1 8 m s 1significantly changed the feed solution flow state which contributed to increase the fluid turbulence intensity and reynolds number of solution as a result the mass transfer of water molecule and sulfuric acid molecule in the solution was strengthened however the boundary layer thickness tended to be decreased due to the improvement of fluid turbulence intensity resulting in the reduction of r b furthermore the membrane surface temperature was elevated due to the improvement of the mass and heat transfer process at higher flow velocity which led to the elevations of vapor partial pressure at the hot side membrane surface and transmembrane vapor pressure difference and then increased the diffusion rate of vapors at the membrane pores and reduced the value of r m consequently the r t was observed to be reduced taking the case of x 1 35 for instance in response to the v 1 from 1 0 to 1 8 m s 1 both of the r b and r m dropped from 0 329 to 0 149 pa m2 h kg 1 and from 3 838 to 2 954 pa m2 h kg 1 which led to the reduction of r t from 4 166 to 3 103 pa m2 h kg 1 4 1 5 effects of vacuum side pressure figs 11 12 showed the influences of p 3 on r b r m and r t under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 85 c and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 although the variation of p 3 had little effect on the solution flow state in the vmd module it might cause the variation of the transmembrane vapor pressure difference and determined the overall process performance it could be seen that when the x 1 remained unchanged and increasing the p 3 from 35 kpa to 45 kpa directly decreased the transmembrane vapor pressure difference which weakened the vaporization rate of water molecules at the membrane surface and decreased the vaporization heat from the bulk solution thus the increase of p 3 decreased the driving pressure difference and weakened transmembrane transfer process of mass as well as heat thus it was observed that the values of all the r b r m and r t increased taking the case of x 1 10 for instance with respect to the p 3 from 35 kpa to 45 kpa the value of r t increased from 2 311 to 4 709 pa m2 h kg 1 resulting from the increase of the r b from 0 204 to 0 211 pa m2 h kg 1 and the r m from 2 107 to 4 498 pa m2 h kg 1 the current vmd system had several variables including independent variables and dependent variables which often influenced and restricted each other in order to deeply understand the relationship between variables it was necessary to adopt statistical methods to analyze a large number of simulation data here multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the significance of independent variables on dependent variables taking feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity and vacuum side pressure as independent variables and total system resistance as dependent variables through data analysis software origin 8 5 and spss20 0 statistical analysis was carried out on the result data of the system total resistance under different conditions and the relevant correlation table 2 was obtained as follows it could be seen that f value was 33 425 and the test significance probability p was close to 0 000 which was less than 0 5 indicating that there was a significant correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable in addition it was found that the total resistance was positively correlated with the feed concentration and vacuum side pressure and negatively correlated with the feed temperature and feed velocity when all independent variables were 0 the constant coefficient was 10 567 when other conditions remained unchanged and the feed concentration increased by one unit the total resistance increased by 0 142 pa m2 h kg 1 when other conditions remained unchanged and the feed temperature increased by one unit the total resistance decreased by 0 352 pa m2 h kg 1 when other conditions remained unchanged and the feed velocity increased by one unit the total resistance decreased by 1 029 pa m2 h kg 1 when other conditions remained unchanged and the vacuum side pressure increased by one unit the total resistance increased by 0 585 pa m2 h kg 1 through the above multiple linear regression analysis the difference in results obtained at different conditions was significant in addition for the vmd system membrane fouling is inevitable in the actual operation process which will enhance the transfer resistance in different degrees apparently various kinds of resistances existed in the transmembrane transfer process resulting in the nonlinear change trend of the vmd process characteristics it is difficult to accurately predict the vmd system performance 4 2 vmd performance prediction based on ann model at present the ann can achieve effective prediction in this study about 81 groups of experiments for the vmd process were conducted under variable conditions to obtain a large number of available data for training and testing the ann model with the aid of statistical software as shown in table 3 thereinto 70 of the obtained experimental data was used for training 15 for testing and the remaining 15 for validation of the established ann model the following parameters including x 1 t 1 m 1 and p 3 were selected as the inputs of the ann model to predict the n and gor as an outputs to better establish the structure of the ann model it should use different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer to train the ann model and determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer according to the corresponding minimum mean square error mse fig 13 showed influences of number of nodes in hidden layer on mse in the ann model of n and gor it was found that the minimum values of mse for n and gor were 0 285 and 0 002 respectively it could be concluded that each hidden layer of the established ann model contained 10 neurons hyperbolic tangent transfer function tansig and levenberg marquardt lm algorithms were used in the establishment and training process of ann model fig 14 showed the training results of the ann model the predicted and experimental values were tallied with each other well with a higher values of r2 for the training validation and test sets respectively apparently it was considered that the current model created by ann had enough precision and could describe the vmd system accurately according to the above trained ann model fig 15 showed the simulation results representing the influences from x 1 and t 1 on n and gor as all other parameters were fixed constant including m 1 of 1000 l h 1 and p 3 of 20 kpa as the x 1 increased from 10 to 50 the value of n correspondingly decreased from 2 3 to 1 kg m 2 h 1 while the gor decreased from 0 723 to 0 489 higher x 1 would lead to thicker boundary layer thickness and membrane fouling layer thickness which would increase the resistance in the transfer process of mass and heat thereby reducing the n across the membrane as a result the energy efficiency would be reduced and the values of gor was observed to be decreased in addition with the elevation of t 1 from 70 to 90 c the value of n increased from 1 15 to 3 75 kg m 2 h 1 and the gor increased from 0 672 to 0 768 the bulk solution had higher energy at higher t 1 in the vmd module which made more water molecules evaporate at the membrane surface and diffuse to the vacuum side across the membrane pores therefore both of the n and gor were observed to be increased accordingly these results implied that the x 1 and t 1 were the crucial factors controlling the vmd process performance fig 16 presented the simulation results representing the influences from x 1 and m 1 on n and gor as all other parameters were fixed constant including t 1 of 80 c and p 3 of 20 kpa it was seen that increasing m 1 from 200 to 1000 l h 1 increased the n from 1 21 to 2 30 kg m 2 h 1 and gor from 0 707 to 0 723 the reason was that higher m 1 led to larger turbulence degree of bulk solution which was beneficial to reduce the boundary layer and membrane fouling thicknesses resulting in the reduction of the resistance in the transfer process of mass and heat as a result the transfer process of mass and heat was strengthened and the value of n across the membrane was observed to be increased accordingly the gor showed an increasing trend correspondingly fig 17 presented the simulation results representing the influences from x 1 and p 3 on n and gor as all other parameters were fixed constant including t 1 of 80 c and m 1 of 1000 l h 1 as could been seen that both of the n and gor decreased with the increase of p 3 from 20 to 40 kpa because higher p 3 directly reduced the driving pressure difference which led to a decline of evaporation rate of water molecule on the hot side membrane surface therefore both the values of the n and gor were found to be decreased at a higher level of vacuum side pressure 5 conclusions this paper was focused on a vmd system applied for the industrial sulfuric acid wastewater mathematical models were developed by considering relevant conservation laws of mass and heat firstly the impacts from critical factors on the system transfer resistance were investigated through the numerical simulation furthermore a system test bench was built and multiple working condition experiments were conducted for the purpose of depicting and optimizing the vmd process performance a prediction model constructed by artificial neural network was suggested according to the experimental data after the experiment and simulation the obtained conclusions were given out 1 simulation results indicated that increasing x 1 and p 3 or decreasing v 1 would contribute to the elevation of r b and r m which resulted in the increase of the r t in addition increasing t 1 also increased the r b slightly but decreased the r m significantly which contributed to the reduction of the r t 2 81 groups of experiments were conducted to developed the ann model high regression r2 value confirmed the precise prediction of the vmd process performance by the developed ann model thus the current ann model could be used to predict the membrane flux and gor of the vmd system with high accuracy 3 the simulation results based on the developed ann model showed that the increase in t 1 or m 1 led to the increase in the n and gor the increase of x 1 and p 3 implied the decrease in the n and gor from the above what we got confirms the potentiality of the vmd technology to purify the sulfuric acid wastewater the current technology has great prospect to deal with industrial wastewater more importantly the current ann model is a good way to solve the nonlinear problem and is considered as an important reference to predict and optimize the working conditions for the vmd system which is beneficial to further realize the commercialization of the vmd technology the focus of next step is to optimize the system and obtain the best operation control strategy declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this paper and paper is

heterogeneous electro fenton hetero ef system has attracted much attention for the removal of refractory organic pollutants in this study hetero ef for phenol degradation was constructed to use cobalt and nitrogen co doped graphene co n go modified cathode the microstructure and composition of the modified cathode material were explored using sem tem xps and xrd systematic investigation of the effects of various factors on phenol removal showed that the phenol removal rate could reach 97 00 in the hetero ef system by co n go within 4 h and the substrate could be removed well in a wide ph range 3 9 the phenol removal rate was still up to 90 71 after eight consecutive reaction cycles combined with the quenching test and epr analysis singlet oxygen 1o2 played a major role in the degradation of phenol further research revealed that oh and o2 were not only involved in oxidative degradation of pollutants but also contributed to the production of 1o2 meanwhile dissolved oxygen do also participated in the formation of 1o2 the study is beneficial to further develop the potential of hetero ef system for environmental organic pollution remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords singlet oxygen co n doped heterogeneous electro fenton aops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phenol and its compounds were found in wastewater of various industries such as oil refineries textile mills and some other chemical plants which made a great harm to water system once be released 1 phenol was a weakly acidic organic compound with high solubility in water 2 it has certain environmental accumulation and difficult to degrade therefore it has a greater risk of toxicity to the environment conventional treatment methods such as biological treatment chemical precipitation etc were not sufficient to ensure good removal 3 4 at present advanced oxidation process aops has been proven to be one of the effective methods for degradation of organic pollutants 5 7 and electro oxidation has the advantages of high efficiency and low cost and it has been gradually studied 8 9 electro fenton ef technology an environmentally friendly method of removing refractory organic pollutants is becoming more widely used due to it has the advantages of convenient operation and management clean safe and no secondary pollution 10 12 however homogeneous ef reaction system is not ideal because of its high metal ion concentration narrow ph range and secondary pollution of sludge 11 13 in contrast heterogeneous ef hetero ef system could not only effectively overcome the above defects of homogeneous system but also has the ability to continuous production of h2o2 by two electron oxygen reduction 2e orr avoids the risks associated with transportation storage and manufacturing of concentrated h2o2 14 18 in recent years in situ hetero ef systems had been constructed with cathodes modified with catalytic components for example n doped carbon cofe alloy cofe nc and carbon nanotubes cnts cofe nc cnts cnts 19 oxidized carbon nanotubes iron oxychloride ocnts feocl 16 and mno2 into carbon nanotubes coated carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene mno2 cnts c ptfe 20 which avoids the addition of metal ions and facilitates separation and recovery while maintaining catalytic activity by regenerating the low valent metal ion component by electro reduction the agglomeration of transition metals however would significantly reduce the catalytic efficiency which was an urgent issue that had to be addressed 21 in previous studies it has been demonstrated that the combination of transition metals and carbon materials can restrain metal agglomeration and improve the electrical conductivity of the catalyst 22 23 for example denis et al adopted a bottom up preparation method to encapsulate nano nicoo2 nco particles in porous nitrogen doped carbon submicrospheres ncs and found that porous ncs could effectively buffer the obvious volume expansion and inhibit the aggregation of nco the obtained nco ncs anode has a significant high rate reversible capacity and cycling behavior as well as a high lithium diffusivity and a significant pseudo capacitance contribution 24 ding et al prepared co c microspheres by in situ transformation and the carbon shell inhibited the agglomeration of co particles resulting in a uniform core shell structure the experimental results show that co c microspheres have good reflection loss characteristics which can achieve strong reflection loss ultra wide response bandwidth and thin matching thickness 25 therefore using this material modification can theoretically enhance the effect and avoid the agglomeration of metals consequently metal and nitrogen co doped carbon materials m n c have been extensively studied because they are low cost highly active and possess a high level of stability in 2e orr reactions 26 28 the green synthesis of h2o2 has been demonstrated to be more effective with n doped carbon materials since their charge distribution on carbon surfaces was altered as well as their interactions with adsorbed substances are affected making them a useful material for the green synthesis 29 which was beneficial for the adsorption of dissolved oxygen to improve electrochemical activity and 2e orr 30 and there were active sites for catalyzing h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radicals oh 10 29 31 as of yet relatively little research has been conducted on m n c materials as catalyst modified cathodes for hetero ef and the internal reaction mechanism remains unclear in particular the interaction between metal nitrogen doped carbon materials and hydrogen peroxide the source of active species in the reaction system and the generation mechanism of species were still lacking in this study n doped graphene oxide materials loaded with co co n go were successfully prepared as working electrodes using carbon paper as a support the working electrode was not only the h2o2 generation site but also the h2o2 activation site to study the catalytic performance of the co n go electrode phenol was chosen as an example for degradation and the probable degradation route of phenol was speculated the types and sources of reactive oxygen species ros were identified and the potential catalytic reaction mechanism for in situ hetero ef systems was explored 2 experimental 2 1 chemical reagents details of chemical reagents and suppliers were listed in supplementary information of text s1 2 2 synthesis of catalysts 2 2 1 synthesis of graphene oxide the graphene oxide go was prepared by using the hummer method 32 under an ice bath 69 ml of h2so4 98 was added to the beaker 3 0 g of graphite flakes and 1 5 g of sodium nitrate were added and the mixture was stirred and cooled to 0 c subsequently 9 0 g kmno4 was added slowly with different batches at a reaction temperature below 20 c with stirring for 15 min following this the temperature was gradually raised to 35 c for 30 min whilst stirring continuously then 138 ml of deionized water was slowly added heated to 98 c and stirred for 15 min before the heating source was turned off finally the mixture was cooled in a water bath for 10 min and 420 ml deionized water and 3 ml h2o2 30 were added for stirring and cooling at room temperature following filtration centrifugation and dialysis of washing until its ph was reached neutral the product was dispersed in water at a concentration of 1 g l with ultrasonic for 60 min and freeze dried to obtain go 2 2 2 synthesis of co n go catalyst the preparation method of co n go catalyst had reported in the literature 33 34 a solution of 100 mg of go and 50 mg of melamine was dispersed for 2 h by ultrasonic method in 50 ml of deionized water then 1 ml of a 3 g l co no3 6h2o solution was added to the mixture which was dispersed by ultrasonic for 20 min and was subsequently freeze dried for 24 h after heating to 800 c with a rate of 5 c per minute under a nitrogen atmosphere and holding it for 60 min the product was denoted as co n go catalyst the preparation process of the catalyst has been shown in scheme 1 2 3 preparation of electrodes dissolve 6 mg of different catalytic materials go n go co n go in anhydrous ethanol containing 5 nafion and ultrasonic treatment for 20 min to achieve a uniformly distributed solution similar to ink carbon paper with effective area of 4 cm2 2 cm 2 cm was served as the working electrode carrier the catalyst dispersion was coated on the carbon paper substrate and dried under infrared lamp to obtain the working electrode 2 4 bath experiments all experiments on the degradation of phenol were conducted in a single chamber reactor unless otherwise stated the reaction temperature was 298 15 k and the stable current was provided by the lightning magnetic dj8 292 inesa scientific instrument co ltd double potentiostat a carbon paper electrode was modified with a catalyst as the working electrode the platinum sheet as the opposite electrode and the distance was 2 cm the volume of electrolyte was 60 ml and phenol with a concentration of 100 mg l na2so4 solution 50 mm was used as a supporting electrolyte the electrolyte was stirred with magnetic force at 200 rpm to avoid concentration polarization 1 00 ml of reaction solution was taken from the cathode chamber every hour to analysis during the reaction process stirred continuously to avoid concentration polarization and continuously pumped o2 into the electrolyte at a constant flow rate except for the experiment to explore the effect of ph the initial ph remained unchanged and all conditions were neutral the investigations such as degradation experiments influence factor experiments quenching experiments were carried out in triplicate to explore the catalytic performance of co n go electrode under different conditions different influencing factors were set up such as different current densities 5 00 7 25 ma cm2 initial ph 2 0 12 5 the detailed analysis has made in the results and discussion section 2 5 characterization and analysis 2 5 1 characterization the morphology and

analysis of phenol was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc for detailed parameter setting and data analysis refer to text s2 in supplementary information the intermediates of phenol degradation were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry the details were shown in supplementary information of text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 microstructure characterization the sem tem hr tem and mapping tests were employed to reveal the microstructure and composition of the co n go modified cathode the sem images show no significant difference in go n go and co n go at the size of 2 um fig 1 a c which was similar to the morphology of graphene oxide with layered folded and smooth surfaces when scaled up to 500 nm go n go had no change fig 1 d and e while granular protrusions could be observed on co n go surface fig 1 f which may be due to the agglomeration of cobalt during high temperature pyrolysis combined with tem mapping analysis fig 2 d it was found that the granular protrusions were consistent with co element and the results were consistent with sem analysis tem image shows obvious black small agglomerated particles fig 2 a and the formed small agglomerated particles were co metal nanoparticles also it could be seen from the grain size distribution histogram fig 2 c that the average particle size of co in the catalyst was close to 27 0 nm this may be due to the fact that the go material inhibits co agglomeration to a certain extent and promotes the dispersion of co metal the presence of nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic activity because the interface between metal nanoparticles and carriers could cause electron redistribution promote charge transfer and further improve catalytic activity it can be seen from the hr tem pattern that there were obvious metal lattice fringes on co n go modified cathode fig 2 b the lattice fringe spacing was 0 214 nm and belongs to the 102 crystal plane of co combined with fig 2 d it was proved that co c n and o elements coexist in the catalyst structure in addition tem mapping also confirmed that co clusters occurred during the doping process which was consistent with sem and tem analysis the transformation of physicochemical properties caused by pyrolysis can significantly affect the efficiency of the working electrode the content of n and co was 5 00 and 0 41 in co n go respectively it is also demonstrated that the two elements n and co were successfully doped and loaded as shown in fig 3 in the spectrogram of c 1s fig 3 a the characteristic peaks at 284 7 ev 285 5 ev and 287 5 ev belonged to cc cn and co structures respectively the main peak at 284 7 ev c c corresponding to graphite c sp2 structure appeared in the c 1s spectrum 35 indicating that go was successfully prepared as a carrier of nitrogen and cobalt the n 1s spectrum fig 3 b could be divided into five different types of n species such as pyridine n 397 9 ev co nx 398 5 ev pyrrole n 400 0 ev graphite n 401 2 ev and oxidized n 402 6 ev 33 36 pyridine n and co nx species accounted for 44 32 of the total n species reports indicated that pyridine n and co nx were the active sites for h2o2 production while pyridine n was considered as the active site for h2o2 to generate oh 37 38 in the spectrum of co 2p fig 3 c the two characteristic peaks at 779 7 ev and 795 1 ev belonged to the co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 which directly proved the interaction between co and carrier and also attested the successful doping of co the other two characteristic peaks at 787 9 ev and 804 8 ev belonged to satellite peaks 39 fig 3 d showed the xrd patterns of go modified cathode n go modified cathode and co n go modified cathode in the xrd pattern of different catalysts found that the peak for amorphous carbon steamed bun peak of 26 0 the diffraction peak of 31 0 was belongs to the 003 of graphite 3r pdf 26 1079 crystal plane of graphite carbon the diffraction peaks at 38 1 and 51 1 correspond to the crystal planes of 104 in coco3 pdf 11 0692 and 111 in cocx pdf 44 0962 indicating that co had successfully anchored in co n go catalyst in addition the diffraction peak of co was not obvious which may be due to the small proportion of co loading 3 2 electro fenton degradation of phenol 3 2 1 properties of different catalysts in order to explore the degradation performance of phenol by working electrodes modified by different materials go n go and co n go were coated on carbon paper as the working electrode the electro fenton degradation experiments of phenol were carried out under the conditions of ph 6 9 and current density was 7 50 ma cm2 as disclosed in fig 4 a the phenol removal rate on the n go modified working electrode was 68 43 within 4 h while the value was only 57 95 with go modified working electrode this indicated the doping of n could contribute to the improvement of the electro catalytic performance which was consistent with previous reports that graphite n was the active site of h2o2 production and pyridine n was the active site of h2o2 activation 37 it was worth noting that when co was doped the performance catalytic degradation of phenol by the co n go modified working electrode was greatly improved and the removal rate reached 97 00 after 4 h of reaction this indicated the introduction of co plays an important role in improving the performance of electro fenton catalyst after exponential fitting phenol degradation rate y varies exponentially with x test s2 of eq 1 and y also depends on parameters a and b in which b has a greater influence the reaction rate of co n go b 2 46 was obviously better than go b 1 55 and n go b 1 63 which shown that the reaction rate gradually increasing fig 4d 3 2 2 influence of applied current the magnitude of current density is an important parameter of hetero ef technology the removal rates of phenol under different current densities were shown in fig 4 b when the current density was 5 00 ma cm2 and 6 25 ma cm2 the removal rates of phenol were only 55 49 and 81 76 after 4 h of reaction and the corresponding values of cod removal rates were 43 61 and 44 44 fig s1 when the current density increased to 7 50 ma cm2 the removal rate of phenol and cod were up to 97 00 and 91 51 the exponential fitting curve showed that when the current density increased to 7 50 ma cm2 b 2 46 the degradation rate of phenol has significantly accelerated fig 4e it has proved that with the increase of current the increasing current was conducive to generating a large amount of h2o2 and activated h2o2 to generate more oh to attack substrates 14 40 since the higher current density intensified electron transfer and promoted the process of oxygen reduction in addition the mineralization current efficiency mce of phenol under different applied currents was also investigated fig s2 when the current density was 5 00 ma cm2 6 25 ma cm2 and 7 50 ma cm2 the mce of phenol was 51 90 43 61 and 95 00 respectively it could know that when the current density was 7 5 ma cm2 the mineralization current efficiency of phenol was also the maximum 3 2 3 influence of initial ph when h2o2 was generated and excited to form oh the influence of ph of reaction solution could not be ignored as shown in fig 4 c when initial ph values were set to 2 0 4 5 6 9 9 0 11 0 and 12 5 the removal rates of phenol were 100 97 52 97 00 77 98 56 45 and 39 49 within 4 h respectively the cod removals with different initial ph values were 100 95 52 91 51 65 76 51 77 and 28 56 fig s3 it was observed that when ph increased from 2 0 to 6 9 the removal rate only decreased by 3 00 showing that the hetero ef system had strong adaptability to ph of solution it was illustrated that acidic conditions were conducive to phenol removal and cod reduction which may be because the increase of h content in the solution is conducive to the formation of h2o2 41 the exponential analysis of degradation reactions at different ph was 2 0 4 5 6 9 11 0 and 12 5 the value of b was 2 40 2 15 2 46 1 62 1 23 and 0 91 respectively fig 4f the results indicated that the degradation rate of hetero ef under acidic conditions was significantly better than that under alkaline conditions due to the higher content of h was conducive to generate h2o2 and the oxidation capacity of oh near neutral was weaker than acidic when ph was over 6 9 oh would rapidly convert to conjugate base o which reaction rate was lower than oh 42 meanwhile ph has monitored during the reaction fig s4 when ph was 2 0 and 4 5 the ph change was not obvious while in neutral or basic conditions 6 9 9 0 ph has decreased signally because carboxylic acid formic acid acetic acid has formed in the degradation process of phenol 43 44 when alkali was over ph changed weakly and consistent with the results of poor degrade under alkaline conditions it indicated that the reaction rate has gradually accelerated because of the ph change of the reaction system which was consistent with the kinetic fitting results in addition under the ph of 7 the removal rate of phenol and cod was still up to 56 45 and 51 77 respectively because h2o2 was activated by catalytic site on the working electrode surface to produce reactive oxygen radicals such as oh and ho2 45 these free radicals reacted with phenol and degraded into derivatives or minerals the applicable ph of the reaction system was 3 9 basically covering the ph range of different sewage however considering that the ph standard of environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 is 6 9 so the initial ph in reaction systems were 6 9 unless otherwise stated 3 3 durability of the co n go electrode the stability of co n go modified cathode was verified by repeated experiments with the same experimental parameters the experimental results were shown in fig 5 after eight repeated experiments the removal rate of phenol still reached 90 71 after 4 h of reaction it was only 6 29 less efficient than the fresh co n go modified cathode 97 00 the results showed that the co n go cathode has the sustainable utilization and stability were outstanding in the electro fenton system 3 4 comparison with other aops the cost of the wastewater treatment system is a very important parameter the main operational cost of hetero ef process included electrode material and energy consumption the cost of cobalt as electrode material was assumed to be 2 91 kg and energy consumed was approximately estimated at a cost of 0 071 kwh for hetero ef process the operational costs were 0 94 kg phenol and 0 32 kg cod respectively at optimum conditions for conventional fenton process the operational costs were 1 34 kg phenol 1 85 kg cod respectively at optimum conditions 46 a comparison of some related results of the removal of phenol and its products by different advanced oxidation technologies has shown in table 1 during the fenton reaction hydrogen peroxide was catalyzed by ferrous ions to produce hydroxyl radicals that required the addition of activated metal ions and oxidants which leads to a high economic cost 47 49 however the heterogeneous catalytic system does not need additional oxidants and has high repeatability so it has better economic benefits and application prospects 50 51 overall this work has the advantages of excellent catalytic performance high repeatability and good economic benefits 3 5 mechanism of phenol degradation 3 5 1 recognition of oxidation mechanism the reactive oxygen species involved in phenol degradation were identified by quenching experiments and epr analysis in general the common oxidation mechanisms in the hetero ef system include 1o2 oh and o2 corresponding oxidation effects can be quenched by furfurylalcohol ffa tert butanol tba and p benzoquinone p bq respectively as shown in fig 6a the removal rate of phenol reached 97 00 without adding any scavengers within 4 h after adding tba 600 mm the removal rate decreased to 73 24 indicating that oh was generated and contributed to phenol degradation in the hetero ef system with co n go modified cathode when 2 mm p bq was added to the hetero ef system fig 6b the removal rate reached 82 02 even though the concentration continued to increase until 10 mm the removal rate was still 79 34 indicating that o2 had a limited inhibitory effect on phenol removal meanwhile the removal of phenol was significantly inhibited by the addition of ffa fig 6c the removal rate was 41 72 when 10 mm ffa was introduced into the reaction system when the concentration of ffa increased to 50 mm the removal rate was decreased rapidly to 18 22 which indicated that 1o2 was dominant in the hetero ef system of co n go further analysis showed that when added ffa to 50 mm the degradation rate of phenol was only 18 22 which was consistent with the inhibition effect of oh on phenol degradation in the presence of tba indicating that ffa almost completely quenching the catalytic oxidation of other reactive oxygen species except oh in the heterogeneous system the quenching experiments show that in the n go electrode catalytic system fig s5 as shown in fig s6 the hydroxyl free radical has almost no effect 5 06 the hydroxyl free radical has a contribution to degrade phenol 44 62 in co n go electrode catalytic system which further indicates that co nx was the active site of hydrogen peroxide generation thus producing certain hydroxyl free radical for the degradation of phenol to confirm the existence of 1o2 oh and o2 in hetero ef systems temp and dmpo were used as traps for epr experiments fig 6d f the quartet lines of dmpo oh and dmpo o2 had been detected with characteristic peak intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 which verified that oh and o2 generated in the hetero ef system 52 53 in addition the typical three state spectrum of temp 1o2 with the characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 was also observed 22 and the peak intensity was relatively obvious indicating that the hetero ef system of co n go could produce 1o2 with relatively high output 3 5 2 analysis the source of reactive oxygen species in ef system oh was mainly derived from the reduction of h2o2 and o2 directly generated o2 through electron transfer during the electrochemical reaction o2 was reduced to h2o2 through an important 2e orr mechanism with the ooh as intermediate 54 55 studies have proved that graphene has the two dimensional structure of sp2 hybrid and has a large specific surface area and electrical conductivity which could effectively promote the process of electron transfer to contributing to produce h2o2 56 59 in this study using go as the carrier the co doped hetero atomic nitrogen and transition metal cobalt induced the formation of different n species fig 3 previous studies have reported that graphite n could promote the 2e orr process and co nx exhibited great potential for acidic h2o2 electro synthesis via a dominated 2e orr pathway 60 63 which were all conducive to the rapid production of h2o2 subsequently h2o2 formed through above processes could be activated on the surface of the catalyst to produce oh or it could be further reduced to oh by the production of intermediate oh through e pathway in the electro catalytic process 64 65 at the same time part of o2 was converted to o2 by single electron reduction reaction with the co n go modified electrode 66 the quenching results and epr experiments have testified that 1o2 played a dominant role in the hetero ef system with the co n go cathode in order to investigate the source of 1o2 we carried out aeration experiments under different conditions fig s7 the removal efficiency of phenol was 97 00 within 4 h under the condition of o2 while the value was only 75 32 when n2 was introduced these results indicated that dissolved oxygen do in the reaction system was involved in the formation of 1o2 some studies have verified that the conjugated structure of carbon and nitrogen materials may involve energy transfer between excited three state excitons and ground state oxygen molecules during the generation of 1o2 67 moreover do could be transformed into 1o2 by discharge or chemical reaction in the hetero ef system 68 therefore in the hetero ef system with co n go modified electrode the conjugated structure of n doped go promoted the formation of 1o2 what s interesting was that when nitrogen was successfully introduced the degradation efficiency of phenol was still up to 75 32 which suggested that 1o2 possessed other sources besides do in combination with the experimental analysis of the influence factors the current density has an obvious influence on the catalytic degradation performance fig 4b higher current density could affect the generation and decomposition of h2o2 into oh thus affecting the generation of reactive oxygen species thus the production of reactive oxygen species could be control by regulating the content of do in the reaction system and the amount of current given in combination with above quenching and epr experiments oh and o2 almost do not participate in phenol degradation but exhibited relatively obvious characteristic peaks we believe that only part of oh and o2 produced in the reaction system were used for direct oxidation of phenol and part of them contributed to the transformation of 1o2 also previous studies have revealed the reaction between oh and o2 or through the reaction between o2 and h2o2 could to produce 1o2 16 19 69 70 based on the above mechanism exploration 1o2 dominated the degradation of phenol in the hetero ef system with co n go modified electrode its main sources include do transformation and subsequent reactions involving oh and o2 in particular the conjugate structure of the co n go modified electrode could promote energy transfer between excited three state excitons and ground state oxygen molecules during the generation of 1o2 eq 1 71 73 in addition the main source of oh was the reduction of h2o2 eqs 2 3 when transition metals cobalt and hetero atomic nitrogen were introduced the produced co nx and graphite n jointly promoted h2o2 electro synthesis via a dominated 2e orr pathway 74 75 which further enhanced the formation of oh eqs 4 5 meanwhile do diffused to the surface and interior of the co n go working electrode and then o2 was generated by e reduction of o2 eqs 6 subsequently part of oh and o2 produced in the reaction system were used for direct oxidation of phenol and part of them contributed to the transformation of 1o2 eqs 7 8 scheme 2 1 o 2 energy transfer

hetero ef system was inferred from the determination of intermediates in the phenol degradation process by gc ms table s1 the oxidation of phenol was usually gradual firstly h2o2 and oh attack phenol to produce benzenediol catechol hydroquinone and degraded by reactive oxygen species 1o2 o2 to form benzoquinone subsequently the benzoquinone undergoes a ring opening reaction to produce micro molecular species such as succinic acid finally the micro molecular species were completely oxidized to co2 and h2o based on the test results of gc ms and relevant references the possible pathways of phenol degradation were proposed fig 7 4 conclusion in this study cobalt and nitrogen co doped go modified cathode was synthesized and used to construct hetero ef system on the basis of the experimental results we came to the following conclusions 1 the results of series characterization experiment sem hr tem xps confirmed that co and n have been successfully incorporated into go and various n species such as co nx and graphite n have emerged to improve the work performance of modified co n go cathode 2 hetero ef system with co n go cathode achieved efficient removal of phenol in a wide range of ph 2 9 after eight consecutive cycles the modified cathode still exhibited high work performance 3 the results of the quench tests and epr analysis indicated that 1o2 oh and o2 participated in the degradation of phenol in hetero ef system 1o2 played a crucial role in the degradation of phenol meanwhile 1o2 mainly came from the following ways 1 dissolved oxygen via electron transfer reaction 2 reactive oxygen species reacted to produce 1o2 and o2 was the main intermediate involved in the reaction in brief the conjugate structure formed by the introduction of n on the cathode material promoted the electron transfer process which was conducive to the conversion of do to 1o2 co nx and graphite n enhanced the generation of oh and o2 by promoting the generation of h2o2

heterogeneous electro fenton hetero ef system has attracted much attention for the removal of refractory organic pollutants in this study hetero ef for phenol degradation was constructed to use cobalt and nitrogen co doped graphene co n go modified cathode the microstructure and composition of the modified cathode material were explored using sem tem xps and xrd systematic investigation of the effects of various factors on phenol removal showed that the phenol removal rate could reach 97 00 in the hetero ef system by co n go within 4 h and the substrate could be removed well in a wide ph range 3 9 the phenol removal rate was still up to 90 71 after eight consecutive reaction cycles combined with the quenching test and epr analysis singlet oxygen 1o2 played a major role in the degradation of phenol further research revealed that oh and o2 were not only involved in oxidative degradation of pollutants but also contributed to the production of 1o2 meanwhile dissolved oxygen do also participated in the formation of 1o2 the study is beneficial to further develop the potential of hetero ef system for environmental organic pollution remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords singlet oxygen co n doped heterogeneous electro fenton aops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phenol and its compounds were found in wastewater of various industries such as oil refineries textile mills and some other chemical plants which made a great harm to water system once be released 1 phenol was a weakly acidic organic compound with high solubility in water 2 it has certain environmental accumulation and difficult to degrade therefore it has a greater risk of toxicity to the environment conventional treatment methods such as biological treatment chemical precipitation etc were not sufficient to ensure good removal 3 4 at present advanced oxidation process aops has been proven to be one of the effective methods for degradation of organic pollutants 5 7 and electro oxidation has the advantages of high efficiency and low cost and it has been gradually studied 8 9 electro fenton ef technology an environmentally friendly method of removing refractory organic pollutants is becoming more widely used due to it has the advantages of convenient operation and management clean safe and no secondary pollution 10 12 however homogeneous ef reaction system is not ideal because of its high metal ion concentration narrow ph range and secondary pollution of sludge 11 13 in contrast heterogeneous ef hetero ef system could not only effectively overcome the above defects of homogeneous system but also has the ability to continuous production of h2o2 by two electron oxygen reduction 2e orr avoids the risks associated with transportation storage and manufacturing of concentrated h2o2 14 18 in recent years in situ hetero ef systems had been constructed with cathodes modified with catalytic components for example n doped carbon cofe alloy cofe nc and carbon nanotubes cnts cofe nc cnts cnts 19 oxidized carbon nanotubes iron oxychloride ocnts feocl 16 and mno2 into carbon nanotubes coated carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene mno2 cnts c ptfe 20 which avoids the addition of metal ions and facilitates separation and recovery while maintaining catalytic activity by regenerating the low valent metal ion component by electro reduction the agglomeration of transition metals however would significantly reduce the catalytic efficiency which was an urgent issue that had to be addressed 21 in previous studies it has been demonstrated that the combination of transition metals and carbon materials can restrain metal agglomeration and improve the electrical conductivity of the catalyst 22 23 for example denis et al adopted a bottom up preparation method to encapsulate nano nicoo2 nco particles in porous nitrogen doped carbon submicrospheres ncs and found that porous ncs could effectively buffer the obvious volume expansion and inhibit the aggregation of nco the obtained nco ncs anode has a significant high rate reversible capacity and cycling behavior as well as a high lithium diffusivity and a significant pseudo capacitance contribution 24 ding et al prepared co c microspheres by in situ transformation and the carbon shell inhibited the agglomeration of co particles resulting in a uniform core shell structure the experimental results show that co c microspheres have good reflection loss characteristics which can achieve strong reflection loss ultra wide response bandwidth and thin matching thickness 25 therefore using this material modification can theoretically enhance the effect and avoid the agglomeration of metals consequently metal and nitrogen co doped carbon materials m n c have been extensively studied because they are low cost highly active and possess a high level of stability in 2e orr reactions 26 28 the green synthesis of h2o2 has been demonstrated to be more effective with n doped carbon materials since their charge distribution on carbon surfaces was altered as well as their interactions with adsorbed substances are affected making them a useful material for the green synthesis 29 which was beneficial for the adsorption of dissolved oxygen to improve electrochemical activity and 2e orr 30 and there were active sites for catalyzing h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radicals oh 10 29 31 as of yet relatively little research has been conducted on m n c materials as catalyst modified cathodes for hetero ef and the internal reaction mechanism remains unclear in particular the interaction between metal nitrogen doped carbon materials and hydrogen peroxide the source of active species in the reaction system and the generation mechanism of species were still lacking in this study n doped graphene oxide materials loaded with co co n go were successfully prepared as working electrodes using carbon paper as a support the working electrode was not only the h2o2 generation site but also the h2o2 activation site to study the catalytic performance of the co n go electrode phenol was chosen as an example for degradation and the probable degradation route of phenol was speculated the types and sources of reactive oxygen species ros were identified and the potential catalytic reaction mechanism for in situ hetero ef systems was explored 2 experimental 2 1 chemical reagents details of chemical reagents and suppliers were listed in supplementary information of text s1 2 2 synthesis of catalysts 2 2 1 synthesis of graphene oxide the graphene oxide go was prepared by using the hummer method 32 under an ice bath 69 ml of h2so4 98 was added to the beaker 3 0 g of graphite flakes and 1 5 g of sodium nitrate were added and the mixture was stirred and cooled to 0 c subsequently 9 0 g kmno4 was added slowly with different batches at a reaction temperature below 20 c with stirring for 15 min following this the temperature was gradually raised to 35 c for 30 min whilst stirring continuously then 138 ml of deionized water was slowly added heated to 98 c and stirred for 15 min before the heating source was turned off finally the mixture was cooled in a water bath for 10 min and 420 ml deionized water and 3 ml h2o2 30 were added for stirring and cooling at room temperature following filtration centrifugation and dialysis of washing until its ph was reached neutral the product was dispersed in water at a concentration of 1 g l with ultrasonic for 60 min and freeze dried to obtain go 2 2 2 synthesis of co n go catalyst the preparation method of co n go catalyst had reported in the literature 33 34 a solution of 100 mg of go and 50 mg of melamine was dispersed for 2 h by ultrasonic method in 50 ml of deionized water then 1 ml of a 3 g l co no3 6h2o solution was added to the mixture which was dispersed by ultrasonic for 20 min and was subsequently freeze dried for 24 h after heating to 800 c with a rate of 5 c per minute under a nitrogen atmosphere and holding it for 60 min the product was denoted as co n go catalyst the preparation process of the catalyst has been shown in scheme 1 2 3 preparation of electrodes dissolve 6 mg of different catalytic materials go n go co n go in anhydrous ethanol containing 5 nafion and ultrasonic treatment for 20 min to achieve a uniformly distributed solution similar to ink carbon paper with effective area of 4 cm2 2 cm 2 cm was served as the working electrode carrier the catalyst dispersion was coated on the carbon paper substrate and dried under infrared lamp to obtain the working electrode 2 4 bath experiments all experiments on the degradation of phenol were conducted in a single chamber reactor unless otherwise stated the reaction temperature was 298 15 k and the stable current was provided by the lightning magnetic dj8 292 inesa scientific instrument co ltd double potentiostat a carbon paper electrode was modified with a catalyst as the working electrode the platinum sheet as the opposite electrode and the distance was 2 cm the volume of electrolyte was 60 ml and phenol with a concentration of 100 mg l na2so4 solution 50 mm was used as a supporting electrolyte the electrolyte was stirred with magnetic force at 200 rpm to avoid concentration polarization 1 00 ml of reaction solution was taken from the cathode chamber every hour to analysis during the reaction process stirred continuously to avoid concentration polarization and continuously pumped o2 into the electrolyte at a constant flow rate except for the experiment to explore the effect of ph the initial ph remained unchanged and all conditions were neutral the investigations such as degradation experiments influence factor experiments quenching experiments were carried out in triplicate to explore the catalytic performance of co n go electrode under different conditions different influencing factors were set up such as different current densities 5 00 7 25 ma cm2 initial ph 2 0 12 5 the detailed analysis has made in the results and discussion section 2 5 characterization and analysis 2 5 1 characterization the morphology and

analysis of phenol was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc for detailed parameter setting and data analysis refer to text s2 in supplementary information the intermediates of phenol degradation were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry the details were shown in supplementary information of text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 microstructure characterization the sem tem hr tem and mapping tests were employed to reveal the microstructure and composition of the co n go modified cathode the sem images show no significant difference in go n go and co n go at the size of 2 um fig 1 a c which was similar to the morphology of graphene oxide with layered folded and smooth surfaces when scaled up to 500 nm go n go had no change fig 1 d and e while granular protrusions could be observed on co n go surface fig 1 f which may be due to the agglomeration of cobalt during high temperature pyrolysis combined with tem mapping analysis fig 2 d it was found that the granular protrusions were consistent with co element and the results were consistent with sem analysis tem image shows obvious black small agglomerated particles fig 2 a and the formed small agglomerated particles were co metal nanoparticles also it could be seen from the grain size distribution histogram fig 2 c that the average particle size of co in the catalyst was close to 27 0 nm this may be due to the fact that the go material inhibits co agglomeration to a certain extent and promotes the dispersion of co metal the presence of nanoparticles contributes to the improvement of catalytic activity because the interface between metal nanoparticles and carriers could cause electron redistribution promote charge transfer and further improve catalytic activity it can be seen from the hr tem pattern that there were obvious metal lattice fringes on co n go modified cathode fig 2 b the lattice fringe spacing was 0 214 nm and belongs to the 102 crystal plane of co combined with fig 2 d it was proved that co c n and o elements coexist in the catalyst structure in addition tem mapping also confirmed that co clusters occurred during the doping process which was consistent with sem and tem analysis the transformation of physicochemical properties caused by pyrolysis can significantly affect the efficiency of the working electrode the content of n and co was 5 00 and 0 41 in co n go respectively it is also demonstrated that the two elements n and co were successfully doped and loaded as shown in fig 3 in the spectrogram of c 1s fig 3 a the characteristic peaks at 284 7 ev 285 5 ev and 287 5 ev belonged to cc cn and co structures respectively the main peak at 284 7 ev c c corresponding to graphite c sp2 structure appeared in the c 1s spectrum 35 indicating that go was successfully prepared as a carrier of nitrogen and cobalt the n 1s spectrum fig 3 b could be divided into five different types of n species such as pyridine n 397 9 ev co nx 398 5 ev pyrrole n 400 0 ev graphite n 401 2 ev and oxidized n 402 6 ev 33 36 pyridine n and co nx species accounted for 44 32 of the total n species reports indicated that pyridine n and co nx were the active sites for h2o2 production while pyridine n was considered as the active site for h2o2 to generate oh 37 38 in the spectrum of co 2p fig 3 c the two characteristic peaks at 779 7 ev and 795 1 ev belonged to the co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 which directly proved the interaction between co and carrier and also attested the successful doping of co the other two characteristic peaks at 787 9 ev and 804 8 ev belonged to satellite peaks 39 fig 3 d showed the xrd patterns of go modified cathode n go modified cathode and co n go modified cathode in the xrd pattern of different catalysts found that the peak for amorphous carbon steamed bun peak of 26 0 the diffraction peak of 31 0 was belongs to the 003 of graphite 3r pdf 26 1079 crystal plane of graphite carbon the diffraction peaks at 38 1 and 51 1 correspond to the crystal planes of 104 in coco3 pdf 11 0692 and 111 in cocx pdf 44 0962 indicating that co had successfully anchored in co n go catalyst in addition the diffraction peak of co was not obvious which may be due to the small proportion of co loading 3 2 electro fenton degradation of phenol 3 2 1 properties of different catalysts in order to explore the degradation performance of phenol by working electrodes modified by different materials go n go and co n go were coated on carbon paper as the working electrode the electro fenton degradation experiments of phenol were carried out under the conditions of ph 6 9 and current density was 7 50 ma cm2 as disclosed in fig 4 a the phenol removal rate on the n go modified working electrode was 68 43 within 4 h while the value was only 57 95 with go modified working electrode this indicated the doping of n could contribute to the improvement of the electro catalytic performance which was consistent with previous reports that graphite n was the active site of h2o2 production and pyridine n was the active site of h2o2 activation 37 it was worth noting that when co was doped the performance catalytic degradation of phenol by the co n go modified working electrode was greatly improved and the removal rate reached 97 00 after 4 h of reaction this indicated the introduction of co plays an important role in improving the performance of electro fenton catalyst after exponential fitting phenol degradation rate y varies exponentially with x test s2 of eq 1 and y also depends on parameters a and b in which b has a greater influence the reaction rate of co n go b 2 46 was obviously better than go b 1 55 and n go b 1 63 which shown that the reaction rate gradually increasing fig 4d 3 2 2 influence of applied current the magnitude of current density is an important parameter of hetero ef technology the removal rates of phenol under different current densities were shown in fig 4 b when the current density was 5 00 ma cm2 and 6 25 ma cm2 the removal rates of phenol were only 55 49 and 81 76 after 4 h of reaction and the corresponding values of cod removal rates were 43 61 and 44 44 fig s1 when the current density increased to 7 50 ma cm2 the removal rate of phenol and cod were up to 97 00 and 91 51 the exponential fitting curve showed that when the current density increased to 7 50 ma cm2 b 2 46 the degradation rate of phenol has significantly accelerated fig 4e it has proved that with the increase of current the increasing current was conducive to generating a large amount of h2o2 and activated h2o2 to generate more oh to attack substrates 14 40 since the higher current density intensified electron transfer and promoted the process of oxygen reduction in addition the mineralization current efficiency mce of phenol under different applied currents was also investigated fig s2 when the current density was 5 00 ma cm2 6 25 ma cm2 and 7 50 ma cm2 the mce of phenol was 51 90 43 61 and 95 00 respectively it could know that when the current density was 7 5 ma cm2 the mineralization current efficiency of phenol was also the maximum 3 2 3 influence of initial ph when h2o2 was generated and excited to form oh the influence of ph of reaction solution could not be ignored as shown in fig 4 c when initial ph values were set to 2 0 4 5 6 9 9 0 11 0 and 12 5 the removal rates of phenol were 100 97 52 97 00 77 98 56 45 and 39 49 within 4 h respectively the cod removals with different initial ph values were 100 95 52 91 51 65 76 51 77 and 28 56 fig s3 it was observed that when ph increased from 2 0 to 6 9 the removal rate only decreased by 3 00 showing that the hetero ef system had strong adaptability to ph of solution it was illustrated that acidic conditions were conducive to phenol removal and cod reduction which may be because the increase of h content in the solution is conducive to the formation of h2o2 41 the exponential analysis of degradation reactions at different ph was 2 0 4 5 6 9 11 0 and 12 5 the value of b was 2 40 2 15 2 46 1 62 1 23 and 0 91 respectively fig 4f the results indicated that the degradation rate of hetero ef under acidic conditions was significantly better than that under alkaline conditions due to the higher content of h was conducive to generate h2o2 and the oxidation capacity of oh near neutral was weaker than acidic when ph was over 6 9 oh would rapidly convert to conjugate base o which reaction rate was lower than oh 42 meanwhile ph has monitored during the reaction fig s4 when ph was 2 0 and 4 5 the ph change was not obvious while in neutral or basic conditions 6 9 9 0 ph has decreased signally because carboxylic acid formic acid acetic acid has formed in the degradation process of phenol 43 44 when alkali was over ph changed weakly and consistent with the results of poor degrade under alkaline conditions it indicated that the reaction rate has gradually accelerated because of the ph change of the reaction system which was consistent with the kinetic fitting results in addition under the ph of 7 the removal rate of phenol and cod was still up to 56 45 and 51 77 respectively because h2o2 was activated by catalytic site on the working electrode surface to produce reactive oxygen radicals such as oh and ho2 45 these free radicals reacted with phenol and degraded into derivatives or minerals the applicable ph of the reaction system was 3 9 basically covering the ph range of different sewage however considering that the ph standard of environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 is 6 9 so the initial ph in reaction systems were 6 9 unless otherwise stated 3 3 durability of the co n go electrode the stability of co n go modified cathode was verified by repeated experiments with the same experimental parameters the experimental results were shown in fig 5 after eight repeated experiments the removal rate of phenol still reached 90 71 after 4 h of reaction it was only 6 29 less efficient than the fresh co n go modified cathode 97 00 the results showed that the co n go cathode has the sustainable utilization and stability were outstanding in the electro fenton system 3 4 comparison with other aops the cost of the wastewater treatment system is a very important parameter the main operational cost of hetero ef process included electrode material and energy consumption the cost of cobalt as electrode material was assumed to be 2 91 kg and energy consumed was approximately estimated at a cost of 0 071 kwh for hetero ef process the operational costs were 0 94 kg phenol and 0 32 kg cod respectively at optimum conditions for conventional fenton process the operational costs were 1 34 kg phenol 1 85 kg cod respectively at optimum conditions 46 a comparison of some related results of the removal of phenol and its products by different advanced oxidation technologies has shown in table 1 during the fenton reaction hydrogen peroxide was catalyzed by ferrous ions to produce hydroxyl radicals that required the addition of activated metal ions and oxidants which leads to a high economic cost 47 49 however the heterogeneous catalytic system does not need additional oxidants and has high repeatability so it has better economic benefits and application prospects 50 51 overall this work has the advantages of excellent catalytic performance high repeatability and good economic benefits 3 5 mechanism of phenol degradation 3 5 1 recognition of oxidation mechanism the reactive oxygen species involved in phenol degradation were identified by quenching experiments and epr analysis in general the common oxidation mechanisms in the hetero ef system include 1o2 oh and o2 corresponding oxidation effects can be quenched by furfurylalcohol ffa tert butanol tba and p benzoquinone p bq respectively as shown in fig 6a the removal rate of phenol reached 97 00 without adding any scavengers within 4 h after adding tba 600 mm the removal rate decreased to 73 24 indicating that oh was generated and contributed to phenol degradation in the hetero ef system with co n go modified cathode when 2 mm p bq was added to the hetero ef system fig 6b the removal rate reached 82 02 even though the concentration continued to increase until 10 mm the removal rate was still 79 34 indicating that o2 had a limited inhibitory effect on phenol removal meanwhile the removal of phenol was significantly inhibited by the addition of ffa fig 6c the removal rate was 41 72 when 10 mm ffa was introduced into the reaction system when the concentration of ffa increased to 50 mm the removal rate was decreased rapidly to 18 22 which indicated that 1o2 was dominant in the hetero ef system of co n go further analysis showed that when added ffa to 50 mm the degradation rate of phenol was only 18 22 which was consistent with the inhibition effect of oh on phenol degradation in the presence of tba indicating that ffa almost completely quenching the catalytic oxidation of other reactive oxygen species except oh in the heterogeneous system the quenching experiments show that in the n go electrode catalytic system fig s5 as shown in fig s6 the hydroxyl free radical has almost no effect 5 06 the hydroxyl free radical has a contribution to degrade phenol 44 62 in co n go electrode catalytic system which further indicates that co nx was the active site of hydrogen peroxide generation thus producing certain hydroxyl free radical for the degradation of phenol to confirm the existence of 1o2 oh and o2 in hetero ef systems temp and dmpo were used as traps for epr experiments fig 6d f the quartet lines of dmpo oh and dmpo o2 had been detected with characteristic peak intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 which verified that oh and o2 generated in the hetero ef system 52 53 in addition the typical three state spectrum of temp 1o2 with the characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 was also observed 22 and the peak intensity was relatively obvious indicating that the hetero ef system of co n go could produce 1o2 with relatively high output 3 5 2 analysis the source of reactive oxygen species in ef system oh was mainly derived from the reduction of h2o2 and o2 directly generated o2 through electron transfer during the electrochemical reaction o2 was reduced to h2o2 through an important 2e orr mechanism with the ooh as intermediate 54 55 studies have proved that graphene has the two dimensional structure of sp2 hybrid and has a large specific surface area and electrical conductivity which could effectively promote the process of electron transfer to contributing to produce h2o2 56 59 in this study using go as the carrier the co doped hetero atomic nitrogen and transition metal cobalt induced the formation of different n species fig 3 previous studies have reported that graphite n could promote the 2e orr process and co nx exhibited great potential for acidic h2o2 electro synthesis via a dominated 2e orr pathway 60 63 which were all conducive to the rapid production of h2o2 subsequently h2o2 formed through above processes could be activated on the surface of the catalyst to produce oh or it could be further reduced to oh by the production of intermediate oh through e pathway in the electro catalytic process 64 65 at the same time part of o2 was converted to o2 by single electron reduction reaction with the co n go modified electrode 66 the quenching results and epr experiments have testified that 1o2 played a dominant role in the hetero ef system with the co n go cathode in order to investigate the source of 1o2 we carried out aeration experiments under different conditions fig s7 the removal efficiency of phenol was 97 00 within 4 h under the condition of o2 while the value was only 75 32 when n2 was introduced these results indicated that dissolved oxygen do in the reaction system was involved in the formation of 1o2 some studies have verified that the conjugated structure of carbon and nitrogen materials may involve energy transfer between excited three state excitons and ground state oxygen molecules during the generation of 1o2 67 moreover do could be transformed into 1o2 by discharge or chemical reaction in the hetero ef system 68 therefore in the hetero ef system with co n go modified electrode the conjugated structure of n doped go promoted the formation of 1o2 what s interesting was that when nitrogen was successfully introduced the degradation efficiency of phenol was still up to 75 32 which suggested that 1o2 possessed other sources besides do in combination with the experimental analysis of the influence factors the current density has an obvious influence on the catalytic degradation performance fig 4b higher current density could affect the generation and decomposition of h2o2 into oh thus affecting the generation of reactive oxygen species thus the production of reactive oxygen species could be control by regulating the content of do in the reaction system and the amount of current given in combination with above quenching and epr experiments oh and o2 almost do not participate in phenol degradation but exhibited relatively obvious characteristic peaks we believe that only part of oh and o2 produced in the reaction system were used for direct oxidation of phenol and part of them contributed to the transformation of 1o2 also previous studies have revealed the reaction between oh and o2 or through the reaction between o2 and h2o2 could to produce 1o2 16 19 69 70 based on the above mechanism exploration 1o2 dominated the degradation of phenol in the hetero ef system with co n go modified electrode its main sources include do transformation and subsequent reactions involving oh and o2 in particular the conjugate structure of the co n go modified electrode could promote energy transfer between excited three state excitons and ground state oxygen molecules during the generation of 1o2 eq 1 71 73 in addition the main source of oh was the reduction of h2o2 eqs 2 3 when transition metals cobalt and hetero atomic nitrogen were introduced the produced co nx and graphite n jointly promoted h2o2 electro synthesis via a dominated 2e orr pathway 74 75 which further enhanced the formation of oh eqs 4 5 meanwhile do diffused to the surface and interior of the co n go working electrode and then o2 was generated by e reduction of o2 eqs 6 subsequently part of oh and o2 produced in the reaction system were used for direct oxidation of phenol and part of them contributed to the transformation of 1o2 eqs 7 8 scheme 2 1 o 2 energy transfer

hetero ef system was inferred from the determination of intermediates in the phenol degradation process by gc ms table s1 the oxidation of phenol was usually gradual firstly h2o2 and oh attack phenol to produce benzenediol catechol hydroquinone and degraded by reactive oxygen species 1o2 o2 to form benzoquinone subsequently the benzoquinone undergoes a ring opening reaction to produce micro molecular species such as succinic acid finally the micro molecular species were completely oxidized to co2 and h2o based on the test results of gc ms and relevant references the possible pathways of phenol degradation were proposed fig 7 4 conclusion in this study cobalt and nitrogen co doped go modified cathode was synthesized and used to construct hetero ef system on the basis of the experimental results we came to the following conclusions 1 the results of series characterization experiment sem hr tem xps confirmed that co and n have been successfully incorporated into go and various n species such as co nx and graphite n have emerged to improve the work performance of modified co n go cathode 2 hetero ef system with co n go cathode achieved efficient removal of phenol in a wide range of ph 2 9 after eight consecutive cycles the modified cathode still exhibited high work performance 3 the results of the quench tests and epr analysis indicated that 1o2 oh and o2 participated in the degradation of phenol in hetero ef system 1o2 played a crucial role in the degradation of phenol meanwhile 1o2 mainly came from the following ways 1 dissolved oxygen via electron transfer reaction 2 reactive oxygen species reacted to produce 1o2 and o2 was the main intermediate involved in the reaction in brief the conjugate structure formed by the introduction of n on the cathode material promoted the electron transfer process which was conducive to the conversion of do to 1o2 co nx and graphite n enhanced the generation of oh and o2 by promoting the generation of h2o2
