23115,two distinct computational procedures based on semi empirical and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans computations are presented to estimate towline forces applied by tractor type escort tugs the crucial part of both techniques is to calculate the hydrodynamic forces generated by the hull and appendages of the escort tug the escort performance is characterised by the components of the towline force namely steering and braking forces which can be estimated easily from the quasi static equilibrium condition in the semi empirical approach the hydrodynamic forces are represented by a set of manoeuvring derivatives which are obtained by regression equations based on model test measurements or full scale test results this technique is quite simple and only requires basic design parameters but ignores the details of the hull and appendage geometries and only suitable to be used for the yaw angles up to the stall angle the rans based approach however is complex and requires detailed hull and appendage geometries but takes the local flow characteristics into consideration these techniques are proposed to be used at the different stages of the design process depending on the availability of hull and appendage data keywords escort tug hydrodynamic forces rans towline forces bollard pull 1 introduction the high volume of traffic in confined waterways such as the strait of istanbul bosphorus increases the possibility of collisions and groundings with major consequences including loss of lives and environmental disasters most of the collisions and groundings are caused by a loss of engine power and or rudder control and could be prevented by emergency steering provided by adequate tug escort simulator studies and actual experience in many ports and channels around the world have proved that tugs of suitable design and power are able to significantly assist in the control of laden tankers in the event of a loss of propulsion or steerage when running connected at the stern of the vessel ocimf 1997 in order to reduce the risk of ship groundings and collisions the turkish straits vessel traffic service tsvts requires that large vessels particularly those loaded with dangerous cargo shall be escorted by suitable type size and number of escort tugs this requirement is widely considered to result in a positive improvement to the safety of navigation ocimf 2007 however in some particular cases the ship operators argue that the decision about the type and number of escort tugs are taken by tsvts mainly depending on the tug operators experiences it is now widely accepted that escort tugs are the most effective way of reducing the risk of ship groundings and collisions when a large vessel loses the engine and or rudder control in confined waters while the performance of conventional tugs could be represented by a single measure bollard pull which is mainly related with the engine power the performance of escort tugs depends on many factors including the hull and skeg geometry the location of the propellers and the towing staple and the stability characteristics the grounding of large tankers with dramatic environmental consequences has resulted in the emerging of research programs for designing escort tugs that are capable of rendering effective braking and steering assistance to large tankers operating in restricted waters dabbar and morgan 1996 hensen 1997 hutchison et al 1993 jagannathan et al 1995 sturmhöfel and bartels 1993 one of the earliest of these research programs included planar force model tests with a 7200 bhp tractor tug design a significant finding from these tests was that the hydrodynamic interaction was small between the flow around the hull and the propeller induced flow this finding enabled the development of escort performance simulations based on equilibrium conditions on the horizontal plane hutchison et al 1993 an extensive model test program was conducted by allan 2000 to investigate a series of hull forms and associated appendages which can be adapted to escort tugs with either cycloidal or azimuth stern drive propulsion to develop an efficient escort tug design with a capability of generating 150 tons of escort steering force initial tests indicated that the predicted forces could not be achieved mainly due to a shift to the aft in the position of the centre of lateral resistance clr through the significant angles of attack to meet the design target steering force the design of the skeg was increased and the clr shifted forward by about 2 the second series of tests were then performed on the modified skeg design which showed that at 10 knots the tug can obtain a maximum steering force of 150 tons molyneux 2003 conducted further tests with a 1 18 scale model of the same tractor type escort tug design to obtain lift and drag forces for the hull in combination with different appendages which included the case of the hull with and without the fin the range of ship speeds was from 4 to 12 knots with model speeds based on froude scaling the model was fixed at the required yaw angle and the measurements were made of surge force fore and aft sway forces and yaw moment using a planar motion mechanism pmm the model was free to roll about the axis through the towing staple and free to pitch and heave at the high speeds of 10 and 12 knots yaw angles tested varied from a small negative value to approximately 45 for speeds of 4 6 and 8 knots yaw angles varied from a small negative value to 105 it was concluded that the free surface wave effects were small for the range of speeds typically found in escort tug operation allan and molyneux 2007 presented the results of scaled model experiments with three different type of escort tugs representing voith tractor azimuth stern drive asd and z drive tractor 1 18 scaled models of each tug were constructed the aim of these experiments was to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments generated by the various hulls and appendages no propulsion units were fitted and a wide range of yaw angles likely to be encountered during escort operation was covered the models were fixed at a given yaw angle during the tests and measurements made for the surge and sway forces and yaw moment for the range of operating speeds and yaw angles the speeds tested corresponded to 4 6 8 10 and 12 knots in full scale the steering and braking force coefficients and the position of the centre of lateral resistance were measured and compared for different types of tugs model tests have proven to be extremely useful in designing hull and appendages of escort tugs however excessive time and cost requirements have limited their applications in the early stages of the design process the emergence of computational fluid dynamics cfd has provided designers a more practical tool to facilitate early design performance studies molyneux 2007 and molyneux and bose 2008 used a commercial reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver with k ω turbulence model to predict the forces and flow patterns around the hull of a 39 m voith tractor type escort tug the predictions were compared with data from model experiments with a pmm conducted by molyneux 2007 a hexahedral mesh was found to be most suitable for predicting the escort forces resulting in calculated forces that on average were within 5 6 of measured values and never exceeded 10 the largest discrepancy occurred at high yaw angles of 60 the study neglected the free surface effects on the basis that the effect of the free surface on the forces measured in the model experiments were small jahra et al 2015 also investigated the hydrodynamic forces and moments of the same escort tug at steady oblique flow conditions using a commercial rans solver with k ε turbulence model the free surface was modelled using the volume of fluid vof approach for calm water condition the hull was assumed fixed in space with an even keel the rans solver predictions were compared with the experimental measurements at 15 30 and 45 yaw angles at 15 and 30 flow conditions a reasonable agreement between the measurement and the predicted results was achieved but it was found that the rans solver prediction underestimated the sway forces for the 45 heading this was considered to be due to the turbulence model used in the computational method which was not suitable for predicting the highly separated flows observed at yaw angles of approximately 30 and higher smoker et al 2016 used commercial viscous flow solver package with k ε turbulence model to predict lift and drag forces at large yaw angles of the same escort tug model used by molyneux 2007 in these simulations the model was free to heave but was set at a fixed roll angle a range of simulations was performed for yaw angles ranging from 0 to 45 and calculated lift and drag forces were compared against escort model tests the computational results for maximum lift were within 2 of the experimental values with the same stall angle of approximately 37 predicted in both cases the calculated drag force was consistently within 10 of the model test values however the cfd simulations increasingly underpredicted the drag force as the yaw angle increased once flow separation had occurred above about 37 the predicted lift and drag forces were significantly below the model test forces reliable estimation of hydrodynamic forces by model tests or computational methods enabled the development of numerical models to estimate the escort performance characterised by the steering and braking forces applied by the tug waclawek and molyneux 2000 ratcliff 2003 these numerical models in general are based on basic design characteristics related to the tug s hull appendages and the propulsion parameters in these models in general the hull appendages and thrusters are considered separately and the interactions between them are omitted due to the difficulties in dealing with the complex flow characteristics around the tug particularly at higher speeds and large yaw angles to investigate the interaction between thrusters brandner and renilson 1998 conducted a series of experiments and measured the forces acting on two thrusters for a range of relative positions the results showed that forces from the trailing thruster are heavily affected by interaction particularly due to impingement of the race from the leading thruster whereas forces from the latter remained essentially unaffected despite its proximity to the former a major contribution in the prediction of the performance of vertical axis propellers in escort conditions is due to molyneux and waclawek 2001 in which regression equations were presented enabling practical estimation of the effective thrust force and its direction bilici et al 2016 presented two distinct computational methodologies based on semi empirical and rans based approaches to practically estimate the maximum achievable steering and braking forces depending on the escort tug configuration as well as the type and speed of the escort operation in order to validate the hydrodynamic force calculations model test results of a voith schneider propeller vsp equipped tractor type escort tug ajax presented by molyneux 2007 were used comparison of these measurements with those predicted by the semi empirical and rans based computational methodologies indicated that both procedures provide an acceptable level of correlation particularly at the lower range of yaw angles this paper presents a further and extended application of the above mentioned study bilici et al 2016 which was based on limited tug geometric particulars available in the open literature to test the predictive capability of the semi empirical and rans based methods with an escort tug configuration representing state of the art design features it is shown that the steering and braking forces generated by an escort tug can be determined by using the components of the thrust force and the hydrodynamic forces i e the lift and drag forces therefore the crucial part of the methodology is to predict the hydrodynamic forces due to the tug s hull and skeg the hydrodynamic hull forces can easily be estimated by a set of manoeuvring derivatives which are obtained by reliable semi empirical methods based on model test measurements or full scale test results the lift and drag forces due to the skeg can also be estimated by empirical methods based on experiments conducted with low aspect ratio wing sections however this semi empirical approach is basically suitable to be used for the yaw angles up to the stall angle and ignores the effect of local flow characteristics hence these estimates need to be validated by a more reliable computational method particularly based on the solution of the viscous turbulent flow field the study also includes the investigation of the effects of free surface and heel angle on the lift and drag forces for critical yaw angles in order to determine the significance of these aspects another difficulty in the prediction of performance of escort tugs is the estimation of the thrust forces at specific escort speeds and yaw angles this is a problem due to the complex flow characteristics and interactions between the thrusters hull and appendages in this study the regression equations of molyneux and waclawek 2001 to predict the force created by the propulsion system and its direction were used finally the results of the hydrodynamic and thrust force calculations were used to estimate the steering and braking forces applied by a full scale escort tug 2 steering and braking forces in order to assess the performance of an escort tug the maximum achievable steering and braking forces should be accurately predicted for the range of escort speeds the primary forces acting on a tractor type escort tug in pure and powered indirect modes are shown in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively with reference to the tug centre of pressure the escort tug applies force to the escorted ship through the towline the escort braking force f b is the streamwise component of the towline force and mainly affected by drag force the escort steering force f s on the other hand is the transverse component of the towline force and particularly caused by hydrodynamic lift force the steering and braking force components depend on the towline force t and the towline angle δ as follows 1 f s t s i n δ f b t c o s δ the ratio of the braking force to the steering force will vary depending on the yaw angle of the tug relative to the centreline α and the towline angle δ a properly designed escort tug hull and skeg can generate significant hydrodynamic lift which would result in high steering and braking forces in indirect mode escort tugs can be operated in various modes depending on the speed of the assisted vessel at lower speeds typically below 6 knots the tug uses the thrust force generated by its propulsion system to retard or steer the assisted vessel this type of operation is called the direct mode and can also be achieved by conventional tugs at higher speeds particularly at speeds over 8 knots properly designed and equipped escort tugs use the advantage of special propulsion systems to generate hydrodynamic forces by letting the assisted vessel to drag the tug through the towline with an angle of attack with respect to the centreline of the assisted vessel this type of operation is called indirect mode because the towline force is augmented by the hydrodynamic force generated by the tug s hull and skeg depending on the role of the tug s propulsion system the indirect mode can be applied in a pure or powered mode in the pure indirect mode the thruster force is perpendicular to the centreline of the tug and the propulsion unit generates only required amount of power to maintain a specific yaw angle in powered indirect mode however maximum available thrust power is used to achieve and maintain the largest possible yaw angle to generate maximum steering force in this mode towline forces generally exceed the tug s rated bollard pull in essence the direct mode relies purely on the thrust force the pure indirect mode takes advantage of the hydrodynamic effects of the tug s hull and skeg with minimum thrust and the powered indirect mode uses both hydrodynamic effects and maximum available thrust power jagannathan et al 1995 as shown in fig 1 a in the pure indirect mode the thrust force acts only in the transverse direction to maintain a specific yaw angle in order to determine the towline and thrust forces the forces are balanced in the x and y directions and the yaw moment about the centre of pressure as shown in fig 2 resulting in the following set of equations 2 p l h l t l 0 3 p t h t t t 0 4 m p t d 1 t t d 2 0 where p t transverse component of the thrust force normal to tug s centreline p l longitudinal component of the thrust force parallel to tug s centreline t t transverse component of the towline force normal to tug s centreline t l longitudinal component of the towline force parallel to tug s centreline h l transverse component of the hydrodynamic force normal to tug s centreline h t longitudinal component of the hydrodynamic force parallel to tug s centreline m yawing moment d 1 longitudinal distance from thrusters to the centre of hydrodynamic force d 2 longitudinal distance from towing staple to the centre of hydrodynamic force in pure indirect mode the longitudinal component of the thrust force is zero then from equation 2 5 t l h l and from equation 3 6 t t h t p t substituting into equation 4 p t can be calculated as follows 7 p t m h t d 2 d 1 d 2 in the pure indirect mode only a small fraction of the total thrust power is needed to maintain the set yaw angle hence this mode enables an assessment of the effect of different hull and skeg geometries on escort performance independent of the maximum available thrust in order to increase the steering force while keeping the yaw angle constant the tug must increase the thrust power to maximum available this mode of operation is called the powered indirect mode as illustrated in fig 1 b the transverse component of thrust force can be calculated in a similar manner as in the pure indirect mode equation 7 in the powered indirect mode the tug is assumed to be using the maximum available thrust power hence the longitudinal component of the thrust force is 8 p l t d 2 p t 2 where t d represents the dynamic thrust force which is equal to bollard pull in static conditions however as the speed and yaw angle change the dynamic thrust force and its direction may dramatically change in order to determine the dynamic thrust force a set of regression equations based on model tests with tractor type escort tugs are used details of this procedure is given in section 6 the transverse component of the towline force is given in equation 6 and the longitudinal component of the towline force can be easily determined as follows 9 t l h l p l in order to obtain the steering and braking forces towline force components should be transformed from the local tug coordinate system to the global coordinate system as follows 10 f s t t cos α t l sin α 11 f b t t sin α t l cos α longitudinal and transverse components of the hydrodynamic forces h l and h t can be easily obtained from the lift and drag forces f l and f d using the following formulas 12 h l f l sin α f d cos α 13 h t f d sin α f l cos α 3 hydrodynamic forces flow around an escort tug in indirect mode is significantly affected by viscosity because of the adverse pressure gradients flow separations increase with the increasing yaw angles both cross flow pressures and circulatory forces exist in typical problems of performance prediction of the escort vessels thus viscous modelling is the most critical part of the methodology and requires a meticulous study for an escort tug in static drift motion assuming no heave pitch motion the hydrodynamic forces can be expressed as function of longitudinal and lateral velocity components and speed independent coefficients called hydrodynamic derivatives as follows 14 surge f x ρ 2 l 2 x u u u u x v v v 2 15 sway f y ρ 2 l 2 y v u v y v v v v 16 y a w n ρ 2 l 3 n v u v n v v v v the hydrodynamic force in pure surge motion can be considered to be the same as the total resistance and can be calculated from ittc formulation the linear component of the transverse force y v is a lift curve slope appropriate to the small angle of incidence while the nonlinear term y v v is called the cross drag coefficient determined for specific drift angle range these coefficients depend on the hull geometry and the reynolds number and can be determined from captive model tests the linear coefficient y v can also be estimated rather reliably by empirical methods based on model test results an empirical formula for conventional ship forms is given by ankudinov 1985 17 y v π t l 2 0 25 c b b t 2 1 5 c b b t 3 45 at larger angles the side force is dominated by cross flow and hence much more difficult to be predicted the cross drag coefficient y v v can be defined on the base of the ship lateral area at large incidence angle and can be estimated by the following empirical formula ankudinov 1985 18 y v v t l 1 1 0 0045 l t 0 27 b t 0 016 b t 2 for the yaw moment similar formulas are available ankudinov 1985 19 n v π t l 2 0 75 0 04 c b b π t 20 n v v 0 75 n v the performance of an escort tug is significantly influenced by the skeg geometry a properly designed skeg generates considerable lift and drag forces which contribute to the maximum attainable steering and braking forces the lift force generated by the skeg depends on the yaw angle and up to the stall angle the skeg lift coefficient c ls can be determined according to whicker and fehlner 1958 21 c l s c l s β β 57 3 c d c a r e β 57 3 2 where β is the sideslip angle and the slope of the lift curve is given by 22 c l s β 1 8 π a r e 1 8 c o s λ a r e 2 cos 4 λ 4 where λ is the sweep of quarter chord line the effective aspect ratio ar e is defined as follows 23 a r e 2 b 2 a l s where b is the span and a ls is the lateral area of the skeg the cross flow drag coefficient c dc for a square tip skeg is given by 24 c d c 0 1 1 6 λ where λ is the taper ratio for yaw angles up to the stall angle the drag coefficient c ds can be calculated according to whicker and fehlner 1958 25 c d s 0 0065 c l s 2 0 9 π a r e 4 tug particulars in order to demonstrate the application of escort performance prediction procedure a typical voith tractor escort tug designed for escort operations in the straits of marmara is considered the particulars of this voith tractor escort tug are given in table 1 the hull form is shown in fig 3 the vessel is fitted with a skeg based on naca 0012 series profile geometry 5 rans computations 5 1 computational model and boundary conditions the rans computations were carried out with a 1 10 model scale of presented escort tug the lines plan of the hull was used to generate the three dimensional solid geometry while the propulsion cage of the tug was ignored according to the selected cartesian system the aft starboard and upper side of the hull were pointed towards x y and z directions respectively the fore end of the waterline was set as the origin location a relatively large solution domain was generated since the hull acts as a significantly bluff body for the high yaw angle cases in accordance with this the computational boundaries at the inlets outlets and bottom were placed at 4 l 6 l 12 l and 3 l respectively from the hull where l implies the model length fig 4 since the free surface effects were not taken into consideration in the simulations the top boundary was placed at a height that corresponds to the scantling draught of the tug the computational mesh was generated with a well known cut cell technique which is a type of non matching block unstructured volume mesh generation method for the generation of the mesh structure star ccm 11 06 software package was utilised in this method whilst both triangular and quadrilateral elements are used in the surface mesh structure the hexahedral cells dominate the solution domain the near wall region also involves tetrahedral elements the technique provides a relatively simple and quick mesh generation solution in which several local mesh refinement blocks can also be effectively specified a view of the generated volume mesh is shown in fig 5 in order to reduce the computational resource requirements and obtain a quick solution the y value of the first cell adjacent to the outer surface of the solid body was kept around 50 for the most part of the hull and skeg where y represents a non dimensional distance from the wall which is described as follows 26 y y u τ ϑ in this equation y u τ ϑ imply the distance from the wall friction velocity and kinematic viscosity respectively since this approach basically requires the use of the law of the wall the placement of 15 20 cells in the boundary layer was adequate to accurately model the near wall region for practical purposes instead of generating different volume meshes for various computational cases the mesh was generated only for the zero yaw angle condition the yaw angle effects were provided by the implementation of inlet boundary condition to one of the side boundaries besides the inlet boundary in the x direction and changing the velocity components for each yaw angle cases while keeping the velocity magnitude constant at each operation speed see fig 4 however it should be noted that the generation of individual volume meshes for each case would slightly increase the solution accuracy several local refinement blocks were applied to better resolve the flow field where large changes in flow parameters were expected to occur however to facilitate the mesh generation process a symmetrical refinement structure around centreline of the tug was adopted the dimensions of the refinement zones applied can be examined in fig 6 the velocity magnitudes of 6 8 and 10 knots for the full scale tug were considered which corresponded to froude numbers fr of about 0 16 0 22 and 0 27 respectively in the study accordingly for the model scaled simulations the velocity magnitudes of 0 976 m s 1 301 m s and 1 627 m s were used the turbulence intensity level was set as 1 at the inlet boundaries at the outlet boundaries the atmospheric pressure was specified and the backflow turbulence direction was adjusted in accordance with the yaw angle finally a symmetry condition which can be interpreted as a slip wall was applied to the top and bottom boundaries 5 2 details of computations in the simulations steady incompressible rans equations wilcox 2006 were solved ansys fluent 17 2 software package was used for the computations in order to calculate the turbulence field and hence model the reynolds stresses which arise in rans equations after the averaging operation as additional unknowns the realizable k ε turbulence model shih et al 1995 that is based on the boussinesq hypothesis tennekes and lumley 1972 in conjunction with the two layer zonal model of chen and patel 1988 was used the applied model is an improved version of the standard k ε model launder and spalding 1972 when applying this turbulence model two additional transport equations for turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation should be solved the rans and aforementioned turbulence transport equations were solved by finite volume technique with a segregated algorithm blazek 2001 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 for the pressure velocity coupling a standard pressure correction procedure simple was applied patankar and spalding 1972 the second order upwind scheme was used to discretise the convective acceleration terms while the viscous terms were dealt with the second order central difference scheme pletcher et al 2013 in each case the iterations were run until the scaled residuals dropped to a level of 10 6 while the variations of the flow variables such as the hydrodynamic forces and velocities at various locations in the wake field were systematically checked in order to decide whether the convergence was achieved 5 3 grid dependence analysis in order to check whether the computational results were independent of the grid density some additional computations were carried out with three different mesh densities for the 45 yaw angle case at fr 0 22 a basic grid structure mesh a was initially generated with the mesh generation technique previously described the mesh b and mesh c were then obtained by systematically increasing the mesh resolution at each direction of the coordinate system by a factor of approximately 2 3 hence the total cell number in the domain was nearly doubled in each step the basic mesh characteristics and results for the calculated sway forces with each meshes are summarised in table 2 where average y implies the average value of y calculated for the first cells adjacent to the walls while average cell aspect ratio represents the ratio of the cell length to the cell height for the same cell the negligible difference of around 2 and 0 05 for the lift and drag forces respectively between the results of the mesh b and mesh c points out that the mesh b is suitable to carry out further simulations with various yaw angles and flow speeds the uncertainty analysis of the numerical discretisation was performed by using the grid convergence index gci method roache 1998 the procedure is explained in detail in çelik et al 2008 the resulting gci value of the mesh b for the lift force was obtained as approximately 4 0 which implies the general numerical uncertainty in this force component this uncertainty level is expected to be much lower for the yaw angles below the stall angle the final non dimensional cell sizes used in the computations in the light of the mesh dependency analysis are also given in table 3 6 results 6 1 comparative results of the hydrodynamic forces table 4 summarises the lift and drag coefficients of the tug obtained by the application of the two numerical approaches the results associated with the yaw angles higher than 40 are not shown for the semi empirical method this is due firstly to the fact that manoeuvring derivatives that are used to estimate the hydrodynamic hull forces are based on model experiments carried out for small yaw angles typically up to 20 secondly the lift and drag force coefficients of the skeg are calculated by empirical formulae that are basically valid only for the yaw angles up to the stall angle therefore the use of this method is not suitable for the yaw angles beyond the stall angle however this does not jeopardize the applicability and practicality of the semi empirical method since from the tug s operational point of view solely the yaw angles smaller than the stall angle are of interest as is clearly seen from table 4 the results associated with different froude numbers considered are almost identical for the rans method this indicates that for the speed range investigated the general character of the lift and drag forces remains nearly unchanged on the other hand as the coefficients are somewhat inherently independent from the velocity for the semi empirical method the results for the different froude numbers considered are once again very similar a graphical comparison of the semi empirically calculated lift and drag force coefficients with those obtained by the rans computations is shown in fig 7 the lift and drag coefficients are defined as follows 27 c l f l 0 5 ρ a l v 2 c d f d 0 5 ρ a l v 2 where f l and f d imply the lift and drag forces respectively al is the underwater lateral area of the hull and skeg ρ is the density of the water kg m3 and v is the speed m s of the escorted ship the figure solely presents the results obtained at fr 0 22 which corresponds to a speed of 8 knots for the full scale tug for the lift force coefficient c l the agreement is very good up to the yaw angle of 30 the difference between the results of the two methods are not greater than 4 within this range and this value slightly augments to around 9 at the yaw angle of 35 which is very close to the stall angle the stall occurs between the yaw angles of 35 and 40 according to the rans computations as mentioned previously the results of the semi empirical approach are mainly valid up to the stall angle then the results of the semi empirical method for yaw angles greater than 40 are not graphically presented the plot shows that the difference between the results of the two methods significantly increases after the stall the rans computations indicate that the lift force produced by the tug dramatically decreases after the stall it can be seen that nearly half of the maximum lift force produced can be suddenly lost within a few degrees of yaw angle this point is quite critical from the operational point of view since the lift force highly affects the steering force applied by the tug the lift force also continues to rapidly decrease in a nearly linear fashion for the larger yaw angle values however it should also be recalled that the rans computations performed did not include the effect of the free surface and heel angle of the tug which are present in the real operational situations assuming that these forces are simply unimportant up to the stall angle additional rans simulations at the yaw angles of 30 35 45 and the froude number of 0 22 including both the free surface and heel angle effects were also performed to show the validity of this assumption as the solution domain previously generated was already large it was decided to keep the dimensions of this domain for the new simulations the initial mesh resolution was also basically maintained for the underwater part of the hull form however an additional mesh refinement was applied for the zone around the free surface in the z direction the free surface mesh was also refined in the x and y directions to accurately resolve the surface deformations near the hull the well known volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 was considered for the two phase flow calculations an implicit approach was adopted for the tracking of the free surface which was performed with a high accuracy second order scheme to increase the accuracy and stability of the solution method an unsteady technique with the three time level implicit time discretisation ferziger and peric 2002 was applied a dynamically varying time step was chosen such that the maximum local courant number in the flow field was initially kept around 5 and gradually increased up to 40 as the solution evolved a heel angle of 8 was considered in the study taking the main characteristics of the tug into account the results of these simulations are also displayed in fig 7 as is seen the lift force was almost not affected by the free surface and heel effects before the stall angle and nearly identical results were obtained within this range however after the stall at the yaw angle of 45 the lift force was considerably increased by almost 79 the results of these simulations are also presented in table 4 as far as the drag force coefficient c d is concerned the predictions of the rans and semi empirical methods displayed an acceptable correlation similar to that obtained for c l the difference in the drag coefficient which generally remains around 5 is about 22 at the yaw angle of 10 after the stall the drag force first displays a horizontal movement which is then followed by a significant and continuous increase as expected the plateau around the stall is due to the substantially large decrease in the lift force obtained at the same yaw angle and associated reduction of the induced drag component perhaps interestingly the additional simulations performed which included the effect of the free surface and a heel angle indicated that the drag force behaves nearly independent of the free surface and heel angle effects as very similar values were obtained even after the stall angle the difference remained within 3 at the yaw angle of 45 the results indicate that for the conventional operational ranges which are basically up to the stall angle the practical simulations can ignore the effect of the free surface as well as that of the heel angle in an effort to rapidly and roughly estimate the hydrodynamic forces to assist the design process of an escort tug it should be noted here that the rans simulations were carried out with a 1 10 model scale of presented escort tug whilst the semi empirical calculations were used the full scale tug properties since the semi empirical method is based on non dimensional coefficients obtained from model tests the steering and braking forces can be non dimensionalised independent of the scale hence there is no effect of scaling for the semi empirical method however the model scale approach with froude similarity certainly introduces reynolds number differences between the model scale and full scale tug the differences in reynolds numbers mainly affect the energy of the boundary layer and the flow separation phenomenon basically a model scale tug involves a larger flow separation zones hence slightly larger lift and lower drag force coefficients can be generated by a full scale tug compared to the model scale tug 6 2 flow topology around the hull and skeg the fundamental structure of the flow field around the tug is briefly presented in this section benefiting from the rans simulations which do not include the free surface and heel angle effects here only the figures associated with the cases performed at fr 0 22 are given shown in fig 8 are the static pressure coefficient distributions and two dimensional 2d streamlines around the hull on two different xy planes of z l 0 and z l 0 05 for the 35 and 45 yaw angle cases as is known the 35 yaw angle case implies the flow structure just before the stall phenomenon while the 45 yaw angle case represents a post stall flow regime the substantial difference in the flow topologies is clearly apparent in the figure on both xy planes the red coloured high pressure zone around the fore end is stronger for the 45 yaw angle case as a result of the increasing incoming flow angle before the stall there exists a very low pressure or suction zone around the starboard side of the fore and which creates high lift force acting on the hull in the 45 yaw angle case however the pressure on this field increases and the low pressure zone diffuses to a much larger area due to the very large flow separation zone these explain the reason of the dramatic decrease in the lift force seen in fig 7 around the stall angle 2d streamlines around the skeg on xy plane of z l 0 12 are presented in fig 9 for the same cases the flow separation already occurs around the skeg for the 35 yaw angle case with a single vortex structure concentrated in a confined space causing a significant loss of efficiency with the increasing contribution of the drag force on the other hand the 45 yaw angle case presents an extremely large separation zone forming from two strong counter rotating vortices this indeed causes a significant loss of lift force generated fig 10 shows the flow structure around the yz plane of x l 0 28 which is located close to the trailing edge of the skeg the large organised vortex arising from the tip of the skeg which moves away from the hull and loses its strength as the yaw angle increases can be clearly observed in the figure the structure of the 3d streamlines around the tug the pressure distribution on the hull is presented in fig 11 for the 35 yaw angle case the flow separation and strong helical motion are mainly caused by the skeg geometry after the stall for the 45 yaw angle case a very large high vorticity zone which partially mixes with the vorticity generated by the aft region dominates the figure this difference in the flow regime certainly substantially affects the pressure distribution on the hull 6 3 prediction of full scale escort performance once the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and appendages are determined as described in the previous sections the performance of the escort tug in pure or powered indirect modes can be determined depending on the usage of thrust power in pure indirect mode thrusters apply a force perpendicular to the centreline of the tug in order to maintain a specific yaw angle the thrust force required for this is only a small percentage of the total thrust force available in order to increase the steering force the angle between the tug and the assisted vessel should be reduced and hence the thrust force should be increased in this way much higher steering forces may be obtained by supporting the hydrodynamic forces by the thrust power and the tug is said to be operated in the powered indirect mode as previously presented in section 2 the towline force components can be determined in both pure and powered indirect modes by balancing the forces in x and y directions and moment around the centre of pressure of the tug even though the performance of an escort tug in pure indirect mode is a convenient indicator of the general hydrodynamic performance of the tug from an operational point of view escort performance is represented by the performance in powered indirect mode where maximum available steering and braking force are achieved the steering and braking forces at different yaw angles for the given escort tug in powered indirect mode was calculated by both semi empirical and rans based approaches for three different operational speeds of 6 8 and 10 knots for the full scale tug to improve the overall prediction of the effect of the propulsion system on the results the dynamic thrust force and the angle was also taken into account in a similar way to that described in molyneux and waclawek 2001 according to this experimental work the thrust force generated by a vertical axis propeller can be significantly increased compared to that obtained at the bollard pull condition depending on the advance coefficient and the angle between the thruster and incoming flow which results in the dynamic thrust force moreover due to the tendency for the incoming flow to interact with the propulsion system the direction of the thrust force is no longer oriented with the direction of the propeller and hence a dynamic thrust angle is created as a first step the dynamic thrust forces were calculated benefiting from the regression curves given in molyneux and waclawek 2001 linear interpolation was applied for the dynamic thrust force coefficient values corresponding to the advance coefficients within those presented in that study the transverse component p t of dynamic thrust force generated by the propulsion system should be exactly equal to the force that satisfies the static balance at a specific yaw angle accordingly after the calculation of the dynamic thrust angle in a similar manner to that of the dynamic thrust force the longitudinal component p l force that corresponds to p t required was obtained interestingly the longitudinal component of the dynamic thrust force was found to be higher than the rated bollard pull of the escort tug particularly at large yaw angles the associated results are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 as it can be seen in fig 12 the steering forces predicted by both approaches are in close agreement up to the stall angle within this range at fr 0 22 the differences between the two predictions were lower than 6 3 1 on average the steering force exhibits a substantial rise depending on the operational speed for the highest operational speed the steering force produced by the tug is around twice the rated static bollard pull due to the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces it can be observed that the steering force increases almost in a linear manner up to the stall angle after the stall the steering force suddenly decreases as expected due to the rapid lift force loss as the yaw angle further increases a tendency to increase with a mild slope is apparent due to the higher contribution of the longitudinal component of the thrust force at higher yaw angles the additional simulations which included the effect of free surface and heel angle at fr 0 22 on the other hand did almost not affect the steering force predictions before the stall however at 45 yaw angle the steering force increased by around 26 due to the significant rise of the lift force obtained in this simulation the braking forces calculated by both approaches are presented in fig 13 it appears that the braking force is not as sensitive to stall phenomenon as the steering force at each speed this force decreases in a parabolic fashion with increasing yaw angle similar to that observed in the previous figure the agreement between the two approaches is good up to the stall angle which rises to 16 9 at 30 yaw angle and remains within 7 6 on average one interesting consequence is that there exists a certain yaw angle for each speed where zero braking force occurs this specific yaw angle corresponds to a towline angle of 90 and from this point on the tug begins to pull the assisted vessel rather than brake it the braking forces as they are considerably lower than the steering forces were relatively more affected by the introduction of the free surface and heel angle in the simulations whilst the differences remained within 15 before the stall it reached up to 44 at the yaw angle of 45 for fr 0 22 the simulations indicated that the omission of the effect of the free surface as well as that of the heel angle did not significantly affect the prediction of the steering and braking forces 7 concluding remarks a practical methodology based on two different approaches which can be successfully used to predict towline forces generated by tractor type escort tugs was presented in the semi empirical approach the hydrodynamic forces acting on the bare hull are estimated by using the manoeuvring derivatives obtained from model tests carried out for relatively small yaw angles up to typically 20 the lift and drag forces of the skeg are also obtained from simple empirical formulas based on the experimental tests which are basically valid up to the stall angle hence this technique is not suitable to calculate the escort performance beyond the stall angle furthermore the technique also ignores the details of the hull and appendage geometries which may significantly affect the towline force components even for the yaw angles smaller than the stall angle therefore it may be concluded that the semi empirical approach is most suitable to be used at early design stages where various design alternatives are considered the second approach on the other hand is a computational methodology based on the solution of the rans equations and suitable to be used at later stages of the design process with a wider range of yaw angles when the detailed geometrical definitions of the tug and appendages are available the calculations with both methodologies showed that the estimated lift and drag forces are in close agreement up to the stall angle the inclusion of the free surface and heel angle in the simulations slightly affected these forces however after the stall whilst the drag force still displayed minor variations the lift force obtained was significantly increased as a consequence of the inclusion of these effects a good agreement was also observed for the steering and braking forces predicted by the two methods the differences between the results of the two methods applied were around 3 1 and 7 6 on average for the steering forces and braking forces respectively up to the stall angle at fr 0 22 the additional simulations performed showed that the existence of the free surface and heel angle did not much influence the steering forces predicted before the stall at fr 0 22 however after this particular yaw angle a much higher steering force could be obtained compared to that calculated in the simulations without these effects the braking forces were relatively more affected by the introduction of the free surface and heel angle in the simulations however the differences still remained within 15 before the stall the results also indicate that very large steering forces which are much higher than the rated bollard pull of the tug can be obtained in the powered indirect mode on the other hand the braking forces tend to rapidly take negative values for the higher yaw angle operational cases the present escort performance analyses also include the influence of the dynamic thrust force and its direction which significantly changed the contribution of the propulsion force to the steering and braking forces particularly at large yaw angles the longitudinal component of the dynamic thrust force was found to be higher than the rated bollard pull of the escort tug overall the methodology with both approaches can be systematically used as a convenient tool to design highly efficient and effective tractor type tugs this methodology can also be used to investigate the effects of basic design characteristics such as the main dimensions of tug and skeg and the locations of the thrusters and towing staple the approaches presented here are basically intended to be used as rapid practical and convenient tools for the initial design stages of the escort tugs however although the results imply an adequate reliability for both methods an experimental validation involving a wide range of yaw angles operational speeds and different hull forms is clearly needed this comparative study will also provide the ability of further increasing the predictive capability of the current methods presented for this purpose the authors intend to conduct a series of experimental tests by using the new pmm system presently installed in the towing tank of istanbul technical university within the frame of a recent project katmansis involving the construction of a modern large and high speed cavitation tunnel as well as the design and application of a manoeuvring system consisting of free running and captive modes özden et al 2016 for a more extensive and detailed analysis with a more accurate and wide range performance prediction the physical operation mechanism of the tandem propulsors are also aimed to be separately analysed and then to be investigated in conjunction with the hull by means of computer simulations to understand the interaction between the propulsors and hull the future works which will not aim to achieve rapid solutions will cover fully resolved boundary layer flow calculation to more accurately capture the flow separation phenomenon particularly for the yaw angles larger than the stall angle and will also include three degrees of freedom simulations with the heave pitch and roll motions of the hull under the influence of the sea waves and towline force which are considered to be highly effective on the tugs 
23115,two distinct computational procedures based on semi empirical and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans computations are presented to estimate towline forces applied by tractor type escort tugs the crucial part of both techniques is to calculate the hydrodynamic forces generated by the hull and appendages of the escort tug the escort performance is characterised by the components of the towline force namely steering and braking forces which can be estimated easily from the quasi static equilibrium condition in the semi empirical approach the hydrodynamic forces are represented by a set of manoeuvring derivatives which are obtained by regression equations based on model test measurements or full scale test results this technique is quite simple and only requires basic design parameters but ignores the details of the hull and appendage geometries and only suitable to be used for the yaw angles up to the stall angle the rans based approach however is complex and requires detailed hull and appendage geometries but takes the local flow characteristics into consideration these techniques are proposed to be used at the different stages of the design process depending on the availability of hull and appendage data keywords escort tug hydrodynamic forces rans towline forces bollard pull 1 introduction the high volume of traffic in confined waterways such as the strait of istanbul bosphorus increases the possibility of collisions and groundings with major consequences including loss of lives and environmental disasters most of the collisions and groundings are caused by a loss of engine power and or rudder control and could be prevented by emergency steering provided by adequate tug escort simulator studies and actual experience in many ports and channels around the world have proved that tugs of suitable design and power are able to significantly assist in the control of laden tankers in the event of a loss of propulsion or steerage when running connected at the stern of the vessel ocimf 1997 in order to reduce the risk of ship groundings and collisions the turkish straits vessel traffic service tsvts requires that large vessels particularly those loaded with dangerous cargo shall be escorted by suitable type size and number of escort tugs this requirement is widely considered to result in a positive improvement to the safety of navigation ocimf 2007 however in some particular cases the ship operators argue that the decision about the type and number of escort tugs are taken by tsvts mainly depending on the tug operators experiences it is now widely accepted that escort tugs are the most effective way of reducing the risk of ship groundings and collisions when a large vessel loses the engine and or rudder control in confined waters while the performance of conventional tugs could be represented by a single measure bollard pull which is mainly related with the engine power the performance of escort tugs depends on many factors including the hull and skeg geometry the location of the propellers and the towing staple and the stability characteristics the grounding of large tankers with dramatic environmental consequences has resulted in the emerging of research programs for designing escort tugs that are capable of rendering effective braking and steering assistance to large tankers operating in restricted waters dabbar and morgan 1996 hensen 1997 hutchison et al 1993 jagannathan et al 1995 sturmhöfel and bartels 1993 one of the earliest of these research programs included planar force model tests with a 7200 bhp tractor tug design a significant finding from these tests was that the hydrodynamic interaction was small between the flow around the hull and the propeller induced flow this finding enabled the development of escort performance simulations based on equilibrium conditions on the horizontal plane hutchison et al 1993 an extensive model test program was conducted by allan 2000 to investigate a series of hull forms and associated appendages which can be adapted to escort tugs with either cycloidal or azimuth stern drive propulsion to develop an efficient escort tug design with a capability of generating 150 tons of escort steering force initial tests indicated that the predicted forces could not be achieved mainly due to a shift to the aft in the position of the centre of lateral resistance clr through the significant angles of attack to meet the design target steering force the design of the skeg was increased and the clr shifted forward by about 2 the second series of tests were then performed on the modified skeg design which showed that at 10 knots the tug can obtain a maximum steering force of 150 tons molyneux 2003 conducted further tests with a 1 18 scale model of the same tractor type escort tug design to obtain lift and drag forces for the hull in combination with different appendages which included the case of the hull with and without the fin the range of ship speeds was from 4 to 12 knots with model speeds based on froude scaling the model was fixed at the required yaw angle and the measurements were made of surge force fore and aft sway forces and yaw moment using a planar motion mechanism pmm the model was free to roll about the axis through the towing staple and free to pitch and heave at the high speeds of 10 and 12 knots yaw angles tested varied from a small negative value to approximately 45 for speeds of 4 6 and 8 knots yaw angles varied from a small negative value to 105 it was concluded that the free surface wave effects were small for the range of speeds typically found in escort tug operation allan and molyneux 2007 presented the results of scaled model experiments with three different type of escort tugs representing voith tractor azimuth stern drive asd and z drive tractor 1 18 scaled models of each tug were constructed the aim of these experiments was to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments generated by the various hulls and appendages no propulsion units were fitted and a wide range of yaw angles likely to be encountered during escort operation was covered the models were fixed at a given yaw angle during the tests and measurements made for the surge and sway forces and yaw moment for the range of operating speeds and yaw angles the speeds tested corresponded to 4 6 8 10 and 12 knots in full scale the steering and braking force coefficients and the position of the centre of lateral resistance were measured and compared for different types of tugs model tests have proven to be extremely useful in designing hull and appendages of escort tugs however excessive time and cost requirements have limited their applications in the early stages of the design process the emergence of computational fluid dynamics cfd has provided designers a more practical tool to facilitate early design performance studies molyneux 2007 and molyneux and bose 2008 used a commercial reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver with k ω turbulence model to predict the forces and flow patterns around the hull of a 39 m voith tractor type escort tug the predictions were compared with data from model experiments with a pmm conducted by molyneux 2007 a hexahedral mesh was found to be most suitable for predicting the escort forces resulting in calculated forces that on average were within 5 6 of measured values and never exceeded 10 the largest discrepancy occurred at high yaw angles of 60 the study neglected the free surface effects on the basis that the effect of the free surface on the forces measured in the model experiments were small jahra et al 2015 also investigated the hydrodynamic forces and moments of the same escort tug at steady oblique flow conditions using a commercial rans solver with k ε turbulence model the free surface was modelled using the volume of fluid vof approach for calm water condition the hull was assumed fixed in space with an even keel the rans solver predictions were compared with the experimental measurements at 15 30 and 45 yaw angles at 15 and 30 flow conditions a reasonable agreement between the measurement and the predicted results was achieved but it was found that the rans solver prediction underestimated the sway forces for the 45 heading this was considered to be due to the turbulence model used in the computational method which was not suitable for predicting the highly separated flows observed at yaw angles of approximately 30 and higher smoker et al 2016 used commercial viscous flow solver package with k ε turbulence model to predict lift and drag forces at large yaw angles of the same escort tug model used by molyneux 2007 in these simulations the model was free to heave but was set at a fixed roll angle a range of simulations was performed for yaw angles ranging from 0 to 45 and calculated lift and drag forces were compared against escort model tests the computational results for maximum lift were within 2 of the experimental values with the same stall angle of approximately 37 predicted in both cases the calculated drag force was consistently within 10 of the model test values however the cfd simulations increasingly underpredicted the drag force as the yaw angle increased once flow separation had occurred above about 37 the predicted lift and drag forces were significantly below the model test forces reliable estimation of hydrodynamic forces by model tests or computational methods enabled the development of numerical models to estimate the escort performance characterised by the steering and braking forces applied by the tug waclawek and molyneux 2000 ratcliff 2003 these numerical models in general are based on basic design characteristics related to the tug s hull appendages and the propulsion parameters in these models in general the hull appendages and thrusters are considered separately and the interactions between them are omitted due to the difficulties in dealing with the complex flow characteristics around the tug particularly at higher speeds and large yaw angles to investigate the interaction between thrusters brandner and renilson 1998 conducted a series of experiments and measured the forces acting on two thrusters for a range of relative positions the results showed that forces from the trailing thruster are heavily affected by interaction particularly due to impingement of the race from the leading thruster whereas forces from the latter remained essentially unaffected despite its proximity to the former a major contribution in the prediction of the performance of vertical axis propellers in escort conditions is due to molyneux and waclawek 2001 in which regression equations were presented enabling practical estimation of the effective thrust force and its direction bilici et al 2016 presented two distinct computational methodologies based on semi empirical and rans based approaches to practically estimate the maximum achievable steering and braking forces depending on the escort tug configuration as well as the type and speed of the escort operation in order to validate the hydrodynamic force calculations model test results of a voith schneider propeller vsp equipped tractor type escort tug ajax presented by molyneux 2007 were used comparison of these measurements with those predicted by the semi empirical and rans based computational methodologies indicated that both procedures provide an acceptable level of correlation particularly at the lower range of yaw angles this paper presents a further and extended application of the above mentioned study bilici et al 2016 which was based on limited tug geometric particulars available in the open literature to test the predictive capability of the semi empirical and rans based methods with an escort tug configuration representing state of the art design features it is shown that the steering and braking forces generated by an escort tug can be determined by using the components of the thrust force and the hydrodynamic forces i e the lift and drag forces therefore the crucial part of the methodology is to predict the hydrodynamic forces due to the tug s hull and skeg the hydrodynamic hull forces can easily be estimated by a set of manoeuvring derivatives which are obtained by reliable semi empirical methods based on model test measurements or full scale test results the lift and drag forces due to the skeg can also be estimated by empirical methods based on experiments conducted with low aspect ratio wing sections however this semi empirical approach is basically suitable to be used for the yaw angles up to the stall angle and ignores the effect of local flow characteristics hence these estimates need to be validated by a more reliable computational method particularly based on the solution of the viscous turbulent flow field the study also includes the investigation of the effects of free surface and heel angle on the lift and drag forces for critical yaw angles in order to determine the significance of these aspects another difficulty in the prediction of performance of escort tugs is the estimation of the thrust forces at specific escort speeds and yaw angles this is a problem due to the complex flow characteristics and interactions between the thrusters hull and appendages in this study the regression equations of molyneux and waclawek 2001 to predict the force created by the propulsion system and its direction were used finally the results of the hydrodynamic and thrust force calculations were used to estimate the steering and braking forces applied by a full scale escort tug 2 steering and braking forces in order to assess the performance of an escort tug the maximum achievable steering and braking forces should be accurately predicted for the range of escort speeds the primary forces acting on a tractor type escort tug in pure and powered indirect modes are shown in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively with reference to the tug centre of pressure the escort tug applies force to the escorted ship through the towline the escort braking force f b is the streamwise component of the towline force and mainly affected by drag force the escort steering force f s on the other hand is the transverse component of the towline force and particularly caused by hydrodynamic lift force the steering and braking force components depend on the towline force t and the towline angle δ as follows 1 f s t s i n δ f b t c o s δ the ratio of the braking force to the steering force will vary depending on the yaw angle of the tug relative to the centreline α and the towline angle δ a properly designed escort tug hull and skeg can generate significant hydrodynamic lift which would result in high steering and braking forces in indirect mode escort tugs can be operated in various modes depending on the speed of the assisted vessel at lower speeds typically below 6 knots the tug uses the thrust force generated by its propulsion system to retard or steer the assisted vessel this type of operation is called the direct mode and can also be achieved by conventional tugs at higher speeds particularly at speeds over 8 knots properly designed and equipped escort tugs use the advantage of special propulsion systems to generate hydrodynamic forces by letting the assisted vessel to drag the tug through the towline with an angle of attack with respect to the centreline of the assisted vessel this type of operation is called indirect mode because the towline force is augmented by the hydrodynamic force generated by the tug s hull and skeg depending on the role of the tug s propulsion system the indirect mode can be applied in a pure or powered mode in the pure indirect mode the thruster force is perpendicular to the centreline of the tug and the propulsion unit generates only required amount of power to maintain a specific yaw angle in powered indirect mode however maximum available thrust power is used to achieve and maintain the largest possible yaw angle to generate maximum steering force in this mode towline forces generally exceed the tug s rated bollard pull in essence the direct mode relies purely on the thrust force the pure indirect mode takes advantage of the hydrodynamic effects of the tug s hull and skeg with minimum thrust and the powered indirect mode uses both hydrodynamic effects and maximum available thrust power jagannathan et al 1995 as shown in fig 1 a in the pure indirect mode the thrust force acts only in the transverse direction to maintain a specific yaw angle in order to determine the towline and thrust forces the forces are balanced in the x and y directions and the yaw moment about the centre of pressure as shown in fig 2 resulting in the following set of equations 2 p l h l t l 0 3 p t h t t t 0 4 m p t d 1 t t d 2 0 where p t transverse component of the thrust force normal to tug s centreline p l longitudinal component of the thrust force parallel to tug s centreline t t transverse component of the towline force normal to tug s centreline t l longitudinal component of the towline force parallel to tug s centreline h l transverse component of the hydrodynamic force normal to tug s centreline h t longitudinal component of the hydrodynamic force parallel to tug s centreline m yawing moment d 1 longitudinal distance from thrusters to the centre of hydrodynamic force d 2 longitudinal distance from towing staple to the centre of hydrodynamic force in pure indirect mode the longitudinal component of the thrust force is zero then from equation 2 5 t l h l and from equation 3 6 t t h t p t substituting into equation 4 p t can be calculated as follows 7 p t m h t d 2 d 1 d 2 in the pure indirect mode only a small fraction of the total thrust power is needed to maintain the set yaw angle hence this mode enables an assessment of the effect of different hull and skeg geometries on escort performance independent of the maximum available thrust in order to increase the steering force while keeping the yaw angle constant the tug must increase the thrust power to maximum available this mode of operation is called the powered indirect mode as illustrated in fig 1 b the transverse component of thrust force can be calculated in a similar manner as in the pure indirect mode equation 7 in the powered indirect mode the tug is assumed to be using the maximum available thrust power hence the longitudinal component of the thrust force is 8 p l t d 2 p t 2 where t d represents the dynamic thrust force which is equal to bollard pull in static conditions however as the speed and yaw angle change the dynamic thrust force and its direction may dramatically change in order to determine the dynamic thrust force a set of regression equations based on model tests with tractor type escort tugs are used details of this procedure is given in section 6 the transverse component of the towline force is given in equation 6 and the longitudinal component of the towline force can be easily determined as follows 9 t l h l p l in order to obtain the steering and braking forces towline force components should be transformed from the local tug coordinate system to the global coordinate system as follows 10 f s t t cos α t l sin α 11 f b t t sin α t l cos α longitudinal and transverse components of the hydrodynamic forces h l and h t can be easily obtained from the lift and drag forces f l and f d using the following formulas 12 h l f l sin α f d cos α 13 h t f d sin α f l cos α 3 hydrodynamic forces flow around an escort tug in indirect mode is significantly affected by viscosity because of the adverse pressure gradients flow separations increase with the increasing yaw angles both cross flow pressures and circulatory forces exist in typical problems of performance prediction of the escort vessels thus viscous modelling is the most critical part of the methodology and requires a meticulous study for an escort tug in static drift motion assuming no heave pitch motion the hydrodynamic forces can be expressed as function of longitudinal and lateral velocity components and speed independent coefficients called hydrodynamic derivatives as follows 14 surge f x ρ 2 l 2 x u u u u x v v v 2 15 sway f y ρ 2 l 2 y v u v y v v v v 16 y a w n ρ 2 l 3 n v u v n v v v v the hydrodynamic force in pure surge motion can be considered to be the same as the total resistance and can be calculated from ittc formulation the linear component of the transverse force y v is a lift curve slope appropriate to the small angle of incidence while the nonlinear term y v v is called the cross drag coefficient determined for specific drift angle range these coefficients depend on the hull geometry and the reynolds number and can be determined from captive model tests the linear coefficient y v can also be estimated rather reliably by empirical methods based on model test results an empirical formula for conventional ship forms is given by ankudinov 1985 17 y v π t l 2 0 25 c b b t 2 1 5 c b b t 3 45 at larger angles the side force is dominated by cross flow and hence much more difficult to be predicted the cross drag coefficient y v v can be defined on the base of the ship lateral area at large incidence angle and can be estimated by the following empirical formula ankudinov 1985 18 y v v t l 1 1 0 0045 l t 0 27 b t 0 016 b t 2 for the yaw moment similar formulas are available ankudinov 1985 19 n v π t l 2 0 75 0 04 c b b π t 20 n v v 0 75 n v the performance of an escort tug is significantly influenced by the skeg geometry a properly designed skeg generates considerable lift and drag forces which contribute to the maximum attainable steering and braking forces the lift force generated by the skeg depends on the yaw angle and up to the stall angle the skeg lift coefficient c ls can be determined according to whicker and fehlner 1958 21 c l s c l s β β 57 3 c d c a r e β 57 3 2 where β is the sideslip angle and the slope of the lift curve is given by 22 c l s β 1 8 π a r e 1 8 c o s λ a r e 2 cos 4 λ 4 where λ is the sweep of quarter chord line the effective aspect ratio ar e is defined as follows 23 a r e 2 b 2 a l s where b is the span and a ls is the lateral area of the skeg the cross flow drag coefficient c dc for a square tip skeg is given by 24 c d c 0 1 1 6 λ where λ is the taper ratio for yaw angles up to the stall angle the drag coefficient c ds can be calculated according to whicker and fehlner 1958 25 c d s 0 0065 c l s 2 0 9 π a r e 4 tug particulars in order to demonstrate the application of escort performance prediction procedure a typical voith tractor escort tug designed for escort operations in the straits of marmara is considered the particulars of this voith tractor escort tug are given in table 1 the hull form is shown in fig 3 the vessel is fitted with a skeg based on naca 0012 series profile geometry 5 rans computations 5 1 computational model and boundary conditions the rans computations were carried out with a 1 10 model scale of presented escort tug the lines plan of the hull was used to generate the three dimensional solid geometry while the propulsion cage of the tug was ignored according to the selected cartesian system the aft starboard and upper side of the hull were pointed towards x y and z directions respectively the fore end of the waterline was set as the origin location a relatively large solution domain was generated since the hull acts as a significantly bluff body for the high yaw angle cases in accordance with this the computational boundaries at the inlets outlets and bottom were placed at 4 l 6 l 12 l and 3 l respectively from the hull where l implies the model length fig 4 since the free surface effects were not taken into consideration in the simulations the top boundary was placed at a height that corresponds to the scantling draught of the tug the computational mesh was generated with a well known cut cell technique which is a type of non matching block unstructured volume mesh generation method for the generation of the mesh structure star ccm 11 06 software package was utilised in this method whilst both triangular and quadrilateral elements are used in the surface mesh structure the hexahedral cells dominate the solution domain the near wall region also involves tetrahedral elements the technique provides a relatively simple and quick mesh generation solution in which several local mesh refinement blocks can also be effectively specified a view of the generated volume mesh is shown in fig 5 in order to reduce the computational resource requirements and obtain a quick solution the y value of the first cell adjacent to the outer surface of the solid body was kept around 50 for the most part of the hull and skeg where y represents a non dimensional distance from the wall which is described as follows 26 y y u τ ϑ in this equation y u τ ϑ imply the distance from the wall friction velocity and kinematic viscosity respectively since this approach basically requires the use of the law of the wall the placement of 15 20 cells in the boundary layer was adequate to accurately model the near wall region for practical purposes instead of generating different volume meshes for various computational cases the mesh was generated only for the zero yaw angle condition the yaw angle effects were provided by the implementation of inlet boundary condition to one of the side boundaries besides the inlet boundary in the x direction and changing the velocity components for each yaw angle cases while keeping the velocity magnitude constant at each operation speed see fig 4 however it should be noted that the generation of individual volume meshes for each case would slightly increase the solution accuracy several local refinement blocks were applied to better resolve the flow field where large changes in flow parameters were expected to occur however to facilitate the mesh generation process a symmetrical refinement structure around centreline of the tug was adopted the dimensions of the refinement zones applied can be examined in fig 6 the velocity magnitudes of 6 8 and 10 knots for the full scale tug were considered which corresponded to froude numbers fr of about 0 16 0 22 and 0 27 respectively in the study accordingly for the model scaled simulations the velocity magnitudes of 0 976 m s 1 301 m s and 1 627 m s were used the turbulence intensity level was set as 1 at the inlet boundaries at the outlet boundaries the atmospheric pressure was specified and the backflow turbulence direction was adjusted in accordance with the yaw angle finally a symmetry condition which can be interpreted as a slip wall was applied to the top and bottom boundaries 5 2 details of computations in the simulations steady incompressible rans equations wilcox 2006 were solved ansys fluent 17 2 software package was used for the computations in order to calculate the turbulence field and hence model the reynolds stresses which arise in rans equations after the averaging operation as additional unknowns the realizable k ε turbulence model shih et al 1995 that is based on the boussinesq hypothesis tennekes and lumley 1972 in conjunction with the two layer zonal model of chen and patel 1988 was used the applied model is an improved version of the standard k ε model launder and spalding 1972 when applying this turbulence model two additional transport equations for turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation should be solved the rans and aforementioned turbulence transport equations were solved by finite volume technique with a segregated algorithm blazek 2001 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 for the pressure velocity coupling a standard pressure correction procedure simple was applied patankar and spalding 1972 the second order upwind scheme was used to discretise the convective acceleration terms while the viscous terms were dealt with the second order central difference scheme pletcher et al 2013 in each case the iterations were run until the scaled residuals dropped to a level of 10 6 while the variations of the flow variables such as the hydrodynamic forces and velocities at various locations in the wake field were systematically checked in order to decide whether the convergence was achieved 5 3 grid dependence analysis in order to check whether the computational results were independent of the grid density some additional computations were carried out with three different mesh densities for the 45 yaw angle case at fr 0 22 a basic grid structure mesh a was initially generated with the mesh generation technique previously described the mesh b and mesh c were then obtained by systematically increasing the mesh resolution at each direction of the coordinate system by a factor of approximately 2 3 hence the total cell number in the domain was nearly doubled in each step the basic mesh characteristics and results for the calculated sway forces with each meshes are summarised in table 2 where average y implies the average value of y calculated for the first cells adjacent to the walls while average cell aspect ratio represents the ratio of the cell length to the cell height for the same cell the negligible difference of around 2 and 0 05 for the lift and drag forces respectively between the results of the mesh b and mesh c points out that the mesh b is suitable to carry out further simulations with various yaw angles and flow speeds the uncertainty analysis of the numerical discretisation was performed by using the grid convergence index gci method roache 1998 the procedure is explained in detail in çelik et al 2008 the resulting gci value of the mesh b for the lift force was obtained as approximately 4 0 which implies the general numerical uncertainty in this force component this uncertainty level is expected to be much lower for the yaw angles below the stall angle the final non dimensional cell sizes used in the computations in the light of the mesh dependency analysis are also given in table 3 6 results 6 1 comparative results of the hydrodynamic forces table 4 summarises the lift and drag coefficients of the tug obtained by the application of the two numerical approaches the results associated with the yaw angles higher than 40 are not shown for the semi empirical method this is due firstly to the fact that manoeuvring derivatives that are used to estimate the hydrodynamic hull forces are based on model experiments carried out for small yaw angles typically up to 20 secondly the lift and drag force coefficients of the skeg are calculated by empirical formulae that are basically valid only for the yaw angles up to the stall angle therefore the use of this method is not suitable for the yaw angles beyond the stall angle however this does not jeopardize the applicability and practicality of the semi empirical method since from the tug s operational point of view solely the yaw angles smaller than the stall angle are of interest as is clearly seen from table 4 the results associated with different froude numbers considered are almost identical for the rans method this indicates that for the speed range investigated the general character of the lift and drag forces remains nearly unchanged on the other hand as the coefficients are somewhat inherently independent from the velocity for the semi empirical method the results for the different froude numbers considered are once again very similar a graphical comparison of the semi empirically calculated lift and drag force coefficients with those obtained by the rans computations is shown in fig 7 the lift and drag coefficients are defined as follows 27 c l f l 0 5 ρ a l v 2 c d f d 0 5 ρ a l v 2 where f l and f d imply the lift and drag forces respectively al is the underwater lateral area of the hull and skeg ρ is the density of the water kg m3 and v is the speed m s of the escorted ship the figure solely presents the results obtained at fr 0 22 which corresponds to a speed of 8 knots for the full scale tug for the lift force coefficient c l the agreement is very good up to the yaw angle of 30 the difference between the results of the two methods are not greater than 4 within this range and this value slightly augments to around 9 at the yaw angle of 35 which is very close to the stall angle the stall occurs between the yaw angles of 35 and 40 according to the rans computations as mentioned previously the results of the semi empirical approach are mainly valid up to the stall angle then the results of the semi empirical method for yaw angles greater than 40 are not graphically presented the plot shows that the difference between the results of the two methods significantly increases after the stall the rans computations indicate that the lift force produced by the tug dramatically decreases after the stall it can be seen that nearly half of the maximum lift force produced can be suddenly lost within a few degrees of yaw angle this point is quite critical from the operational point of view since the lift force highly affects the steering force applied by the tug the lift force also continues to rapidly decrease in a nearly linear fashion for the larger yaw angle values however it should also be recalled that the rans computations performed did not include the effect of the free surface and heel angle of the tug which are present in the real operational situations assuming that these forces are simply unimportant up to the stall angle additional rans simulations at the yaw angles of 30 35 45 and the froude number of 0 22 including both the free surface and heel angle effects were also performed to show the validity of this assumption as the solution domain previously generated was already large it was decided to keep the dimensions of this domain for the new simulations the initial mesh resolution was also basically maintained for the underwater part of the hull form however an additional mesh refinement was applied for the zone around the free surface in the z direction the free surface mesh was also refined in the x and y directions to accurately resolve the surface deformations near the hull the well known volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 was considered for the two phase flow calculations an implicit approach was adopted for the tracking of the free surface which was performed with a high accuracy second order scheme to increase the accuracy and stability of the solution method an unsteady technique with the three time level implicit time discretisation ferziger and peric 2002 was applied a dynamically varying time step was chosen such that the maximum local courant number in the flow field was initially kept around 5 and gradually increased up to 40 as the solution evolved a heel angle of 8 was considered in the study taking the main characteristics of the tug into account the results of these simulations are also displayed in fig 7 as is seen the lift force was almost not affected by the free surface and heel effects before the stall angle and nearly identical results were obtained within this range however after the stall at the yaw angle of 45 the lift force was considerably increased by almost 79 the results of these simulations are also presented in table 4 as far as the drag force coefficient c d is concerned the predictions of the rans and semi empirical methods displayed an acceptable correlation similar to that obtained for c l the difference in the drag coefficient which generally remains around 5 is about 22 at the yaw angle of 10 after the stall the drag force first displays a horizontal movement which is then followed by a significant and continuous increase as expected the plateau around the stall is due to the substantially large decrease in the lift force obtained at the same yaw angle and associated reduction of the induced drag component perhaps interestingly the additional simulations performed which included the effect of the free surface and a heel angle indicated that the drag force behaves nearly independent of the free surface and heel angle effects as very similar values were obtained even after the stall angle the difference remained within 3 at the yaw angle of 45 the results indicate that for the conventional operational ranges which are basically up to the stall angle the practical simulations can ignore the effect of the free surface as well as that of the heel angle in an effort to rapidly and roughly estimate the hydrodynamic forces to assist the design process of an escort tug it should be noted here that the rans simulations were carried out with a 1 10 model scale of presented escort tug whilst the semi empirical calculations were used the full scale tug properties since the semi empirical method is based on non dimensional coefficients obtained from model tests the steering and braking forces can be non dimensionalised independent of the scale hence there is no effect of scaling for the semi empirical method however the model scale approach with froude similarity certainly introduces reynolds number differences between the model scale and full scale tug the differences in reynolds numbers mainly affect the energy of the boundary layer and the flow separation phenomenon basically a model scale tug involves a larger flow separation zones hence slightly larger lift and lower drag force coefficients can be generated by a full scale tug compared to the model scale tug 6 2 flow topology around the hull and skeg the fundamental structure of the flow field around the tug is briefly presented in this section benefiting from the rans simulations which do not include the free surface and heel angle effects here only the figures associated with the cases performed at fr 0 22 are given shown in fig 8 are the static pressure coefficient distributions and two dimensional 2d streamlines around the hull on two different xy planes of z l 0 and z l 0 05 for the 35 and 45 yaw angle cases as is known the 35 yaw angle case implies the flow structure just before the stall phenomenon while the 45 yaw angle case represents a post stall flow regime the substantial difference in the flow topologies is clearly apparent in the figure on both xy planes the red coloured high pressure zone around the fore end is stronger for the 45 yaw angle case as a result of the increasing incoming flow angle before the stall there exists a very low pressure or suction zone around the starboard side of the fore and which creates high lift force acting on the hull in the 45 yaw angle case however the pressure on this field increases and the low pressure zone diffuses to a much larger area due to the very large flow separation zone these explain the reason of the dramatic decrease in the lift force seen in fig 7 around the stall angle 2d streamlines around the skeg on xy plane of z l 0 12 are presented in fig 9 for the same cases the flow separation already occurs around the skeg for the 35 yaw angle case with a single vortex structure concentrated in a confined space causing a significant loss of efficiency with the increasing contribution of the drag force on the other hand the 45 yaw angle case presents an extremely large separation zone forming from two strong counter rotating vortices this indeed causes a significant loss of lift force generated fig 10 shows the flow structure around the yz plane of x l 0 28 which is located close to the trailing edge of the skeg the large organised vortex arising from the tip of the skeg which moves away from the hull and loses its strength as the yaw angle increases can be clearly observed in the figure the structure of the 3d streamlines around the tug the pressure distribution on the hull is presented in fig 11 for the 35 yaw angle case the flow separation and strong helical motion are mainly caused by the skeg geometry after the stall for the 45 yaw angle case a very large high vorticity zone which partially mixes with the vorticity generated by the aft region dominates the figure this difference in the flow regime certainly substantially affects the pressure distribution on the hull 6 3 prediction of full scale escort performance once the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and appendages are determined as described in the previous sections the performance of the escort tug in pure or powered indirect modes can be determined depending on the usage of thrust power in pure indirect mode thrusters apply a force perpendicular to the centreline of the tug in order to maintain a specific yaw angle the thrust force required for this is only a small percentage of the total thrust force available in order to increase the steering force the angle between the tug and the assisted vessel should be reduced and hence the thrust force should be increased in this way much higher steering forces may be obtained by supporting the hydrodynamic forces by the thrust power and the tug is said to be operated in the powered indirect mode as previously presented in section 2 the towline force components can be determined in both pure and powered indirect modes by balancing the forces in x and y directions and moment around the centre of pressure of the tug even though the performance of an escort tug in pure indirect mode is a convenient indicator of the general hydrodynamic performance of the tug from an operational point of view escort performance is represented by the performance in powered indirect mode where maximum available steering and braking force are achieved the steering and braking forces at different yaw angles for the given escort tug in powered indirect mode was calculated by both semi empirical and rans based approaches for three different operational speeds of 6 8 and 10 knots for the full scale tug to improve the overall prediction of the effect of the propulsion system on the results the dynamic thrust force and the angle was also taken into account in a similar way to that described in molyneux and waclawek 2001 according to this experimental work the thrust force generated by a vertical axis propeller can be significantly increased compared to that obtained at the bollard pull condition depending on the advance coefficient and the angle between the thruster and incoming flow which results in the dynamic thrust force moreover due to the tendency for the incoming flow to interact with the propulsion system the direction of the thrust force is no longer oriented with the direction of the propeller and hence a dynamic thrust angle is created as a first step the dynamic thrust forces were calculated benefiting from the regression curves given in molyneux and waclawek 2001 linear interpolation was applied for the dynamic thrust force coefficient values corresponding to the advance coefficients within those presented in that study the transverse component p t of dynamic thrust force generated by the propulsion system should be exactly equal to the force that satisfies the static balance at a specific yaw angle accordingly after the calculation of the dynamic thrust angle in a similar manner to that of the dynamic thrust force the longitudinal component p l force that corresponds to p t required was obtained interestingly the longitudinal component of the dynamic thrust force was found to be higher than the rated bollard pull of the escort tug particularly at large yaw angles the associated results are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 as it can be seen in fig 12 the steering forces predicted by both approaches are in close agreement up to the stall angle within this range at fr 0 22 the differences between the two predictions were lower than 6 3 1 on average the steering force exhibits a substantial rise depending on the operational speed for the highest operational speed the steering force produced by the tug is around twice the rated static bollard pull due to the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces it can be observed that the steering force increases almost in a linear manner up to the stall angle after the stall the steering force suddenly decreases as expected due to the rapid lift force loss as the yaw angle further increases a tendency to increase with a mild slope is apparent due to the higher contribution of the longitudinal component of the thrust force at higher yaw angles the additional simulations which included the effect of free surface and heel angle at fr 0 22 on the other hand did almost not affect the steering force predictions before the stall however at 45 yaw angle the steering force increased by around 26 due to the significant rise of the lift force obtained in this simulation the braking forces calculated by both approaches are presented in fig 13 it appears that the braking force is not as sensitive to stall phenomenon as the steering force at each speed this force decreases in a parabolic fashion with increasing yaw angle similar to that observed in the previous figure the agreement between the two approaches is good up to the stall angle which rises to 16 9 at 30 yaw angle and remains within 7 6 on average one interesting consequence is that there exists a certain yaw angle for each speed where zero braking force occurs this specific yaw angle corresponds to a towline angle of 90 and from this point on the tug begins to pull the assisted vessel rather than brake it the braking forces as they are considerably lower than the steering forces were relatively more affected by the introduction of the free surface and heel angle in the simulations whilst the differences remained within 15 before the stall it reached up to 44 at the yaw angle of 45 for fr 0 22 the simulations indicated that the omission of the effect of the free surface as well as that of the heel angle did not significantly affect the prediction of the steering and braking forces 7 concluding remarks a practical methodology based on two different approaches which can be successfully used to predict towline forces generated by tractor type escort tugs was presented in the semi empirical approach the hydrodynamic forces acting on the bare hull are estimated by using the manoeuvring derivatives obtained from model tests carried out for relatively small yaw angles up to typically 20 the lift and drag forces of the skeg are also obtained from simple empirical formulas based on the experimental tests which are basically valid up to the stall angle hence this technique is not suitable to calculate the escort performance beyond the stall angle furthermore the technique also ignores the details of the hull and appendage geometries which may significantly affect the towline force components even for the yaw angles smaller than the stall angle therefore it may be concluded that the semi empirical approach is most suitable to be used at early design stages where various design alternatives are considered the second approach on the other hand is a computational methodology based on the solution of the rans equations and suitable to be used at later stages of the design process with a wider range of yaw angles when the detailed geometrical definitions of the tug and appendages are available the calculations with both methodologies showed that the estimated lift and drag forces are in close agreement up to the stall angle the inclusion of the free surface and heel angle in the simulations slightly affected these forces however after the stall whilst the drag force still displayed minor variations the lift force obtained was significantly increased as a consequence of the inclusion of these effects a good agreement was also observed for the steering and braking forces predicted by the two methods the differences between the results of the two methods applied were around 3 1 and 7 6 on average for the steering forces and braking forces respectively up to the stall angle at fr 0 22 the additional simulations performed showed that the existence of the free surface and heel angle did not much influence the steering forces predicted before the stall at fr 0 22 however after this particular yaw angle a much higher steering force could be obtained compared to that calculated in the simulations without these effects the braking forces were relatively more affected by the introduction of the free surface and heel angle in the simulations however the differences still remained within 15 before the stall the results also indicate that very large steering forces which are much higher than the rated bollard pull of the tug can be obtained in the powered indirect mode on the other hand the braking forces tend to rapidly take negative values for the higher yaw angle operational cases the present escort performance analyses also include the influence of the dynamic thrust force and its direction which significantly changed the contribution of the propulsion force to the steering and braking forces particularly at large yaw angles the longitudinal component of the dynamic thrust force was found to be higher than the rated bollard pull of the escort tug overall the methodology with both approaches can be systematically used as a convenient tool to design highly efficient and effective tractor type tugs this methodology can also be used to investigate the effects of basic design characteristics such as the main dimensions of tug and skeg and the locations of the thrusters and towing staple the approaches presented here are basically intended to be used as rapid practical and convenient tools for the initial design stages of the escort tugs however although the results imply an adequate reliability for both methods an experimental validation involving a wide range of yaw angles operational speeds and different hull forms is clearly needed this comparative study will also provide the ability of further increasing the predictive capability of the current methods presented for this purpose the authors intend to conduct a series of experimental tests by using the new pmm system presently installed in the towing tank of istanbul technical university within the frame of a recent project katmansis involving the construction of a modern large and high speed cavitation tunnel as well as the design and application of a manoeuvring system consisting of free running and captive modes özden et al 2016 for a more extensive and detailed analysis with a more accurate and wide range performance prediction the physical operation mechanism of the tandem propulsors are also aimed to be separately analysed and then to be investigated in conjunction with the hull by means of computer simulations to understand the interaction between the propulsors and hull the future works which will not aim to achieve rapid solutions will cover fully resolved boundary layer flow calculation to more accurately capture the flow separation phenomenon particularly for the yaw angles larger than the stall angle and will also include three degrees of freedom simulations with the heave pitch and roll motions of the hull under the influence of the sea waves and towline force which are considered to be highly effective on the tugs 
23116,a mathematical model of direct acting tensioner system was developed to analyze the effect of internal friction of tensioner cylinder on the tensioner performance the platform tensioner riser coupling system was established by implementing the tensioner model into ansys aqwa through user subroutines written in python scripts the overall coupling dynamic response under different wave conditions was investigated the results from current analyses considering the effect of internal friction of hydraulic cylinder show that the relationship between tension and piston stroke of tensioner under the cyclic displacement is not simple nonlinear relationship but hysteretic loop relationship based on the results of the dynamic response under same wave conditions it found that the variation of vertical relative displacement between platform and riser obtained with the hysteretic tensioner model is similar to that with the nonlinear tensioner model whereas the tension obtained with the hysteretic tensioner model has greater scope when compared to that with the nonlinear tensioner model moreover the tension from the hysteretic tensioner model would change suddenly several times in relatively short period under irregular waves due to the existence of high frequency component which resultantly exerts great impact on the fatigue life of the riser and tensioner keywords tensioner system riser hysteretic tensioner model tension variations complete coupled analysis 1 introduction as the exploration of oil and gas in the ocean moves towards deep waters the riser string which connected the drilling unit and the wellhead becomes longer and heavier to prevent buckling of the riser string due to its own weight and external environment load the top tensioned risers ttrs is usually applied to deep water operations as ttrs is equipped with the riser tensioners to maintain a nearly constant tension at the top of the riser and to compensate for the relative movements between the semi submersible platform and riser chakrabarti 2005 von and ankargren 2015 for the performance analysis of tensioner grønevik 2013 used the beam elements to simulate the tensioner and analyze the tension variation due to the change of volume in the nitrogen pressure vessels however yang et al yang and kim 2010 found that the tensioner performance analysis cannot only consider the impact of the state variation of gas it also need to take the impact of the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder into account yang et al yang and kim 2010 and zhang et al 2013 regarded the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder as coulomb friction and the coulomb friction on the tensioner piston by the cylinder was assumed to be related to the tension andersson et al 2007 and lee et al 2015 indicated that the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder can be regarded as a damping force in the cylinder and internal friction can be seen as the sum of seal friction coulomb friction and viscous friction however there is still a lack of studies considering the impact of different friction on the performance of tensioner therefore it is necessary to conduct a deeper study on the effect of internal friction on the performance of tensioner in addition to the performance of the tensioner chen et al 2018 and gupta et al 2008 also found that the coupling effect of the tensioner the riser and the platform can not be ignored in the simulation considering the large impact of the coupling effect on the global response and in the coupling dynamic response analysis the results are largely influenced by the simulation method of tensioner wang et al 2012 kang kang et al 2017 established the gas state model of the tensioner to analyze the coupling dynamic response pestana et al 2016 used the nonlinear spring damping element in the software orcaflex to simulate the tensioner but the impact of the internal friction in the tensioner cylinder on the overall response was not considered haziri haziri and dyngvold 2011 used the library of hydraulics pneumatics in simulationx to simulate the tensioner and established the whole coupling model of platform tensioner riser by simulationx but it cannot be used to analyze the effect of wave condition on the whole motion response based on the existing work on tensioner performance from different scholars it is found that the internal friction is one of the key factors in the tensioner cylinder but the simplified friction model neglecting the effect of internal friction were mostly applied in these existing work therefore a reasonable tensioner simulation model taking account of the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is proposed specially for the current study and based on this tensioner model a full platform tensioner riser coupling system is developed to study the effect of the tensioner performance on the dynamic response of the platform and riser 2 riser tensioner there are two main types of tensioners currently used in deepwater drilling operations wire ropes tensioner wrt and direct acting tensioner dat however due to the complexity and limited payload ability of the wrt types the dat types with hydro pneumatic have become predominant in recent offshore field developments the direct acting tensioner dat eliminates the transmission devices such as pulleys and wire ropes while the tension is directly transmitted by the hydraulic cylinder piston rod which brings advantages such as strong stability and accurate compensation to dat xuan et al 2012 all analyses in the current work are based on the direct acting tensioner dat a schematic diagram of the direct acting tensioner dat is shown in fig 1 the direct acting tensioner dat typically consists of hydro pneumatic tensioner cylinders oil gas accumulators high pressure gas vessels and low pressure gas vessels the hydro pneumatic tensioner cylinders provide almost constant tension to the riser in order to counter the balance of the overall weight of the riser and tube inside fluid the internal piston divides hydraulic cylinder into two parts low pressure pneumatic chamber and high pressure hydraulic chamber the low pressure chamber of the hydraulic cylinder is connected through a pneumatic pressure line to the low pressure gas vessels which is mainly used to provide damping effect and play the protective role of the riser tensioner system the high pressure chamber of the hydraulic cylinder is connected through a hydraulic pressure line to the oil gas accumulators which provides the tension for the riser and the tension maintained by oil pressure in this side of the hydraulic cylinder from the oil gas accumulator is pressurized by high pressure gas vessels 3 the mathematical model of the riser tensioner system the riser tensioner is a complicated structure composed of hydro pneumatic and mechanical subsystems in order to simplify the analysis principle hypothesizes of the current work are as follows 1 ignored the friction loss inside the oil gas accumulator 2 ignored the pressure loss inside the pressure line 3 ignored the quality of the piston rod and the hydraulic fluid 4 met the variation law of gas state and ignored the effect of the temperature 3 1 modelling of gas state variations supposing that there is no heat transfer the internal pressure variation of the high pressure gas cylinder satisfies the following relation 1 p a 0 v a 0 k p a 1 v a 1 k where k is the adiabatic gas constant which is 1 4 for nitrogen grønevik 2013 p a 0 is the initial pressure in the high pressure gas vessels v a 0 is the initial volume in the high pressure gas vessels p a 1 is the pressure after considering the pressure variation in the high pressure gas vessels and v a 1 is the volume after considering the volume variation in the high pressure gas vessels considering that the hydraulic fluid is incompressible it is thought that the gas volume varies along with the motion of hydraulic cylinder piston the volume variation in the high pressure gas vessels is expressed as follows 2 δ v a v a 1 v a 0 a r x p where δ v a is the variation of gas volume in the system a r is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the rod side and x p is the displacement of the piston in the hydraulic cylinder overall the pressure variations δ p a in a high pressure cylinder due to the gas volume variation can be represented as 3 δ p a p a 0 1 a r x p v a 0 k 1 similarly pressure variations δ p b in a low pressure cylinder due to the gas volume variation can be represented as 4 δ p b p b 0 1 a p x p v b 0 k 1 where p b 0 is the initial pressure in the low pressure gas vessels v b 0 is the initial volume in the low pressure gas vessels and a p is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the piston side 3 2 modelling of internal friction in hydraulic cylinder the hydraulic cylinder is an important part of tensioner its internal friction performance should not be ignored in the analysis process in order to achieve the tensioner model and to ensure the condition in simulation is in conformity with the actual operating conditions the friction model considering the stribeck effect should be the preferred for such study based on xuan et al 2012 s findings the hydraulic cylinder has significant stribeck effect when the direction of piston movement changes in hydraulic cylinder the stribeck effect occurs when the hydraulic fluid contacts with the moving piston when the piston velocity is smaller than the stribeck velocity piston limit velocity the friction decreases with the increase of the piston velocity in the stribeck model the total friction f f r is simulated as a function of relative velocity and pressure and is assumed to be the sum of stribeck coulomb and viscous components the friction can be defined by two parts the velocity dependent part f f r v and the pressure dependent part f f r p the total friction force and the two parts are defined as lee et al 2015 xuan et al 2012 marton and lantos 2007 5 f f r f f r v f f r p f f r v f c f s f c e x p v p v l s i g n v p k v v p a v f f r p k p p p r f s where f c is the coulomb friction force f

coefficient a v is the friction exponent 0 a v 1 and k p is the linear coefficient in the velocity dependent part f f r v the first term represents the coulomb friction f c which is usually defined as a constant the second term represents the mixed friction also known as stribeck effect friction which is expressed by the exponential function relation between static friction f s and stribeck velocity v l piston limit velocity the third term is the fluid dynamic fricti on viscous friction which is related to the viscous properties of the hydraulic fluid the pressure dependent part f f r p of the friction force represents the static friction force 3 3 modelling of tension variations in the direct acting tensioner system the tension is applied to the top of the riser through the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder the tension f t can be expressed as the sum of the hydraulic force produced by the pressure difference between both sides of the cylinder piston and the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder which is shown as follows 6 f t f h y d f f r the hydraulic force produced by the pressure difference between both sides of tensioner piston in the hydraulic pneumatic cylinder f h y d can be represented as 7 f h y d p r a r p p a p where p r is the pressure of the piston at the rod side a r is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the rod side p p is the pressure of the piston at the piston side and a p is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the piston side based on the gas state variations in section 2 1 the pressure difference between both sides of tensioner piston in the hydraulic pneumatic cylinder also can be represented as 8 p r p a 0 δ p a p p p b 0 δ p b for a comprehensive consideration of the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder the equation of force equilibrium on both sides of tensioner piston f t in the hydraulic pneumatic cylinder can be reformulated as 9 f t p a 0 1 a r x p v a 0 k a r p b 0 1 a p x p v b 0 k a p f f r the tensioner is an important connection between the platform and riser and its performance will be affected by the relative movement between the platform and riser however in the traditional tensioner analysis process pestana et al 2016 and mao et al 2016 normally used the platform motions as the input signal of the tensioner piston which is not in accordance with the actual operation conditions unlike those studies the real time responses of the platform and riser at the connected location are inputted to the tensioner to simulate the coupling dynamic response of the tensioner with the platform and riser system in this paper therefore the calculation formula of the tensioner model in the simulation process can be rewritten by the parametric formulation 10 f t p a 0 1 a r x

cylinder respectively x r i s e r and v r i s e r are the real time displacement of the connection point between the riser and tensioner along the tensioner cylinder respectively these parameters can be extracted dynamically by user subroutines from ansys aqwa result file the schematic diagram of the tensioner between the platform and riser is shown in fig 2 4 performance of the tensioner system based on the mathematical model for each components of the tensioner system the tensioner performance can be simulated by using matlab program to study the effect of the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder on the tension variations the direct acting tensioner used on the hysy 981 deepwater semi submersible drilling platform was taken as an example for the current study the input piston stroke signal of the tensioner cylinder is consisted of a cyclostationary sinusoidal signal assuming that the sinusoidal signal is with an amplitude of 5 m and time period of 10 s while the piston is in the mid stroke at the initial time the basic parameters of the tensioner system are shown in table 1 4 1 analysis of internal friction effect in hydraulic cylinder in the tensioner system the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is closely related to the piston movement and frictional pressure drop based on eq 5 we compiled the matlab program to analyze the variation of internal friction in the hydraulic cylinder the values of the corresponding parameters are as follows the limit velocity of the piston in the hydraulic cylinder is 0 05 m s the pressure drop due to friction is 2 bar the coulomb friction coefficient is 0 5 the viscous friction coefficient is 65818 ns m and the viscous friction index is 1 the calculation results are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 fig 3 shows the variation of the friction with the piston velocity the total internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder is mainly composed of three parts the pressure dependent friction the viscous friction and the stribeck effect friction as shown in fig 3 the pressure dependent friction is a constant regardless of the piston velocity the viscous friction increases linearly with the increase of piston velocity and the stribeck effect friction is closely related to the limit velocity of the piston when the piston velocity is lower than a certain value 0 05 m s the total friction force increases with the decrease of the piston velocity due to the stribeck effect when the piston velocity equals to 0 the velocity changes from a positive value to a negative one and the total friction also changes abruptly from a positive value to a negative one fig 4 shows the variation of stribeck effect friction and piston velocity with time as shown in fig 4 the stribeck effect friction decreases with increasing piston velocity until piston velocity goes beyond the limit after which the stribeck effect friction keeps as a constant in addition the stribeck effect friction reaches the maximum when the piston velocity is zero and changes suddenly when the direction of velocity changes 4 2 performance of the tensioner system under cyclic displacement the reciprocating motion of the piston is regarded as cyclic displacement in the current study in the analysis of tensioner system we take the down stroke as positive and take the up stroke as negative respectively in order to analyze the influence of internal friction of hydraulic cylinder the tensioner models considering separately the state variation of gas and internal friction of hydraulic cylinder are developed specially in the current work the simulated tension stroke curve at the piston side chamber of a single cylinder in the tensioner system is shown in fig 5 firstly when the tension is assumed to be related to the state variation of gas only the relation between the tension and the piston stroke is shown in curve 1 fig 5 as shown by curve 1 the relationship between the tension and the piston stroke is nonlinear so the tensioner model considering only the state variation of gas is named as nonlinear tensioner model when the piston is displaced upward with respect to the cylinder housing it will cause the hydraulic fluid to flow from the accumulator to the hydraulic cylinder meantime the pressure of the high pressure hydraulic chamber will be reduced and the tension will be reduced accordingly otherwise the pressure of the high pressure hydraulic chamber will be increased and the tension will be increased accordingly in addition calculation results show that the tension ranges from 1 9 mn to 2 68 mn under a given piston dynamic stroke from 5 m to 5 m secondly when the tension is assumed to be also related to the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder the relation between the tension and the piston stroke is shown in curve 2 fig 5 as shown by curve 2 the relationship between them is similar to a hysteretic curve the tensioner model of considering internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is thus named as hysteretic tensioner model and the time history curve of tension and piston displacement under the single cylinder of hysteretic tensioner model are shown in fig 6 when the piston is displaced upward with respect to the cylinder housing the tension will be reduced with the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder otherwise the tension will be increased when the piston is displaced downward with respect to the cylinder housing in addition when the piston stroke reaching stop positon the tension will have the sudden change due to the viscous friction of tensioner cylinder and the tension has opposite change with piston movement when the piston velocity is lower than the limit value this result was caused by the impact of the stribeck effect friction of the tensioner cylinder the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder contributes to the tension loss the friction caused tension loss expressed as a percentage of the total tension is shown in fig 7 it shows that the tension loss due to the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is up to 13 6 of the total tension among this 13 6 tension loss 10 4 is due to the viscous friction while the contribution of the stribeck effect friction and pressure dependent friction is similar with a proportion of 2 1 and 2 2 respectively based on the current results it can be concluded that the internal friction can not be omitted in the performance analysis of tensioner 5 response analysis of platform tensioner riser coupling system based on the tensioner mathematical model established in the previous section 2 the platform tensioner riser coupling system was established by implementing the tensioner system model into commercial software ansys aqwa through user subroutines written in python scripts in the ansys aqwa module the platform geometry model can be created in workbench using design modeler the riser string is modeled by the tethers connections and the tensioner can be joined between the platform and the riser string by the external force calculation program a full platform tensioner riser coupling system is thus developed and the effect of the performance of the tensioner on platform and riser dynamic response is simulated 5 1 model dimensions and wave conditions the current study takes the hysy 981 deepwater semi submersible drilling platform as an example to analyze the dynamic response of the platform tensioner riser coupling system in accordance with the demands of actual drilling operation the normal operating wave conditions which is extensively applied in south china sea is chosen for the study meanwhile in order to check the applicability of the tensioner used in the coupling system the overall dynamic response under different regular waves and irregular waves is analyzed the corresponding wave condition parameters are shown in table 2 the overall model of the platform and the riser system has been established in the hydrodynamic analysis software ansys aqwa in ansys aqwa hydrodynamic analysis the schematic of drilling platform model is shown in fig 8 and the principal dimensions of drilling platform and riser system are shown in table 3 and table 4 here the catenary mooring are adopted and the parameters of mooring system are shown in table 5 and table 6 by the coupling dynamic response analysis the vertical movement between the platform and the riser and the tension on the top of the riser are analyzed to investigate the performance of the hysteretic tensioner model under regular waves1 fig 9 and fig 10 present the vertical relative movement of the platform and the riser and the tension on the top of the riser under regular waves1 respectively the results show that the tension does change with the relative movement in real time when the platform moves upward relative to the riser the riser tension increases with the relative displacements in addition fig 10 shows that the tension increases with decreasing relative velocity value when the velocity is close to 0 and has a sudden change when the relative velocity is 0 this is similar to the variation trend shown in fig 6 and the main difference between the two graphs figs 10 and fig 6 is that the scope of the suddenly changed tension in fig 10 takes a larger proportion of the total tension variation when compared to that shown in fig 6 the reason of this difference is that the range of relative displacement and relative velocity are smaller than the range of piston stroke and piston velocity in fig 6 based on the traditional nonlinear tensioner model the overall dynamic response of the two different tensioner models are compared and analyzed fig 11 a shows the vertical relative displacement variation based on the two different tensioner models as shown in fig 11a the time history curves of the relative displacement from different tensioner models are similar and the scope of vertical relative displacement from the nonlinear tensioner model is slightly smaller than that from the hysteretic tensioner model it can be concluded that the hysteretic tensioner also can compensate the relative movement between the platform and the riser as the nonlinear tensioner unlike the variation of vertical relative displacement the tension variation from the two tensioner models has a great difference as shown in fig 11 b the tension provided by the hysteretic tensioner model and the nonlinear tensioner model varied from 5 728 mn to 6 605 mn and from 5 948 mn to 6 397 mn under the regular waves1 respectively it shows that the variation range of the tension from the hysteretic tensioner model is larger than that from the nonlinear tensioner model and fig 11b also shows that the tension will has a sudden change for the hysteretic tensioner model due to the internal friction of the tensioner cylinder which has an impact on the fatigue life of the riser in addition fig 11 c shows the relation between tension and relative displacement based on different tensioner models as shown in fig 11c the variation curves of tension with the relative displacement for both the nonlinear tensioner model and the hysteretic tensioner model are identical with the original curves shown in fig 5 in order to confirm the applicability of the hysteretic tensioner model under different wave conditions the overall coupled dynamic response under different wave periods is analyzed fig 12 a and fig 12 b present the vertical relative movement variation of the platform and the riser and the tension variation under different regular waves respectively it turned out that the variation scope of the relative displacement and the tension under regular waves1 are larger than that under regular waves2 under the regular waves2 the relative displacement varied from 2 m to 10 5 m and the tension varied from 5 19 mn to 7 15 mn and the tension does change with the relative movement in real time in addition compared with the stroke range of the tensioner piston it can also be found that the relative displacement variation under regular waves2 is in a reasonable scope these results indicated that the hysteretic tensioner model can effectively compensate the relative movement between the platform and the riser under the regular waves2 5 2 coupled dynamic response analysis under irregular waves aimed at the random characteristics of the wave conditions in the actual operation process the coupling dynamic response such as the vertical movement between the platform and the riser and the tension on the top of the riser are analyzed for the hysteretic tensioner model under the irregular waves the selected irregular waves type in this paper is pierson moskowitz spectrum the corresponding wave parameters of pierson moskowitz spectrum is shown in table 2 and the wave spectrum curve of the pierson moskowitz spectrum is shown in fig 13 the results of the coupled dynamic response analysis are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 the results also show that the tension does change with the relative movement in real time as shown in fig 14 the tension reaches maximum when the value of vertical relative displacement between the platform and the riser reaches maximum the corresponding tension and relative displacement varied from 5 635 mn to 6 579 mn and from 4 85 m to 7 3 m respectively fig 15 shows the variation trend of tension and relative velocity under irregular waves in addition comparing the result with the regular waves it shows that the variation law of fig 15 is identical to the fig 10 based on the overall dynamic response analysis under the irregular waves the calculation results based on the two different tensioner models under irregular waves are compared fig 16 a and fig 16 b show the relative displacement variation and the tension variation from analyses using the two different tensioner models respectively it can be found that the time history curves of the relative displacement for the two different tensioner models under irregular waves are similar to those results under regular waves this result shows that the hysteretic tensioner model can be applied in different wave conditions similarly under the irregular waves the hysteretic tensioner model also has a great scope of tension variation than the nonlinear tensioner model as shown in fig 16b the tension provided by the hysteretic tensioner model and the nonlinear tensioner model varied from 5 635 mn to 6 579 mn and from 5 826 mn to 6 356 mn under the irregular waves respectively fig 16 c shows the variation trend of the vertical relative displacement with tension from analyses using the two different tensioner models and the relations between tension and relative displacement for the different tensioner models are identical to that shown in fig 11c in addition compared with the periodic dynamic response under regular waves1 the tension variation under the irregular waves is random variation due to the existence of the high frequency component under the irregular waves the tension would change suddenly several times in a relatively short period which put forward higher requirement for the fatigue life of the tensioner and riser 6 conclusions and future studies in this paper the mathematical model of the direct acting riser tensioner system was developed to analyze the impact of internal friction of hydraulic cylinder on the tensioner performance the platform tensioner riser coupling system was established by implementing the tensioner system model into commercial software ansys aqwa through user subroutines written in python scripts the overall coupling dynamic response of the system under different wave conditions was investigate as a result of the analysis some significant conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 for the tensioner considering the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder the relationship between tension and piston stroke is not a simple nonlinear relationship but a hysteretic loop relationship moreover when the piston stroke reaching stop positon the tension will have the sudden change due to the viscous friction of tensioner cylinder and due to the stribeck effect friction the tension will have opposite change with piston movement when the piston velocity is lower than the limit value 2 by comparing the calculation results from different tensioner models the scope of vertical relative displacement under the nonlinear tensioner model is slightly smaller than that for the hysteretic tensioner model the scope of the tension under the hysteretic tensioner model is larger than that for the nonlinear tensioner and the tension also has a sudden change under the hysteretic tensioner model due to the internal friction of the tensioner cylinder in addition due to the existence of the high frequency component under the irregular waves the tension of the hysteretic tensioner model will complete more sudden changes in a relatively short period which has an impact on the fatigue life of the riser and tensioner in this study a tensioner model considering internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is established which is more consistent with the working condition and by using the ansys aqwa the overall coupling dynamic response can be really simulate under the normal operating conditions in the future work the emergency disconnection of the riser under dangerous conditions will be analyzed the model is further verified by analyzing the overall dynamic response during the emergency disconnection of the riser acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the support provided by program for changjiang scholars and innovative research team in university irt 14r58 
23116,a mathematical model of direct acting tensioner system was developed to analyze the effect of internal friction of tensioner cylinder on the tensioner performance the platform tensioner riser coupling system was established by implementing the tensioner model into ansys aqwa through user subroutines written in python scripts the overall coupling dynamic response under different wave conditions was investigated the results from current analyses considering the effect of internal friction of hydraulic cylinder show that the relationship between tension and piston stroke of tensioner under the cyclic displacement is not simple nonlinear relationship but hysteretic loop relationship based on the results of the dynamic response under same wave conditions it found that the variation of vertical relative displacement between platform and riser obtained with the hysteretic tensioner model is similar to that with the nonlinear tensioner model whereas the tension obtained with the hysteretic tensioner model has greater scope when compared to that with the nonlinear tensioner model moreover the tension from the hysteretic tensioner model would change suddenly several times in relatively short period under irregular waves due to the existence of high frequency component which resultantly exerts great impact on the fatigue life of the riser and tensioner keywords tensioner system riser hysteretic tensioner model tension variations complete coupled analysis 1 introduction as the exploration of oil and gas in the ocean moves towards deep waters the riser string which connected the drilling unit and the wellhead becomes longer and heavier to prevent buckling of the riser string due to its own weight and external environment load the top tensioned risers ttrs is usually applied to deep water operations as ttrs is equipped with the riser tensioners to maintain a nearly constant tension at the top of the riser and to compensate for the relative movements between the semi submersible platform and riser chakrabarti 2005 von and ankargren 2015 for the performance analysis of tensioner grønevik 2013 used the beam elements to simulate the tensioner and analyze the tension variation due to the change of volume in the nitrogen pressure vessels however yang et al yang and kim 2010 found that the tensioner performance analysis cannot only consider the impact of the state variation of gas it also need to take the impact of the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder into account yang et al yang and kim 2010 and zhang et al 2013 regarded the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder as coulomb friction and the coulomb friction on the tensioner piston by the cylinder was assumed to be related to the tension andersson et al 2007 and lee et al 2015 indicated that the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder can be regarded as a damping force in the cylinder and internal friction can be seen as the sum of seal friction coulomb friction and viscous friction however there is still a lack of studies considering the impact of different friction on the performance of tensioner therefore it is necessary to conduct a deeper study on the effect of internal friction on the performance of tensioner in addition to the performance of the tensioner chen et al 2018 and gupta et al 2008 also found that the coupling effect of the tensioner the riser and the platform can not be ignored in the simulation considering the large impact of the coupling effect on the global response and in the coupling dynamic response analysis the results are largely influenced by the simulation method of tensioner wang et al 2012 kang kang et al 2017 established the gas state model of the tensioner to analyze the coupling dynamic response pestana et al 2016 used the nonlinear spring damping element in the software orcaflex to simulate the tensioner but the impact of the internal friction in the tensioner cylinder on the overall response was not considered haziri haziri and dyngvold 2011 used the library of hydraulics pneumatics in simulationx to simulate the tensioner and established the whole coupling model of platform tensioner riser by simulationx but it cannot be used to analyze the effect of wave condition on the whole motion response based on the existing work on tensioner performance from different scholars it is found that the internal friction is one of the key factors in the tensioner cylinder but the simplified friction model neglecting the effect of internal friction were mostly applied in these existing work therefore a reasonable tensioner simulation model taking account of the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is proposed specially for the current study and based on this tensioner model a full platform tensioner riser coupling system is developed to study the effect of the tensioner performance on the dynamic response of the platform and riser 2 riser tensioner there are two main types of tensioners currently used in deepwater drilling operations wire ropes tensioner wrt and direct acting tensioner dat however due to the complexity and limited payload ability of the wrt types the dat types with hydro pneumatic have become predominant in recent offshore field developments the direct acting tensioner dat eliminates the transmission devices such as pulleys and wire ropes while the tension is directly transmitted by the hydraulic cylinder piston rod which brings advantages such as strong stability and accurate compensation to dat xuan et al 2012 all analyses in the current work are based on the direct acting tensioner dat a schematic diagram of the direct acting tensioner dat is shown in fig 1 the direct acting tensioner dat typically consists of hydro pneumatic tensioner cylinders oil gas accumulators high pressure gas vessels and low pressure gas vessels the hydro pneumatic tensioner cylinders provide almost constant tension to the riser in order to counter the balance of the overall weight of the riser and tube inside fluid the internal piston divides hydraulic cylinder into two parts low pressure pneumatic chamber and high pressure hydraulic chamber the low pressure chamber of the hydraulic cylinder is connected through a pneumatic pressure line to the low pressure gas vessels which is mainly used to provide damping effect and play the protective role of the riser tensioner system the high pressure chamber of the hydraulic cylinder is connected through a hydraulic pressure line to the oil gas accumulators which provides the tension for the riser and the tension maintained by oil pressure in this side of the hydraulic cylinder from the oil gas accumulator is pressurized by high pressure gas vessels 3 the mathematical model of the riser tensioner system the riser tensioner is a complicated structure composed of hydro pneumatic and mechanical subsystems in order to simplify the analysis principle hypothesizes of the current work are as follows 1 ignored the friction loss inside the oil gas accumulator 2 ignored the pressure loss inside the pressure line 3 ignored the quality of the piston rod and the hydraulic fluid 4 met the variation law of gas state and ignored the effect of the temperature 3 1 modelling of gas state variations supposing that there is no heat transfer the internal pressure variation of the high pressure gas cylinder satisfies the following relation 1 p a 0 v a 0 k p a 1 v a 1 k where k is the adiabatic gas constant which is 1 4 for nitrogen grønevik 2013 p a 0 is the initial pressure in the high pressure gas vessels v a 0 is the initial volume in the high pressure gas vessels p a 1 is the pressure after considering the pressure variation in the high pressure gas vessels and v a 1 is the volume after considering the volume variation in the high pressure gas vessels considering that the hydraulic fluid is incompressible it is thought that the gas volume varies along with the motion of hydraulic cylinder piston the volume variation in the high pressure gas vessels is expressed as follows 2 δ v a v a 1 v a 0 a r x p where δ v a is the variation of gas volume in the system a r is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the rod side and x p is the displacement of the piston in the hydraulic cylinder overall the pressure variations δ p a in a high pressure cylinder due to the gas volume variation can be represented as 3 δ p a p a 0 1 a r x p v a 0 k 1 similarly pressure variations δ p b in a low pressure cylinder due to the gas volume variation can be represented as 4 δ p b p b 0 1 a p x p v b 0 k 1 where p b 0 is the initial pressure in the low pressure gas vessels v b 0 is the initial volume in the low pressure gas vessels and a p is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the piston side 3 2 modelling of internal friction in hydraulic cylinder the hydraulic cylinder is an important part of tensioner its internal friction performance should not be ignored in the analysis process in order to achieve the tensioner model and to ensure the condition in simulation is in conformity with the actual operating conditions the friction model considering the stribeck effect should be the preferred for such study based on xuan et al 2012 s findings the hydraulic cylinder has significant stribeck effect when the direction of piston movement changes in hydraulic cylinder the stribeck effect occurs when the hydraulic fluid contacts with the moving piston when the piston velocity is smaller than the stribeck velocity piston limit velocity the friction decreases with the increase of the piston velocity in the stribeck model the total friction f f r is simulated as a function of relative velocity and pressure and is assumed to be the sum of stribeck coulomb and viscous components the friction can be defined by two parts the velocity dependent part f f r v and the pressure dependent part f f r p the total friction force and the two parts are defined as lee et al 2015 xuan et al 2012 marton and lantos 2007 5 f f r f f r v f f r p f f r v f c f s f c e x p v p v l s i g n v p k v v p a v f f r p k p p p r f s where f c is the coulomb friction force f

coefficient a v is the friction exponent 0 a v 1 and k p is the linear coefficient in the velocity dependent part f f r v the first term represents the coulomb friction f c which is usually defined as a constant the second term represents the mixed friction also known as stribeck effect friction which is expressed by the exponential function relation between static friction f s and stribeck velocity v l piston limit velocity the third term is the fluid dynamic fricti on viscous friction which is related to the viscous properties of the hydraulic fluid the pressure dependent part f f r p of the friction force represents the static friction force 3 3 modelling of tension variations in the direct acting tensioner system the tension is applied to the top of the riser through the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder the tension f t can be expressed as the sum of the hydraulic force produced by the pressure difference between both sides of the cylinder piston and the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder which is shown as follows 6 f t f h y d f f r the hydraulic force produced by the pressure difference between both sides of tensioner piston in the hydraulic pneumatic cylinder f h y d can be represented as 7 f h y d p r a r p p a p where p r is the pressure of the piston at the rod side a r is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the rod side p p is the pressure of the piston at the piston side and a p is the cross sectional areas of the piston at the piston side based on the gas state variations in section 2 1 the pressure difference between both sides of tensioner piston in the hydraulic pneumatic cylinder also can be represented as 8 p r p a 0 δ p a p p p b 0 δ p b for a comprehensive consideration of the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder the equation of force equilibrium on both sides of tensioner piston f t in the hydraulic pneumatic cylinder can be reformulated as 9 f t p a 0 1 a r x p v a 0 k a r p b 0 1 a p x p v b 0 k a p f f r the tensioner is an important connection between the platform and riser and its performance will be affected by the relative movement between the platform and riser however in the traditional tensioner analysis process pestana et al 2016 and mao et al 2016 normally used the platform motions as the input signal of the tensioner piston which is not in accordance with the actual operation conditions unlike those studies the real time responses of the platform and riser at the connected location are inputted to the tensioner to simulate the coupling dynamic response of the tensioner with the platform and riser system in this paper therefore the calculation formula of the tensioner model in the simulation process can be rewritten by the parametric formulation 10 f t p a 0 1 a r x

cylinder respectively x r i s e r and v r i s e r are the real time displacement of the connection point between the riser and tensioner along the tensioner cylinder respectively these parameters can be extracted dynamically by user subroutines from ansys aqwa result file the schematic diagram of the tensioner between the platform and riser is shown in fig 2 4 performance of the tensioner system based on the mathematical model for each components of the tensioner system the tensioner performance can be simulated by using matlab program to study the effect of the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder on the tension variations the direct acting tensioner used on the hysy 981 deepwater semi submersible drilling platform was taken as an example for the current study the input piston stroke signal of the tensioner cylinder is consisted of a cyclostationary sinusoidal signal assuming that the sinusoidal signal is with an amplitude of 5 m and time period of 10 s while the piston is in the mid stroke at the initial time the basic parameters of the tensioner system are shown in table 1 4 1 analysis of internal friction effect in hydraulic cylinder in the tensioner system the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is closely related to the piston movement and frictional pressure drop based on eq 5 we compiled the matlab program to analyze the variation of internal friction in the hydraulic cylinder the values of the corresponding parameters are as follows the limit velocity of the piston in the hydraulic cylinder is 0 05 m s the pressure drop due to friction is 2 bar the coulomb friction coefficient is 0 5 the viscous friction coefficient is 65818 ns m and the viscous friction index is 1 the calculation results are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 fig 3 shows the variation of the friction with the piston velocity the total internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder is mainly composed of three parts the pressure dependent friction the viscous friction and the stribeck effect friction as shown in fig 3 the pressure dependent friction is a constant regardless of the piston velocity the viscous friction increases linearly with the increase of piston velocity and the stribeck effect friction is closely related to the limit velocity of the piston when the piston velocity is lower than a certain value 0 05 m s the total friction force increases with the decrease of the piston velocity due to the stribeck effect when the piston velocity equals to 0 the velocity changes from a positive value to a negative one and the total friction also changes abruptly from a positive value to a negative one fig 4 shows the variation of stribeck effect friction and piston velocity with time as shown in fig 4 the stribeck effect friction decreases with increasing piston velocity until piston velocity goes beyond the limit after which the stribeck effect friction keeps as a constant in addition the stribeck effect friction reaches the maximum when the piston velocity is zero and changes suddenly when the direction of velocity changes 4 2 performance of the tensioner system under cyclic displacement the reciprocating motion of the piston is regarded as cyclic displacement in the current study in the analysis of tensioner system we take the down stroke as positive and take the up stroke as negative respectively in order to analyze the influence of internal friction of hydraulic cylinder the tensioner models considering separately the state variation of gas and internal friction of hydraulic cylinder are developed specially in the current work the simulated tension stroke curve at the piston side chamber of a single cylinder in the tensioner system is shown in fig 5 firstly when the tension is assumed to be related to the state variation of gas only the relation between the tension and the piston stroke is shown in curve 1 fig 5 as shown by curve 1 the relationship between the tension and the piston stroke is nonlinear so the tensioner model considering only the state variation of gas is named as nonlinear tensioner model when the piston is displaced upward with respect to the cylinder housing it will cause the hydraulic fluid to flow from the accumulator to the hydraulic cylinder meantime the pressure of the high pressure hydraulic chamber will be reduced and the tension will be reduced accordingly otherwise the pressure of the high pressure hydraulic chamber will be increased and the tension will be increased accordingly in addition calculation results show that the tension ranges from 1 9 mn to 2 68 mn under a given piston dynamic stroke from 5 m to 5 m secondly when the tension is assumed to be also related to the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder the relation between the tension and the piston stroke is shown in curve 2 fig 5 as shown by curve 2 the relationship between them is similar to a hysteretic curve the tensioner model of considering internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is thus named as hysteretic tensioner model and the time history curve of tension and piston displacement under the single cylinder of hysteretic tensioner model are shown in fig 6 when the piston is displaced upward with respect to the cylinder housing the tension will be reduced with the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder otherwise the tension will be increased when the piston is displaced downward with respect to the cylinder housing in addition when the piston stroke reaching stop positon the tension will have the sudden change due to the viscous friction of tensioner cylinder and the tension has opposite change with piston movement when the piston velocity is lower than the limit value this result was caused by the impact of the stribeck effect friction of the tensioner cylinder the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder contributes to the tension loss the friction caused tension loss expressed as a percentage of the total tension is shown in fig 7 it shows that the tension loss due to the internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is up to 13 6 of the total tension among this 13 6 tension loss 10 4 is due to the viscous friction while the contribution of the stribeck effect friction and pressure dependent friction is similar with a proportion of 2 1 and 2 2 respectively based on the current results it can be concluded that the internal friction can not be omitted in the performance analysis of tensioner 5 response analysis of platform tensioner riser coupling system based on the tensioner mathematical model established in the previous section 2 the platform tensioner riser coupling system was established by implementing the tensioner system model into commercial software ansys aqwa through user subroutines written in python scripts in the ansys aqwa module the platform geometry model can be created in workbench using design modeler the riser string is modeled by the tethers connections and the tensioner can be joined between the platform and the riser string by the external force calculation program a full platform tensioner riser coupling system is thus developed and the effect of the performance of the tensioner on platform and riser dynamic response is simulated 5 1 model dimensions and wave conditions the current study takes the hysy 981 deepwater semi submersible drilling platform as an example to analyze the dynamic response of the platform tensioner riser coupling system in accordance with the demands of actual drilling operation the normal operating wave conditions which is extensively applied in south china sea is chosen for the study meanwhile in order to check the applicability of the tensioner used in the coupling system the overall dynamic response under different regular waves and irregular waves is analyzed the corresponding wave condition parameters are shown in table 2 the overall model of the platform and the riser system has been established in the hydrodynamic analysis software ansys aqwa in ansys aqwa hydrodynamic analysis the schematic of drilling platform model is shown in fig 8 and the principal dimensions of drilling platform and riser system are shown in table 3 and table 4 here the catenary mooring are adopted and the parameters of mooring system are shown in table 5 and table 6 by the coupling dynamic response analysis the vertical movement between the platform and the riser and the tension on the top of the riser are analyzed to investigate the performance of the hysteretic tensioner model under regular waves1 fig 9 and fig 10 present the vertical relative movement of the platform and the riser and the tension on the top of the riser under regular waves1 respectively the results show that the tension does change with the relative movement in real time when the platform moves upward relative to the riser the riser tension increases with the relative displacements in addition fig 10 shows that the tension increases with decreasing relative velocity value when the velocity is close to 0 and has a sudden change when the relative velocity is 0 this is similar to the variation trend shown in fig 6 and the main difference between the two graphs figs 10 and fig 6 is that the scope of the suddenly changed tension in fig 10 takes a larger proportion of the total tension variation when compared to that shown in fig 6 the reason of this difference is that the range of relative displacement and relative velocity are smaller than the range of piston stroke and piston velocity in fig 6 based on the traditional nonlinear tensioner model the overall dynamic response of the two different tensioner models are compared and analyzed fig 11 a shows the vertical relative displacement variation based on the two different tensioner models as shown in fig 11a the time history curves of the relative displacement from different tensioner models are similar and the scope of vertical relative displacement from the nonlinear tensioner model is slightly smaller than that from the hysteretic tensioner model it can be concluded that the hysteretic tensioner also can compensate the relative movement between the platform and the riser as the nonlinear tensioner unlike the variation of vertical relative displacement the tension variation from the two tensioner models has a great difference as shown in fig 11 b the tension provided by the hysteretic tensioner model and the nonlinear tensioner model varied from 5 728 mn to 6 605 mn and from 5 948 mn to 6 397 mn under the regular waves1 respectively it shows that the variation range of the tension from the hysteretic tensioner model is larger than that from the nonlinear tensioner model and fig 11b also shows that the tension will has a sudden change for the hysteretic tensioner model due to the internal friction of the tensioner cylinder which has an impact on the fatigue life of the riser in addition fig 11 c shows the relation between tension and relative displacement based on different tensioner models as shown in fig 11c the variation curves of tension with the relative displacement for both the nonlinear tensioner model and the hysteretic tensioner model are identical with the original curves shown in fig 5 in order to confirm the applicability of the hysteretic tensioner model under different wave conditions the overall coupled dynamic response under different wave periods is analyzed fig 12 a and fig 12 b present the vertical relative movement variation of the platform and the riser and the tension variation under different regular waves respectively it turned out that the variation scope of the relative displacement and the tension under regular waves1 are larger than that under regular waves2 under the regular waves2 the relative displacement varied from 2 m to 10 5 m and the tension varied from 5 19 mn to 7 15 mn and the tension does change with the relative movement in real time in addition compared with the stroke range of the tensioner piston it can also be found that the relative displacement variation under regular waves2 is in a reasonable scope these results indicated that the hysteretic tensioner model can effectively compensate the relative movement between the platform and the riser under the regular waves2 5 2 coupled dynamic response analysis under irregular waves aimed at the random characteristics of the wave conditions in the actual operation process the coupling dynamic response such as the vertical movement between the platform and the riser and the tension on the top of the riser are analyzed for the hysteretic tensioner model under the irregular waves the selected irregular waves type in this paper is pierson moskowitz spectrum the corresponding wave parameters of pierson moskowitz spectrum is shown in table 2 and the wave spectrum curve of the pierson moskowitz spectrum is shown in fig 13 the results of the coupled dynamic response analysis are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 the results also show that the tension does change with the relative movement in real time as shown in fig 14 the tension reaches maximum when the value of vertical relative displacement between the platform and the riser reaches maximum the corresponding tension and relative displacement varied from 5 635 mn to 6 579 mn and from 4 85 m to 7 3 m respectively fig 15 shows the variation trend of tension and relative velocity under irregular waves in addition comparing the result with the regular waves it shows that the variation law of fig 15 is identical to the fig 10 based on the overall dynamic response analysis under the irregular waves the calculation results based on the two different tensioner models under irregular waves are compared fig 16 a and fig 16 b show the relative displacement variation and the tension variation from analyses using the two different tensioner models respectively it can be found that the time history curves of the relative displacement for the two different tensioner models under irregular waves are similar to those results under regular waves this result shows that the hysteretic tensioner model can be applied in different wave conditions similarly under the irregular waves the hysteretic tensioner model also has a great scope of tension variation than the nonlinear tensioner model as shown in fig 16b the tension provided by the hysteretic tensioner model and the nonlinear tensioner model varied from 5 635 mn to 6 579 mn and from 5 826 mn to 6 356 mn under the irregular waves respectively fig 16 c shows the variation trend of the vertical relative displacement with tension from analyses using the two different tensioner models and the relations between tension and relative displacement for the different tensioner models are identical to that shown in fig 11c in addition compared with the periodic dynamic response under regular waves1 the tension variation under the irregular waves is random variation due to the existence of the high frequency component under the irregular waves the tension would change suddenly several times in a relatively short period which put forward higher requirement for the fatigue life of the tensioner and riser 6 conclusions and future studies in this paper the mathematical model of the direct acting riser tensioner system was developed to analyze the impact of internal friction of hydraulic cylinder on the tensioner performance the platform tensioner riser coupling system was established by implementing the tensioner system model into commercial software ansys aqwa through user subroutines written in python scripts the overall coupling dynamic response of the system under different wave conditions was investigate as a result of the analysis some significant conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 for the tensioner considering the internal friction of the hydraulic cylinder the relationship between tension and piston stroke is not a simple nonlinear relationship but a hysteretic loop relationship moreover when the piston stroke reaching stop positon the tension will have the sudden change due to the viscous friction of tensioner cylinder and due to the stribeck effect friction the tension will have opposite change with piston movement when the piston velocity is lower than the limit value 2 by comparing the calculation results from different tensioner models the scope of vertical relative displacement under the nonlinear tensioner model is slightly smaller than that for the hysteretic tensioner model the scope of the tension under the hysteretic tensioner model is larger than that for the nonlinear tensioner and the tension also has a sudden change under the hysteretic tensioner model due to the internal friction of the tensioner cylinder in addition due to the existence of the high frequency component under the irregular waves the tension of the hysteretic tensioner model will complete more sudden changes in a relatively short period which has an impact on the fatigue life of the riser and tensioner in this study a tensioner model considering internal friction of hydraulic cylinder is established which is more consistent with the working condition and by using the ansys aqwa the overall coupling dynamic response can be really simulate under the normal operating conditions in the future work the emergency disconnection of the riser under dangerous conditions will be analyzed the model is further verified by analyzing the overall dynamic response during the emergency disconnection of the riser acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the support provided by program for changjiang scholars and innovative research team in university irt 14r58

eulerian finite element method shockwave bubble pulsation 1 introduction the underwater explosion is an important research topic in both military and civilian fields the pressure load caused by the underwater explosion can lead to much more serious damage on a nearby structure than the same explosive detonated in air because the water is more capable in transmitting the shockwave load furthermore the bubble consisting of the gaseous productions will move violently in the water after the shockwave radiation if the explosive is placed at a proper location the bubble may impact the nearby structure with its high speed liquid jet and the secondary bubble pulsation load in the past few decades many researches have devoted themselves into the studies on the underwater explosion cole cole 1948 summarized the proceeding works on the underwater explosion and established the main framework of this subject which had been a significant guidance to the following studies because of the large ratios in both time and space between the shockwave phase and the bubble motion phase there re great difficulties in simulating the whole process of the underwater explosion continuously especially in times that the computational resources are extremely limited the shockwave phase of the underwater explosion is used to being predicted by the empirical formulas fitted by the experiments data cole 1948 geers and hunter 2002 price 1979 for the far field pressure profile many formulas have enough accuracy for the engineering application because the disturbance of the fluid is so small that the problem can be easily linearized however when the near field pressure is concerned most empirical formulas lose accuracy because the nonlinearity arises jin et al 2017 ming et al 2016 bubble motion is one of the most important aspects in which the underwater explosion differs from the air blast the bubble oscillates in the water and radiates bubble pulsation load outward every time it reaches its minimum volume meanwhile the bubble will interact with the nearby boundaries and develop high speed jet extensive studies have been carried out on the bubble dynamics geers and

2015 however the incompressible or weak compressible assumption of the fluid limits it in the simulation of the shockwave phase and the energy lose mechanism of the bubble oscillation is difficult to simulate accurately liu et al adopted the finite volume method with the interface captured by front tracking method to study the collapse of a bubble near a solid wall liu et al 2017 wang et al used

out by barras et al with the ale method on the pulsating bubble phenomenon of the underwater explosion barras et al 2012 zhang et al developed a fully coupled fluid structure interaction numerical model to investigate the damage of an underwater explosion bubble on the submerged structures zhang et al 2017 however these works seldom simulated the shockwave and the bubble oscillation phase continuously the eulerian finite element method efem is an effective approach in computational fluid dynamics which has been widely used in the hydrocodes benson 1992a benson and okazawa 2004 tian et al 2018 the operator split technique makes it flexible to be combined with other numerical techniques in this paper the underwater explosion in the free field is simulated with the efem the paper is organized as follows firstly the basic theoretical and numerical models are presented and the special treatments of the model is elaborated in details then 2 cases of underwater explosion are investigated with the numerical model which is validated by the experiment then some conclusions are drawn to offer reference to the relevant studies 2 theoretical and numerical method 2 1 eulerian finite element method with operator split in this paper the fluid field of underwater explosion is concerned if the explosive is spherical and other fluid boundaries are ignored the fluid flow motion in the gravity field can be treated as axisymmetric therefore a cylindrical coordinate system is established with its origin locating at the center of the explosive and the revolving axis pointing to the opposite direction of the gravity as shown in fig 1 r and z denote the radial and the axial coordinates respectively the computational domain is taken as a rectangle sized by a 2a the efem is adopted in this paper to simulate the underwater explosion with proper efficiency and accuracy the detailed main framework of this method can refer to the published papers benson 1992a 1992b 2008 benson and okazawa 2004 the reynolds number of the fluid field around the underwater explosion is usually high enough to ignore the viscosity best 2002 klaseboer et al 2005b liu et al 2016b wang and khoo 2004 zhang and liu 2015 then the stress tensor can be simplified as a scalar of pressure and satisfies the momentum conservation equations 1 u t p u u ρ g where u is the velocity vector and u ρ u is the momentum ρ and p are the density and the pressure of the fluid g is the gravity acceleration the third term in eq 1 is the convection term and requires upwind scheme to be solved which is hard to implement in traditional fem thus with the operator split technique eq 1 is decomposed into two equations 2 u t p ρ g and 3 u t u u 0 after these two equations are solved the increments of u are added together to update the real u because of the absence of the convection term in eq 2 it is based on the perspective of lagrange and easy to be solved with traditional fem in the present cylindrical coordinate system it can be written in the form of weighted residual method with v denoting the weight function 4 ω r ρ u v p v d ω γ r p n ˆ v d γ ω r g v d ω ω p v r d ω where the integral by parts and the gauss green formula are used to eliminate the calculation of the gradient of p wu and gu 2012 n ˆ is the unit normal vector at the boundary γ of the integral domain ω pointing outward of ω taking φ as the shape function of the element and choose it as the weight function eq 4 can be rewritten in the semi discretized form 5 n ω r ρ φ m φ n d ω u n ω r g φ m r p φ m d ω γ r p n ˆ φ m d γ ω p φ m r d ω here m and n are the nodal number and u n is the unknown nodal acceleration vector calculated by solving eq 5 efficiently with the lumped mass matrix then the nodal velocity and displacement are advanced explicitly with the second order central difference method 6 u n 1 2 u n 1 2 δ t u n 7 u n 1 u n δ t u n 1 2 where the superscript stands for the number of the increment δ t is the time increment which is limited by δ t l c 0 l is the smallest edge length of the elements and c 0 is the dilatational wave speed after the nodal position is calculated the density and the internal energy of each element can be updated as follows 8 ρ t ρ u 0 9 ρ e m t p u 0 where e m is the internal energy per unit mass and the fluid is assumed to be adiabat because the time period of the underwater explosion is short enough to neglect the thermal conduction the equation of state eos of the fluid outside of the bubble is chosen as the tait equation qiu et al 2008 10 p ρ e m γ 1 γ p w where γ is the ratio of specific heat and p w is the reference pressure combining eq 9 with eq 10 we can easily obtain the dilatational wave speed c 0 11 c 0 2 d p d ρ e m p ρ γ 1 the pressure of the internal gaseous products of the explosive are modeled with the jones wilkens lee jwl equation lee et al 1968 12 p a 1 ω ρ r 1 ρ 0 e 1 b 1 ω ρ r 2 ρ 0 e 2 ω ρ e m where a b r 1 r 2 and ω are the material constants ρ 0 and ρ are the densities of the explosive and the gaseous products e 1 and e 2 are defined as 13 e 1 exp ρ 0 ρ r 1 e 2 exp ρ 0 ρ r 2 similarly the dilatation wave speed c for the gaseous products can be written as 14 c 0 2 ω 1 ω e m a e 1 r 1 ρ 0 b e 2 ρ 0 r 2 ρ 0 ρ 2 a r 1 e 1 b r 2 e 2 the material constants used in this paper are listed in table 1 after the mesh and the variables are advanced forward in a time increment the mesh is moved back to its original position to eliminate the element distortion and to solve eq 3 this procedure refers to the eulerian phase which considers the advection quantities between adjacent elements during the moving back of the mesh the convected volume is calculated with the volume of fluid vof benson 1992a hirt and nichols 1981 method with the prescribed velocity calculated in the lagrangian phase then the element centered variables such as the transported mass and internal energy are updated subsequently to archive a second order accuracy the muscl algorithm benson 1992a van leer 1977 is adopted to transport the element centered variables conventionally the muscl algorithm takes the element centered variable as the average value of the element then by introducing a second order distribution among the adjacent elements in each direction the gradient of the variable is calculated as the slope at the element center with specific slope limiters theoretically the conservativeness requires that the integration over each element with the linear distribution defined by the slopes equals to the integration with the constant distribution however the muscl algorithm must be modified to maintain conservativeness in the axisymmetric model because of the coefficient r in the volumetric integration in the cylindrical coordinate system thus for an element centered variable ϕ a correction ϕ c must be considered to preserve the conservativeness 15 s e r ϕ ϕ c p p e ϕ d s s e r ϕ e d s where the subscript ϕ e is the value at the element center of element s e ϕ is the gradient of ϕ at the element center determined by the calculated slopes p is the coordinate vector of the integration point and p e is the coordinate of the element center then ϕ c can be expressed as 16 ϕ c s e r d s s e r ϕ e d s s e r ϕ e p p e ϕ d s for the structured mesh with the element edges parallel to the axis and bounded by r r 1 r 2 and z z 1 z 2 ϕ c can be simply calculated with 17 ϕ c e r ϕ r c r 1 r 2 1 3 r 3 1 2 r c r 2 r 2 r 1 in the present model the momentum is stored at the nodes thus it cannot be transported with the muscl algorithm the half index shift algorithm benson 1992b 2008 is adopted in this paper to transport the momentum 2 2 non reflecting boundary condition for the underwater explosion simulation the non reflecting boundary condition is essential for the accuracy the non reflecting boundary condition should absorb the outward pressure wave effectively to avoid the spurious reflection at the same time the long term effect on the computational domain must be minimized to preserve the accurate oscillation of the bubble to archive the non reflecting effect a proper surface pressure must be applied to the boundary of the computational domain and taken into account in the second integration at the right side of eq 5 according to the bernoulli equation for irrotational flow we can decompose the total pressure into three parts 18 p p 1 2 ρ u 2 p d where the first term p p atm ρgh is the undisturbed pressure at the same depth the second term is nonlinear and decreases along with r 2and r is the distance to the center of the bubble if the computational domain is taken large enough this term is negligible for the outer boundary the third term p d in eq 18 is the transient term based on the linearized acoustic assumption which is reasonable when the computational domain is sufficient large the dynamic pressure p d and the material velocity u satisfy the second order early time approximation eta2 equation felippa 1980 19 p d κ p c p d d t ρ c u e where e is the unit vector pointing to the direction that the acoustic wave propagating and κ p is the local mean curvature of the surface s which is taken as the wave front in this paper as we can see that the second term at the left side of eq 19 is the effect of the curvature because the boundary of the computational domain is not always coinciding with the wave front surface the calculation of the curvature κ p is important to the accuracy if the bubble moves in an infinite field no physical reflection wave should be observed at the non reflecting boundary thus all the incident waves come directly from the bubble and κ p can be taken as 1 r for simplicity where r is the distance to the bubble center considering the size of the computational domain should be much larger than the size of the bubble this simplification has a second order accuracy 3 results and discussion in free field the jet evolution due to the buoyancy is an important feature except for the pulsation this feature can be represented by the non dimensional buoyancy parameter klaseboer et al 2005a 20 δ ρ g r m p when δ is 0 there is no buoyancy effect and the bubble tends to pulsate spherically with δ increasing an upward jet would develop during the collapsing phase of a bubble with a great δ in this paper 2 groups of cases are investigated with different buoyancy parameters 3 1 model validation and asymmetry of bubble pulsation load firstly cases with small buoyancy parameters are considered in this case a tnt explosive weighted 0 5 kg is detonated at the depth of 10 m an experiment is carried out in a cylindrical water tank with a radius of 24 m and a depth of 20 m for comparison the maximum radius of the bubble can be calculated with the empirical formula klaseboer et al 2005a 21 r m 3 38 w h 10 1 3 where w is the explosive weight with the unit of kilogram specifically r m 0 988 m for this case thus the buoyancy parameter δ is small and equals 0 22 because r m is much smaller than the tank size and the initial depth effects of the free surface and the tank wall are ignored in the simulation the computational domain is taken as a rectangle with a 5 r m as shown in fig 1 and is discretized into square elements with the length l e 0 01 r m the simulation is performed on a pc with core i7 4790 3 6 ghz and 16 gb memery openmp is used in the code to accelerate the simulation the simulation takes about 5 h the pressure contour of the numerical results during the shockwave phase is shown in fig 2 the results show that the shockwave radiated from the detonated explosive propagates outward spherically a sharp front of the shockwave is preserved in the simulation the shockwave reaches the boundary of the computational domain at t 3 04 ms little spurious reflection wave emerges which is attributed to the non reflecting boundary condition based on eta2 as shown in fig 2 e 2 pressure sensors are placed 3 m away from the explosive at the same depth in the simulation and the experiment respectively to demonstrate the convergence of the numerical model with respect to the domain size a 7 simulation results are compared together in which a is taken from 2r m to 5r m here we define a non dimensional parameter θ to represent the reflection of the present non reflecting boundary 22 θ p r p p i p where p i and p r are the amplitudes of the incident pressure and the reflected pressure at the boundary fig 3 shows the change of θ with r m a we can see that the reflection parameter θ is linearly related to r m a considering the incident wave p i is nearly proportional to 1 a the computational results of the reflected wave converge to θ with the same rate as 1 a 2 the pressure profiles along time are compared in fig 4 for shockwave which are from the present model with different element size l e the geers hunter model geers and hunter 2002 geers and park 2005 and the experiment we can see that with the decrease of l e the shock wave profile from the present model gets more sharp and converges to the experimental one in spite of that the numerical model smears the shockwave a little the profile of the shockwave pressure calculated by the numerical model with l e 0 01r m agrees with the experimental results well as shown in fig 4 obviously the geers hunter model based on the linear assumption fails in predicting the arrival time of shockwave because the wave speed is assumed constant and equals to the sound speed actually the shockwave speed is faster than the sound speed in the near field of underwater explosion at t 2 05 ms a small fluctuation is observed only in the experiment results this is very likely caused by the wave structure of the internal gas after the explosive is detonated at the center a detonation wave propagates outward when the detonation is completed and the detonation wave reaches the explosive water interface a rarefaction wave and a shock wave travel inward and outward from the interface the outward wave makes up the main part of the shock wave the inward rarefaction wave will reflect at the bubble center and radiate a pressure disturbance into the surrounding flow field which refers to the pressure fluctuation after the initial shockwave by contrast the detonation process is not included in the numerical model so that the pressure profile is decreasing smoothly without the fluctuation the bubble evolution and the surrounding pressure field are shown in fig 5 the explosive is detonated and the gas bubble starts expanding at t 0 ms high pressure shockwave and bubble load radiate from the gas bubble outward the bubble keeps expanding and reaches its maximum volume at t 66 7 ms and starts collapsing due to the pressure difference between the internal gas and the ambient fluid attributing to the gradient of the ambient pressure caused by the gravity the lower side of the bubble subjects to greater ambient pressure than the upper side of the bubble thus the lower side of the bubble collapses faster consequently the water converges together beneath the bubble and produces a high pressure region which accelerates the collapse of the bottom of the bubble further therefore a high speed upward jet emerges during the collapsing phase and penetrates the bubble into toroidal at t 134 8 ms at the same time a high pressure region emerges at the toroidal eye due to the jet impact which exists during the whole rebound phase of the bubble the bubble reaches its minimum volume during the collapsing phase at t 135 0 ms and the internal gas pressure reaches its peak meanwhile a bubble pulsation pressure wave radiates away from the pressed bubble then the bubble starts rebounding and the second pulsation period begins the bubble pulsation loads of the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 6 the results show good agreement in general except that the pressure peak is a little wider in the simulation the arrival time of the pulsation load is determined by both the wave speed and the bubble period as the distance of the pressure sensor from the bubble is relatively near the error of the bubble period would overide that of the wave speed and the effect of the wave speed can be neglected the arrival time of the bubble pulsation load is 136 7 ms in the numerical results with an error of 0 2 compared with the 137 0 ms in the experiment compared with the geers hunter model the present model preserves more accuracy in predicting the bubble period furthermore the bubble pulsation load is treated as spherical symmetric in the geers hunter model while it s not true for the near field it s easy to find the center of the bubble pulsation pressure wave is at about 0 0 5 because the upward migration of the bubble due to the buoyancy the pressure profiles in the 3 directions which are upward downward and horizontal directions at t 136 ms and 137 ms are drawn in fig 7 to investigate the distribution of the bubble pulsation load in different directions apparently the bubble pulsation load at the downward direction is greater than the others which can be attributed to the high pressure region beneath the bubble before the penetration which breaks the symmetry of the pressure field around the bubble furthermore the bubble plays a role in obstructing the pressure wave propagating upward previous study liu et al 2014 has pointed that the asymmetric difference between the pressure peaks in different directions is a second order infinitesimal with respect to r 1 and decays with propagation time or distance rapidly thus in the far field problems the difference can be ignored and the geers hunter model can predict accurately we also should notice that there is a smaller pressure peak at the left side of the bubble pulsation pressure peak which is only found in pressure profiles in the upward direction this pressure peak is caused by the high pressure region above the bubble after the penetration because the bubble obstructs the propagation downward of this pressure wave the pressure profile in this direction drops fastest after bubble pulsation load passed as the initial depth of the explosive is increased to 15 m the simulation results are shown in fig 8 because the explosive depth has little influence on the shockwave phase and the bubble expanding phase except the bubble pulsation period fig 8 only presents the bubble collapsing from its maximum volume at t 55 3 ms which is 11 4 ms earlier than the previous case similar bubble dynamics is shown despite the preceding in time the jet penetrates the bubble at t 112 1 ms which is 22 6 ms earlier than the first case as shown in eq 21 the maximum radius of the bubble decreases with the increasing of the depth due to the bigger ambient pressure in the deeper water the maximum radius of the bubble is smaller too the changes of the equivalent radius of the bubble and the pressure 3 m away from the explosive are drawn in fig 9 for the comparison of these two cases it s easy to find that the bubble radiates a pressure peak each time it reaches its minimum volume the first one is the shockwave generated right after the detonation the second one is the bubble pulsation load generated when the bubble collapses to its minimum volume each pressure peak delays a little compared to the change of the radius due to the propagation from the bubble to the sensor in this section the buoyancy parameters of the 2 cases are 0 220 and 0 189 respectively with these small buoyancy parameters we can see that the jet develops in the final stage of the collapsing phase and the penetration occurs near the moment when the bubble reaches its minimum volume next we will increase the weight of the explosive to investigate the bubble dynamics with large buoyancy parameter 3 2 influence of buoyancy parameter on bubble dynamics because gravity is negligable in the detonation and the propagation of the shockwave the buoyancy parameter has little effect on the shockwave phase thus only the bubble evolution is considered in this section the weight of the explosive increases from 0 5 kg to 5 kg and 50 kg at the depth of 15 m to be simulated with different buoyancy parameters the other quantities also need to be non dimensionalized to be compared together with different buoyancy parameters according to the published papers on bubble dynamics klaseboer et al 2005a zhang and liu 2015 the length scale density scale and pressure scale are taken as r m ρ and p respectively thus the time scale can be calculated with 23 t s r m ρ p and the corresponding maximum radius r m the buoyancy parameter δ and the time scale for non dimensionalization of these 3 cases are listed in table 2 for each case the bubble evolution of 4 moments at the same non dimensional time are compared together in fig 10 and the changes of the equavalent radii of the bubbles with non dimensional time are drawn in fig 11 in which the solid triangles denote the moments of the penetration and the vertical lines indicate the moment imaged in fig 10 we can see that the upward jet develops earlier in the case with a greater buoyancy parameter from the first column of fig 10 because the asymmetric velocity component caused by the jet development occupys part of the kinetic energy the pulsation process is slowed down compared with the case with lower buoyancy parameter thus the moment when the bubble reaches its minimum radius delays along with the increase of the buoyancy parameter as shown in both figs 10 and 11 meanwhile the minimum radius of the bubble also increases with the buoyancy parameter which indicates that the bubble pulsation load would be smaller in a case with a greater buoyancy parameter 4 conclusions in this paper the efem is employed to investigate the underwater explosion in the cylindrical coordinate system the muscl algorithm is modified to maintain the conservativeness in the axisymmetric model and the eta2 is adopted to approach the second order non reflecting boundary condition with the presented numerical model 2 underwater explosion cases with different initial depths are firstly simulated for both of the shockwave phase and the bubble oscillation phase continuously compared with the experimental results the numerical model predicts the underwater explosion load with a good accuracy in both amplitude and time and exhibits the capability to consider the nonlinearity in the near field for the shockwave propagation under the gravity effect the bubble collapses non spherically and developes an upward jet the bubble pulsation load has different characteristics in different directions especially in the near field the 2 high pressure regions caused by the gradient of the ambient pressure and the jet impact are the main reasons that the bubble pulsation load loses its symmetry because the asymmetry decays with the distance rapidly the spherical bubble pulsation load model can predict the pressure profile accurately in far field by contrast the asymmetry must be considered in the near field bubble pulsation load simulation then the effects of the buoyancy parameter on the bubble evolution are investigated by simulating 2 more cases with different explosive weights the results show that the increase of the buoyancy parameter could delay the penetration and extend the collapse of the bubble because the energy is occupied by the motion of the surrounding flow when the bubble reaches its minimum radius the jet development would weaken the pulsation load for a larger minimum radius acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the national natural science

out by barras et al with the ale method on the pulsating bubble phenomenon of the underwater explosion barras et al 2012 zhang et al developed a fully coupled fluid structure interaction numerical model to investigate the damage of an underwater explosion bubble on the submerged structures zhang et al 2017 however these works seldom simulated the shockwave and the bubble oscillation phase continuously the eulerian finite element method efem is an effective approach in computational fluid dynamics which has been widely used in the hydrocodes benson 1992a benson and okazawa 2004 tian et al 2018 the operator split technique makes it flexible to be combined with other numerical techniques in this paper the underwater explosion in the free field is simulated with the efem the paper is organized as follows firstly the basic theoretical and numerical models are presented and the special treatments of the model is elaborated in details then 2 cases of underwater explosion are investigated with the numerical model which is validated by the experiment then some conclusions are drawn to offer reference to the relevant studies 2 theoretical and numerical method 2 1 eulerian finite element method with operator split in this paper the fluid field of underwater explosion is concerned if the explosive is spherical and other fluid boundaries are ignored the fluid flow motion in the gravity field can be treated as axisymmetric therefore a cylindrical coordinate system is established with its origin locating at the center of the explosive and the revolving axis pointing to the opposite direction of the gravity as shown in fig 1 r and z denote the radial and the axial coordinates respectively the computational domain is taken as a rectangle sized by a 2a the efem is adopted in this paper to simulate the underwater explosion with proper efficiency and accuracy the detailed main framework of this method can refer to the published papers benson 1992a 1992b 2008 benson and okazawa 2004 the reynolds number of the fluid field around the underwater explosion is usually high enough to ignore the viscosity best 2002 klaseboer et al 2005b liu et al 2016b wang and khoo 2004 zhang and liu 2015 then the stress tensor can be simplified as a scalar of pressure and satisfies the momentum conservation equations 1 u t p u u ρ g where u is the velocity vector and u ρ u is the momentum ρ and p are the density and the pressure of the fluid g is the gravity acceleration the third term in eq 1 is the convection term and requires upwind scheme to be solved which is hard to implement in traditional fem thus with the operator split technique eq 1 is decomposed into two equations 2 u t p ρ g and 3 u t u u 0 after these two equations are solved the increments of u are added together to update the real u because of the absence of the convection term in eq 2 it is based on the perspective of lagrange and easy to be solved with traditional fem in the present cylindrical coordinate system it can be written in the form of weighted residual method with v denoting the weight function 4 ω r ρ u v p v d ω γ r p n ˆ v d γ ω r g v d ω ω p v r d ω where the integral by parts and the gauss green formula are used to eliminate the calculation of the gradient of p wu and gu 2012 n ˆ is the unit normal vector at the boundary γ of the integral domain ω pointing outward of ω taking φ as the shape function of the element and choose it as the weight function eq 4 can be rewritten in the semi discretized form 5 n ω r ρ φ m φ n d ω u n ω r g φ m r p φ m d ω γ r p n ˆ φ m d γ ω p φ m r d ω here m and n are the nodal number and u n is the unknown nodal acceleration vector calculated by solving eq 5 efficiently with the lumped mass matrix then the nodal velocity and displacement are advanced explicitly with the second order central difference method 6 u n 1 2 u n 1 2 δ t u n 7 u n 1 u n δ t u n 1 2 where the superscript stands for the number of the increment δ t is the time increment which is limited by δ t l c 0 l is the smallest edge length of the elements and c 0 is the dilatational wave speed after the nodal position is calculated the density and the internal energy of each element can be updated as follows 8 ρ t ρ u 0 9 ρ e m t p u 0 where e m is the internal energy per unit mass and the fluid is assumed to be adiabat because the time period of the underwater explosion is short enough to neglect the thermal conduction the equation of state eos of the fluid outside of the bubble is chosen as the tait equation qiu et al 2008 10 p ρ e m γ 1 γ p w where γ is the ratio of specific heat and p w is the reference pressure combining eq 9 with eq 10 we can easily obtain the dilatational wave speed c 0 11 c 0 2 d p d ρ e m p ρ γ 1 the pressure of the internal gaseous products of the explosive are modeled with the jones wilkens lee jwl equation lee et al 1968 12 p a 1 ω ρ r 1 ρ 0 e 1 b 1 ω ρ r 2 ρ 0 e 2 ω ρ e m where a b r 1 r 2 and ω are the material constants ρ 0 and ρ are the densities of the explosive and the gaseous products e 1 and e 2 are defined as 13 e 1 exp ρ 0 ρ r 1 e 2 exp ρ 0 ρ r 2 similarly the dilatation wave speed c for the gaseous products can be written as 14 c 0 2 ω 1 ω e m a e 1 r 1 ρ 0 b e 2 ρ 0 r 2 ρ 0 ρ 2 a r 1 e 1 b r 2 e 2 the material constants used in this paper are listed in table 1 after the mesh and the variables are advanced forward in a time increment the mesh is moved back to its original position to eliminate the element distortion and to solve eq 3 this procedure refers to the eulerian phase which considers the advection quantities between adjacent elements during the moving back of the mesh the convected volume is calculated with the volume of fluid vof benson 1992a hirt and nichols 1981 method with the prescribed velocity calculated in the lagrangian phase then the element centered variables such as the transported mass and internal energy are updated subsequently to archive a second order accuracy the muscl algorithm benson 1992a van leer 1977 is adopted to transport the element centered variables conventionally the muscl algorithm takes the element centered variable as the average value of the element then by introducing a second order distribution among the adjacent elements in each direction the gradient of the variable is calculated as the slope at the element center with specific slope limiters theoretically the conservativeness requires that the integration over each element with the linear distribution defined by the slopes equals to the integration with the constant distribution however the muscl algorithm must be modified to maintain conservativeness in the axisymmetric model because of the coefficient r in the volumetric integration in the cylindrical coordinate system thus for an element centered variable ϕ a correction ϕ c must be considered to preserve the conservativeness 15 s e r ϕ ϕ c p p e ϕ d s s e r ϕ e d s where the subscript ϕ e is the value at the element center of element s e ϕ is the gradient of ϕ at the element center determined by the calculated slopes p is the coordinate vector of the integration point and p e is the coordinate of the element center then ϕ c can be expressed as 16 ϕ c s e r d s s e r ϕ e d s s e r ϕ e p p e ϕ d s for the structured mesh with the element edges parallel to the axis and bounded by r r 1 r 2 and z z 1 z 2 ϕ c can be simply calculated with 17 ϕ c e r ϕ r c r 1 r 2 1 3 r 3 1 2 r c r 2 r 2 r 1 in the present model the momentum is stored at the nodes thus it cannot be transported with the muscl algorithm the half index shift algorithm benson 1992b 2008 is adopted in this paper to transport the momentum 2 2 non reflecting boundary condition for the underwater explosion simulation the non reflecting boundary condition is essential for the accuracy the non reflecting boundary condition should absorb the outward pressure wave effectively to avoid the spurious reflection at the same time the long term effect on the computational domain must be minimized to preserve the accurate oscillation of the bubble to archive the non reflecting effect a proper surface pressure must be applied to the boundary of the computational domain and taken into account in the second integration at the right side of eq 5 according to the bernoulli equation for irrotational flow we can decompose the total pressure into three parts 18 p p 1 2 ρ u 2 p d where the first term p p atm ρgh is the undisturbed pressure at the same depth the second term is nonlinear and decreases along with r 2and r is the distance to the center of the bubble if the computational domain is taken large enough this term is negligible for the outer boundary the third term p d in eq 18 is the transient term based on the linearized acoustic assumption which is reasonable when the computational domain is sufficient large the dynamic pressure p d and the material velocity u satisfy the second order early time approximation eta2 equation felippa 1980 19 p d κ p c p d d t ρ c u e where e is the unit vector pointing to the direction that the acoustic wave propagating and κ p is the local mean curvature of the surface s which is taken as the wave front in this paper as we can see that the second term at the left side of eq 19 is the effect of the curvature because the boundary of the computational domain is not always coinciding with the wave front surface the calculation of the curvature κ p is important to the accuracy if the bubble moves in an infinite field no physical reflection wave should be observed at the non reflecting boundary thus all the incident waves come directly from the bubble and κ p can be taken as 1 r for simplicity where r is the distance to the bubble center considering the size of the computational domain should be much larger than the size of the bubble this simplification has a second order accuracy 3 results and discussion in free field the jet evolution due to the buoyancy is an important feature except for the pulsation this feature can be represented by the non dimensional buoyancy parameter klaseboer et al 2005a 20 δ ρ g r m p when δ is 0 there is no buoyancy effect and the bubble tends to pulsate spherically with δ increasing an upward jet would develop during the collapsing phase of a bubble with a great δ in this paper 2 groups of cases are investigated with different buoyancy parameters 3 1 model validation and asymmetry of bubble pulsation load firstly cases with small buoyancy parameters are considered in this case a tnt explosive weighted 0 5 kg is detonated at the depth of 10 m an experiment is carried out in a cylindrical water tank with a radius of 24 m and a depth of 20 m for comparison the maximum radius of the bubble can be calculated with the empirical formula klaseboer et al 2005a 21 r m 3 38 w h 10 1 3 where w is the explosive weight with the unit of kilogram specifically r m 0 988 m for this case thus the buoyancy parameter δ is small and equals 0 22 because r m is much smaller than the tank size and the initial depth effects of the free surface and the tank wall are ignored in the simulation the computational domain is taken as a rectangle with a 5 r m as shown in fig 1 and is discretized into square elements with the length l e 0 01 r m the simulation is performed on a pc with core i7 4790 3 6 ghz and 16 gb memery openmp is used in the code to accelerate the simulation the simulation takes about 5 h the pressure contour of the numerical results during the shockwave phase is shown in fig 2 the results show that the shockwave radiated from the detonated explosive propagates outward spherically a sharp front of the shockwave is preserved in the simulation the shockwave reaches the boundary of the computational domain at t 3 04 ms little spurious reflection wave emerges which is attributed to the non reflecting boundary condition based on eta2 as shown in fig 2 e 2 pressure sensors are placed 3 m away from the explosive at the same depth in the simulation and the experiment respectively to demonstrate the convergence of the numerical model with respect to the domain size a 7 simulation results are compared together in which a is taken from 2r m to 5r m here we define a non dimensional parameter θ to represent the reflection of the present non reflecting boundary 22 θ p r p p i p where p i and p r are the amplitudes of the incident pressure and the reflected pressure at the boundary fig 3 shows the change of θ with r m a we can see that the reflection parameter θ is linearly related to r m a considering the incident wave p i is nearly proportional to 1 a the computational results of the reflected wave converge to θ with the same rate as 1 a 2 the pressure profiles along time are compared in fig 4 for shockwave which are from the present model with different element size l e the geers hunter model geers and hunter 2002 geers and park 2005 and the experiment we can see that with the decrease of l e the shock wave profile from the present model gets more sharp and converges to the experimental one in spite of that the numerical model smears the shockwave a little the profile of the shockwave pressure calculated by the numerical model with l e 0 01r m agrees with the experimental results well as shown in fig 4 obviously the geers hunter model based on the linear assumption fails in predicting the arrival time of shockwave because the wave speed is assumed constant and equals to the sound speed actually the shockwave speed is faster than the sound speed in the near field of underwater explosion at t 2 05 ms a small fluctuation is observed only in the experiment results this is very likely caused by the wave structure of the internal gas after the explosive is detonated at the center a detonation wave propagates outward when the detonation is completed and the detonation wave reaches the explosive water interface a rarefaction wave and a shock wave travel inward and outward from the interface the outward wave makes up the main part of the shock wave the inward rarefaction wave will reflect at the bubble center and radiate a pressure disturbance into the surrounding flow field which refers to the pressure fluctuation after the initial shockwave by contrast the detonation process is not included in the numerical model so that the pressure profile is decreasing smoothly without the fluctuation the bubble evolution and the surrounding pressure field are shown in fig 5 the explosive is detonated and the gas bubble starts expanding at t 0 ms high pressure shockwave and bubble load radiate from the gas bubble outward the bubble keeps expanding and reaches its maximum volume at t 66 7 ms and starts collapsing due to the pressure difference between the internal gas and the ambient fluid attributing to the gradient of the ambient pressure caused by the gravity the lower side of the bubble subjects to greater ambient pressure than the upper side of the bubble thus the lower side of the bubble collapses faster consequently the water converges together beneath the bubble and produces a high pressure region which accelerates the collapse of the bottom of the bubble further therefore a high speed upward jet emerges during the collapsing phase and penetrates the bubble into toroidal at t 134 8 ms at the same time a high pressure region emerges at the toroidal eye due to the jet impact which exists during the whole rebound phase of the bubble the bubble reaches its minimum volume during the collapsing phase at t 135 0 ms and the internal gas pressure reaches its peak meanwhile a bubble pulsation pressure wave radiates away from the pressed bubble then the bubble starts rebounding and the second pulsation period begins the bubble pulsation loads of the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 6 the results show good agreement in general except that the pressure peak is a little wider in the simulation the arrival time of the pulsation load is determined by both the wave speed and the bubble period as the distance of the pressure sensor from the bubble is relatively near the error of the bubble period would overide that of the wave speed and the effect of the wave speed can be neglected the arrival time of the bubble pulsation load is 136 7 ms in the numerical results with an error of 0 2 compared with the 137 0 ms in the experiment compared with the geers hunter model the present model preserves more accuracy in predicting the bubble period furthermore the bubble pulsation load is treated as spherical symmetric in the geers hunter model while it s not true for the near field it s easy to find the center of the bubble pulsation pressure wave is at about 0 0 5 because the upward migration of the bubble due to the buoyancy the pressure profiles in the 3 directions which are upward downward and horizontal directions at t 136 ms and 137 ms are drawn in fig 7 to investigate the distribution of the bubble pulsation load in different directions apparently the bubble pulsation load at the downward direction is greater than the others which can be attributed to the high pressure region beneath the bubble before the penetration which breaks the symmetry of the pressure field around the bubble furthermore the bubble plays a role in obstructing the pressure wave propagating upward previous study liu et al 2014 has pointed that the asymmetric difference between the pressure peaks in different directions is a second order infinitesimal with respect to r 1 and decays with propagation time or distance rapidly thus in the far field problems the difference can be ignored and the geers hunter model can predict accurately we also should notice that there is a smaller pressure peak at the left side of the bubble pulsation pressure peak which is only found in pressure profiles in the upward direction this pressure peak is caused by the high pressure region above the bubble after the penetration because the bubble obstructs the propagation downward of this pressure wave the pressure profile in this direction drops fastest after bubble pulsation load passed as the initial depth of the explosive is increased to 15 m the simulation results are shown in fig 8 because the explosive depth has little influence on the shockwave phase and the bubble expanding phase except the bubble pulsation period fig 8 only presents the bubble collapsing from its maximum volume at t 55 3 ms which is 11 4 ms earlier than the previous case similar bubble dynamics is shown despite the preceding in time the jet penetrates the bubble at t 112 1 ms which is 22 6 ms earlier than the first case as shown in eq 21 the maximum radius of the bubble decreases with the increasing of the depth due to the bigger ambient pressure in the deeper water the maximum radius of the bubble is smaller too the changes of the equivalent radius of the bubble and the pressure 3 m away from the explosive are drawn in fig 9 for the comparison of these two cases it s easy to find that the bubble radiates a pressure peak each time it reaches its minimum volume the first one is the shockwave generated right after the detonation the second one is the bubble pulsation load generated when the bubble collapses to its minimum volume each pressure peak delays a little compared to the change of the radius due to the propagation from the bubble to the sensor in this section the buoyancy parameters of the 2 cases are 0 220 and 0 189 respectively with these small buoyancy parameters we can see that the jet develops in the final stage of the collapsing phase and the penetration occurs near the moment when the bubble reaches its minimum volume next we will increase the weight of the explosive to investigate the bubble dynamics with large buoyancy parameter 3 2 influence of buoyancy parameter on bubble dynamics because gravity is negligable in the detonation and the propagation of the shockwave the buoyancy parameter has little effect on the shockwave phase thus only the bubble evolution is considered in this section the weight of the explosive increases from 0 5 kg to 5 kg and 50 kg at the depth of 15 m to be simulated with different buoyancy parameters the other quantities also need to be non dimensionalized to be compared together with different buoyancy parameters according to the published papers on bubble dynamics klaseboer et al 2005a zhang and liu 2015 the length scale density scale and pressure scale are taken as r m ρ and p respectively thus the time scale can be calculated with 23 t s r m ρ p and the corresponding maximum radius r m the buoyancy parameter δ and the time scale for non dimensionalization of these 3 cases are listed in table 2 for each case the bubble evolution of 4 moments at the same non dimensional time are compared together in fig 10 and the changes of the equavalent radii of the bubbles with non dimensional time are drawn in fig 11 in which the solid triangles denote the moments of the penetration and the vertical lines indicate the moment imaged in fig 10 we can see that the upward jet develops earlier in the case with a greater buoyancy parameter from the first column of fig 10 because the asymmetric velocity component caused by the jet development occupys part of the kinetic energy the pulsation process is slowed down compared with the case with lower buoyancy parameter thus the moment when the bubble reaches its minimum radius delays along with the increase of the buoyancy parameter as shown in both figs 10 and 11 meanwhile the minimum radius of the bubble also increases with the buoyancy parameter which indicates that the bubble pulsation load would be smaller in a case with a greater buoyancy parameter 4 conclusions in this paper the efem is employed to investigate the underwater explosion in the cylindrical coordinate system the muscl algorithm is modified to maintain the conservativeness in the axisymmetric model and the eta2 is adopted to approach the second order non reflecting boundary condition with the presented numerical model 2 underwater explosion cases with different initial depths are firstly simulated for both of the shockwave phase and the bubble oscillation phase continuously compared with the experimental results the numerical model predicts the underwater explosion load with a good accuracy in both amplitude and time and exhibits the capability to consider the nonlinearity in the near field for the shockwave propagation under the gravity effect the bubble collapses non spherically and developes an upward jet the bubble pulsation load has different characteristics in different directions especially in the near field the 2 high pressure regions caused by the gradient of the ambient pressure and the jet impact are the main reasons that the bubble pulsation load loses its symmetry because the asymmetry decays with the distance rapidly the spherical bubble pulsation load model can predict the pressure profile accurately in far field by contrast the asymmetry must be considered in the near field bubble pulsation load simulation then the effects of the buoyancy parameter on the bubble evolution are investigated by simulating 2 more cases with different explosive weights the results show that the increase of the buoyancy parameter could delay the penetration and extend the collapse of the bubble because the energy is occupied by the motion of the surrounding flow when the bubble reaches its minimum radius the jet development would weaken the pulsation load for a larger minimum radius acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the national natural science

23118,this work focuses on roll decay experiments performed on hulls normally used as fpsos considering the practical case of beam seas newton s second law and the newton euler theorem lead to coupled sway heave and roll equations for an arbitrary pole assuming symmetry the heave equation is uncoupled leaving the sway and roll equations coupled the research shows that even if inertia is decoupled damping coupling is unavoidable and cannot be neglected nevertheless a third order equation dealing only with roll can be constructed the latter is used to develop a robust approach that uses system identification techniques to obtain damping properties from the decay tests in this approach non linear damping is assessed using a cycle by cycle linear approach that uses system identification to match all the information obtained from the decay test both held over and pre oscillation tests are discussed and new concept is presented the coupled damping number cdn which relates the product of the main diagonal damping terms with coupling damping coefficients the cdn is proven to be null for potential flows and turns out to be very small even when viscous effects are present such as in decay tests at least for typical fpso hulls keywords roll damping roll center sway roll coupled damping 1 introduction since the start of the use of fpsos floating production storage and offloading platforms in the 1960 s roll motions have revealed to be a major concern for operators of these units roll motion prediction for fpsos are traditionally based on the knowledge established for conventional ships and very few works oriented to issues specific to fpsos have been published nonetheless very large roll motions with values above design predictions have been reported for fpsos over the last years implying uncomfortable conditions for the crew process plant downtime and degradation of the structural integrity of topside supports hull bilge keels and risers it should be stressed that even though many similarities can be found between an fpso and a ship these structures differ in many aspects lack of maneuvering capability weight distribution with regard to topsides and unconventional anti roll system which affects their roll behavior and places a question mark on the adequacy of currently employed methods for roll motion prediction in fact numerous works related to the estimation of roll damping in oil tankers have been published during the last decades nevertheless most have two fundamental issues which may propagate errors to damping estimation the first is related to the lack of a unique definition of the pole necessary for rotational equations despite the fact that the importance of this definition for damping estimation has been shown by some researchers this pole is in principle arbitrary as known from theory and is known as either the roll center or the center of roll however these names prove to be meaningless as they have no clear definition a better understanding of the pole would definitely improve roll estimation procedures the second fundamental issue is related to the understanding of the coupling of roll with other degrees of freedom these two issues are addressed below froude 1861 was one of the first to recognize the importance of roll motions for the operability of ships froude formulated roll damping in a linear plus quadratic velocity dependent form to account for dissipation of energy during roll motion he studied the effects of wave height and steepness on the rolling of ships and the influence of this phenomenon on the design of ship hull shape based on this work froude 1861 he suggested designing the hull in such a way as to move the ship s natural roll frequency away from synchronization with the excitation waves his work also supported the use of bilge keels to stabilize roll motion froude s method uses decay tests equating the potential energy lost to damping in each half cycle to the work done by the equivalent linearized damping moment during the same period this produces an expression for the slope of the roll decay curve as a function of the linear and nonlinear damping coefficients later on dalzell 1976 extended froude s method to the case of a linear plus cubic damping model vugts 1968 conducted several experimental assessments to determine hydrodynamic coefficients of swaying heaving and rolling cylinders in free fluid surfaces his work has been used as the basis for numerous studies assessing the roll damping of floating bodies ikeda et al 1978a proposed a new technique to estimate roll damping based on decay tests this technique separated roll damping into components but ignored their interactions and therefore the coupling of roll damping to other degrees of freedom was not taken into account ikeda et al 1978a himeno 1981 provided a good review of roll damping phenomena in a very thorough literature survey of japanese and worldwide literature on the subject this review is largely based on the work of ikeda et al 1978b faltinsen 1993 described another approach to predict damping in his approach energy loss is evaluated in terms of a linear equivalent damping coefficient equating the energy loss of an equivalent sinusoidal behavior to the energy dissipation from a quadratic equation the vast majority of roll damping studies since froude has focused on studying roll in a single degree of freedom neglecting any coupling but ikeda et al 1981 also conducted a number of forced sway and roll experiments his paper deals with viscous effects on forces and moments acting on a ship in sway and roll motion at zero forward speed and investigates roll damping and coupling terms in velocity phase of roll into sway and sway into roll from this work it can be concluded that damping coupling terms are large having the same order of magnitude as the main diagonal dampings bass and haddara 1989 1991 performed an extensive series of experiments to determine roll damping characteristics for a number of small fishing vessels in the experiments the models were attached to a dynamometer with only 2 degrees of freedom the model was free to roll and heave but restrained in all other modes his investigations included not only roll damping but also roll sway coupled damping he clearly showed the influence of roll sway and sway roll coupling on roll damping which has a non linear dependence on the position of the roll axis the axis on which the model is free to rotate standing 1991 also conducted many model tests to investigate viscous roll damping and the effect of sway and heave motions on the roll response of a transportation barge numerical examples suggest that the roll and sway equations may be decoupled if the motions are defined relative to a certain roll center his work assumes that the roll sway and heave equations are coupled only through the relative velocity term in the roll damping moment the equations are otherwise decoupled by defining them relative to the roll center this roll center however is not clearly defined during the past 40 years much more information has become available supporting that roll damping prediction is influenced by the position of the roll center the first serious discussions emerged during the 1980s when ikeda 2004 carried out forced roll tests on four fishing boat models he observed that lowering the position of the rotation axis of the forced test the roll center led to decreased roll damping bass and haddara 1989 showed that the equivalent non dimensional linear roll damping coefficient increases along with the distance between the position of the rotation axis roll center and the center of gravity chun et al 2001 arrived at the same conclusion park et al 2000 studied the effects of the position of the rotation axis again called the roll center on damping for fpso sections using decay experiments they also considered a symmetric section of an fpso and positioned the rotation axis on the symmetry plane their findings indicate that roll damping is sensitive to the position of the axis roll center on the symmetry plane roll damping will increase if the rotation axis is placed above the still water level thus far previous studies have confirmed the importance of the position of the rotation axis however for a freely floating body there is no fixed rotation axis hence a clear definition of the roll center is not traceable in the literature and in effect each researcher has his her own interpretation in the classical principles of naval architecture pna a quote states that a very rough estimate for the location of the roll center is halfway between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy implying that the roll center lies on the symmetry plane overall all relevant studies of roll motion highlight the need for a better understanding of the roll center different definitions may be found center of gravity vugts 1968 still water level center of buoyancy and others have all been considered as the roll center this difficulty can even be found in ikeda s formulations in ikeda et al 1978a and ikeda et al 1977 the quantity known as og represents the distance from the still water level to the roll axis vertical position of the roll center in other papers such as ikeda 1984 and ikeda et al 1993 og is defined as the distance from the still water level to the center of gravity stewart et al 1979 mentioned an instantaneous roll center according to his work the roll center is instantaneously at rest as the vessel moves through waves but tends to wander wildly and may move from well above to well below the vessel in irregular waves the main reason why stewart s formulation was not taken up by other researchers is not very clear roberts and dacunha 1985 identified the roll center as a point where the roll equation decouples from sway which is in fact impossible since damping coupling still remains see below later on standing 1991 proposed the following definition when there is significant damping the roll center may be defined as the point of minimum sway response in a forced roll or free decay type of experiment or simulation when a pure moment is applied this is an obscure sentence at least for the present authors in both references the position of the roll center is assumed to be constant and independent of frequency the mismatch of roll center definitions may have motivated molin 2002 to call it the mystérieux center du roulis mysterious roll center in french recently fernandes et al 2015 2016 have noticed that the instantaneous center of rotation icr that is the point with zero velocity varies in time as predicted by newtonian mechanics fernandes et al 2015 2016 also proposed the concept of a most often instantaneous roll center moirc value as also discussed below of course this moirc value could be called the roll center but the authors see no reason to do that in fact the roll center and the center of roll for that matter seems indeed to be a fantasy that does not help those working with roll damping estimation based on the challenges described above this work presents an innovative robust approach to assess roll damping of fpsos taking into account a correct definition of the pole on which to center the motion equations as well as the influence of the unavoidable coupled damping for sway and roll damping estimation using both numerical and experimental techniques 2 third order equation the motion of a floating body exposed to external forces such as wind wave and currents takes place in six degrees of freedom the motion equations can be derived using the newton euler or lagrange equations clayton and bishop 1982 expressed general fully nonlinear equations of rigid body kinetics in a vectorial framework in order to construct the governing motion equations the following assumptions and simplifications are made i the floating body is slender and rigid with a symmetry plane ii motion amplitude is small so that equations can be linearized iii the effects of viscosity are neglected except for roll motion a right handed co ordinate system x y z is considered with respect to an arbitrary position o as shown in fig 1 the translation displacements in x y and z directions with respect to the origin denoted by η 1 η 2 and η 3 indicate surge sway and heave respectively the angular displacements about the same set of axis η 4 η 5 and η 6 indicate roll pitch and yaw respectively under the above assumptions three linearly coupled differential homogeneous equations of motion in a vertical plane for a free roll decay test imposing an initial roll displacement on a freely floating body can be written as 2 1 j 2 4 k 2 4 m j k a j k η k b j k η k c j k η k 0 where m j k are the components of the generalized mass matrix of the ship and z c is the vertical distance of the pole to the center of gravity a j k and b j k are the frequency dependent added mass and damping coefficients respectively and c j k are the hydrostatic restoring coefficients due to symmetry the generalized forms of mass added mass and damping matrix coefficients

is easy to inertially decouple the roll and sway equations by moving the origin of the coordinate system to a position at which the mass matrix is diagonal zero off diagonal elements this position of the origin is referred to here as the inertial decoupling point idp a new set of sway and roll equations can then be written for the idp coordinate system as 2 3 2 3 m a 22 0 0 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p η

the coupling added mass a 42 c g can be easily obtained by the formula 2 4 2 4 z i d p z c g a 42 c g m a 22 note that despite the roll being inertially decoupled non zero coupled damping terms b 24 i d p and b 42 i d p still remain these terms are by no means small as shown below indeed these terms are numerically large having the same order of magnitude as b 22 and b 44 i d p so the quote from the pna lewis 1989 stating that roll is still coupled to the sway equation but only through the coefficient b 42 and this coupling is not strong therefore we ignore the coupling terms does not seem to be correct another relevant point is related to equation 2 5 which corresponds to the second line of equation 2 3 2 5 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p η 4 b 42 i d p η 2 b 44 i d p η 4 c 44 i d p η 4 0 this is the roll equation and it is clear that it includes a term depending on sway velocity and a damping coupling term however for decades the equation for one degree of freedom has been used in the literature recall the pna quote mentioned above lewis 1989 ignoring this coupling dependent term 2 6 2 6 η 4 b η 4 η 4 k η 4 η 4 0 note that equation 2 6 has no theoretical basis unless b 42 i d p η 2 0 for some reason in fact during decay tests especially for the pure moment method see below the sway velocity might be small but the coupling damping term is not as shown below even if this were the case the pole of the equation with one degree of freedom defined according to equation 2 4 can only be the idp it definitely cannot be the cg center of gravity or another point one can find in the literature studies that place the pole at the cg then use the parallel axis theorem to get the damping with respect to the idp which is conceptually wrong now note that the sway roll problem is semi definite since the sway mode has no restoring force hence the system is initially of fourth order as seen in equation 2 2 but it may become third order if the pole is positioned on the idp in fact as shown in appendix a the system of equation 2 3 may be written as 2 7 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p η 4 b 22 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p m a 22 b 44 i d p η 4 b 22 b 44 i d p b 24 i d p b 42 i d p m a 22 c 44 i d p η

equation 2 7 is homogeneous involving only roll the coupling terms add to the roll restoring term which multiplies η 4 hence the remainder of this work will deal with equation 2 7 to address the roll problem on an innovative robust basis also note that in principle once η 4 is know it can be used to obtain η 2 and plug it into equation 2 8 allowing η 2 to be obtained after integration a comprehensive 3rd order roll equation including the coupling terms is presented here the 3rd order equation is used in a robust method to assess roll damping in the non linear quadratic case including the influence of coupling terms 3 linear system identification equation 2 7 can be written in dimensionless form as 3 1 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p c ˆ 44

account the initial conditions k 1 k 2 and k 3 considering free roll decay the general solution for the linear roll response can be represented in exponential form as seen below 3 3 η 4 t k 1 e λ 1 t k 2 e λ 2 t k 3 e λ 3 t the linear equivalent coefficients of the roll equation 3 1 can be obtained by applying a linear system identification technique to every cycle of the roll time series linear system identification assumes that the roll response has a form such as that of equation 3 3 for a cycle peak to peak or trough to trough with period t and proceeds by applying non linear least squares using the levenberg marquardt method levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 moré 1978 to the above equation in order to obtain k i and λ i the coefficients of the 3rd order equation 3 1 can be obtained by providing the correct values of k i and λ i obtained from linear system identification for the following initial conditions η 4 0 θ 0 η 4 0 0 η 4 0 c ˆ 44 i d p θ 0 with known k i and λ i the

22 b ˆ 44 i d p and b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p can be obtained from equation 3 4 note that this is a procedure that gets all the information available from the decay test which is another proposal of the present work this is unlike the froude and faltinsen methods which use global properties the potential energy difference in the former and the equivalent harmonic energy dissipation in the latter 4 linear validation to validate the si system identification method time series were generated based on the coefficients of numerical model for different initial angles θ 0 and linear damping coefficients provided by the general solution of equations with the idp as the origin linear dampings are extracted from the time series by applying the si and compared with exact numerical solutions in fig 2 it has been observed that the non dimensional order of magnitude of b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p is much smaller than those of b ˆ 22 and b ˆ 44 i d p and consequently si estimates of this value suffer from unavoidable numerical errors for instance in the case studied here b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p equals 1 8e 03 while the value estimated with si is 1 6e 03 by identifying the role of b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p on the roll equation it has been concluded that this numerical error 2e 04 may be negligible indeed fig 3 illustrates that the roll time series obtained by linear system identification is very close to the direct numerical result 5 non linear approach by applying si the linear equivalent damping and restoring coefficients could be obtained for each cycle with their corresponding mean angles this study assumes that the nonlinearity of roll damping can be represented as a linear plus quadratic form as below 5 1 b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 44 l i d p b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 the linear b ˆ 44 l i d p and quadratic b ˆ 44 q i d p parts of roll damping can be extracted from conventional damping plot methods such as those described by froude faltinsen and others see for example fig 4 extracted from oliveira and fernandes 2014 considering the derivative of b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 5 2 d d t b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 η 4 b ˆ 44 l i d p η 4 2 b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 η 4 the 3rd order roll equation including linear plus quadratic damping terms can be obtained from equation 5 3 as 5 3 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 l i d p η 4 2 b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p η 4 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 22 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 0 substituting the obtained coefficients from linear system identification into equation 5 3 the roll time series can be obtained by solving the equation using the fourth order runge kutta method the system identification algorithm can be described by the illustrated flowchart in fig 5 6 consequence of applying the third order equation 6 1 numerical study this study now proceeds with an application of the third order equation from which it is possible to extract several consequences that have been previously overlooked calculations of hydrostatic coefficients added mass and potential damping coefficients were performed using a radiation diffraction program wamit a model with 3703 panels has been used for the representation of the fpso s hull see fig 6 a common practice is to use extra damping values to allow for the viscous effects when using potential theory table 1 presents particular specifications of the full scale fpso for a reference draft of 14 7 m to verify and validate the system identification approach time series were generated based on the numerical model s coefficients for different initial conditions θ 0 and nonlinearity ratios b ˆ 44 q i d p b 44 l i d p provided by the general solution of the equations using the idp as a pole the initial conditions and nonlinearity ratios used are listed in table 2 the combination of initial conditions and nonlinearity ratios produced a total of 48 conditions for the numerical tests the results have shown excellent agreement between the coefficients obtained from system identification and those of numerical models the differences between them are presented in the next section 6 1 1 influence of b 24 and b 42 on nonlinear damping estimation by system identification 6 1 1 1 quadratic term table 3 shows two different 3rd order si applications used to study the influence of coupling terms on roll damping the first case is a 3rd order si including b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p the other assumes b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p to be zero fig 7 shows the consequences of neglecting both b ˆ 24 i d p and b ˆ 42 i d p in the calculation of the quadratic term b ˆ 44 q i d p for different initial angles the horizontal axes in the figure are the known values defined in the numerical model while the vertical axes are the values obtained from the si this sensitivity study reveals a gradual decrease in the precision of the estimation of the quadratic part of roll damping b ˆ 44 q i d p when coupling terms are ignored 6 1 1 2 linear term the numerical errors of calculating the linear damping part b ˆ 44 l i d p for the same cases above b ˆ 24 i d p and b ˆ 42 i d p taken into consideration or assumed to be 0 are compared in fig 8 generally 3rd order si results show good agreement with exact numerical solutions when predicting the linear term of roll damping for small nonlinearity ratios b ˆ 44 q i d p b 44 l i d p the value obtained for b 44 l i d p when including coupling terms in the si is almost identical to the exact numerical solution for larger ratios the error may be up to 1 however if coupling terms are ignored in the lsi b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p 0 the error may increase by up to sevenfold fig 9 a finally fig 9 shows the errors of the si approach for estimating the quadratic term of roll damping b ˆ 44 q i d p with and without taking b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p into consideration increasing nonlinearity leads the 3rd order si to a minimum error less than 1 when the coupling terms are taken into account fig 9 b however the error increases to 30 when the coupling terms are not included in the si note also that figs 8 and 9 show no significant change in the error with variation of the initial angle especially when coupling terms are taken into account the comparisons between the numerical study and si approaches show a high accuracy of roll damping prediction by 3rd order system identification when taking coupling terms into account therefore it can be concluded that neglecting the coupling term is a potential source of error for the estimation of roll damping this is considered an unexpected result given the guidelines given in lewis 1989 6 1 2 comparison of faltinsen s and froude s results and 3rd order si approaches previous studies evaluating the nonlinearity of roll damping used froude s and faltinsen s approaches for comparisons this part of the study compare these approaches with the 3rd order si considering the results above coupling terms are included for these simulations fig 10 shows a comparison of the error of roll damping estimation both linear and quadratic damping terms between the three approaches froude s approach is very sensitive to both the initial angle and nonlinearity and leads to larger errors the errors with faltinsen s approach are constant for different initial angles but raise quickly with nonlinearity ratios as shown in fig 10 a froude s approach is unfavorable for predicting linear damping while faltinsen s approach is unfavorable for predicting the quadratic roll damping term for systems with high nonlinearity however faltinsen s approach showed reasonable results for predicting linear roll damping with low nonlinearity in summary compared to typical roll damping estimation methods the 3rd order s i performed better showing excellent results for the vast majority of nonlinearity ratios and initial angles table 4 provides a brief summary of the comparisons 6 2 experimental study this study carried out a model test with a section of the parallel middle body of a typical fpso placed transverse to the wave channel width the width of the wave chanel used was 1 00 m and the width of the model was 0 90 m leaving a 0 05 m gap at each side this may be considered a 2d situation although it is representative for a large parallel middle body fpso in beam seas oliveira and fernandes 2014 this has been also checked via potential flow calculations asgari and fernandes 2017 tests were performed under two initial conditions free roll decay test with pre oscillation and held over free roll decay test see fig 12 due to the coupling terms sway is unavoidable in any free decay test fig 11 illustrates sway for both free roll decay tests this is another motivation to take into account the effects of sway for roll damping even under controlled conditions the model s hull was made of fiberglass with an internal aluminum structure see fig 13 the test matrix was a combination of pre oscillation and held over tests with naked hull and bilge keel models using three different initial angles in a medium draft see table 5 scaling was based on froude s similarity with a scale factor of 1 75 fig 14 compares the idp and the moirc most often instantaneous roll center concepts both show almost the same results for free roll decay but it should be considered that these concepts have different definitions for different conditions such as in beam seas they have completely different behaviors fernandes et al 2016 as shown in table 7 two approaches were applied to the experimental results to obtain roll damping coefficients non dimensional roll damping coefficients obtained from 3rd order and 2nd order used in typical methods system identification are presented respectively in figs 15 and 16 fig 15 a and b compare non dimensional roll damping coefficients between the held over and pre oscillation tests of the naked hull model obtained respectively from 2nd and 3rd order system identifications the comparison shows reasonable agreement of both techniques these results may provide further support to the hypothesis that a simpler technique of pre oscillation could be employed instead of applying strict initial conditions for a free roll decay held over but it is important to mention that this is true only for angles when the non linearity is weak now fig 15 c and d compare separately non dimensional roll damping coefficients between 2nd and 3rd order system identifications for held over and pre oscillation techniques according to fig 15 c for held over technique the results of the 2nd order si are similar to those of the 3rd order si for the naked hull model with low nonlinearity the same conclusion is obtained for the pre oscillation technique see fig 15 d observing fig 15 one may say that the pre oscillation technique helps to achieve larger mean angles with the same initial angles since the first cycle can be included when estimating roll damping however the pre oscillation technique shows a larger dispersion than the held over approach as expected attaching the bilge keel increases the nonlinear damping fig 16 a and b compare non dimensional roll damping coefficients of the model with a bilge keel between held over and pre oscillation techniques respectively obtained from both 2nd and 3rd order system identifications the comparison shows that the results from both techniques are in good agreement fig 16 c and d show that the results of held over have smaller variance than those of the pre oscillation technique but it is clear that the 3rd order technique is sensing the non linearity there is an overestimation of the damping with a 2nd order technique for large angles 2deg based on the results obtained it may be concluded that more realistic results are to be expected when taking into account the effects of the coupling terms fig 17 shows that a reduction in the quadratic terms of roll damping is observed with the linear plus quadratic approach for pre oscillation tests furthermore using a biquadratic form 1 1 a biquadratic approximation of roll damping divides the mean angle range into two intervals each interval has different values of linear and quadratic damping producing two straight lines with different slopes leads to a better nonlinear damping behavior for larger angles see figs 18 and 19 with traditional approaches only the properties of roll damping can be obtained from the free roll decay test using the 3rd order si approach however properties of the sway motion and its coupling with roll can also be well estimated see equation 3 4 this is illustrated in fig 20 which shows the estimated non dimensional form of sway damping b ˆ 22 for tests on models with a naked hull nh and with a bilge keel bk b ˆ 22 showed linear behavior for tests with a naked hull fig 20 a but increasing nonlinearity in tests with a bilge keel fig 20 b the product b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p may also be estimated using the 3rd order si approach fig 21 illustrates the values of the product of damping coupling terms produced by applying this approach to models with a naked hull nh and with a bilge keel bk the figure shows a clear trend of b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p deviating from constant values within a region near zero especially for tests on a model with a bilge keel this clearly illustrates the effect of the bilge keel on the damping coupling terms product which is quite different for the naked hull finally time series of roll decay modeled with different methods are compared to each other and to experimental results in fig 22 fig 22 a shows the time series generated by 3rd order si approaches with coefficients provided by the cycle per cycle analysis fig 22 b shows the nonlinear roll damping represented in biquadratic form fig 22 c uses the traditional linear plus quadratic approach finally fig 22 d shows the time series for the traditional second order system identification with a single degree of freedom note also that for high nonlinearity bilge keel width equal to 1 8 m the roll restoring coefficient showed a higher nonlinear deviation the influence of coupling terms on the results has already been discussed numerically above and results have shown in contrast with traditional methods that damping coupling terms are not negligible especially when roll damping is nonlinear the two 3rd order sis shown in table 3 have also been applied on experimental roll time series to obtain b ˆ 44 i d p the first included a damping coupling term b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p 0 while in the second the coupling term is neglected b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p 0 fig 23 shows how neglecting coupling terms affects the estimation of b ˆ 44 i d p comparing the results of both approaches for a model with a bilge keel fig 23 b and d it can be seen that neglecting coupling terms causes overestimation of roll damping for large mean angles similar to what is seen when applying a 2nd order si the main conclusion here is that the 3rd order si approach seems to yield better more robust results when nonlinearity is expected to be higher 6 2 1 the role of the coupled damping number cdn in equation 3 1 the combination of damping terms is always grouped that is b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p this study therefore proposes that this grouped quantity be defined as a new term the coupled damping number cdn so that 6 2 c d n b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p one should immediately recognize that cdn 0 fernandes 1983 for the 2d case under analysis under a potential flow hypothesis which is a result from the application of green s theorem hence equation 3 1 for this situation can be rewritten as 6 3 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 c d n η 4 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 22 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 0 to study the cdn s influence on the equation two 3rd order sis were applied on experimental results the first included the cdn while the second one neglected it see table 8 the results are shown in fig 24 below fig 24 shows that neglecting cdn does not have a large effect on roll damping estimation this seems to be a remarkable indication that cdn is negligible even when viscous effects are present it must be stressed that the possibility of neglecting the cdn does not mean that the effects of the coupling damping terms are negligible but rather that the product of the main diagonal terms minus the product of the coupling terms could indeed be negligible cdn 0 this is probably the reason why the wrong assumption that the cross damping term may be neglected has survived for so long 7 conclusions the main aim of the present investigation was to present a robust approach to the assessment of roll damping using an innovative 3rd order equation for roll damping analysis constructed by considering a proper understating of the pole for rotational equations and taking into account the influence of unavoidable coupled dampings this work points out conditions under which the conventional 2nd order equation considering only the roll degree of freedom may be used based on equation 2 5 sway motion should be very small and maybe most importantly the pole should be the idp inertially decoupled point for the 2nd order equation to work as a good approximation this study has applied both numerical and experimental techniques as a first step it showed the importance of placing the pole at the idp which allows a third order equation to be used for roll equation 2 7 the new approach using this third order equation has been validated and verified numerically the 3rd order si showed excellent results for the vast majority of nonlinearity ratios and initial angles in the numerical model and is able to estimate not only roll properties but also sway and sway roll coupling properties the errors of this 3rd order si compare favorably with those of the froude and faltinsen approaches the results have shown that the 3rd order si produces more efficient predictions of the linear plus quadratic damping coefficient when compared to froude and faltinsen approaches especially when nonlinearity is high this study has shown that including damping coupling terms in 3rd order sis could improve the estimation of roll damping several free roll decay tests using the held over and pre oscillation techniques were carried out in the wave channel facility of the waves and currents laboratory laboratório de ondas e correntes loc of the federal university of rio de janeiro the results obtained have shown good agreement of the new approach for different decay techniques for experiments with a naked hull model the 2nd order si has shown similar results to the 3rd order si however in the presence of a bilge keel the 2nd order si produces higher roll damping values while those estimated with the 3rd order si are more realistic and less unsafe it is worth mentioning that this approach has produced even better results for held over tests see fig 23 finally a new cdn coupled damping number term including all damping coefficients equation 6 2 is presented here one of the most significant findings from this study is that the cdn may be negligible even when viscous effects are present non potential as mentioned above it should be noted that neglecting the cdn does not mean that the effects of the coupling damping term are negligible but rather that the product of the main diagonal terms minus the product of the coupling terms could indeed be negligible cdn 0 this is probably the reason why the wrong assumption that the cross damping term may be neglected has survived for so long proving that for the general case is a task for future work acknowledgements this research is supported by the cnpq conselho nacional de pesquisa brazilian national

23118,this work focuses on roll decay experiments performed on hulls normally used as fpsos considering the practical case of beam seas newton s second law and the newton euler theorem lead to coupled sway heave and roll equations for an arbitrary pole assuming symmetry the heave equation is uncoupled leaving the sway and roll equations coupled the research shows that even if inertia is decoupled damping coupling is unavoidable and cannot be neglected nevertheless a third order equation dealing only with roll can be constructed the latter is used to develop a robust approach that uses system identification techniques to obtain damping properties from the decay tests in this approach non linear damping is assessed using a cycle by cycle linear approach that uses system identification to match all the information obtained from the decay test both held over and pre oscillation tests are discussed and new concept is presented the coupled damping number cdn which relates the product of the main diagonal damping terms with coupling damping coefficients the cdn is proven to be null for potential flows and turns out to be very small even when viscous effects are present such as in decay tests at least for typical fpso hulls keywords roll damping roll center sway roll coupled damping 1 introduction since the start of the use of fpsos floating production storage and offloading platforms in the 1960 s roll motions have revealed to be a major concern for operators of these units roll motion prediction for fpsos are traditionally based on the knowledge established for conventional ships and very few works oriented to issues specific to fpsos have been published nonetheless very large roll motions with values above design predictions have been reported for fpsos over the last years implying uncomfortable conditions for the crew process plant downtime and degradation of the structural integrity of topside supports hull bilge keels and risers it should be stressed that even though many similarities can be found between an fpso and a ship these structures differ in many aspects lack of maneuvering capability weight distribution with regard to topsides and unconventional anti roll system which affects their roll behavior and places a question mark on the adequacy of currently employed methods for roll motion prediction in fact numerous works related to the estimation of roll damping in oil tankers have been published during the last decades nevertheless most have two fundamental issues which may propagate errors to damping estimation the first is related to the lack of a unique definition of the pole necessary for rotational equations despite the fact that the importance of this definition for damping estimation has been shown by some researchers this pole is in principle arbitrary as known from theory and is known as either the roll center or the center of roll however these names prove to be meaningless as they have no clear definition a better understanding of the pole would definitely improve roll estimation procedures the second fundamental issue is related to the understanding of the coupling of roll with other degrees of freedom these two issues are addressed below froude 1861 was one of the first to recognize the importance of roll motions for the operability of ships froude formulated roll damping in a linear plus quadratic velocity dependent form to account for dissipation of energy during roll motion he studied the effects of wave height and steepness on the rolling of ships and the influence of this phenomenon on the design of ship hull shape based on this work froude 1861 he suggested designing the hull in such a way as to move the ship s natural roll frequency away from synchronization with the excitation waves his work also supported the use of bilge keels to stabilize roll motion froude s method uses decay tests equating the potential energy lost to damping in each half cycle to the work done by the equivalent linearized damping moment during the same period this produces an expression for the slope of the roll decay curve as a function of the linear and nonlinear damping coefficients later on dalzell 1976 extended froude s method to the case of a linear plus cubic damping model vugts 1968 conducted several experimental assessments to determine hydrodynamic coefficients of swaying heaving and rolling cylinders in free fluid surfaces his work has been used as the basis for numerous studies assessing the roll damping of floating bodies ikeda et al 1978a proposed a new technique to estimate roll damping based on decay tests this technique separated roll damping into components but ignored their interactions and therefore the coupling of roll damping to other degrees of freedom was not taken into account ikeda et al 1978a himeno 1981 provided a good review of roll damping phenomena in a very thorough literature survey of japanese and worldwide literature on the subject this review is largely based on the work of ikeda et al 1978b faltinsen 1993 described another approach to predict damping in his approach energy loss is evaluated in terms of a linear equivalent damping coefficient equating the energy loss of an equivalent sinusoidal behavior to the energy dissipation from a quadratic equation the vast majority of roll damping studies since froude has focused on studying roll in a single degree of freedom neglecting any coupling but ikeda et al 1981 also conducted a number of forced sway and roll experiments his paper deals with viscous effects on forces and moments acting on a ship in sway and roll motion at zero forward speed and investigates roll damping and coupling terms in velocity phase of roll into sway and sway into roll from this work it can be concluded that damping coupling terms are large having the same order of magnitude as the main diagonal dampings bass and haddara 1989 1991 performed an extensive series of experiments to determine roll damping characteristics for a number of small fishing vessels in the experiments the models were attached to a dynamometer with only 2 degrees of freedom the model was free to roll and heave but restrained in all other modes his investigations included not only roll damping but also roll sway coupled damping he clearly showed the influence of roll sway and sway roll coupling on roll damping which has a non linear dependence on the position of the roll axis the axis on which the model is free to rotate standing 1991 also conducted many model tests to investigate viscous roll damping and the effect of sway and heave motions on the roll response of a transportation barge numerical examples suggest that the roll and sway equations may be decoupled if the motions are defined relative to a certain roll center his work assumes that the roll sway and heave equations are coupled only through the relative velocity term in the roll damping moment the equations are otherwise decoupled by defining them relative to the roll center this roll center however is not clearly defined during the past 40 years much more information has become available supporting that roll damping prediction is influenced by the position of the roll center the first serious discussions emerged during the 1980s when ikeda 2004 carried out forced roll tests on four fishing boat models he observed that lowering the position of the rotation axis of the forced test the roll center led to decreased roll damping bass and haddara 1989 showed that the equivalent non dimensional linear roll damping coefficient increases along with the distance between the position of the rotation axis roll center and the center of gravity chun et al 2001 arrived at the same conclusion park et al 2000 studied the effects of the position of the rotation axis again called the roll center on damping for fpso sections using decay experiments they also considered a symmetric section of an fpso and positioned the rotation axis on the symmetry plane their findings indicate that roll damping is sensitive to the position of the axis roll center on the symmetry plane roll damping will increase if the rotation axis is placed above the still water level thus far previous studies have confirmed the importance of the position of the rotation axis however for a freely floating body there is no fixed rotation axis hence a clear definition of the roll center is not traceable in the literature and in effect each researcher has his her own interpretation in the classical principles of naval architecture pna a quote states that a very rough estimate for the location of the roll center is halfway between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy implying that the roll center lies on the symmetry plane overall all relevant studies of roll motion highlight the need for a better understanding of the roll center different definitions may be found center of gravity vugts 1968 still water level center of buoyancy and others have all been considered as the roll center this difficulty can even be found in ikeda s formulations in ikeda et al 1978a and ikeda et al 1977 the quantity known as og represents the distance from the still water level to the roll axis vertical position of the roll center in other papers such as ikeda 1984 and ikeda et al 1993 og is defined as the distance from the still water level to the center of gravity stewart et al 1979 mentioned an instantaneous roll center according to his work the roll center is instantaneously at rest as the vessel moves through waves but tends to wander wildly and may move from well above to well below the vessel in irregular waves the main reason why stewart s formulation was not taken up by other researchers is not very clear roberts and dacunha 1985 identified the roll center as a point where the roll equation decouples from sway which is in fact impossible since damping coupling still remains see below later on standing 1991 proposed the following definition when there is significant damping the roll center may be defined as the point of minimum sway response in a forced roll or free decay type of experiment or simulation when a pure moment is applied this is an obscure sentence at least for the present authors in both references the position of the roll center is assumed to be constant and independent of frequency the mismatch of roll center definitions may have motivated molin 2002 to call it the mystérieux center du roulis mysterious roll center in french recently fernandes et al 2015 2016 have noticed that the instantaneous center of rotation icr that is the point with zero velocity varies in time as predicted by newtonian mechanics fernandes et al 2015 2016 also proposed the concept of a most often instantaneous roll center moirc value as also discussed below of course this moirc value could be called the roll center but the authors see no reason to do that in fact the roll center and the center of roll for that matter seems indeed to be a fantasy that does not help those working with roll damping estimation based on the challenges described above this work presents an innovative robust approach to assess roll damping of fpsos taking into account a correct definition of the pole on which to center the motion equations as well as the influence of the unavoidable coupled damping for sway and roll damping estimation using both numerical and experimental techniques 2 third order equation the motion of a floating body exposed to external forces such as wind wave and currents takes place in six degrees of freedom the motion equations can be derived using the newton euler or lagrange equations clayton and bishop 1982 expressed general fully nonlinear equations of rigid body kinetics in a vectorial framework in order to construct the governing motion equations the following assumptions and simplifications are made i the floating body is slender and rigid with a symmetry plane ii motion amplitude is small so that equations can be linearized iii the effects of viscosity are neglected except for roll motion a right handed co ordinate system x y z is considered with respect to an arbitrary position o as shown in fig 1 the translation displacements in x y and z directions with respect to the origin denoted by η 1 η 2 and η 3 indicate surge sway and heave respectively the angular displacements about the same set of axis η 4 η 5 and η 6 indicate roll pitch and yaw respectively under the above assumptions three linearly coupled differential homogeneous equations of motion in a vertical plane for a free roll decay test imposing an initial roll displacement on a freely floating body can be written as 2 1 j 2 4 k 2 4 m j k a j k η k b j k η k c j k η k 0 where m j k are the components of the generalized mass matrix of the ship and z c is the vertical distance of the pole to the center of gravity a j k and b j k are the frequency dependent added mass and damping coefficients respectively and c j k are the hydrostatic restoring coefficients due to symmetry the generalized forms of mass added mass and damping matrix coefficients are given by m j k m 0 m z c 0 m 0 m z c 0 i 44 a j k a 22 0 a 24 0 a 33 0 a 24 0 a 44 b j k b 22 0 b 24 0 b 33 0 b 24 0 b 44 c j k 0 0 0 0 c 33 0 0 0 c 44 it is well known that the heave equation entirely decouples due to symmetry with the sway roll equations remaining coupled 2 2 vugts 1968 2 2 m a 22 a 24 m z c a 42 m z c i 4 a 44 η 2 η 4 b 22 b 24 b 42 b 44 η 2 η 4 0 0 0 c 44 η 2 η 4 0 0 it is easy to inertially decouple the roll and sway equations by moving the origin of the coordinate system to a position at which the mass matrix is diagonal zero off diagonal elements this position of the origin is referred to here as the inertial decoupling point idp a new set of sway and roll equations can then be written for the idp coordinate system as 2 3 2 3 m a 22 0 0 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p η 2 η 4 b 22 b 24 i d p b 42 i d p b 44 i d p η 2 η 4 0 0 0 c 44 i d p η 2 η 4 0 0 the vertical position of the idp z i d p which is related to the vertical position of the center of gravity zc g and the coupling added mass a 42 c g can be easily obtained by the formula 2 4 2 4 z i d p z c g a 42 c g m a 22 note that despite the roll being inertially decoupled non zero coupled damping terms b 24 i d p and b 42 i d p still remain these terms are by no means small as shown below indeed these terms are numerically large having the same order of magnitude as b 22 and b 44 i d p so the quote from the pna lewis 1989 stating that roll is still coupled to the sway equation but only through the coefficient b 42 and this coupling is not strong therefore we ignore the coupling terms does not seem to be correct another relevant point is related to equation 2 5 which corresponds to the second line of equation 2 3 2 5 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p η 4 b 42 i d p η 2 b 44 i d p η 4 c 44 i d p η 4 0 this is the roll equation and it is clear that it includes a term depending on sway velocity and a damping coupling term however for decades the equation for one degree of freedom has been used in the literature recall the pna quote mentioned above lewis 1989 ignoring this coupling dependent term 2 6 2 6 η 4 b η 4 η 4 k η 4 η 4 0 note that equation 2 6 has no theoretical basis unless b 42 i d p η 2 0 for some reason in fact during decay tests especially for the pure moment method see below the sway velocity might be small but the coupling damping term is not as shown below even if this were the case the pole of the equation with one degree of freedom defined according to equation 2 4 can only be the idp it definitely cannot be the cg center of gravity or another point one can find in the literature studies that place the pole at the cg then use the parallel axis theorem to get the damping with respect to the idp which is conceptually wrong now note that the sway roll problem is semi definite since the sway mode has no restoring force hence the system is initially of fourth order as seen in equation 2 2 but it may become third order if the pole is positioned on the idp in fact as shown in appendix a the system of equation 2 3 may be written as 2 7 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p η 4 b 22 i 4 i d p a 44 i d p m a 22 b 44 i d p η 4 b 22 b 44 i d p b 24 i d p b 42 i d p m a 22 c 44 i d p η

equation 2 7 is homogeneous involving only roll the coupling terms add to the roll restoring term which multiplies η 4 hence the remainder of this work will deal with equation 2 7 to address the roll problem on an innovative robust basis also note that in principle once η 4 is know it can be used to obtain η 2 and plug it into equation 2 8 allowing η 2 to be obtained after integration a comprehensive 3rd order roll equation including the coupling terms is presented here the 3rd order equation is used in a robust method to assess roll damping in the non linear quadratic case including the influence of coupling terms 3 linear system identification equation 2 7 can be written in dimensionless form as 3 1 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 22 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 0 where b ˆ 22 b 22 m a 22 ω n b ˆ 44 i d p b 44 i d p i 4 i d p a 44 i d p ω n c ˆ 44 i d p c 44 i d p i 4 i d p a 44 i d p ω n 2 b ˆ 24 i d p b 24 i d p m a 22 l ω n b ˆ 42 i d p b 42 i d p l i 4 i d p a 44 i d p ω n where l is a length unit and the non dimensional sway and roll and their derivatives can be expressed as below η 4 η 4 η 2 η 2 l η 4 η 4 ω n η 2 η 2 l ω n η 4 η 4 ω n 2 η 2 η 2 l ω n 2 looking for a particular solution of the form η 4 k e λ t substituting η 4 and its derivatives into equation 3 1 one obtains 3 2 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p λ i 2 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p λ i b ˆ 22 c ˆ 44 i d p λ i λ i 2 c ˆ 44 i d p where λ i λ i ω n a particular solution of λ i for i 1 2 and 3 can be obtained from equation 3 2 taking into account the initial conditions k 1 k 2 and k 3 considering free roll decay the general solution for the linear roll response can be represented in exponential form as seen below 3 3 η 4 t k 1 e λ 1 t k 2 e λ 2 t k 3 e λ 3 t the linear equivalent coefficients of the roll equation 3 1 can be obtained by applying a linear system identification technique to every cycle of the roll time series linear system identification assumes that the roll response has a form such as that of equation 3 3 for a cycle peak to peak or trough to trough with period t and proceeds by applying non linear least squares using the levenberg marquardt method levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 moré 1978 to the above equation in order to obtain k i and λ i the coefficients of the 3rd order equation 3 1 can be obtained by providing the correct values of k i and λ i obtained from linear system identification for the following initial conditions η 4 0 θ 0 η 4 0 0 η 4 0 c ˆ 44 i d p θ 0 with known k i and λ i the following system of equations can be written based on equation 3 2 3 4 1 λ 1 2 λ 1 1 λ 2 2 λ 2 1 λ 3 2 λ 3 b ˆ 22 c ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p λ 1 λ 1 2 c ˆ 44 i d p λ 2 λ 2 2 c ˆ 44 i d p λ 3 λ 3 2 c ˆ 44 i d p c ˆ 44 i d p is known from the initial conditions η 4 0 and η 4 0 3 5 c ˆ 44 i d p λ 1 2 k 1 λ 2 2 k 2 λ 3 2 k 3 k 1 k 2 k 3 therefore b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p and b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p can be obtained from equation 3 4 note that this is a procedure that gets all the information available from the decay test which is another proposal of the present work this is unlike the froude and faltinsen methods which use global properties the potential energy difference in the former and the equivalent harmonic energy dissipation in the latter 4 linear validation to validate the si system identification method time series were generated based on the coefficients of numerical model for different initial angles θ 0 and linear damping coefficients provided by the general solution of equations with the idp as the origin linear dampings are extracted from the time series by applying the si and compared with exact numerical solutions in fig 2 it has been observed that the non dimensional order of magnitude of b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p is much smaller than those of b ˆ 22 and b ˆ 44 i d p and consequently si estimates of this value suffer from unavoidable numerical errors for instance in the case studied here b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p equals 1 8e 03 while the value estimated with si is 1 6e 03 by identifying the role of b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p on the roll equation it has been concluded that this numerical error 2e 04 may be negligible indeed fig 3 illustrates that the roll time series obtained by linear system identification is very close to the direct numerical result 5 non linear approach by applying si the linear equivalent damping and restoring coefficients could be obtained for each cycle with their corresponding mean angles this study assumes that the nonlinearity of roll damping can be represented as a linear plus quadratic form as below 5 1 b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 44 l i d p b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 the linear b ˆ 44 l i d p and quadratic b ˆ 44 q i d p parts of roll damping can be extracted from conventional damping plot methods such as those described by froude faltinsen and others see for example fig 4 extracted from oliveira and fernandes 2014 considering the derivative of b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 5 2 d d t b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 η 4 b ˆ 44 l i d p η 4 2 b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 η 4 the 3rd order roll equation including linear plus quadratic damping terms can be obtained from equation 5 3 as 5 3 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 l i d p η 4 2 b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 q i d p η 4 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p η 4 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 22 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 0 substituting the obtained coefficients from linear system identification into equation 5 3 the roll time series can be obtained by solving the equation using the fourth order runge kutta method the system identification algorithm can be described by the illustrated flowchart in fig 5 6 consequence of applying the third order equation 6 1 numerical study this study now proceeds with an application of the third order equation from which it is possible to extract several consequences that have been previously overlooked calculations of hydrostatic coefficients added mass and potential damping coefficients were performed using a radiation diffraction program wamit a model with 3703 panels has been used for the representation of the fpso s hull see fig 6 a common practice is to use extra damping values to allow for the viscous effects when using potential theory table 1 presents particular specifications of the full scale fpso for a reference draft of 14 7 m to verify and validate the system identification approach time series were generated based on the numerical model s coefficients for different initial conditions θ 0 and nonlinearity ratios b ˆ 44 q i d p b 44 l i d p provided by the general solution of the equations using the idp as a pole the initial conditions and nonlinearity ratios used are listed in table 2 the combination of initial conditions and nonlinearity ratios produced a total of 48 conditions for the numerical tests the results have shown excellent agreement between the coefficients obtained from system identification and those of numerical models the differences between them are presented in the next section 6 1 1 influence of b 24 and b 42 on nonlinear damping estimation by system identification 6 1 1 1 quadratic term table 3 shows two different 3rd order si applications used to study the influence of coupling terms on roll damping the first case is a 3rd order si including b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p the other assumes b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p to be zero fig 7 shows the consequences of neglecting both b ˆ 24 i d p and b ˆ 42 i d p in the calculation of the quadratic term b ˆ 44 q i d p for different initial angles the horizontal axes in the figure are the known values defined in the numerical model while the vertical axes are the values obtained from the si this sensitivity study reveals a gradual decrease in the precision of the estimation of the quadratic part of roll damping b ˆ 44 q i d p when coupling terms are ignored 6 1 1 2 linear term the numerical errors of calculating the linear damping part b ˆ 44 l i d p for the same cases above b ˆ 24 i d p and b ˆ 42 i d p taken into consideration or assumed to be 0 are compared in fig 8 generally 3rd order si results show good agreement with exact numerical solutions when predicting the linear term of roll damping for small nonlinearity ratios b ˆ 44 q i d p b 44 l i d p the value obtained for b 44 l i d p when including coupling terms in the si is almost identical to the exact numerical solution for larger ratios the error may be up to 1 however if coupling terms are ignored in the lsi b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p 0 the error may increase by up to sevenfold fig 9 a finally fig 9 shows the errors of the si approach for estimating the quadratic term of roll damping b ˆ 44 q i d p with and without taking b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p into consideration increasing nonlinearity leads the 3rd order si to a minimum error less than 1 when the coupling terms are taken into account fig 9 b however the error increases to 30 when the coupling terms are not included in the si note also that figs 8 and 9 show no significant change in the error with variation of the initial angle especially when coupling terms are taken into account the comparisons between the numerical study and si approaches show a high accuracy of roll damping prediction by 3rd order system identification when taking coupling terms into account therefore it can be concluded that neglecting the coupling term is a potential source of error for the estimation of roll damping this is considered an unexpected result given the guidelines given in lewis 1989 6 1 2 comparison of faltinsen s and froude s results and 3rd order si approaches previous studies evaluating the nonlinearity of roll damping used froude s and faltinsen s approaches for comparisons this part of the study compare these approaches with the 3rd order si considering the results above coupling terms are included for these simulations fig 10 shows a comparison of the error of roll damping estimation both linear and quadratic damping terms between the three approaches froude s approach is very sensitive to both the initial angle and nonlinearity and leads to larger errors the errors with faltinsen s approach are constant for different initial angles but raise quickly with nonlinearity ratios as shown in fig 10 a froude s approach is unfavorable for predicting linear damping while faltinsen s approach is unfavorable for predicting the quadratic roll damping term for systems with high nonlinearity however faltinsen s approach showed reasonable results for predicting linear roll damping with low nonlinearity in summary compared to typical roll damping estimation methods the 3rd order s i performed better showing excellent results for the vast majority of nonlinearity ratios and initial angles table 4 provides a brief summary of the comparisons 6 2 experimental study this study carried out a model test with a section of the parallel middle body of a typical fpso placed transverse to the wave channel width the width of the wave chanel used was 1 00 m and the width of the model was 0 90 m leaving a 0 05 m gap at each side this may be considered a 2d situation although it is representative for a large parallel middle body fpso in beam seas oliveira and fernandes 2014 this has been also checked via potential flow calculations asgari and fernandes 2017 tests were performed under two initial conditions free roll decay test with pre oscillation and held over free roll decay test see fig 12 due to the coupling terms sway is unavoidable in any free decay test fig 11 illustrates sway for both free roll decay tests this is another motivation to take into account the effects of sway for roll damping even under controlled conditions the model s hull was made of fiberglass with an internal aluminum structure see fig 13 the test matrix was a combination of pre oscillation and held over tests with naked hull and bilge keel models using three different initial angles in a medium draft see table 5 scaling was based on froude s similarity with a scale factor of 1 75 fig 14 compares the idp and the moirc most often instantaneous roll center concepts both show almost the same results for free roll decay but it should be considered that these concepts have different definitions for different conditions such as in beam seas they have completely different behaviors fernandes et al 2016 as shown in table 7 two approaches were applied to the experimental results to obtain roll damping coefficients non dimensional roll damping coefficients obtained from 3rd order and 2nd order used in typical methods system identification are presented respectively in figs 15 and 16 fig 15 a and b compare non dimensional roll damping coefficients between the held over and pre oscillation tests of the naked hull model obtained respectively from 2nd and 3rd order system identifications the comparison shows reasonable agreement of both techniques these results may provide further support to the hypothesis that a simpler technique of pre oscillation could be employed instead of applying strict initial conditions for a free roll decay held over but it is important to mention that this is true only for angles when the non linearity is weak now fig 15 c and d compare separately non dimensional roll damping coefficients between 2nd and 3rd order system identifications for held over and pre oscillation techniques according to fig 15 c for held over technique the results of the 2nd order si are similar to those of the 3rd order si for the naked hull model with low nonlinearity the same conclusion is obtained for the pre oscillation technique see fig 15 d observing fig 15 one may say that the pre oscillation technique helps to achieve larger mean angles with the same initial angles since the first cycle can be included when estimating roll damping however the pre oscillation technique shows a larger dispersion than the held over approach as expected attaching the bilge keel increases the nonlinear damping fig 16 a and b compare non dimensional roll damping coefficients of the model with a bilge keel between held over and pre oscillation techniques respectively obtained from both 2nd and 3rd order system identifications the comparison shows that the results from both techniques are in good agreement fig 16 c and d show that the results of held over have smaller variance than those of the pre oscillation technique but it is clear that the 3rd order technique is sensing the non linearity there is an overestimation of the damping with a 2nd order technique for large angles 2deg based on the results obtained it may be concluded that more realistic results are to be expected when taking into account the effects of the coupling terms fig 17 shows that a reduction in the quadratic terms of roll damping is observed with the linear plus quadratic approach for pre oscillation tests furthermore using a biquadratic form 1 1 a biquadratic approximation of roll damping divides the mean angle range into two intervals each interval has different values of linear and quadratic damping producing two straight lines with different slopes leads to a better nonlinear damping behavior for larger angles see figs 18 and 19 with traditional approaches only the properties of roll damping can be obtained from the free roll decay test using the 3rd order si approach however properties of the sway motion and its coupling with roll can also be well estimated see equation 3 4 this is illustrated in fig 20 which shows the estimated non dimensional form of sway damping b ˆ 22 for tests on models with a naked hull nh and with a bilge keel bk b ˆ 22 showed linear behavior for tests with a naked hull fig 20 a but increasing nonlinearity in tests with a bilge keel fig 20 b the product b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p may also be estimated using the 3rd order si approach fig 21 illustrates the values of the product of damping coupling terms produced by applying this approach to models with a naked hull nh and with a bilge keel bk the figure shows a clear trend of b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p deviating from constant values within a region near zero especially for tests on a model with a bilge keel this clearly illustrates the effect of the bilge keel on the damping coupling terms product which is quite different for the naked hull finally time series of roll decay modeled with different methods are compared to each other and to experimental results in fig 22 fig 22 a shows the time series generated by 3rd order si approaches with coefficients provided by the cycle per cycle analysis fig 22 b shows the nonlinear roll damping represented in biquadratic form fig 22 c uses the traditional linear plus quadratic approach finally fig 22 d shows the time series for the traditional second order system identification with a single degree of freedom note also that for high nonlinearity bilge keel width equal to 1 8 m the roll restoring coefficient showed a higher nonlinear deviation the influence of coupling terms on the results has already been discussed numerically above and results have shown in contrast with traditional methods that damping coupling terms are not negligible especially when roll damping is nonlinear the two 3rd order sis shown in table 3 have also been applied on experimental roll time series to obtain b ˆ 44 i d p the first included a damping coupling term b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p 0 while in the second the coupling term is neglected b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p 0 fig 23 shows how neglecting coupling terms affects the estimation of b ˆ 44 i d p comparing the results of both approaches for a model with a bilge keel fig 23 b and d it can be seen that neglecting coupling terms causes overestimation of roll damping for large mean angles similar to what is seen when applying a 2nd order si the main conclusion here is that the 3rd order si approach seems to yield better more robust results when nonlinearity is expected to be higher 6 2 1 the role of the coupled damping number cdn in equation 3 1 the combination of damping terms is always grouped that is b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p this study therefore proposes that this grouped quantity be defined as a new term the coupled damping number cdn so that 6 2 c d n b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p b ˆ 24 i d p b ˆ 42 i d p one should immediately recognize that cdn 0 fernandes 1983 for the 2d case under analysis under a potential flow hypothesis which is a result from the application of green s theorem hence equation 3 1 for this situation can be rewritten as 6 3 η 4 b ˆ 22 b ˆ 44 i d p η 4 c d n η 4 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 b ˆ 22 c ˆ 44 i d p η 4 0 to study the cdn s influence on the equation two 3rd order sis were applied on experimental results the first included the cdn while the second one neglected it see table 8 the results are shown in fig 24 below fig 24 shows that neglecting cdn does not have a large effect on roll damping estimation this seems to be a remarkable indication that cdn is negligible even when viscous effects are present it must be stressed that the possibility of neglecting the cdn does not mean that the effects of the coupling damping terms are negligible but rather that the product of the main diagonal terms minus the product of the coupling terms could indeed be negligible cdn 0 this is probably the reason why the wrong assumption that the cross damping term may be neglected has survived for so long 7 conclusions the main aim of the present investigation was to present a robust approach to the assessment of roll damping using an innovative 3rd order equation for roll damping analysis constructed by considering a proper understating of the pole for rotational equations and taking into account the influence of unavoidable coupled dampings this work points out conditions under which the conventional 2nd order equation considering only the roll degree of freedom may be used based on equation 2 5 sway motion should be very small and maybe most importantly the pole should be the idp inertially decoupled point for the 2nd order equation to work as a good approximation this study has applied both numerical and experimental techniques as a first step it showed the importance of placing the pole at the idp which allows a third order equation to be used for roll equation 2 7 the new approach using this third order equation has been validated and verified numerically the 3rd order si showed excellent results for the vast majority of nonlinearity ratios and initial angles in the numerical model and is able to estimate not only roll properties but also sway and sway roll coupling properties the errors of this 3rd order si compare favorably with those of the froude and faltinsen approaches the results have shown that the 3rd order si produces more efficient predictions of the linear plus quadratic damping coefficient when compared to froude and faltinsen approaches especially when nonlinearity is high this study has shown that including damping coupling terms in 3rd order sis could improve the estimation of roll damping several free roll decay tests using the held over and pre oscillation techniques were carried out in the wave channel facility of the waves and currents laboratory laboratório de ondas e correntes loc of the federal university of rio de janeiro the results obtained have shown good agreement of the new approach for different decay techniques for experiments with a naked hull model the 2nd order si has shown similar results to the 3rd order si however in the presence of a bilge keel the 2nd order si produces higher roll damping values while those estimated with the 3rd order si are more realistic and less unsafe it is worth mentioning that this approach has produced even better results for held over tests see fig 23 finally a new cdn coupled damping number term including all damping coefficients equation 6 2 is presented here one of the most significant findings from this study is that the cdn may be negligible even when viscous effects are present non potential as mentioned above it should be noted that neglecting the cdn does not mean that the effects of the coupling damping term are negligible but rather that the product of the main diagonal terms minus the product of the coupling terms could indeed be negligible cdn 0 this is probably the reason why the wrong assumption that the cross damping term may be neglected has survived for so long proving that for the general case is a task for future work acknowledgements this research is supported by the cnpq conselho nacional de pesquisa brazilian national

23119,the scattering of water waves induced by tension leg structures tlss over uneven bottoms is investigated using the eigenfunction matching method emm both the wave amplitude and the surge motion displacement were assumed to be small and the linear wave theory was employed to solve the problem in the solution procedure of the step approximation the structure and the bottom configuration were sliced into a number of shelves separated by abrupt steps upon applying the conservation of mass and momentum a system of linear equations was obtained with unknown coefficients that represented the wave amplitude and the horizontal displacement of the tls the sparse system of linear equations was then solved by using the sparse matrix solver superlu the solution was validated via the theoretical solution of the wave scattering problem with a rectangular tls over a flat bottom the method was further applied to study wave scattering for different tls geometries over uneven bottoms moreover a problem with multiple tlss was studied as well keywords eigenfunction matching method emm step approximation floating structure tension leg structures tlss uneven bottom 1 introduction coastal disasters occur frequently and are caused by huge wave attacks and sea level rise these phenomena are attributed to climate change therefore coastal protection is a major concern for the mitigation of the coastal damage caused by extreme wave conditions and storm surges floating breakwaters may be sufficient for the attenuation of waves in the water area in addition floating structures may be used in fishing farms for the conservation of ecology tourism and leisure moreover they may be implemented in working stations of ocean engineering such as oil exploration stations chung 1976 engineering design also uses assembled floating structures to construct an airport on the sea as seen in the work of kagemoto et al 1998 or to provide people to live work and play on the surface of the water tension leg structures tlss are composed of semi submerged structures and pre tensioned mooring anchors on the sea bottom tlss are an innovation in the engineering practice of offshore floating breakwaters because they have a superior motion response to water wave dynamics they offer the advantage of providing good resistance and they are a creative solution in harsh environments in this work we investigate water wave scattering for three different tls shapes namely triangular trapezoidal and rectangular geometries the eigenfunction matching method emm is employed for the solution of the problem which is based on a hybrid numerical and analytical method the proposed emm is capable of simulating various tls shapes over uneven bottoms notably the emm model has a robust solution and a remarkable speed in calculation compared with existing computational fluid dynamics cfd codes tsai and chou 2015 waves exerting forces on floating structures could produce three directional motions i e surging heaving and pitching motions for simplicity and as a first step for the evaluation of the proposed method we assume that tls has an exerting force anchoring on the structure therefore only the surging motion is considered other motions are neglected in the solution of the problem waves acting on floating structures can be described using analytical solutions numerical simulations experimental studies and field observations the most famous theory for the description of wave motion is the mild slope equation mse developed by berkhoff 1972 which is a depth averaged equation that is integrated from the bottom to the water surface the mse is widely used in the simulation of wave transformations in coastal and ocean engineering problems massel 1993 utilized the eigenfunction method for the derivation of the mse in which the evanescent modes were included and the nonlinear terms of bottom curvature h 2 h and slope h h 2 were reconstructed here h x y is the horizontal gradient operator and h is the mean water depth the plane wave approximation pwa and the transfer matrix method tmm are commonly used for the description of waves traveling over a stepped bottom the former method encompassed the matching technique and the long wave approximation the bottom profiles would be sliced into a number of shelves separated by abrupt steps the latter method encompassed miles 1967 theory to investigate wave scattering over a step of arbitrary depth devillard et al 1988 extended miles theory by introducing a transfer matrix to account for the combined effect of all steps for the case of arbitrary bottom configurations o hare and davies 1992 approximated the bottom topography by using a series of shelves that were separated by abrupt steps the desired transfer of matrix tm was found by applying the prescribed method in their following study o hare and davies 1993 demonstrated that their solutions were comparable with those of the mse however their solutions converged to pseudo solutions for steep bathymetry recently tsai et al 2011 extended miles theory to the indirect eigenfunction matching method iemm by including the evanescent eigenfunctions in the prescribed horizontal velocities it should be noted that the iemm could be reduced to the tm and the pwa in the limiting case of long waves two types of breakwaters are typically designed on the sea bottom namely the gravity type and the free surface type gravity type breakwaters are conventional structures that often rest on the sea floor in addition they are built as a submerged type to fit the requirement of coastal landscape and ecology gravity type breakwaters have a heavy weight and large size and are designed by engineers for different purposes gravity breakwaters have been further improved by several researchers who have introduced porosity shih 2012 as a means of wave energy dissipation and water exchange floating breakwaters present the advantage of lower construction cost compared with that of gravity breakwaters lee and lee 1993 used the eigenfunction method and the interfaced continuity equation to analyze the surge motion of a tls in addition lee 1994 considered the fluid induced drags on linearly elastic tension legs of a tls then the model was extended to the dragged surge motion of a tls with wave large body and small body multi interactions lee and wang 2001 lee et al 1999 furthermore twin tls systems and a fish cage system were also studied lee and wang 2003 2005 gesraha 2006 investigated waves interacting with a long rectangular breakwater with two thin sideboards using eigenfunction expansions katō et al 1967 conducted laboratory experiments on four different shapes of floating structures namely inverse rectangular trapezoidal inverse trapezoidal and triangular geometries in which the transmission coefficients of each shape were compared lee and cho 2003 explored the wave scattering of a moored pontoon type floating breakwater using the element free galerkin method koutandos and prinos 2005 investigated the dynamic response of a box type wave barrier in both shallow and intermediate water regions under the action of regular and irregular waves koftis and prinos 2005 presented the dynamic behavior of a trapezoid barrier with a 45 inclined face li et al 2005 simulated wave transmission through an infinitely long cylinder in shallow and deep water regions using the modified approximation method from tsay and liu 1983 rao et al 2009 conducted experiments to study the wave transmission of a plate with varying inclination and immersion model tests were conducted by teh et al 2011 to study the dynamics of the fixed free surface semicircular breakwater with different immersion depths and porosities the experiments of günaydın and kabdaşlı 2004 showed the hydraulic performance of a u type and a type barrier under the action of regular and irregular waves in this study we investigate water wave scattering induced by a trapezoid tls over an uneven bottom using the emm previous emm studies on wave structure interaction are in fact limited to rectangular structures over a flat or a single step bottom behera et al 2016 datta and jain 1988 dhillon et al 2016 lee 1994 lee and wang 2000 2001 lee et al 1999 in this study the floating structure and the bottom topography were sliced into successive flat shelves separated by abrupt steps the matching conditions of the normal flow flux and the continuity of structure displacements were imposed on the interface boundaries the model was validated by comparing it with the analytical solution of lee and lee 1993 the emm was further applied for the description of water wave scattering for different tls geometries over uneven bottoms the key features of the wave scattering and structure dynamics response to the tls will be discussed 2 the mathematical model we consider problems of monochromatic water waves scattering that have been induced by the tls over uneven bottoms non linearities that are typically associated with the tls response are attributed to 1 free surface effects 2 the coupling of the degrees of freedom 3 the nonlinear effects on the stiffness of the tethering system and 4 the nonlinear drag force and the associated hydrodynamic damping on slender members in this study we do not consider the prescribed non linearities on the other hand we follow lee and lee 1993 to simply the study by the assumptions that both the wave amplitude and the surge motion displacement are small that only the surge motion is considered and that the linear wave theory is used the wave motion is assumed to be time harmonic e i σ t where σ 2 π t is the angular frequency t is the wave period t is the time and i is the unit of the complex number for simplicity we assume that the tension leg is sufficiently strong in order for only the surge motion to be dominant and for the remaining motions to be neglected fig 1 demonstrates the schematic of the wave scattering problem induced by the tls in the figure it shows that the sea bottom is discretized into a series of m shelves in the intervals of x m 1 x x m for m 1 2 3 m with a water depth of h m applying the linear wave theory the velocity potential governed by the laplace equation is given by 1 2 ϕ 0 where x z is the two dimensional del operator it should be noted that ϕ is only related to the spatial part of the velocity potential for the remainder of this work the problem is subjected to the free surface boundary condition 2 ϕ z σ 2 g ϕ 0 for d m 0 where d m 0 indicates that there is no tls in the interval of x m 1 x x m in addition the boundary condition on the sea bottom can be expressed in the form of 3 ϕ m z 0 on z h m and the boundary condition on the bottom of the tls is given by 4 ϕ m z 0 on z d m for d m 0 for each connection the slip conditions for each step and structure are 5 ϕ m x 0 for h m max z h m min and 6 ϕ m x i σ s for d m max z d m min in eqs 5 and 6 it is desirable to define s as the displacement of the surge motion as well as h m max max h m h m 1 and h m min min h m h m 1 a similar definition may be formulated for d m max and d m min as well in addition the matching conditions in each connection of the water are expressed as 7 ϕ m ϕ m 1 8 ϕ m x ϕ m 1 x for d m max z h m min when there is no structure on a shelf d m 0 and n 0 the wavenumber k m n can be solved via the dispersion relation 9 σ 2 g κ m n tan κ m n h m and the following relation 10 k m n i κ m n where i 1 is the imaginary unit and κ m n is the n th positive root of the dispersion relation for the positive integer n when n 0 eqs 9 and 10 can be reduced to the dispersion relation for the progressive wave that is 11 σ 2 g k m 0 tanh k m 0 h m and when there is a structure over a shelf d m 0 the wavenumber is alternatively defined as 12 k m n i n π h m d m the complex valued wavenumber k m n defined in eq 9 through 12 enables the formulation of a unified emm for all types of situations d m 0 or d m 0 n 0 or n 0 furthermore the following conditions are required to render the solution unique 13 η a e i k 1 0 x k r e i θ r e i k 1 0 x as x 14 η a k t e i θ t e i k m 0 x as x 15 ϕ i a g σ cosh k 1 0 h 1 z cosh k 1 0 h 1 e i k 1 0 x k r e i θ r e i k 1 0 x as x and 16 ϕ i a g σ cosh k m 0 h m z cosh k m 0 h m k t e i θ t e i k m 0 x as x where a is the incident wave amplitude as well as k r θ r k t and θ t are real numbers such that k r e i θ r and k t e i θ t are the reflection and transmission coefficients respectively here it should be noted that we have to assume that there is no structure over the first and the last shelves the estimation of these coefficients will be introduced in eq 26 3 the eigenfunction matching method based on the linear wave theory the complete solution of the velocity potential for the m th shelf may be expressed as 17 ϕ m x z n 0 n a m n ξ m n 1 x b m n ξ m n 2 x ζ m n z for m 1 2 3 m where a m n and b m n are the unknown coefficients of the eigenfunctions ξ m n 1 x ζ m n z and ξ m n 2 x ζ m n z respectively it should be noted that there are n 1 eigenfunction modes in eq 17 upon applying the conditions of eq 2 through 4 and by employing the method of the separation of variables the depth eigenfunction ζ m n z can be obtained and expressed as 18 ζ m n z cosh k m n h m z by observing at eq 18 we have ζ m n 1 for k m n 0 according to the sturm liouville theory zettl 2005 the following orthogonal relation is used for the solution of problem that is 19 ζ m n ζ m l λ m n δ n l where l is a mode index varying from 0 to n δ n l is the kronecker delta function and λ n is a function of h m and k m n written as 20 λ m n cosh 2 d m h m k m n for convenience we define the inner product of two orthogonal depth eigenfunctions as follows 21 f g λ 2 λ 1 f z g z d z where f and g are the depth eigenfunctions of ζ m n and λ 1 and λ 2 represent depths d m and h m respectively which correspond to the first depth eigenfunction f subsequently the spatial eigenfunctions may be defined as 22 ξ m n 1 x e i k m n x x m 1 k m n 0 1 k m n 0 and 23 ξ m n 2 x e i k m n x x m k m n 0 x k m n 0 where 24 x m x m for m 1 2 m 1 x 0 x m 0 it should be noted that the definitions of eigenfunctions ξ m n 1 x ζ m n z and ξ m n 2 x ζ m n z are valid for all cases d m 0 or d m 0 n 0 or n 0 if the complex valued wavenumber k m n is defined by eq 9 through 12 coefficients a m n and b m n in eq 17 are determined via the matching conditions at two adjacent shelves based on eqs 15 and 16 the following equations can be obtained such that 25 a 1 0 i a g σ 1 cosh k 1 0 h 1 a 1 n 0 for n 1 2 n b m n 0 for n 0 1 n and 26 k r e i θ r i b 1 0 σ a g cosh k 1 0 h 1 k t e i θ t i a m 0 σ a g cosh k m 0 h m notably the present theory uses the conservation of mass and momentum as matching conditions to solve the problem therefore the use of eq 7 results in the following expression 27 ζ m l inner ϕ m ζ m 1 l inner ϕ m 1 for l 0 1 n and m 1 2 m 1 where ζ m l inner z is the inner depth function corresponding to d m max and h m min similarly the combination of eqs 5 6 and 8 yields the following equation 28 ϕ m x ζ m l outer ϕ m 1 x ζ m l outer i σ s d m d m 1 ζ m l outer d z where ζ m l outer z is the outer depth function it should be noted that eqs 27 and 28 are valid for all four cases shown in fig 2 upon applying eq 17 eqs 27 and 28 may be derived and rewritten in the following form 29 n 0 n a m n ξ m n 1 x m b m n ξ m n 2 x m ζ m l inner ζ m n n 0 n a m 1 n ξ m 1 n 1 x m b m 1 n ξ m 1 n 2 x m ζ m l inner ζ m 1 n and 30 n 0 n a m n d ξ m n 1 d x x m b m n d ξ m n 2 d x x m ζ m n ζ m l outer n 0 n a m 1 n d ξ m 1 n 1 d x x m b m 1 n d ξ m 1 n 2 d x x m ζ m 1 n ζ m l outer i σ s d m d m 1 ζ m l outer d z it should be noted that eqs 25 29 and 30 are formed of 2 m n 1 linear equations to solve unknowns a m n b m n and s together with the equation of motion for the floating structure eqs 29 and 30 are reduced to the original equations of emm for water wave scattering without structures where d m 0 and s 0 takano 1960 tsai et al 2011 4 governing equation of structure motion the surge motion of the structure can be derived on the basis of newton s second law as 31 m i σ 2 s f w x f t x where f w x is the total horizontal wave force acting on the floating structure f t x is the horizontal component of the tension force by the legs and m is the mass of the structure the total horizontal wave forces acting on the floating structure can be expressed as 32 f w x i σ ρ m 1 m 1 d m 1 d m ϕ m small x m z d z where 33 ϕ m small ϕ m x x m for d m d m 1 ϕ m 1 x x m for d m 1 d m following the work of lee and lee 1993 we assume that the horizontal component of the tension force is linearly proportional to the displacement of the surge motion which is given by 34 f t x f s where f is the tension coefficient of the leg the combination of eqs 31 32 and 34 could result in the following expression 35 f σ 2 m s i σ ρ w m 1 m 1 d m 1 d m ϕ m small d z 0 combined with eqs 17 and 33 eq 35 provides the additional equation to solve the 2 m n 1 1 unknowns a m n b m n and s in this study we used the superlu to solve the resulting sparse system of the linear equations li 2005 after the unknowns are solved the reflection and transmission coefficients can thus be obtained by eq 26 this completes the solution procedure of the emm it should be noted that fluid induced drags on linearly elastic tension legs and wave body multi interactions may be added to the present model by following lee 1994 and lee and wang 2001 respectively 5 verification of the model the present model is first verified through two numerical examples in the following 5 1 rectangular tls over a flat bottom because the evanescent modes are included in the emm first the number of modes used in the computation must be determined this would be sufficient for providing a reasonable accuracy in the model we first consider a floating rectangular tls with b 2 m h 10 m d 2 m s h 3 m f 3679 m kg s 2 and m 1000 kg as depicted in fig 3 then we may obtain the structure density ρ s 166 7 k g m 3 here the tension coefficient is f which will be introduced in eq 37 numerical tests were conducted by using different wave periods which varies from t 4 s to t 20 s fig 4 illustrates the computed reflection and transmission coefficient against the number of eigenfunction modes used in the model the results show that the wave reflection and transmission coefficients converge at approximately n 10 this result suggests that we should use the value of n 10 as will be seen later in section 6 to verify the solution of the present theory two typical cases of b 2 m and b 4 m were investigated and the results were compared with those presented in the work of lee and lee 1993 other input conditions were d 2 m h 10 m s h 3 m and m 1000 kg the wave period in these two computational cases varies within the range of t 1 s and t 21 s the result of the reflection coefficient k r versus the wave period t is presented in fig 5 moreover the displacement s a 1 versus the wave period t is presented in fig 6 here we have defined a 1 a 1 0 for simplicity it should be mentioned that the results obtained via the emm are in good agreement with the solutions obtained by lee and lee 1993 in addition fig 7 shows the transmissions coefficients k t versus the wave period for these two cases notably the value of k t seems to satisfy the conservation of energy i e k r 2 k t 2 1 5 2 water wave scattering over an uneven bottom without the tls to verify the effect of the uneven bottom we applied the proposed model to solve the problem of water wave scattering over an uneven bottom defined by z h x with 36 h x h 0 x 0 h 0 h m h 0 1 3 l x l 2 2 l x l 0 x l h m x l where l is the length of the uneven bottom following fig 7 of porter and porter 2000 we consider the case of l h m h 0 8 and h m h 0 2 5 the convergence of the reflection coefficient for different settings of m and n are depicted in fig 8 in the figure the reflection coefficients obtained via the present model with m 100 and n 10 are in a good agreement with those obtained by porter and porter 2000 therefore we use m 100 and n 10 in the following studies 6 model applications the effect of different tls geometries over flat and stepped bottoms are intensively investigated in this section as depicted in fig 9 we investigate the problem of water wave scattering induced by a trapezoid tls with a top width of b a bottom width of b and a structure height of s h over a parabolic stepped bottom with a width of b b 2 and a height of d then we examine a flat bottom for the case d 0 and a sunken stepped bottom for the case when d 0 in addition a triangular tls corresponds to b 0 and a rectangular tls corresponds to b b in fig 9 we assume that the tension coefficient is f then we can derive the following equation 37 f ρ w g b d d 0 d 2 d 0 2 b b 2 s h h d where h is the water depth d is the ultimately submerged depth and ρ w is the water density in addition d 0 is the statically submerged depth which is defined by the following relation 38 m ρ w b d 0 d 0 2 b b 2 s h 6 1 different shapes of tls over a flat bottom basic case to further validate our model for problems with a trapezoid tls we extended the first rectangular case by setting ρ s 166 7 k g m 3 f 3679 m kg s 2 b 2 m h 10 m d 2 m and s h 3 m and by varying b from 0 a triangular tls to 1 9 approximately a rectangular tls the resulted reflection coefficient and displacement of the surge motion are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively in the figures the results for the case of b 1 9 converge to those in figs 5 a and 6 a respectively this has further validated our model regarding the reflection coefficients in fig 10 it may be observed that the minimum and maximum resonance values occur at two different wave periods namely t 5 5 s 6 5 s and t 7 0 s 10 5 s respectively in addition the case with a larger bottom width gives the larger values of the periods this can be explained as in the following if the tls system is decoupled with the waves we can have a prediction of the resonance period as 2 π m f from eqs 31 and 35 here the decoupling indicates that the total horizontal wave force f w x is an external force independent of s because the density and tension coefficients of the structure are constants the case with the larger bottom width results in the tls with the larger mass as listed in table 1 and the results of the coupled emm model and the decoupled prediction have a common trend that the case with the larger mass has the larger resonance period see fig 10 and table 1 correspondingly fig 11 demonstrates the simulated results of the displacement of the surge motion for a trapezoid tls notably for a tls a higher value in the bottom width results in a higher displacement value 6 2 different tls shapes over a flat bottom extended cases in order to further understand the effect of different tls geometries on wave scattering over a flat bottom typical tls geometries were studied namely triangular rectangular and trapezoid geometries the density of the structure as obtained from the calculations was ρ s 166 7 k g m 3 in addition the structure height was set to s h 3 m the top width varied from b 1 m to 6 m for all tls whereas the bottom width was b 0 b varied from 0 5 m to 3 m and b varied from 1 m to 6 m for the triangular trapezoid and rectangular tls respectively table 2 lists the input parameters used in the emm calculations the variations in k r and s a as a function of the relative depth are shown in figs 12 and 13 fig 12 a through c illustrate the reflection coefficient versus the relative depth for three different tls shapes they reveal that floating structures with a larger top width could produce the maximum reflection coefficient within a smaller relative depth the resonance occurs in the intervals of 0 75 k h 1 85 0 5 k h 1 25 and 0 5 k h 1 0 for a triangular a trapezoid and a rectangular tls respectively it should be noted that the relative depths are located in the intermediate water depth also the results of the coupled emm model and the decoupled prediction have a common trend on the resonance periods for the three aforementioned cases see fig 12 and table 2 however considering the typical cases of a triangular tls they have the same 2 π m f value whereas the simulated resonance frequency varies in this situation it is valuable to use the emm that couples the tls system with the waters waves via eqs 29 30 and 35 fig 13 a through c illustrate the structure displacement against the relative depth for three different tls shapes notably the structure displacement of the surge motion decreases with the increase in the mass of the floating structure 6 3 different tls shapes over a stepped bottom the emm is further employed for the investigation of wave scattering induced by different tls shapes over a stepped bottom the related researches works on wave scattering induced by tls are limited to cases of a rectangular tls over a simple bathymetry in the present study we conducted emm calculations to explore the characteristics of wave dynamics and the structure displacement response to floating structures over a multiply stepped bottom the height of the stepped bottom was selected to be d 2 m and the remaining input parameters were the same as those listed in table 1 for the trapezoid tls fig 14 a and b show the reflection coefficient and the structure displacement against the relative depth respectively it may be observed that a smaller value of the bottom width could results in the maximum reflection coefficient which is located at the highest k h value this implies that the triangular tls b 0 m could produce resonance at a higher frequency than the trapezoid and rectangular tls this also follows the trend that the case with the larger mass has the smaller resonance frequency for k h 1 the reflection coefficient increases with the increase in the relative water depth it is interesting to note that the narrow band of resonance occurs at the water depth range of 0 6 k h 0 9 to study the bottom effect we considered the same case with b 1 m however we varied the height of the stepped bottom the computational results are presented in fig 15 it may be observed that a stepped topography of a larger height can produce a slightly larger reflection coefficient without changes in the resonance frequency 6 4 different tls shapes over a sunken stepped bottom next we investigate the wave scattering induced by different tls shapes over a sunken stepped bottom the height of the stepped bottom was selected to be d 2 m and the remaining input parameters was the same as those listed in table 1 for the trapezoid tls fig 16 a presents the reflection coefficient versus the relative depth it is evident that the sunken stepped bottom produces a quite similar trend to that of the stepped bottom moreover fig 16 b depicts the displacement of the surge motion against the relative depth the effect of the sunken depth on waves scattering for the trapezoid tls is illustrated in fig 17 in the figure as the values of the sunken depth become higher the resonance frequency shifts to a higher value furthermore the frequency shift is significant compared with the results presented in fig 15 in addition it may be noticed that the effect of the sunken stepped depth on the reflection coefficient is insignificant for k h 1 5 6 5 a series of rectangular tls over a flat bottom our model can be easily applied to a series of tls here we extend the case presented in fig 5 a a series of l rectangular tls when l 1 we may refer to the previous case as a preliminary study we assumed that distance between neighboring tls was 50 m fig 18 depicts the reflection coefficients against the wave period t for different numbers l of tls in the figure we may observe that the resonance periods for different numbers of l are close to one another this can be expected because the distance between the tls is long in addition the reflection coefficients for the case when the number of tls is higher the resonance period is wider and the number of side band peaks is greater 7 conclusions wave scattering induced by the tls over uneven bottoms was investigated using the emm the step approximation was used for the solution of the liner wave problems the structure and the bottom topography were sliced into a successive of flat shelves separated by abrupt steps utilizing the conservation of mass and momentum a system of linear equations with unknown coefficients that represented the wave amplitude and structure displacement was obtained the matching conditions of the normal flux as well as the continuity of structure displacement were imposed on the interface boundaries the sparse system of the linear equations was solved via the superlu the solution was validated through the analytical solution of lee and lee 1993 for water wave scattering induced by a rectangular floating tls over a flat bottom and good agreement was found between their results and the results of the present study the emm was further applied to explore wave scattering induced by different tls shapes over uneven bottoms the key features of wave reflection transmission coefficient and displacement of surge motion were investigated all of our results showed that a tls with a larger value of 2 π m f could produce a larger resonance period as suggested by the model that decoupled the tls system with the waves moreover wave scattering induced by tls over a stepped bottom was investigated it is found that a given tls over a larger height of stepped topography could result in a higher reflection coefficient without changing the resonance frequency furthermore the problems that occurred in wave scattering that had been induced by tls over a sunken stepped bottom yielded a similar trend to those over a stepped bottom however the shift in the resonance frequency was significant finally we demonstrated that our model could be easily extended to problems with multiple tls the improvement of the present mode to dragged surge motions with wave body multi interactions will be considered in the future 
23119,the scattering of water waves induced by tension leg structures tlss over uneven bottoms is investigated using the eigenfunction matching method emm both the wave amplitude and the surge motion displacement were assumed to be small and the linear wave theory was employed to solve the problem in the solution procedure of the step approximation the structure and the bottom configuration were sliced into a number of shelves separated by abrupt steps upon applying the conservation of mass and momentum a system of linear equations was obtained with unknown coefficients that represented the wave amplitude and the horizontal displacement of the tls the sparse system of linear equations was then solved by using the sparse matrix solver superlu the solution was validated via the theoretical solution of the wave scattering problem with a rectangular tls over a flat bottom the method was further applied to study wave scattering for different tls geometries over uneven bottoms moreover a problem with multiple tlss was studied as well keywords eigenfunction matching method emm step approximation floating structure tension leg structures tlss uneven bottom 1 introduction coastal disasters occur frequently and are caused by huge wave attacks and sea level rise these phenomena are attributed to climate change therefore coastal protection is a major concern for the mitigation of the coastal damage caused by extreme wave conditions and storm surges floating breakwaters may be sufficient for the attenuation of waves in the water area in addition floating structures may be used in fishing farms for the conservation of ecology tourism and leisure moreover they may be implemented in working stations of ocean engineering such as oil exploration stations chung 1976 engineering design also uses assembled floating structures to construct an airport on the sea as seen in the work of kagemoto et al 1998 or to provide people to live work and play on the surface of the water tension leg structures tlss are composed of semi submerged structures and pre tensioned mooring anchors on the sea bottom tlss are an innovation in the engineering practice of offshore floating breakwaters because they have a superior motion response to water wave dynamics they offer the advantage of providing good resistance and they are a creative solution in harsh environments in this work we investigate water wave scattering for three different tls shapes namely triangular trapezoidal and rectangular geometries the eigenfunction matching method emm is employed for the solution of the problem which is based on a hybrid numerical and analytical method the proposed emm is capable of simulating various tls shapes over uneven bottoms notably the emm model has a robust solution and a remarkable speed in calculation compared with existing computational fluid dynamics cfd codes tsai and chou 2015 waves exerting forces on floating structures could produce three directional motions i e surging heaving and pitching motions for simplicity and as a first step for the evaluation of the proposed method we assume that tls has an exerting force anchoring on the structure therefore only the surging motion is considered other motions are neglected in the solution of the problem waves acting on floating structures can be described using analytical solutions numerical simulations experimental studies and field observations the most famous theory for the description of wave motion is the mild slope equation mse developed by berkhoff 1972 which is a depth averaged equation that is integrated from the bottom to the water surface the mse is widely used in the simulation of wave transformations in coastal and ocean engineering problems massel 1993 utilized the eigenfunction method for the derivation of the mse in which the evanescent modes were included and the nonlinear terms of bottom curvature h 2 h and slope h h 2 were reconstructed here h x y is the horizontal gradient operator and h is the mean water depth the plane wave approximation pwa and the transfer matrix method tmm are commonly used for the description of waves traveling over a stepped bottom the former method encompassed the matching technique and the long wave approximation the bottom profiles would be sliced into a number of shelves separated by abrupt steps the latter method encompassed miles 1967 theory to investigate wave scattering over a step of arbitrary depth devillard et al 1988 extended miles theory by introducing a transfer matrix to account for the combined effect of all steps for the case of arbitrary bottom configurations o hare and davies 1992 approximated the bottom topography by using a series of shelves that were separated by abrupt steps the desired transfer of matrix tm was found by applying the prescribed method in their following study o hare and davies 1993 demonstrated that their solutions were comparable with those of the mse however their solutions converged to pseudo solutions for steep bathymetry recently tsai et al 2011 extended miles theory to the indirect eigenfunction matching method iemm by including the evanescent eigenfunctions in the prescribed horizontal velocities it should be noted that the iemm could be reduced to the tm and the pwa in the limiting case of long waves two types of breakwaters are typically designed on the sea bottom namely the gravity type and the free surface type gravity type breakwaters are conventional structures that often rest on the sea floor in addition they are built as a submerged type to fit the requirement of coastal landscape and ecology gravity type breakwaters have a heavy weight and large size and are designed by engineers for different purposes gravity breakwaters have been further improved by several researchers who have introduced porosity shih 2012 as a means of wave energy dissipation and water exchange floating breakwaters present the advantage of lower construction cost compared with that of gravity breakwaters lee and lee 1993 used the eigenfunction method and the interfaced continuity equation to analyze the surge motion of a tls in addition lee 1994 considered the fluid induced drags on linearly elastic tension legs of a tls then the model was extended to the dragged surge motion of a tls with wave large body and small body multi interactions lee and wang 2001 lee et al 1999 furthermore twin tls systems and a fish cage system were also studied lee and wang 2003 2005 gesraha 2006 investigated waves interacting with a long rectangular breakwater with two thin sideboards using eigenfunction expansions katō et al 1967 conducted laboratory experiments on four different shapes of floating structures namely inverse rectangular trapezoidal inverse trapezoidal and triangular geometries in which the transmission coefficients of each shape were compared lee and cho 2003 explored the wave scattering of a moored pontoon type floating breakwater using the element free galerkin method koutandos and prinos 2005 investigated the dynamic response of a box type wave barrier in both shallow and intermediate water regions under the action of regular and irregular waves koftis and prinos 2005 presented the dynamic behavior of a trapezoid barrier with a 45 inclined face li et al 2005 simulated wave transmission through an infinitely long cylinder in shallow and deep water regions using the modified approximation method from tsay and liu 1983 rao et al 2009 conducted experiments to study the wave transmission of a plate with varying inclination and immersion model tests were conducted by teh et al 2011 to study the dynamics of the fixed free surface semicircular breakwater with different immersion depths and porosities the experiments of günaydın and kabdaşlı 2004 showed the hydraulic performance of a u type and a type barrier under the action of regular and irregular waves in this study we investigate water wave scattering induced by a trapezoid tls over an uneven bottom using the emm previous emm studies on wave structure interaction are in fact limited to rectangular structures over a flat or a single step bottom behera et al 2016 datta and jain 1988 dhillon et al 2016 lee 1994 lee and wang 2000 2001 lee et al 1999 in this study the floating structure and the bottom topography were sliced into successive flat shelves separated by abrupt steps the matching conditions of the normal flow flux and the continuity of structure displacements were imposed on the interface boundaries the model was validated by comparing it with the analytical solution of lee and lee 1993 the emm was further applied for the description of water wave scattering for different tls geometries over uneven bottoms the key features of the wave scattering and structure dynamics response to the tls will be discussed 2 the mathematical model we consider problems of monochromatic water waves scattering that have been induced by the tls over uneven bottoms non linearities that are typically associated with the tls response are attributed to 1 free surface effects 2 the coupling of the degrees of freedom 3 the nonlinear effects on the stiffness of the tethering system and 4 the nonlinear drag force and the associated hydrodynamic damping on slender members in this study we do not consider the prescribed non linearities on the other hand we follow lee and lee 1993 to simply the study by the assumptions that both the wave amplitude and the surge motion displacement are small that only the surge motion is considered and that the linear wave theory is used the wave motion is assumed to be time harmonic e i σ t where σ 2 π t is the angular frequency t is the wave period t is the time and i is the unit of the complex number for simplicity we assume that the tension leg is sufficiently strong in order for only the surge motion to be dominant and for the remaining motions to be neglected fig 1 demonstrates the schematic of the wave scattering problem induced by the tls in the figure it shows that the sea bottom is discretized into a series of m shelves in the intervals of x m 1 x x m for m 1 2 3 m with a water depth of h m applying the linear wave theory the velocity potential governed by the laplace equation is given by 1 2 ϕ 0 where x z is the two dimensional del operator it should be noted that ϕ is only related to the spatial part of the velocity potential for the remainder of this work the problem is subjected to the free surface boundary condition 2 ϕ z σ 2 g ϕ 0 for d m 0 where d m 0 indicates that there is no tls in the interval of x m 1 x x m in addition the boundary condition on the sea bottom can be expressed in the form of 3 ϕ m z 0 on z h m and the boundary condition on the bottom of the tls is given by 4 ϕ m z 0 on z d m for d m 0 for each connection the slip conditions for each step and structure are 5 ϕ m x 0 for h m max z h m min and 6 ϕ m x i σ s for d m max z d m min in eqs 5 and 6 it is desirable to define s as the displacement of the surge motion as well as h m max max h m h m 1 and h m min min h m h m 1 a similar definition may be formulated for d m max and d m min as well in addition the matching conditions in each connection of the water are expressed as 7 ϕ m ϕ m 1 8 ϕ m x ϕ m 1 x for d m max z h m min when there is no structure on a shelf d m 0 and n 0 the wavenumber k m n can be solved via the dispersion relation 9 σ 2 g κ m n tan κ m n h m and the following relation 10 k m n i κ m n where i 1 is the imaginary unit and κ m n is the n th positive root of the dispersion relation for the positive integer n when n 0 eqs 9 and 10 can be reduced to the dispersion relation for the progressive wave that is 11 σ 2 g k m 0 tanh k m 0 h m and when there is a structure over a shelf d m 0 the wavenumber is alternatively defined as 12 k m n i n π h m d m the complex valued wavenumber k m n defined in eq 9 through 12 enables the formulation of a unified emm for all types of situations d m 0 or d m 0 n 0 or n 0 furthermore the following conditions are required to render the solution unique 13 η a e i k 1 0 x k r e i θ r e i k 1 0 x as x 14 η a k t e i θ t e i k m 0 x as x 15 ϕ i a g σ cosh k 1 0 h 1 z cosh k 1 0 h 1 e i k 1 0 x k r e i θ r e i k 1 0 x as x and 16 ϕ i a g σ cosh k m 0 h m z cosh k m 0 h m k t e i θ t e i k m 0 x as x where a is the incident wave amplitude as well as k r θ r k t and θ t are real numbers such that k r e i θ r and k t e i θ t are the reflection and transmission coefficients respectively here it should be noted that we have to assume that there is no structure over the first and the last shelves the estimation of these coefficients will be introduced in eq 26 3 the eigenfunction matching method based on the linear wave theory the complete solution of the velocity potential for the m th shelf may be expressed as 17 ϕ m x z n 0 n a m n ξ m n 1 x b m n ξ m n 2 x ζ m n z for m 1 2 3 m where a m n and b m n are the unknown coefficients of the eigenfunctions ξ m n 1 x ζ m n z and ξ m n 2 x ζ m n z respectively it should be noted that there are n 1 eigenfunction modes in eq 17 upon applying the conditions of eq 2 through 4 and by employing the method of the separation of variables the depth eigenfunction ζ m n z can be obtained and expressed as 18 ζ m n z cosh k m n h m z by observing at eq 18 we have ζ m n 1 for k m n 0 according to the sturm liouville theory zettl 2005 the following orthogonal relation is used for the solution of problem that is 19 ζ m n ζ m l λ m n δ n l where l is a mode index varying from 0 to n δ n l is the kronecker delta function and λ n is a function of h m and k m n written as 20 λ m n cosh 2 d m h m k m n for convenience we define the inner product of two orthogonal depth eigenfunctions as follows 21 f g λ 2 λ 1 f z g z d z where f and g are the depth eigenfunctions of ζ m n and λ 1 and λ 2 represent depths d m and h m respectively which correspond to the first depth eigenfunction f subsequently the spatial eigenfunctions may be defined as 22 ξ m n 1 x e i k m n x x m 1 k m n 0 1 k m n 0 and 23 ξ m n 2 x e i k m n x x m k m n 0 x k m n 0 where 24 x m x m for m 1 2 m 1 x 0 x m 0 it should be noted that the definitions of eigenfunctions ξ m n 1 x ζ m n z and ξ m n 2 x ζ m n z are valid for all cases d m 0 or d m 0 n 0 or n 0 if the complex valued wavenumber k m n is defined by eq 9 through 12 coefficients a m n and b m n in eq 17 are determined via the matching conditions at two adjacent shelves based on eqs 15 and 16 the following equations can be obtained such that 25 a 1 0 i a g σ 1 cosh k 1 0 h 1 a 1 n 0 for n 1 2 n b m n 0 for n 0 1 n and 26 k r e i θ r i b 1 0 σ a g cosh k 1 0 h 1 k t e i θ t i a m 0 σ a g cosh k m 0 h m notably the present theory uses the conservation of mass and momentum as matching conditions to solve the problem therefore the use of eq 7 results in the following expression 27 ζ m l inner ϕ m ζ m 1 l inner ϕ m 1 for l 0 1 n and m 1 2 m 1 where ζ m l inner z is the inner depth function corresponding to d m max and h m min similarly the combination of eqs 5 6 and 8 yields the following equation 28 ϕ m x ζ m l outer ϕ m 1 x ζ m l outer i σ s d m d m 1 ζ m l outer d z where ζ m l outer z is the outer depth function it should be noted that eqs 27 and 28 are valid for all four cases shown in fig 2 upon applying eq 17 eqs 27 and 28 may be derived and rewritten in the following form 29 n 0 n a m n ξ m n 1 x m b m n ξ m n 2 x m ζ m l inner ζ m n n 0 n a m 1 n ξ m 1 n 1 x m b m 1 n ξ m 1 n 2 x m ζ m l inner ζ m 1 n and 30 n 0 n a m n d ξ m n 1 d x x m b m n d ξ m n 2 d x x m ζ m n ζ m l outer n 0 n a m 1 n d ξ m 1 n 1 d x x m b m 1 n d ξ m 1 n 2 d x x m ζ m 1 n ζ m l outer i σ s d m d m 1 ζ m l outer d z it should be noted that eqs 25 29 and 30 are formed of 2 m n 1 linear equations to solve unknowns a m n b m n and s together with the equation of motion for the floating structure eqs 29 and 30 are reduced to the original equations of emm for water wave scattering without structures where d m 0 and s 0 takano 1960 tsai et al 2011 4 governing equation of structure motion the surge motion of the structure can be derived on the basis of newton s second law as 31 m i σ 2 s f w x f t x where f w x is the total horizontal wave force acting on the floating structure f t x is the horizontal component of the tension force by the legs and m is the mass of the structure the total horizontal wave forces acting on the floating structure can be expressed as 32 f w x i σ ρ m 1 m 1 d m 1 d m ϕ m small x m z d z where 33 ϕ m small ϕ m x x m for d m d m 1 ϕ m 1 x x m for d m 1 d m following the work of lee and lee 1993 we assume that the horizontal component of the tension force is linearly proportional to the displacement of the surge motion which is given by 34 f t x f s where f is the tension coefficient of the leg the combination of eqs 31 32 and 34 could result in the following expression 35 f σ 2 m s i σ ρ w m 1 m 1 d m 1 d m ϕ m small d z 0 combined with eqs 17 and 33 eq 35 provides the additional equation to solve the 2 m n 1 1 unknowns a m n b m n and s in this study we used the superlu to solve the resulting sparse system of the linear equations li 2005 after the unknowns are solved the reflection and transmission coefficients can thus be obtained by eq 26 this completes the solution procedure of the emm it should be noted that fluid induced drags on linearly elastic tension legs and wave body multi interactions may be added to the present model by following lee 1994 and lee and wang 2001 respectively 5 verification of the model the present model is first verified through two numerical examples in the following 5 1 rectangular tls over a flat bottom because the evanescent modes are included in the emm first the number of modes used in the computation must be determined this would be sufficient for providing a reasonable accuracy in the model we first consider a floating rectangular tls with b 2 m h 10 m d 2 m s h 3 m f 3679 m kg s 2 and m 1000 kg as depicted in fig 3 then we may obtain the structure density ρ s 166 7 k g m 3 here the tension coefficient is f which will be introduced in eq 37 numerical tests were conducted by using different wave periods which varies from t 4 s to t 20 s fig 4 illustrates the computed reflection and transmission coefficient against the number of eigenfunction modes used in the model the results show that the wave reflection and transmission coefficients converge at approximately n 10 this result suggests that we should use the value of n 10 as will be seen later in section 6 to verify the solution of the present theory two typical cases of b 2 m and b 4 m were investigated and the results were compared with those presented in the work of lee and lee 1993 other input conditions were d 2 m h 10 m s h 3 m and m 1000 kg the wave period in these two computational cases varies within the range of t 1 s and t 21 s the result of the reflection coefficient k r versus the wave period t is presented in fig 5 moreover the displacement s a 1 versus the wave period t is presented in fig 6 here we have defined a 1 a 1 0 for simplicity it should be mentioned that the results obtained via the emm are in good agreement with the solutions obtained by lee and lee 1993 in addition fig 7 shows the transmissions coefficients k t versus the wave period for these two cases notably the value of k t seems to satisfy the conservation of energy i e k r 2 k t 2 1 5 2 water wave scattering over an uneven bottom without the tls to verify the effect of the uneven bottom we applied the proposed model to solve the problem of water wave scattering over an uneven bottom defined by z h x with 36 h x h 0 x 0 h 0 h m h 0 1 3 l x l 2 2 l x l 0 x l h m x l where l is the length of the uneven bottom following fig 7 of porter and porter 2000 we consider the case of l h m h 0 8 and h m h 0 2 5 the convergence of the reflection coefficient for different settings of m and n are depicted in fig 8 in the figure the reflection coefficients obtained via the present model with m 100 and n 10 are in a good agreement with those obtained by porter and porter 2000 therefore we use m 100 and n 10 in the following studies 6 model applications the effect of different tls geometries over flat and stepped bottoms are intensively investigated in this section as depicted in fig 9 we investigate the problem of water wave scattering induced by a trapezoid tls with a top width of b a bottom width of b and a structure height of s h over a parabolic stepped bottom with a width of b b 2 and a height of d then we examine a flat bottom for the case d 0 and a sunken stepped bottom for the case when d 0 in addition a triangular tls corresponds to b 0 and a rectangular tls corresponds to b b in fig 9 we assume that the tension coefficient is f then we can derive the following equation 37 f ρ w g b d d 0 d 2 d 0 2 b b 2 s h h d where h is the water depth d is the ultimately submerged depth and ρ w is the water density in addition d 0 is the statically submerged depth which is defined by the following relation 38 m ρ w b d 0 d 0 2 b b 2 s h 6 1 different shapes of tls over a flat bottom basic case to further validate our model for problems with a trapezoid tls we extended the first rectangular case by setting ρ s 166 7 k g m 3 f 3679 m kg s 2 b 2 m h 10 m d 2 m and s h 3 m and by varying b from 0 a triangular tls to 1 9 approximately a rectangular tls the resulted reflection coefficient and displacement of the surge motion are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively in the figures the results for the case of b 1 9 converge to those in figs 5 a and 6 a respectively this has further validated our model regarding the reflection coefficients in fig 10 it may be observed that the minimum and maximum resonance values occur at two different wave periods namely t 5 5 s 6 5 s and t 7 0 s 10 5 s respectively in addition the case with a larger bottom width gives the larger values of the periods this can be explained as in the following if the tls system is decoupled with the waves we can have a prediction of the resonance period as 2 π m f from eqs 31 and 35 here the decoupling indicates that the total horizontal wave force f w x is an external force independent of s because the density and tension coefficients of the structure are constants the case with the larger bottom width results in the tls with the larger mass as listed in table 1 and the results of the coupled emm model and the decoupled prediction have a common trend that the case with the larger mass has the larger resonance period see fig 10 and table 1 correspondingly fig 11 demonstrates the simulated results of the displacement of the surge motion for a trapezoid tls notably for a tls a higher value in the bottom width results in a higher displacement value 6 2 different tls shapes over a flat bottom extended cases in order to further understand the effect of different tls geometries on wave scattering over a flat bottom typical tls geometries were studied namely triangular rectangular and trapezoid geometries the density of the structure as obtained from the calculations was ρ s 166 7 k g m 3 in addition the structure height was set to s h 3 m the top width varied from b 1 m to 6 m for all tls whereas the bottom width was b 0 b varied from 0 5 m to 3 m and b varied from 1 m to 6 m for the triangular trapezoid and rectangular tls respectively table 2 lists the input parameters used in the emm calculations the variations in k r and s a as a function of the relative depth are shown in figs 12 and 13 fig 12 a through c illustrate the reflection coefficient versus the relative depth for three different tls shapes they reveal that floating structures with a larger top width could produce the maximum reflection coefficient within a smaller relative depth the resonance occurs in the intervals of 0 75 k h 1 85 0 5 k h 1 25 and 0 5 k h 1 0 for a triangular a trapezoid and a rectangular tls respectively it should be noted that the relative depths are located in the intermediate water depth also the results of the coupled emm model and the decoupled prediction have a common trend on the resonance periods for the three aforementioned cases see fig 12 and table 2 however considering the typical cases of a triangular tls they have the same 2 π m f value whereas the simulated resonance frequency varies in this situation it is valuable to use the emm that couples the tls system with the waters waves via eqs 29 30 and 35 fig 13 a through c illustrate the structure displacement against the relative depth for three different tls shapes notably the structure displacement of the surge motion decreases with the increase in the mass of the floating structure 6 3 different tls shapes over a stepped bottom the emm is further employed for the investigation of wave scattering induced by different tls shapes over a stepped bottom the related researches works on wave scattering induced by tls are limited to cases of a rectangular tls over a simple bathymetry in the present study we conducted emm calculations to explore the characteristics of wave dynamics and the structure displacement response to floating structures over a multiply stepped bottom the height of the stepped bottom was selected to be d 2 m and the remaining input parameters were the same as those listed in table 1 for the trapezoid tls fig 14 a and b show the reflection coefficient and the structure displacement against the relative depth respectively it may be observed that a smaller value of the bottom width could results in the maximum reflection coefficient which is located at the highest k h value this implies that the triangular tls b 0 m could produce resonance at a higher frequency than the trapezoid and rectangular tls this also follows the trend that the case with the larger mass has the smaller resonance frequency for k h 1 the reflection coefficient increases with the increase in the relative water depth it is interesting to note that the narrow band of resonance occurs at the water depth range of 0 6 k h 0 9 to study the bottom effect we considered the same case with b 1 m however we varied the height of the stepped bottom the computational results are presented in fig 15 it may be observed that a stepped topography of a larger height can produce a slightly larger reflection coefficient without changes in the resonance frequency 6 4 different tls shapes over a sunken stepped bottom next we investigate the wave scattering induced by different tls shapes over a sunken stepped bottom the height of the stepped bottom was selected to be d 2 m and the remaining input parameters was the same as those listed in table 1 for the trapezoid tls fig 16 a presents the reflection coefficient versus the relative depth it is evident that the sunken stepped bottom produces a quite similar trend to that of the stepped bottom moreover fig 16 b depicts the displacement of the surge motion against the relative depth the effect of the sunken depth on waves scattering for the trapezoid tls is illustrated in fig 17 in the figure as the values of the sunken depth become higher the resonance frequency shifts to a higher value furthermore the frequency shift is significant compared with the results presented in fig 15 in addition it may be noticed that the effect of the sunken stepped depth on the reflection coefficient is insignificant for k h 1 5 6 5 a series of rectangular tls over a flat bottom our model can be easily applied to a series of tls here we extend the case presented in fig 5 a a series of l rectangular tls when l 1 we may refer to the previous case as a preliminary study we assumed that distance between neighboring tls was 50 m fig 18 depicts the reflection coefficients against the wave period t for different numbers l of tls in the figure we may observe that the resonance periods for different numbers of l are close to one another this can be expected because the distance between the tls is long in addition the reflection coefficients for the case when the number of tls is higher the resonance period is wider and the number of side band peaks is greater 7 conclusions wave scattering induced by the tls over uneven bottoms was investigated using the emm the step approximation was used for the solution of the liner wave problems the structure and the bottom topography were sliced into a successive of flat shelves separated by abrupt steps utilizing the conservation of mass and momentum a system of linear equations with unknown coefficients that represented the wave amplitude and structure displacement was obtained the matching conditions of the normal flux as well as the continuity of structure displacement were imposed on the interface boundaries the sparse system of the linear equations was solved via the superlu the solution was validated through the analytical solution of lee and lee 1993 for water wave scattering induced by a rectangular floating tls over a flat bottom and good agreement was found between their results and the results of the present study the emm was further applied to explore wave scattering induced by different tls shapes over uneven bottoms the key features of wave reflection transmission coefficient and displacement of surge motion were investigated all of our results showed that a tls with a larger value of 2 π m f could produce a larger resonance period as suggested by the model that decoupled the tls system with the waves moreover wave scattering induced by tls over a stepped bottom was investigated it is found that a given tls over a larger height of stepped topography could result in a higher reflection coefficient without changing the resonance frequency furthermore the problems that occurred in wave scattering that had been induced by tls over a sunken stepped bottom yielded a similar trend to those over a stepped bottom however the shift in the resonance frequency was significant finally we demonstrated that our model could be easily extended to problems with multiple tls the improvement of the present mode to dragged surge motions with wave body multi interactions will be considered in the future
