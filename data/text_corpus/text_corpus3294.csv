16470,it is well known that microplastics mps may experience weathering and aging under ultraviolet light uv irradiation but it remains unclear if these processes are impacted by natural components such as clay minerals in this study we systematically investigated the photodegradation behaviors of polyvinyl chloride pvc and poly ethylene terephthalate pet two utmost used plastics in the presence of clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite the results demonstrated that the clay minerals particularly kaolinite significantly promoted the mps photodegradation and the aging of pet was more prominent the photodegradation was the most distinct at ph 7 0 regardless of the presence or absence of the clay minerals the results of electron paramagnetic resonance and inhibition experiments of reactive oxygen species indicated that the minerals particularly kaolinite remarkably facilitated production of oh which was the key species contributing to the photodegradation of mps specifically uv irradiation facilitated the photo ionization of mps producing hydrated electrons and mp radical cations mp the lewis base sites prevalent on the clay siloxane surfaces could stabilize the mp radical cations and prevent their recombination with hydrated electrons which promoted the generation of oh under aerobic conditions and facilitated the degradation of mp two dimensional 2d fourier transformation infrared ftir correlation spectroscopy cos analysis and ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a q exactive orbitrap hf mass spectrometer were used to identify the sequential changes of functional groups and the degradation products of the mps this study improves our understanding on the aging of mps in the complex natural environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics photodegradation clay mineral degradation mechanism 2d cos 1 introduction microplastics mps as an emerging contaminant have been detected in various environmental media and raised great concerns over their hazardous effects to ecosystems he et al 2018 koelmans et al 2016 moore 2008 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020b mps are commonly defined as plastic particles less than 5 mm in effective diameter including polycarbonate pc polystyrene ps polyethylene pe and so on cole et al 2015 ding et al 2020 thompson et al 2004 mps are introduced to environment via waste disposal engineering applications and other pathways leading to relatively high level of mps in the environment chen et al 2020 ding et al 2021 koelmans et al 2016 sintim and flury 2017 mps entering the environment will be subject to a series of natural processes eventually leading to their degradation and changes in molecular structure and particle characteristics such as brittleness density size and surface charge andrady 2011 chubarenko et al 2016 ding et al 2020 kedzierski et al 2018 these changes may eventually alter the environmental behaviors ecological risks and biological effects of mps ding et al 2020 mao et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 mps may experience biotic mainly microbial thermal and photodegradation in the environment and photolysis induced by ultraviolet uv light irradiation is considered to be one of the main causes of non biological aging of mps singh and sharma 2008 wang et al 2020 uv irradiation induces the generation of reactive oxygen species ros e g hydroxyl radical oh superoxide anion radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 which result in the formation of oxygen containing functional groups on mps surface and the breakage of polymers zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 many simulation studies have been executed to disclose the degradation of mps in uv irradiation conditions remarkable photoaging of pc mps in aquatic environment were observed over the course of 640 h uv irradiation shi et al 2021 however these results were obtained in pure water without considering the impacts of natural components in the environment as the main inorganic component in soil and natural colloidal particles in surface water clay minerals play key role in the fate and transportation of polar and ionizable compounds kaiser and guggenberger 2000 sassman and lee 2005 sheng et al 2001 clay minerals also contain active substances that mediate certain biological or non biological reactions and participate in the transformation and degradation of organic pollutants chen et al 2019b zehhaf et al 2012 zehhaf et al 2015 one of our recent studies reported that minerals played critical roles in mediating the environmental behaviors of mps zhang et al 2020c in addition several studies reported that some clay minerals in aqueous solutions promoted the photochemical transformation of organic pollutants gu et al 2011 jia et al 2019 liu et al 2011 rubasinghege et al 2018 werner et al 2009 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2019a reported that smectite clay accelerated the photo transformation of tetracyclines under simulated sunlight these findings suggested the photodegradation of tetracycline was mainly attributed to the lewis base catalyzed alkalization on the clay surface under alkaline conditions the amino and phenolic groups in the tetracycline molecule became more electron rich and thus more susceptible to the electrophilic addition reaction of 1o2 it is speculated that the photodegradation of organic compounds may be related to the formation and activation of organic free radicals on the clay surface according to previous studies li et al 2014 xu et al 2019a however the possible production pathways and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood as clay minerals are ubiquitous soil minerals jin et al 2019 it is imperative to investigate their impacts on the environmental behaviors of mps although a few efforts have been made to understand the interactions between mps and clay minerals zhang et al 2020d there is a large knowledge gap about transformation of mps mediated by clay minerals which hinders our understanding about the overall fate and effects of mps in the ecosystems polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet as common engineering plastics are widely used in everyday life and industry chen et al 2019a djapovic et al 2021 they are found as macro and microplastic litters in aquatic marine and soil environments zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a however the degradation of pvc and pet mps is far from well understood therefore this study aimed to clarify the degradation behaviors of mps mediated by clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite in aqueous solutions under uv light irradiation the changes in surface morphology oxygen containing functional groups transformation products and generation of ros were inspected based on these results we tried to disclose the photodegradation pathways of mps and the mediating mechanisms of clay minerals furthermore we evaluated the photodegradation rates under different phs in the presence or absence of the minerals the results would advance our understanding into the photochemical transformation of mps in the environmental relevant conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials two types of plastic samples including the mps of pvc and pet were purchased from the local market of yangling china clay minerals of kaolinite and montmorillonite were purchased from the clay minerals society west lafayette indiana usa other chemicals and materials were listed in the supporting information text s1 2 2 photodegradation of mps and determination of weight loss photodegradation reactions of the mps were carried out in a constant temperature 25 c photochemical reactor equipped fig s1 with 500 w mercury lamp the light intensity on each quartz tube was 100 mw cm2 which is equivalent to the equatorial summer sunlight irradiation china education au light china a given amount of the clay minerals 0 25 g were dispersed in 40 ml of milliq water in which 0 1 g of mps were added the mixture was adjusted to ph 3 0 7 0 or 10 0 by titrating with 5 mm phosphate buffer and then sonicated for 30 min to ensure the mps were well dispersed in the solutions thereafter the mixture was placed in the photochemical reactor with continuous magnetic stirring to ensure uniform illumination the mps were exposed to uv irradiation for pre determined durations such as 0 1 3 5 and 7 days one control group a in which no mineral was added was set up in dark the second control b which contained the same components as the test groups was also conducted in dark the third control c also contained the same components as the test groups except that no mineral was added after the reaction the mps were filtered dried and further calculated the weight loss of mp wl which was shown in detail in supporting information text s2 the filtered leachate was also collected to identify the organic degradation intermediates during photodegradation each treatment contained three parallel replicates and the mean standard deviation sd of three replicates were reported the difference between the weight loss of mps of the three parallel samples was checked using one way analysis of variance significance level 0 05 from spss statistics software spss inc usa a scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 450 fei was used to observe the morphology of the mps before and after treatment and the size distribution was analyzed using nano measurer software two dimensional 2d attenuated total reflectance fourier transformation infrared atr ftir vertex70 germany correlation spectroscopy cos analysis and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo kalpha japan were applied to interpret the changes in surface functional groups of the mps more details are provided in text s3 and text s4 2 3 measurement of ros to further shed light on the photodegradation mechanisms of mps the aqueous suspensions of clay minerals and mps as well as the blank aqueous solution were irradiated for 7 d the blank aqueous solution kept in the dark was considered as blank control 1o2 o2 and oh were measured using an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker emxmicro 6 1 p l spectrometer karlsruhe germany more details of experiment and instrumental operation parameters of the epr scavenger were adjusted according to the description in text s5 to further evaluate the roles of ros ros scavengers including sodium azide nan3 10 mm superoxide dismutase sod 3 mg l isopropyl alcohol ipa 10 mm and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp 0 1 mm were used for the inhibition experiments chin et al 2004 fu et al 2016 halladja et al 2007 the exposure time of the quenching tests were the same as the test groups 0 1 3 5 and 7 d more information on ros scavengers was described in text s6 2 4 analysis and identification of degradation products of mps to identify the chemicals released by mps due to photodegradation the filtered leachates were identified by ultimate 3000 rapid separation liquid chromatography system dionex germering germany coupled to a q exactive hf hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer hplc ms thermo scientific bremen germany detailed information for measurements and the analytical methods are provided in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 photoaging of mps mediated by clay minerals fig 1 shows the sem images of pristine mps pet and pvc mp and the treated ones duration of 1 d and 7 d with or without the clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite at ph 7 0 the surfaces of the pristine pet and pvc mps were smooth fig 1a and h and negligible change was observed in the control groups which were kept in dark however cracks and pits were observed gradually on the surfaces of mps as the reaction proceeded fig 1 fig 1b g display the surface morphology of pet mps before and after oxidation in the absence of clay minerals the cracks on the pet mp surface were thicker and linked together after 1 d uv light exposure fig 1b when the photoaging continued for 7 d fine cracks appeared along with the larger cracks indicating that the composite film was partially broken due to decomposition fig 1c it is noticed that large holes and cracks appeared on the treated pet mps and the smooth surface morphology was completely destroyed in the presence of clay minerals as the surficial polymer was decomposed the subsurface of pet mp was exposed the sem images of pvc mp before and after photodegradation are depicted in fig 1i n the morphology of pvc mp also showed obvious changes and same trend upon exposure time overall the mps experienced greater surface changes in the presence of the minerals suggesting the minerals promoted the photodegradation of mps the degradation of mps was measured and the results are shown in fig 2 and table s1 in the control groups a and b which were kept in dark fig 2 less than 3 of the original weight was lost no matter with or without the clay minerals in the solutions suggesting that the mps were hardly degraded without uv light irradiation however the weight loss of the photoaged pet and pvc mps increased greatly which was in the range of 0 20 22 0 023 and 0 19 78 0 035 respectively and it increased continuously with the irradiation duration suggesting that mps experienced distinct degradation under uv light irradiation table s1 it was worth noting that the presence of clay minerals significantly enhanced the photodegradation of mps fig 2 for example the weight loss of pet mps in the presence of kaolinite 44 25 0 026 was distinctly higher than that of montmorillonite 35 99 0 027 and both were significantly higher than that without clays p 0 05 table s1 the results indicated that the mps photodegradation were highly dependent on the types of clays our previous study indicated that the adsorption of mps on the minerals was negligible zhang et al 2020d suggesting the increased weight loss of mps in the presence of minerals was not due to physical adsorption thus it is assumed that the clays promoted the degradation of both mps to further evaluate the impacts of minerals on the weight loss of mps a r mlclay mlno clay mlno clay was calculated for the same mp the r values in the presence of kaolinite were higher than montmorillonite table s1 implying that kaolinite exhibited stronger effects than montmorillonite on the photodegradation of mps among the two kinds of mps the photodegradation of pet was slightly but significantly higher than pvc in the presence of the minerals p 0 05 table s1 suggesting that the clay minerals displayed stronger effects on pet photodegradation 3 2 mediating mechanism of clay minerals some recent studies suggested that the generated radicals in uv light irradiation primarily contributed to the mp photodegradation zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 to understand the impacts of the minerals on the photodegradation of mps the produced ros including 1o2 o2 and oh were measured in the reaction systems fig 3 shows that the main peaks of 1o2 signals in the presence of kaolinite were stronger than montmorillonite and the control no clay suggesting that more ros were generated due to the presence of kaolinite it is noticed that no signals of oh and o2 were observed in the dark whereas strong characteristic signals were observed in the presence of both minerals oh adduct was detected in the suspension of kaolinite under light irradiation at ph 7 0 while it was not detected in the control however oh signal was very weak in the montmorillonite suspension which might be because of the low conversion rate buettner 1993 zhu et al 2020 these findings indicated that oh production was facilitated by kaolinite under the simulated uv irradiation at ph 7 0 similarly there was a strong o2 signal in the kaolinite suspension but it was very weak in the montmorillonite suspension these results were consistent with the more promoted photodegradation of the mps by kaolinite and suggested that the generated oh and o2 played important roles in the photodegradation of mps kang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 kaolinite is a 1 1 type phyllosilicate with its alumina octahedral plane exposed to the air whereas montmorillonite is a 2 1 type phyllosilicate and the alumina octahedral sheet is sandwiched between the two silica tetrahedral planes jin et al 2019 making it unable to participate directly in surface reactions scheme s1 lewis base sites are prevalent on aluminosilicate surfaces of clay minerals producing deprotonated si al hydroxide groups at the edge sites and permanent negative charges arising from isomorphic substitution xu et al 2019b the negative charges could prevent mp recombination with hydrated electrons subsequently facilitating the production of ros tian et al 2015 therefore the different structures might explain the different catalytic effects of the clay minerals fig 4 illustrates that all the ros scavengers depressed the weight loss of mps fortifying the important roles of ros fig 4 among the four tested ros scavengers ipa and sod scavengers of oh and o2 respectively exhibited the strongest inhibitory ability during mp photodegradation process suggesting a more important role played by oh and o2 than by 1o2 and 3mp which was in accordance with the utmost promoted generation of oh and o2 by kaolinite previous studies also suggested that oh was the most critical species in the photodegradation of mps zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 it was reported that the oxygen containing color groups such as peroxides in mps absorbed photons to generate oh radicals which caused the subsequent degradation of mps under uv light irradiation kaczmarek et al 2000 as shown in scheme s1 uv irradiation causes the photo ionization of mps producing hydrated electrons and mp radical cations mp pickett 2011 shi et al 2021 xu et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 the negative surface charges on the clay minerals could stabilize the mp radical cations and prevent their recombination with hydrated electrons subsequently generating oh radicals under oxic conditions joseph et al 2008 tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 3 3 effect of solution phs the photodegradation efficiency of the mps apparently increased as increasing solution ph in the range of 3 0 7 0 but then decreased as ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 figs s2 and s3 which was consistent with the sem results of mps at different phs figs s4 and s5 meanwhile at all the examined ph conditions the photodegradation of mps was higher in the presence of clay minerals fig s3 regardless of the presence or absence of clay minerals the photodegradation of mps was the highest at ph 7 0 fig s2 as shown in fig s6 a the signals of 1o2 fluctuated with the change in ph values however the oh and o2 derived from the solution show strong ph dependence which was in agreement with previous studies jin et al 2019 joseph et al 2008 tian et al 2015 as the ph increased from 3 to 7 the sign of oh and o2 sharply increased and were utmost in the presence of both minerals at ph 7 0 particularly in the presence of kaolinite fig s6 b and c this might be explained by the impact of the basal spacing of clay mineral and the contribution of o2 joseph et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 acidic conditions cause changes in the interlayer spacing of clay minerals which led to protonation of minerals and affect the conversion of organic matter soma and soma 1989 the basal spacing of clay mineral increased with ph increased which leads to protonation of clay and then accelerated the reaction rate between minerals and the accumulation of oh and o2 radicals soma and soma 1989 however varying ph has negligible impact on the basal spacing of clay mineral and oxygen in ph range 7 8 in addition high ph greatly suppressed the productions of oh and o2 fig s6 b and c at high ph conditions the release rate of o2 2 could be limited thereby affecting the formation of h2o2 and ultimately the generation of oh and o2 joseph et al 2008 the impact of oxygen is more noticeable than the basal spacing of clay mineral at ph 8 and raising ph significantly decreases the release rate of o2 2 and increases the expenses of oh buxton et al 1988 joseph et al 2008 at ph 10 the release rate of o2 2 could be limited thereby affecting the formation of h2o2 and ultimately the generation of oh and o2 joseph et al 2008 this result support that the minerals facilitated the photodegradation of mps by promoting the generation of oh and o2 which actively participated in mps degradation 3 4 photodegradation mechanism of mps 3 4 1 changes in functional groups fig 5 revealed that the changes in surface functional groups of the mps due to uv light irradiation the characteristic bands of the pristine pet mp 0 d exhibited high absorption intensities fig 5 the typical peaks at 728 873 1110 and 1715 cm 1 were observed which are related to the c o of ester bonds the ch of aromatic ring groups and the carbonyl group c o or ketone moieties respectively kang et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 for the pristine pvc mp five major characteristic peaks e g 2914 2853 1331 1254 and 600 cm 1 were observed miao et al 2020a thi kim ngan et al 2018 for instance the apparent sighs at 2914 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 are associated with the ch and ch2 of pvc ali et al 2016 domínguez jaimes et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 the bands located at 1331 and 1254 cm 1 and 600 cm 1 are attributed to ch bending from chcl and bending vibrations of ccl of pvc ali et al 2016 additionally we found that the functional groups of the mps changed significantly with the uv light irradiation time for pvc as shown in fig 5 an apparent signal was observed at around 1740 cm 1 c o which increased remarkably with the irradiation time miao et al 2020a thi kim ngan et al 2018 the intensities of signals at 2914 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 decreased with time moreover the intensities of the signals at 600 1331 and 1254 cm 1 also decreased significantly it was notable that the peaks in hydroxyl region oh 3440 cm 1 3450 cm 1 decreased firstly and then increased after 7 d of uv irradiation fig s7a this might be due to the release of plasticizer from mps in the early stage of aging and formation of oxygen related functional groups on the surface of the plastic in the later stage shi et al 2021 similarly compared with the untreated pet the treated pet showed several discernible changes such as peak shifting fig 5 especially a new peak at 3435 cm 1 was formed on the photo irradiated mps fig s7b corresponding to the hydroxyl group o h while this peak was absence in the pristine pet mp the peaks at 873 and 728 cm 1 as well as that of c o at 1715 cm 1 increased remarkably in the treated mps suggesting distinct oxidation of mps moore 2008 the peak at 1110 cm 1 representing co group increased over the course of oxidative degradation the carbonyl index ci 1715 cm 1 974 cm 1 is another indicator used to quantitatively evaluate the aging of mps during oxidation which was suitable to reflect the changes in the properties of mps during the aging process acuña bedoya et al 2021 domínguez jaimes et al 2021 fig 6 shows that the ci value increased with the exposure duration with a significant correlation p 0 05 these results provided evidence that more oxygen containing functional groups were generated during the mps aging process it is worthy to note that the ci values in the presence of kaolinite from 0 0151 0 004 to 0 3504 0 023 were higher than that of montmorillonite from 0 0151 0 004 to 0 2978 0 018 and no clay from 0 0151 0 004 to 0 2052 0 035 fig 6a moreover the ci values of pet displayed an obvious change than pvc mps within 7 d uv exposure such results showed that mps photodegradation was highly dependent on the properties of mps and clays 3 4 2 2d cos maps due to the limited information provided by the one dimensional ftir spectra 2d cos analysis was performed to further understand the changes of functional groups of the mps fig 7 for pvc seven auto peaks were identified at 600 1331 1740 2853 2914 and 3440 cm 1 along the diagonal line for the pet six major auto peaks at 728 873 1110 1715 1256 and 3435 cm 1 were also identified tables 1 and 2 show that majority of the cross peaks in the synchronous maps of pvc and pet were positive suggesting that these functional groups underwent synchronous changes i e decrease in the intensity of bands during the photodegradation based on the noda s rule dowrey et al 2001 lasch and noda 2019 noda 2006 asynchronous correlation spectroscopy revealed the order of specific chemical reactions during pvc and pet degradation table 1 reveal that the photodegradation of pvc could occur in the following order 600 and 1331 cm 1 ccl 2853 cm 1 ch2 2914 cm 1 ch 3440 cm 1 oh 1740 cm 1 c o scheme s2 a as a first step the c cl vibration 600 and 1331 cm 1 of pvc was attacked readily by obtaining electrons directly from the solution zhao et al 2018 subsequently the ch2 2853 cm 1 was greatly impacted zhao et al 2018 and then c c was formed fig s8 revealed that with increasing exposure time the intensity of the peaks related to c c bond remarkably increased additionally ch bond and ccl bonds weakened these results these results demonstrated that the long chain structures were destructed figs s8 s10 new components of oh appeared in the regional o1s spectrum fig s8 which was consistent with the results of ftir xps results also showed that the intensity of o c increased with irradiation time supporting the generation of oxygen containing groups si table s2 as expected pvc was oxidized by oh to form coh 3440 cm 1 and c o 1740 cm 1 kang et al 2019 miao et al 2020a zhu et al 2019 likewise according to the sign of 2d cos map of pet the sequential order of the band change was derived 1110 and 1256 cm 1 co of ester bonds 1715 cm 1 c o 728 cm 1 ch 873 cm 1 ch 3435 cm 1 oh scheme s2 b these results demonstrated that the degradation of pet firstly took place at the co of ester bonds which was attacked by oh wang et al 2019c secondly the peak of c o increased distinctly followed by the formation of ch groups 728 and 873 cm 1 and oh groups 3435 cm 1 of pet sun et al 2018 finally low molecular weight alcohols were formed which might be partially mineralized to co2 and h2o miao et al 2020a the xps results indicated that the o c ratio increased significantly si table s3 intensities of co and c o bonds increased suggesting that the long chain was shortened figs s8 and s9 meanwhile the intensities of the peaks related to ch remarkably increased these results collectively confirmed that oxygen containing groups were introduced in the process of aged pet mp additionally the atr ftir spectra figs s11 and s12 and 2d cos figs s13 and s14 showed that the dynamic aging mechanism of pet and pvc mp is not affected by ph tables s4 and s5 notably the intensities of the autopeaks at ph 3 0 and 7 0 were stronger than at ph 10 0 which was in line with the photodegradation characterization results figs s13 and s14 3 4 3 intermediates and degradation pathway the intermediates products of mps were identified using hplc ms figs s15 and s16 the identified substances include alkenes ketones alcohols aldehydes lactones ketoacids and esters tables s6 and s7 based on previous studies and the above results the degradation process of pvc and pet mps are proposed in scheme s2 scheme s2 a displayed the possible degradation pathway of pvc and pet in the first step the pvc mp attack the ccl bond and trigger dichlorination under uv light miao et al 2020b the dehydrochlorination readily took place with the production of carbo cations which were subsequently transformed into alkene and polyene c c structures respectively scheme s2 a step 1 gardette and lemaire 1991 jian et al 1991 in the second step pvc mp was oxidized by o2 and h2o to form oxygen containing groups e g alcohols and ketones into solution liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the third step the hydrocarbon based substances were further attacked by o2 radicals to form smaller substances with low molecular weight such as alcohols carboxylic acids and esters which were eventually degraded into co2 and h2o miao et al 2020a for pet the active substance oh attacked the c o bond scheme s2 b step 1 wang et al 2019c leading to its break and formation of short chain intermediates which were further attacked to generate pet monomers sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019c subsequently the oxidation reaction is mainly divided into two types wang et al 2019b which involves the formation of radicals during ester bond cleavage and carboxylic acid of polymer chains terminating day and wiles 1971 sang et al 2020 finally the degradation process of pet was in agreement with pvc forming low molecular weight day and wiles 1971 1972 4 conclusions clay minerals are widely present in the environment and play important roles on the fate of heavy metals and organic molecular pollutants for the first time we demonstrate that the clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite accelerated the mps photodegradation under uv light irradiation both minerals particularly kaolinite facilitated the production of oh and o2 in the reaction systems which actively participated in the degradation of mps compared with previous studies this study shows a more detailed degradation process of mps more importantly our research results show that in aqueous system clay minerals obviously promoted the mp degradation therefore the conversion of mps in mineral rich topsoil may have different manifestations and more investigations are warranted in future researches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

suggested the photodegradation of tetracycline was mainly attributed to the lewis base catalyzed alkalization on the clay surface under alkaline conditions the amino and phenolic groups in the tetracycline molecule became more electron rich and thus more susceptible to the electrophilic addition reaction of 1o2 it is speculated that the photodegradation of organic compounds may be related to the formation and activation of organic free radicals on the clay surface according to previous studies li et al 2014 xu et al 2019a however the possible production pathways and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood as clay minerals are ubiquitous soil minerals jin et al 2019 it is imperative to investigate their impacts on the environmental behaviors of mps although a few efforts have been made to understand the interactions between mps and clay minerals zhang et al 2020d there is a large knowledge gap about transformation of mps mediated by clay minerals which hinders our understanding about the overall fate and effects of mps in the ecosystems polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet as common engineering plastics are widely used in everyday life and industry chen et al 2019a djapovic et al 2021 they are found as macro and microplastic litters in aquatic marine and soil environments zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a however the degradation of pvc and pet mps is far from well understood therefore this study aimed to clarify the degradation behaviors of mps mediated by clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite in aqueous solutions under uv light irradiation the changes in surface morphology oxygen containing functional groups transformation products and generation of ros were inspected based on these results we tried to disclose the photodegradation pathways of mps and the mediating mechanisms of clay minerals furthermore we evaluated the photodegradation rates under different phs in the presence or absence of the minerals the results would advance our understanding into the photochemical transformation of mps in the environmental relevant conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials two types of plastic samples including the mps of pvc and pet were purchased from the local market of yangling china clay minerals of kaolinite and montmorillonite were purchased from the clay minerals society west lafayette indiana usa other chemicals and materials were listed in the supporting information text s1 2 2 photodegradation of mps and determination of weight loss photodegradation reactions of the mps were carried out in a constant temperature 25 c photochemical reactor equipped fig s1 with 500 w mercury lamp the light intensity on each quartz tube was 100 mw cm2 which is equivalent to the equatorial summer sunlight irradiation china education au light china a given amount of the clay minerals 0 25 g were dispersed in 40 ml of milliq water in which 0 1 g of mps were added the mixture was adjusted to ph 3 0 7 0 or 10 0 by titrating with 5 mm phosphate buffer and then sonicated for 30 min to ensure the mps were well dispersed in the solutions thereafter the mixture was placed in the photochemical reactor with continuous magnetic stirring to ensure uniform illumination the mps were exposed to uv irradiation for pre determined durations such as 0 1 3 5 and 7 days one control group a in which no mineral was added was set up in dark the second control b which contained the same components as the test groups was also conducted in dark the third control c also contained the same components as the test groups except that no mineral was added after the reaction the mps were filtered dried and further calculated the weight loss of mp wl which was shown in detail in supporting information text s2 the filtered leachate was also collected to identify the organic degradation intermediates during photodegradation each treatment contained three parallel replicates and the mean standard deviation sd of three replicates were reported the difference between the weight loss of mps of the three parallel samples was checked using one way analysis of variance significance level 0 05 from spss statistics software spss inc usa a scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 450 fei was used to observe the morphology of the mps before and after treatment and the size distribution was analyzed using nano measurer software two dimensional 2d attenuated total reflectance fourier transformation infrared atr ftir vertex70 germany correlation spectroscopy cos analysis and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo kalpha japan were applied to interpret the changes in surface functional groups of the mps more details are provided in text s3 and text s4 2 3 measurement of ros to further shed light on the photodegradation mechanisms of mps the aqueous suspensions of clay minerals and mps as well as the blank aqueous solution were irradiated for 7 d the blank aqueous solution kept in the dark was considered as blank control 1o2 o2 and oh were measured using an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker emxmicro 6 1 p l spectrometer karlsruhe germany more details of experiment and instrumental operation parameters of the epr scavenger were adjusted according to the description in text s5 to further evaluate the roles of ros ros scavengers including sodium azide nan3 10 mm superoxide dismutase sod 3 mg l isopropyl alcohol ipa 10 mm and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp 0 1 mm were used for the inhibition experiments chin et al 2004 fu et al 2016 halladja et al 2007 the exposure time of the quenching tests were the same as the test groups 0 1 3 5 and 7 d more information on ros scavengers was described in text s6 2 4 analysis and identification of degradation products of mps to identify the chemicals released by mps due to photodegradation the filtered leachates were identified by ultimate 3000 rapid separation liquid chromatography system dionex germering germany coupled to a q exactive hf hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer hplc ms thermo scientific bremen germany detailed information for measurements and the analytical methods are provided in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 photoaging of mps mediated by clay minerals fig 1 shows the sem images of pristine mps pet and pvc mp and the treated ones duration of 1 d and 7 d with or without the clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite at ph 7 0 the surfaces of the pristine pet and pvc mps were smooth fig 1a and h and negligible change was observed in the control groups which were kept in dark however cracks and pits were observed gradually on the surfaces of mps as the reaction proceeded fig 1 fig 1b g display the surface morphology of pet mps before and after oxidation in the absence of clay minerals the cracks on the pet mp surface were thicker and linked together after 1 d uv light exposure fig 1b when the photoaging continued for 7 d fine cracks appeared along with the larger cracks indicating that the composite film was partially broken due to decomposition fig 1c it is noticed that large holes and cracks appeared on the treated pet mps and the smooth surface morphology was completely destroyed in the presence of clay minerals as the surficial polymer was decomposed the subsurface of pet mp was exposed the sem images of pvc mp before and after photodegradation are depicted in fig 1i n the morphology of pvc mp also showed obvious changes and same trend upon exposure time overall the mps experienced greater surface changes in the presence of the minerals suggesting the minerals promoted the photodegradation of mps the degradation of mps was measured and the results are shown in fig 2 and table s1 in the control groups a and b which were kept in dark fig 2 less than 3 of the original weight was lost no matter with or without the clay minerals in the solutions suggesting that the mps were hardly degraded without uv light irradiation however the weight loss of the photoaged pet and pvc mps increased greatly which was in the range of 0 20 22 0 023 and 0 19 78 0 035 respectively and it increased continuously with the irradiation duration suggesting that mps experienced distinct degradation under uv light irradiation table s1 it was worth noting that the presence of clay minerals significantly enhanced the photodegradation of mps fig 2 for example the weight loss of pet mps in the presence of kaolinite 44 25 0 026 was distinctly higher than that of montmorillonite 35 99 0 027 and both were significantly higher than that without clays p 0 05 table s1 the results indicated that the mps photodegradation were highly dependent on the types of clays our previous study indicated that the adsorption of mps on the minerals was negligible zhang et al 2020d suggesting the increased weight loss of mps in the presence of minerals was not due to physical adsorption thus it is assumed that the clays promoted the degradation of both mps to further evaluate the impacts of minerals on the weight loss of mps a r mlclay mlno clay mlno clay was calculated for the same mp the r values in the presence of kaolinite were higher than montmorillonite table s1 implying that kaolinite exhibited stronger effects than montmorillonite on the photodegradation of mps among the two kinds of mps the photodegradation of pet was slightly but significantly higher than pvc in the presence of the minerals p 0 05 table s1 suggesting that the clay minerals displayed stronger effects on pet photodegradation 3 2 mediating mechanism of clay minerals some recent studies suggested that the generated radicals in uv light irradiation primarily contributed to the mp photodegradation zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 to understand the impacts of the minerals on the photodegradation of mps the produced ros including 1o2 o2 and oh were measured in the reaction systems fig 3 shows that the main peaks of 1o2 signals in the presence of kaolinite were stronger than montmorillonite and the control no clay suggesting that more ros were generated due to the presence of kaolinite it is noticed that no signals of oh and o2 were observed in the dark whereas strong characteristic signals were observed in the presence of both minerals oh adduct was detected in the suspension of kaolinite under light irradiation at ph 7 0 while it was not detected in the control however oh signal was very weak in the montmorillonite suspension which might be because of the low conversion rate buettner 1993 zhu et al 2020 these findings indicated that oh production was facilitated by kaolinite under the simulated uv irradiation at ph 7 0 similarly there was a strong o2 signal in the kaolinite suspension but it was very weak in the montmorillonite suspension these results were consistent with the more promoted photodegradation of the mps by kaolinite and suggested that the generated oh and o2 played important roles in the photodegradation of mps kang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 kaolinite is a 1 1 type phyllosilicate with its alumina octahedral plane exposed to the air whereas montmorillonite is a 2 1 type phyllosilicate and the alumina octahedral sheet is sandwiched between the two silica tetrahedral planes jin et al 2019 making it unable to participate directly in surface reactions scheme s1 lewis base sites are prevalent on aluminosilicate surfaces of clay minerals producing deprotonated si al hydroxide groups at the edge sites and permanent negative charges arising from isomorphic substitution xu et al 2019b the negative charges could prevent mp recombination with hydrated electrons subsequently facilitating the production of ros tian et al 2015 therefore the different structures might explain the different catalytic effects of the clay minerals fig 4 illustrates that all the ros scavengers depressed the weight loss of mps fortifying the important roles of ros fig 4 among the four tested ros scavengers ipa and sod scavengers of oh and o2 respectively exhibited the strongest inhibitory ability during mp photodegradation process suggesting a more important role played by oh and o2 than by 1o2 and 3mp which was in accordance with the utmost promoted generation of oh and o2 by kaolinite previous studies also suggested that oh was the most critical species in the photodegradation of mps zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 it was reported that the oxygen containing color groups such as peroxides in mps absorbed photons to generate oh radicals which caused the subsequent degradation of mps under uv light irradiation kaczmarek et al 2000 as shown in scheme s1 uv irradiation causes the photo ionization of mps producing hydrated electrons and mp radical cations mp pickett 2011 shi et al 2021 xu et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 the negative surface charges on the clay minerals could stabilize the mp radical cations and prevent their recombination with hydrated electrons subsequently generating oh radicals under oxic conditions joseph et al 2008 tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 3 3 effect of solution phs the photodegradation efficiency of the mps apparently increased as increasing solution ph in the range of 3 0 7 0 but then decreased as ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 figs s2 and s3 which was consistent with the sem results of mps at different phs figs s4 and s5 meanwhile at all the examined ph conditions the photodegradation of mps was higher in the presence of clay minerals fig s3 regardless of the presence or absence of clay minerals the photodegradation of mps was the highest at ph 7 0 fig s2 as shown in fig s6 a the signals of 1o2 fluctuated with the change in ph values however the oh and o2 derived from the solution show strong ph dependence which was in agreement with previous studies jin et al 2019 joseph et al 2008 tian et al 2015 as the ph increased from 3 to 7 the sign of oh and o2 sharply increased and were utmost in the presence of both minerals at ph 7 0 particularly in the presence of kaolinite fig s6 b and c this might be explained by the impact of the basal spacing of clay mineral and the contribution of o2 joseph et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 acidic conditions cause changes in the interlayer spacing of clay minerals which led to protonation of minerals and affect the conversion of organic matter soma and soma 1989 the basal spacing of clay mineral increased with ph increased which leads to protonation of clay and then accelerated the reaction rate between minerals and the accumulation of oh and o2 radicals soma and soma 1989 however varying ph has negligible impact on the basal spacing of clay mineral and oxygen in ph range 7 8 in addition high ph greatly suppressed the productions of oh and o2 fig s6 b and c at high ph conditions the release rate of o2 2 could be limited thereby affecting the formation of h2o2 and ultimately the generation of oh and o2 joseph et al 2008 the impact of oxygen is more noticeable than the basal spacing of clay mineral at ph 8 and raising ph significantly decreases the release rate of o2 2 and increases the expenses of oh buxton et al 1988 joseph et al 2008 at ph 10 the release rate of o2 2 could be limited thereby affecting the formation of h2o2 and ultimately the generation of oh and o2 joseph et al 2008 this result support that the minerals facilitated the photodegradation of mps by promoting the generation of oh and o2 which actively participated in mps degradation 3 4 photodegradation mechanism of mps 3 4 1 changes in functional groups fig 5 revealed that the changes in surface functional groups of the mps due to uv light irradiation the characteristic bands of the pristine pet mp 0 d exhibited high absorption intensities fig 5 the typical peaks at 728 873 1110 and 1715 cm 1 were observed which are related to the c o of ester bonds the ch of aromatic ring groups and the carbonyl group c o or ketone moieties respectively kang et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 for the pristine pvc mp five major characteristic peaks e g 2914 2853 1331 1254 and 600 cm 1 were observed miao et al 2020a thi kim ngan et al 2018 for instance the apparent sighs at 2914 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 are associated with the ch and ch2 of pvc ali et al 2016 domínguez jaimes et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 the bands located at 1331 and 1254 cm 1 and 600 cm 1 are attributed to ch bending from chcl and bending vibrations of ccl of pvc ali et al 2016 additionally we found that the functional groups of the mps changed significantly with the uv light irradiation time for pvc as shown in fig 5 an apparent signal was observed at around 1740 cm 1 c o which increased remarkably with the irradiation time miao et al 2020a thi kim ngan et al 2018 the intensities of signals at 2914 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 decreased with time moreover the intensities of the signals at 600 1331 and 1254 cm 1 also decreased significantly it was notable that the peaks in hydroxyl region oh 3440 cm 1 3450 cm 1 decreased firstly and then increased after 7 d of uv irradiation fig s7a this might be due to the release of plasticizer from mps in the early stage of aging and formation of oxygen related functional groups on the surface of the plastic in the later stage shi et al 2021 similarly compared with the untreated pet the treated pet showed several discernible changes such as peak shifting fig 5 especially a new peak at 3435 cm 1 was formed on the photo irradiated mps fig s7b corresponding to the hydroxyl group o h while this peak was absence in the pristine pet mp the peaks at 873 and 728 cm 1 as well as that of c o at 1715 cm 1 increased remarkably in the treated mps suggesting distinct oxidation of mps moore 2008 the peak at 1110 cm 1 representing co group increased over the course of oxidative degradation the carbonyl index ci 1715 cm 1 974 cm 1 is another indicator used to quantitatively evaluate the aging of mps during oxidation which was suitable to reflect the changes in the properties of mps during the aging process acuña bedoya et al 2021 domínguez jaimes et al 2021 fig 6 shows that the ci value increased with the exposure duration with a significant correlation p 0 05 these results provided evidence that more oxygen containing functional groups were generated during the mps aging process it is worthy to note that the ci values in the presence of kaolinite from 0 0151 0 004 to 0 3504 0 023 were higher than that of montmorillonite from 0 0151 0 004 to 0 2978 0 018 and no clay from 0 0151 0 004 to 0 2052 0 035 fig 6a moreover the ci values of pet displayed an obvious change than pvc mps within 7 d uv exposure such results showed that mps photodegradation was highly dependent on the properties of mps and clays 3 4 2 2d cos maps due to the limited information provided by the one dimensional ftir spectra 2d cos analysis was performed to further understand the changes of functional groups of the mps fig 7 for pvc seven auto peaks were identified at 600 1331 1740 2853 2914 and 3440 cm 1 along the diagonal line for the pet six major auto peaks at 728 873 1110 1715 1256 and 3435 cm 1 were also identified tables 1 and 2 show that majority of the cross peaks in the synchronous maps of pvc and pet were positive suggesting that these functional groups underwent synchronous changes i e decrease in the intensity of bands during the photodegradation based on the noda s rule dowrey et al 2001 lasch and noda 2019 noda 2006 asynchronous correlation spectroscopy revealed the order of specific chemical reactions during pvc and pet degradation table 1 reveal that the photodegradation of pvc could occur in the following order 600 and 1331 cm 1 ccl 2853 cm 1 ch2 2914 cm 1 ch 3440 cm 1 oh 1740 cm 1 c o scheme s2 a as a first step the c cl vibration 600 and 1331 cm 1 of pvc was attacked readily by obtaining electrons directly from the solution zhao et al 2018 subsequently the ch2 2853 cm 1 was greatly impacted zhao et al 2018 and then c c was formed fig s8 revealed that with increasing exposure time the intensity of the peaks related to c c bond remarkably increased additionally ch bond and ccl bonds weakened these results these results demonstrated that the long chain structures were destructed figs s8 s10 new components of oh appeared in the regional o1s spectrum fig s8 which was consistent with the results of ftir xps results also showed that the intensity of o c increased with irradiation time supporting the generation of oxygen containing groups si table s2 as expected pvc was oxidized by oh to form coh 3440 cm 1 and c o 1740 cm 1 kang et al 2019 miao et al 2020a zhu et al 2019 likewise according to the sign of 2d cos map of pet the sequential order of the band change was derived 1110 and 1256 cm 1 co of ester bonds 1715 cm 1 c o 728 cm 1 ch 873 cm 1 ch 3435 cm 1 oh scheme s2 b these results demonstrated that the degradation of pet firstly took place at the co of ester bonds which was attacked by oh wang et al 2019c secondly the peak of c o increased distinctly followed by the formation of ch groups 728 and 873 cm 1 and oh groups 3435 cm 1 of pet sun et al 2018 finally low molecular weight alcohols were formed which might be partially mineralized to co2 and h2o miao et al 2020a the xps results indicated that the o c ratio increased significantly si table s3 intensities of co and c o bonds increased suggesting that the long chain was shortened figs s8 and s9 meanwhile the intensities of the peaks related to ch remarkably increased these results collectively confirmed that oxygen containing groups were introduced in the process of aged pet mp additionally the atr ftir spectra figs s11 and s12 and 2d cos figs s13 and s14 showed that the dynamic aging mechanism of pet and pvc mp is not affected by ph tables s4 and s5 notably the intensities of the autopeaks at ph 3 0 and 7 0 were stronger than at ph 10 0 which was in line with the photodegradation characterization results figs s13 and s14 3 4 3 intermediates and degradation pathway the intermediates products of mps were identified using hplc ms figs s15 and s16 the identified substances include alkenes ketones alcohols aldehydes lactones ketoacids and esters tables s6 and s7 based on previous studies and the above results the degradation process of pvc and pet mps are proposed in scheme s2 scheme s2 a displayed the possible degradation pathway of pvc and pet in the first step the pvc mp attack the ccl bond and trigger dichlorination under uv light miao et al 2020b the dehydrochlorination readily took place with the production of carbo cations which were subsequently transformed into alkene and polyene c c structures respectively scheme s2 a step 1 gardette and lemaire 1991 jian et al 1991 in the second step pvc mp was oxidized by o2 and h2o to form oxygen containing groups e g alcohols and ketones into solution liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the third step the hydrocarbon based substances were further attacked by o2 radicals to form smaller substances with low molecular weight such as alcohols carboxylic acids and esters which were eventually degraded into co2 and h2o miao et al 2020a for pet the active substance oh attacked the c o bond scheme s2 b step 1 wang et al 2019c leading to its break and formation of short chain intermediates which were further attacked to generate pet monomers sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019c subsequently the oxidation reaction is mainly divided into two types wang et al 2019b which involves the formation of radicals during ester bond cleavage and carboxylic acid of polymer chains terminating day and wiles 1971 sang et al 2020 finally the degradation process of pet was in agreement with pvc forming low molecular weight day and wiles 1971 1972 4 conclusions clay minerals are widely present in the environment and play important roles on the fate of heavy metals and organic molecular pollutants for the first time we demonstrate that the clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite accelerated the mps photodegradation under uv light irradiation both minerals particularly kaolinite facilitated the production of oh and o2 in the reaction systems which actively participated in the degradation of mps compared with previous studies this study shows a more detailed degradation process of mps more importantly our research results show that in aqueous system clay minerals obviously promoted the mp degradation therefore the conversion of mps in mineral rich topsoil may have different manifestations and more investigations are warranted in future researches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16471,image graphical abstract abstract conventional water disinfection with chlorine is limited by the inconvenience of their transportation and storage and by the production of potentially harmful disinfection by products dbps electric field treatment eft formally studied for food processing inactivates pathogens by damaging cell membranes through irreversible electroporation electroporation is a physical phenomenon which potentially avoids the use of chemical disinfectants and the formation of dbps nevertheless eft has rarely been considered to disinfect water let alone large scale industrial applications in this article we aim to discuss the feasibility of eft as an alternative drinking water disinfection technology we briefly summarize the recent advances of eft for pathogen inactivation with a focus on industrial applications in food processing subsequently we introduce the basics of eft and analyze its feasibility to be implemented in water disinfection we believe that eft has the potential to become a competitive candidate in the technology toolbox of water disinfection high energy consumption is identified as the major barrier which can potentially be overcome by reducing the distance between the electrodes or applying a locally enhanced electric field lastly we discuss the research needs and call for actions of researchers in different disciplines to promote the implementation of eft in water disinfection keywords locally enhanced electric field treatment leeft disinfection by product dbp electroporation bacteria viruses both our water and food can be contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms most of the pathogens present in water can also be found in food and vice versa acheson 2009 these waterborne and foodborne pathogens have posed enormous health concerns and economic loss to society globally thus the approaches to control and inactivate pathogens are of great interest in both water treatment and food production electric field treatment eft has shown great potential in the processing of liquid food such as juice alcoholic and dairy products as a non thermal process eft will not affect the flavor texture and nutrient of the food if the processing temperature is controlled mcauley et al 2016 eft systems available on the market can process up to 10 000 l of liquid food per hour the cost for the pathogen inactivation of beverages is estimated to be 10 euro ton 1 which is already affordable in some circumstances a commercial eft system usually contains a treatment chamber batch or continuous a pulse generator and its accessories encapsulated in a stainless steel box for safety concerns the footprint is usually a few m2 primarily depending on its treatment capacity and the size of the pulse generator although training is still needed for the users the friendly user interface and protection accessories have made eft devices easy and safe to operate in a survey article eft is named the top three most significant technology currently available by food professionals from industry academia and government jermann et al 2015 eft is also rated the third to be of the most commercial importance in ten years jermann et al 2015 the investigation of eft in liquid food processing has mainly focused on the development of more reliable eft systems for larger scale applications such development is primarily driven by three objectives 1 providing a more uniform electric field in order to avoid localized overheating 2 reducing the applied voltage in order to lower the overall energy consumption and 3 developing more stable electrodes in order to minimize electrochemical reactions electrode erosion and contamination of products buckow et al 2011 experton and martin 2018 experton et al 2016 gonzález sosa et al 2014 huo et al 2016 2018 knoerzer et al 2012 masood et al 2018 2017 peng et al 2017 zhou et al 2020a in addition researchers have studied the inactivation mechanisms the influence of processing parameters on the performance and the inactivation efficiency of eft against different bacteria in different liquid foods arroyo et al 2010 jeyamkondan et al 1999 kotnik et al 2003 mahnič kalamiza et al 2014 mañas et al 2001 montanari et al 2019 sharma et al 2014 somolinos et al 2008 timmermans et al 2014 toepfl et al 2007 2006 nevertheless eft has rarely been studied as a water disinfection technique let alone large scale industrial applications notably eft employs a physical process i e electroporation to inactivate pathogens which avoids the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps associated with chemical disinfection therefore the objectives of this article are to 1 introduce eft for pathogen inactivation 2 discuss the feasibility of eft for water disinfection 3 identify the major obstacles and propose potential solutions and 4 point out future research directions 1 overview of eft eft has been applied as a pathogen inactivation method for several decades as a non thermal physical process eft avoids the use of chemicals and the production of harmful dbps possessing an intrinsic advantage over chemical disinfection methods jeyamkondan et al 1999 raso pueyo and heinz 2010 in a most conventional eft the liquid to be treated flows through a treatment chamber consisting of two parallel plate electrodes huang and wang 2009 jeyamkondan et al 1999 the typical distance separating the two parallel electrodes ranges from 1 to 10 mm rezaeimotlagh et al 2018 sharma et al 2014 timmermans et al 2014 walter et al 2016 high voltage electric pulses up to several tens of kilovolts with short durations typically in microseconds are applied between the electrodes to generate a strong electric field with minimal electrochemical reactions chang and park 2010 the strong electric field is expected to induce irreversible electroporation that damages the cell membrane and thus cell inactivation the theory of electroporation was established primarily using bacteria as the model microorganisms weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 a resting transmembrane potential tmp typically in the range of tens of millivolts is maintained across the bacteria lipid bilayer membrane due to the distribution of charged ions inside versus outside of the membrane felle et al 1980 stratford et al 2019 when a bacterial cell is placed in an electric field an additional tmp i e tmp is induced kotnik et al 2015 when the electric field is strong enough the tmp exceeds the breakdown threshold and thus electroporation occurs the conductivity and permeability of the bacterial membrane increase and electroporated pores are formed on the membrane chang and reese 1990 weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 the breakdown tmp threshold ranges from 250 mv to 1 v depending on the characteristics of the microbes size shape and orientation in the field etc jeyamkondan et al 1999 initial electroporation is reversible microbial cells reseal the pores and heal themselves and thus maintain their activities kotnik et al 2015 as the tmp increases electroporation gradually evolves from reversible to irreversible weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 in this case the electroporated cells cannot reseal and lose their viability causing microbial inactivation kotnik et al 2015 applying eft for pathogen inactivation has multiple advantages as a physical process eft does not require the addition of chemicals nor theoretically generate harmful dbps weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 eft is capable of inactivating a wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms because eft targets microbial lipid bilayer structures gusbeth et al 2009 eft can be a fast treatment process to achieve high pathogen inactivation efficiency if the electric field strength is strong because irreversible electroporation can happen in a few microseconds or less shahini and yeow 2013 in terms of operation eft only relies on electricity and does not need the transportation and storage of chemicals meanwhile eft does not introduce secondary pollution in terms of odor sound or light weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 2 feasibility of eft for water disinfection the pathogen inactivation processes for drinking water and liquid food share the same goal of achieving a high inactivation efficiency against a broad spectrum of pathogens nevertheless drinking water and liquid food have different properties table 1 in a conventional drinking water treatment process the source water to be disinfected usually has a nearly neutral ph 6 8 low conductivity 200 2000 µs cm 1 and low total solid concentration 50 mg l 1 fernández et al 2018 gusbeth et al 2009 mañas et al 2001 seratlić et al 2013 liquid food to be processed can be much more complex for example fruit juice is usually acidic with a ph of 2 5 huang et al 2014 majstorović et al 2017 rezaeimotlagh et al 2018 the viscosity of dairy products can be much higher than that of drinking water table 1 cregenzán alberti et al 2015 jaeger et al 2009 mañas et al 2001 mcauley et al 2016 theoretically eft for water disinfection can achieve efficacy at least similar to that for liquid food processing because pathogens found in water are similar to those in liquid foods and the physicochemical properties of water are also within the range of those for liquid foods in addition drinking water is relatively nutrient deficient compared to liquid food making the pathogens more difficult to survive drinking water also typically has fewer particles and organic molecules that can protect pathogens from inactivation by shading or other mechanisms therefore higher pathogen inactivation efficiency can actually be expected when eft is used in water 3 the major barrier and potential solutions for the implementation of eft for water disinfection the high cost associated with the extensive energy consumption is the major barrier of eft for liquid food processing rodriguez gonzalez et al 2015 this concern will be more significant when applying eft for water disinfection because drinking water is typically less valuable than liquid food according to the literature the specific energy consumption of eft for liquid food processing is 40 1000 kj l 1 assuming the liquid density is 1 kg l 1 saldaña et al 2010 timmermans et al 2014 walter et al 2016 which is significantly higher than that of some other technologies that mainly consumes electrical energy for water disinfection e g 20 100 j l 1 for uv and 20 150 j l 1 for ozone which has been adopted and optimized for decades chang et al 2008 compared to liquid food processing the energy consumption of eft for water disinfection can potentially be lower because the conductivity of drinking water is significantly lower than that of liquid food table 1 indicating that the energy unintentionally diverted for heat generation is largely reduced nevertheless efforts are still needed to further reduce the energy consumption of eft to make it affordable for water disinfection the general idea to reduce the energy consumption of eft is to operate the process at lower voltages when the operating voltage is lower energy conversion efficiency for pulse generation is typically higher in addition side electrochemical reactions and unintentional heating can also be reduced nevertheless according to the current theory of electroporation the electric field strength needs to reach a threshold value to cause irreversible electroporation i e cell inactivation therefore high electric field strength needs to be maintained while lowering the operating voltages which has been realized by two different strategies first we can reduce the distance between the electrodes for the flow by eft systems electric field direction perpendicular to the fluid flow fig 1 a or apply co field or converged configurations for the flow through eft systems electric field direction parallel to the fluid flow fig 1b eveke and brunkhorst 2004 evrendilek and zhang 2005 in both cases the treated fluid needs to flow through narrower channels which will result in a higher risk of clogging and require more energy to push the fluid through huang and wang 2009 this strategy has been investigated in food processing for many years and the knowledge gained from these studies can be applied for water treatment as drinking water usually has fewer solid components and lower viscosity than most liquid foods table 1 eft systems for drinking water disinfection may apply narrower channels than those for liquid food processing nevertheless the throughput of the system will be limited and may not be practical for large scale applications another strategy to achieve high electric field strength with low operating voltages is applying locally enhanced eft leeft the design goal of conventional eft is to achieve a uniform electric field and avoid dead zones so that all pathogens in the system can be inactivated simultaneously differently leeft aims to enhance the electric field locally and to transport pathogens to these regions by various forces e g hydrodynamic electrophoretic and dielectrophoretic to achieve high efficiency disinfection the electric field can be enhanced locally at two different levels at the macro scale coaxial electrodes instead of parallel electrodes can be applied fig 1c with this configuration the electric field is stronger when closer to the center electrode secondly the electrode surface can be modified with micro scale structures with sharp tips e g nanowires fig 1d attributed to the lightning rod effect the electric field near the tips is significantly stronger poudineh et al 2014 simulation results show that the electric field strength can be enhanced by at least 3 4 orders of magnitude liu et al 2014 different from the first strategy that has been applied for food processing leeft was first developed for water treatment and has demonstrated high efficiency disinfection huo et al 2018 zhou et al 2020b 2020c when both synthetic and natural water samples dosed with model bacteria are treated by leeft inactivation efficiencies of 6 logs have been realized with applied voltages as low as 1 v zhou et al 2020b during leeft pathogens will be exposed to the locally enhanced electric field and inactivated but the bulk water is only exposed to the background electric field with much lower strength this paradigm shifting strategy makes the leeft intrinsically a very low energy consuming process at the bench scale the specific energy consumption of 1 5 j l 1 has been achieved according to the operating current and voltage huo et al 2016 zhou et al 2020c nevertheless the development of leeft is still at a very early stage and many challenges still need to be addressed before its real world applications more discussion on leeft can be found in recent publications that talk about electrode materials electrode lifetime concerns of secondary contaminants etc zhou et al 2020b zhou et al 2020c 4 future research and perspectives much higher energy consumption of eft compared with competing technologies is still the major barrier to overcome for water disinfection even though the above mentioned two strategies have been applied to dramatically reduce the energy consumption in bench scale prototypes implementation in full scale eft systems requires much more effort for example the lifetime of the nanowire modified leeft electrode is still too short and needs significant improvement meanwhile researchers also need to look for other strategies that can reduce the energy consumption of eft such as improve the energy efficiency of pulse generation and minimize heat generation besides the major barrier in energy consumption there are other aspects of applying eft for water disinfection that need future investigation food scientists have intensively studied the influence of liquid property parameters including temperature ph conductivity water activity and protein and fat components on the performance of eft arroyo et al 2010 fernández et al 2018 somolinos et al 2008 timmermans et al 2014 for the applications in drinking water disinfection more studies are needed to investigate the influence of specific water quality characteristics such as turbidity and alkalinity as well as inorganic ions e g ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 and dissolved organic matters e g humic acids that commonly exist in natural water bodies most existing studies of eft for water disinfection used a handful of common model bacteria more investigation is needed on different microorganisms including pathogenic bacteria bacterial spores viruses and protozoa the reactor of the eft also needs to be rationally designed for water treatment computational fluid dynamics can be used to access the flow regime and pressure drop which could be beneficial for the optimization of the reactor configuration in addition different from liquid food processing that is typically conducted at industrial scales by the manufacturers drinking water disinfection can be applied not only in large centralized treatment plants but also through the water distribution pipelines and at the point of use for individual houses drinking water disinfection is also needed for remote places without grid power e g islands ships submarines space stations and developing areas or emergency situations when the grid power is disrupted e g earthquakes and hurricanes therefore specific challenges will need to be addressed for eft to be adopted for drinking water disinfection at different scales and under different scenarios promoting the implementation of eft in drinking water disinfection requires the collaboration of water treatment scientists and engineers with other experts from multiple disciplines for example microbiologists can strengthen the understanding of the electroporation process in different water matrix which provides fundamental knowledge to the mechanism of pathogen inactivation in eft electrical engineers can design and optimize the pulse generator and control circuits specifically for water treatment mechanical engineers can improve the cooling system in those eft systems with overheating issues material scientists can develop new electrodes with higher stability lower cost and or specific surface features to provide the electric field enhancement effect food scientists who have applied eft for liquid food processing can also share their acquired knowledge and experience and provide insights into the eft for drinking water disinfection 5 conclusions the next generation water disinfection technologies should minimize the use of chemicals the consumption of energy and the impact on the environment while having high resilience for different application scenarios deng 2021 shannon et al 2010 we believe that eft has the potential to become a competitive candidate in the technology toolbox for next generation water disinfection after analyzing both the feasibility and challenges of eft for water disinfection we offer the following insights 1 as a physical process eft holds intrinsic merit comparing to chemical methods the microbial inactivation by electroporation introduces no dbps to the treated water 2 the operation of eft only relies on electricity which is very easy to transport compared with chemical disinfectants and can also be generated on site to ensure resilience 3 even though the cost of electricity keeps dropping and can potentially be very low in the future the energy consumption of eft devices is still much higher than that of current water disinfection techniques which becomes the major barrier of eft potential solutions include redesigning the device configuration and electrode materials e g leeft 4 with further development eft is promising to be applicable in the water treatment systems with reasonable cost to provide safer and more reliable drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors

16471,image graphical abstract abstract conventional water disinfection with chlorine is limited by the inconvenience of their transportation and storage and by the production of potentially harmful disinfection by products dbps electric field treatment eft formally studied for food processing inactivates pathogens by damaging cell membranes through irreversible electroporation electroporation is a physical phenomenon which potentially avoids the use of chemical disinfectants and the formation of dbps nevertheless eft has rarely been considered to disinfect water let alone large scale industrial applications in this article we aim to discuss the feasibility of eft as an alternative drinking water disinfection technology we briefly summarize the recent advances of eft for pathogen inactivation with a focus on industrial applications in food processing subsequently we introduce the basics of eft and analyze its feasibility to be implemented in water disinfection we believe that eft has the potential to become a competitive candidate in the technology toolbox of water disinfection high energy consumption is identified as the major barrier which can potentially be overcome by reducing the distance between the electrodes or applying a locally enhanced electric field lastly we discuss the research needs and call for actions of researchers in different disciplines to promote the implementation of eft in water disinfection keywords locally enhanced electric field treatment leeft disinfection by product dbp electroporation bacteria viruses both our water and food can be contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms most of the pathogens present in water can also be found in food and vice versa acheson 2009 these waterborne and foodborne pathogens have posed enormous health concerns and economic loss to society globally thus the approaches to control and inactivate pathogens are of great interest in both water treatment and food production electric field treatment eft has shown great potential in the processing of liquid food such as juice alcoholic and dairy products as a non thermal process eft will not affect the flavor texture and nutrient of the food if the processing temperature is controlled mcauley et al 2016 eft systems available on the market can process up to 10 000 l of liquid food per hour the cost for the pathogen inactivation of beverages is estimated to be 10 euro ton 1 which is already affordable in some circumstances a commercial eft system usually contains a treatment chamber batch or continuous a pulse generator and its accessories encapsulated in a stainless steel box for safety concerns the footprint is usually a few m2 primarily depending on its treatment capacity and the size of the pulse generator although training is still needed for the users the friendly user interface and protection accessories have made eft devices easy and safe to operate in a survey article eft is named the top three most significant technology currently available by food professionals from industry academia and government jermann et al 2015 eft is also rated the third to be of the most commercial importance in ten years jermann et al 2015 the investigation of eft in liquid food processing has mainly focused on the development of more reliable eft systems for larger scale applications such development is primarily driven by three objectives 1 providing a more uniform electric field in order to avoid localized overheating 2 reducing the applied voltage in order to lower the overall energy consumption and 3 developing more stable electrodes in order to minimize electrochemical reactions electrode erosion and contamination of products buckow et al 2011 experton and martin 2018 experton et al 2016 gonzález sosa et al 2014 huo et al 2016 2018 knoerzer et al 2012 masood et al 2018 2017 peng et al 2017 zhou et al 2020a in addition researchers have studied the inactivation mechanisms the influence of processing parameters on the performance and the inactivation efficiency of eft against different bacteria in different liquid foods arroyo et al 2010 jeyamkondan et al 1999 kotnik et al 2003 mahnič kalamiza et al 2014 mañas et al 2001 montanari et al 2019 sharma et al 2014 somolinos et al 2008 timmermans et al 2014 toepfl et al 2007 2006 nevertheless eft has rarely been studied as a water disinfection technique let alone large scale industrial applications notably eft employs a physical process i e electroporation to inactivate pathogens which avoids the formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps associated with chemical disinfection therefore the objectives of this article are to 1 introduce eft for pathogen inactivation 2 discuss the feasibility of eft for water disinfection 3 identify the major obstacles and propose potential solutions and 4 point out future research directions 1 overview of eft eft has been applied as a pathogen inactivation method for several decades as a non thermal physical process eft avoids the use of chemicals and the production of harmful dbps possessing an intrinsic advantage over chemical disinfection methods jeyamkondan et al 1999 raso pueyo and heinz 2010 in a most conventional eft the liquid to be treated flows through a treatment chamber consisting of two parallel plate electrodes huang and wang 2009 jeyamkondan et al 1999 the typical distance separating the two parallel electrodes ranges from 1 to 10 mm rezaeimotlagh et al 2018 sharma et al 2014 timmermans et al 2014 walter et al 2016 high voltage electric pulses up to several tens of kilovolts with short durations typically in microseconds are applied between the electrodes to generate a strong electric field with minimal electrochemical reactions chang and park 2010 the strong electric field is expected to induce irreversible electroporation that damages the cell membrane and thus cell inactivation the theory of electroporation was established primarily using bacteria as the model microorganisms weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 a resting transmembrane potential tmp typically in the range of tens of millivolts is maintained across the bacteria lipid bilayer membrane due to the distribution of charged ions inside versus outside of the membrane felle et al 1980 stratford et al 2019 when a bacterial cell is placed in an electric field an additional tmp i e tmp is induced kotnik et al 2015 when the electric field is strong enough the tmp exceeds the breakdown threshold and thus electroporation occurs the conductivity and permeability of the bacterial membrane increase and electroporated pores are formed on the membrane chang and reese 1990 weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 the breakdown tmp threshold ranges from 250 mv to 1 v depending on the characteristics of the microbes size shape and orientation in the field etc jeyamkondan et al 1999 initial electroporation is reversible microbial cells reseal the pores and heal themselves and thus maintain their activities kotnik et al 2015 as the tmp increases electroporation gradually evolves from reversible to irreversible weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 in this case the electroporated cells cannot reseal and lose their viability causing microbial inactivation kotnik et al 2015 applying eft for pathogen inactivation has multiple advantages as a physical process eft does not require the addition of chemicals nor theoretically generate harmful dbps weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 eft is capable of inactivating a wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms because eft targets microbial lipid bilayer structures gusbeth et al 2009 eft can be a fast treatment process to achieve high pathogen inactivation efficiency if the electric field strength is strong because irreversible electroporation can happen in a few microseconds or less shahini and yeow 2013 in terms of operation eft only relies on electricity and does not need the transportation and storage of chemicals meanwhile eft does not introduce secondary pollution in terms of odor sound or light weaver and chizmadzhev 1996 2 feasibility of eft for water disinfection the pathogen inactivation processes for drinking water and liquid food share the same goal of achieving a high inactivation efficiency against a broad spectrum of pathogens nevertheless drinking water and liquid food have different properties table 1 in a conventional drinking water treatment process the source water to be disinfected usually has a nearly neutral ph 6 8 low conductivity 200 2000 µs cm 1 and low total solid concentration 50 mg l 1 fernández et al 2018 gusbeth et al 2009 mañas et al 2001 seratlić et al 2013 liquid food to be processed can be much more complex for example fruit juice is usually acidic with a ph of 2 5 huang et al 2014 majstorović et al 2017 rezaeimotlagh et al 2018 the viscosity of dairy products can be much higher than that of drinking water table 1 cregenzán alberti et al 2015 jaeger et al 2009 mañas et al 2001 mcauley et al 2016 theoretically eft for water disinfection can achieve efficacy at least similar to that for liquid food processing because pathogens found in water are similar to those in liquid foods and the physicochemical properties of water are also within the range of those for liquid foods in addition drinking water is relatively nutrient deficient compared to liquid food making the pathogens more difficult to survive drinking water also typically has fewer particles and organic molecules that can protect pathogens from inactivation by shading or other mechanisms therefore higher pathogen inactivation efficiency can actually be expected when eft is used in water 3 the major barrier and potential solutions for the implementation of eft for water

16472,illicit drug use is complex hidden and often highly stigmatized behaviour which brings a vast challenge for drug surveillance systems drug consumption can be estimated by measuring human excretion products in untreated wastewater known as wastewater based epidemiology wbe over the last decade the application of wastewater based epidemiology to monitor illicit drug loads increased and wbe is currently applied on a global scale studies from over the globe are evaluated with regard to their sampling method analytical accuracy and consumption calculation aiming to further reduce relevant uncertainties in order to make reliable comparisons on a global level only a limited number is identified as high quality studies so further standardization of the wbe approach for illicit drugs is desired especially with regard to the sampling methodology only a fraction of the reviewed papers explicitly reports uncertainty ranges for their consumption data studies which had the highest reliability are recently published indicating an improvement in reporting wbe data until now wbe has not been used in large parts of africa nor in the middle east and russia an overview of consumption data across the continents on commonly studied drugs cocaine mdma amphetamine and methamphetamine is provided overall high consumption rates are confirmed in the us especially for cocaine and methamphetamine while relatively low illicit drug consumption is reported in asia graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology illicit drugs mdma cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine 1 introduction illicit drug use is complex hidden and often highly stigmatized behaviour which brings a vast challenge for drug surveillance systems the traditional way of monitoring illicit drug use is through population surveys consumer interviews and police seizures these methods yield qualitative data and provide useful information such as age sex behaviour and the mode of use ingestion injection or inhalation however due to several limitations such as self report bias and limited population coverage survey based results have difficulties in reflecting detailed spatial and temporal differences of illicit drug use to get access to quantitative data the human metabolic excretion products resulting from drug consumption can be measured in untreated wastewater the measured parent compound or metabolite can be used to calculate the daily mass loads entering a wastewater treatment plant wwtp for these compounds with the knowledge of human drug metabolism and excretion rates together with in sewer transformation rates the relation to consumption g day can be calculated from these mass loads when dividing this by the served population at the point of measurement in the sewage system the amount of illicit drugs consumed in g day inhabitant can be estimated allowing for comparisons between locations van nuijs et al 2020 while this approach provides no knowledge about the behaviour of single users it is useful for identifying the spectrum of substance use for a population serving a particular wwtp this approach provides near real time information for a specific city or region and gives insight about temporal trends it is also a promising tool to estimate the illicit drug market size together with survey based monitoring wastewater based epidemiology wbe can evaluate drugs abuse more comprehensively and potentially support governments in developing policies to scale down drug abuse lai et al 2016 using wbe to detect illicit drugs was first introduced by daughton et al in 2001 daughton 2001 and first applied by zuccato et al zuccato et al 2005 in 2005 to monitor cocaine use and track trends in local illicit drug use in italy in 2012 the first international assessment in 19 european cities was published by thomas et al thomas et al 2012 a paper discussing the uncertainties within the wbe approach has been published in 2013 by castiglioni et al castiglioni et al 2013 and a global overview of results was presented by feng et al feng et al 2018 covering publications between 2005 and 2017 wbe has shown to be an innovative and promising tool and sophisticated methodologies have been published for measuring a great variety of illicit drugs choi et al 2018 f hernández et al 2019 f hernández et al 2018 despite the fact that wbe provides an evidence based estimation on illicit drug use for a specific population it brings a number of uncertainties related to the sampling methodology the analytical procedure and the consumption calculation castiglioni et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 one of the main challenges in wbe is reducing the uncertainty for each of these variables in order to make respectable comparisons on an international level synchronising wastewater sampling and analysis will allow more accurate data o brien et al 2019 the european network of sewage analysis sewage analysis core group europe score coordinates and ensures quality control in international wbe studies this way research can be done with the same validated methods which makes results robust and comparable data on illicit drugs collected under score supervision is therefore used annually by the european monitoring center for drug and drug addiction emcdda gonzález mariño et al 2020 wastewater is an important source of public health information and can be applied in many fields of expertise like for diet and nutrition pesticide use public health and doping and currently it is used to monitor the sars cov 2 virus bivins et al 2020 the present paper first investigates the potential and reliability of wbe methodologies by critically looking at the literature published in the last decade the key areas that are evaluated to determine the reliability are the sampling methodology the analytical accuracy and the consumption estimation and overall reliability scores are considered then an overview of consumption data on the most commonly studied drugs cocaine mdma amphetamine and methamphetamine is provided evaluating spatial trends european wide studies are frequently published and discussed castrignanò et al 2018 krizman matasic et al 2019 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 but here we provide the first overview on a global scale based on a large number of data from published literature on intercontinental level finally suggestions to further improve future wbe studies are provided 2 methods 2 1 literature search one hundred and ten studies reporting on wastewater based epidemiology of illicit drugs were extracted from the scopus database and reviewed systematically haddaway et al 2017 2015 xiao and watson 2019 used search strings were wastewater based epidemiology or sewage epidemiology and illicit drug or drugs of abuse in studies published between 2010 and 2020 export data were filtered based on relevance reports that did not provide new data concerned only new psychoactive substances nps did not calculate the drug consumption or were not representative for the community were removed s i 1 searches were performed until march 2020 fifty two papers are included and reviewed on the estimated drug consumption and the overall reliability of the methodology 2 2 assessment of method reliability the reliability of the selected papers was assessed based on factors introducing uncertainties as described by ort et al 2010a van nuijs et al 2018 feng et al 2018 castiglioni et al 2013 and fernández de córdova and medina 2014 the studies are reviewed with regard to their sampling uncertainty analytical accuracy and the consumption estimation each of the three main criteria was assessed based on specific sub criteria table 1 for each sub criterion a value of 2 1 or 0 is assigned which indicates the reliability of each aspect with a maximum of 6 for the sampling uncertainty a maximum of 10 for the analytical accuracy and a maximum of 6 for the consumption estimation the overall reliability score per study has a maximum of 22 when no information is reported in the reviewed literature for a specific criterion 0 will always be assigned table 2 lists the cut off per sub criterion which is further explained and justified per sub criterion in the sections below 2 3 comparison of international drug consumption the selected fifty two papers were reviewed on drug consumption median consumptions of cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine and mdma were used to compare consumption on an intercontinental scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability of methods in this study the reliability of literature on wbe and illicit drugs published in the last decade is critically reviewed with regard to the sampling uncertainty analytical accuracy and consumption estimations over all 52 papers that are evaluated the mean score of the studies is 14 3 out of a maximum of 22 ranging from 10 to 18 table 3 according to the criteria used in this study especially with regard to the sampling and its description there are major possibilities for further improvement fig 1 shows the percentages of studies with a positive score per sub criterion further details on assigned points per sub criterion per study can be found in s i 2 3 1 1 sampling uncertainty 3 1 1 1 long and short term variations sampling can be a dominant source of uncertainty for the determination of illicit drugs in wastewater as both short term variations such as diurnal patterns in consumption and human behaviour festivals or rainfall and long term variations such as week weekend and seasonal changes do occur ort et al 2010 2010a extreme weather changes and human behaviour will change the daily flow of wastewater to a wwtp and therefore will cause variability and dilution banta green et al 2016 ort et al 2010 2010a the concentration of the analyte is also highly dependant on the season due to wet and dry weather conditions loraine and pettigrove 2006 however these sporadically extreme weather short term events do not give the same uncertainty as long term seasonal changes which are more constant the concentration of illicit drugs can increase significantly during special events and during the weekends bijlsma et al 2014 foppe et al 2018 this brings variability in human behaviour when it comes to drug consumption and will bias the overall consumption of a certain community a similar bias applies to work commuters and tourists who only take part a community for a certain amount of time therefore these are important factors regarding the uncertainty foppe et al 2018 in general long term variations are commonly reported 68 whereas short term variations are reported in only 39 of the papers this was expected because long term variations are easier to track since these are more constant factors to give a reliable estimate of illicit drug use by the local community preferably measurements should be performed during a normal week 3 1 1 2 mode of sampling the systematic sampling error depends on the sampling mode the use of 24 hour composite sampling is most common in wbe composite sampling has a clear advantage over grab sampling with respect to local heterogeneity minkkinen and esbensen 2009 as influent flow and composition may vary significantly over the timespan of sampling composite sampling can be challenging feng et al 2018 ort et al 2010b composite sampling can be performed by three approaches i e flow proportional volume proportional or time proportional flow proportional composite sampling takes a subsample volume proportional to the flow in the sewer at a constant time interval subsamples are weighted individually to form a composite sample volume proportional sampling takes samples more frequently during higher flows and less frequently during lower flows the sampling volume remains constant however this cannot provide a true average concentration since only the frequency changes and individual samples are not weighted properly according to the flow in the sewer in time proportional sampling both frequency and sampling volume are constant and therefore does not provide a true average concentration as well the flow proportional mode of sampling is regarded as most reliable choice for data on illicit drug consumption and is favoured over time and volume proportional sampling because subsamples are weighted individually ort et al 2010 2010a the majority of reviewed papers use 24 h composite influent samples while several studies used grab samples banta green et al 2016 feng et al 2018 fernández de córdova and medina 2014 ort et al 2010 2010a van nuijs et al 2018 whether the composite samples are volume proportional flow proportional or time proportional is not always reported when a detailed description of the sampling methodology is specified flow proportional is most prevalent in total only 21 of the papers specify the use of flow proportional composite sampling thus lack of description of use of flow proportional composite sampling importantly contributes to sampling uncertainty 3 1 1 3 sample volume low sample volumes reduce the power of a study and will increase error einax 2004 koelmans et al 2019 detection limits benefit from large sample volumes as extracts can reach high concentration factors because of the relatively low concentration of certain excreted illicit drugs in wastewater most common illicit drugs cocaine amphetamines will be present in wastewater with relatively high concentrations but for nps the concentration can be much lower and therefore a larger sample volume is required a total sample volume of 1 l for influent is considered sufficient ort et al 2010 subsamples can be taken for sample preparation and chemical analysis more than half 58 of the studies do not report on sample size or do not meet the requirement of collecting 1 l influent publishing full information regarding detailed sampling methodologies is crucial to interpret the obtained results together with the long and short term variations the sample size was often not reported and therefore a factor in reducing the sampling uncertainty of these methods 3 1 2 analytical accuracy 3 1 2 1 identification technique analytical uncertainty is commonly well specified in wbe studies ort et al 2010a the fact that most illicit drugs are of medium to high polarity makes lc ms ms the most attractive method for their identification and quantification all papers report a sophisticated analytical method analytical technique is described in 100 of the studies and in 98 of the studies the technique of choice is liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms or tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms one exception is analysing methamphetamine using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry as the main analytical tool gc ms ms wang et al 2019 lc ms ms is commonly used to investigate pharmaceuticals and their metabolites because of the robustness and excellent reproducibility van nuijs et al 2011 zheng et al 2019 and therefore also a favoured technique to measure concentrations of illicit drugs triple quadrupole mass analysers are used most and considered the reference technique to quantify illicit drugs and their metabolites hernández et al 2018 this technique is both sensitive and suitable for quantitative analysis and selective for identification and an excellent tool for targeted analysis new methodologies are expected to increase in the coming years e g based on mixed mode liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry koelmans et al 2019 or high resolution mass spectrometers such as orbitrap and time of flight qtof analysers in combination with ultra high performance chromatography uhplc which are more suitable for untargeted suspect screening combined these techniques will enhance the sensitivity of the overall method baz lomba reid and thomas 2016 3 1 2 2 analytical conditions specification of the analytical conditions is crucial to make a reliable estimation of the accuracy the polar ionic analytes require specific chromatographic separation separation modes are usually reversed phase rp chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic in rp a hydrophobic stationary phase is used for retention and a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of organic modifier and a water phase for elution in hilic the analytical column is polar combined with a highly organic mobile phase in which water is introduced as the eluting solvent the most commonly reported detection technique is mass spectrometry ms with electrospray ionisation esi all studies report the analytical methodology used either in the report supplementary data or referring to previous work analytical conditions are reported in more detail compared to the sampling methodologies all studies provided a detailed description of the analytical conditions this can be related to quality control protocols which are well developed krizman matasic et al 2019 and the fact that the analytical conditions are easier to control for researches 3 1 2 3 method validation internal standards replicates positive and negative controls prior to application the analytical methodology needs to be completely validated for all analytes in terms of trueness accuracy evaluated by recovery experiments and precision as repeatability selectivity specificity and limits of detection lod and quantification loq hernández et al 2018 a drawback in this field is the lack of guidelines specifically directed toward the analysis of illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater hernández et al 2018 in esi ion suppression is a major issue due to the co eluting matrix constituents of raw wastewater van nuijs et al 2011 zheng et al 2019 resulting in a decrease in sensitivity and unacceptable errors in quantification matrix effects can be corrected using isotopic labelled internal standards ilis which are commercially available for most common illicit drugs and their metabolites van nuijs et al 2011 zheng et al 2019 during method validation there is an absolute need to thoroughly evaluate if the labelled is accurately corrects for matrix effects hernández et al 2018 indeed 98 of all studies report the use of isotopic labelled internal standards when two or more samples from the same sampling location and time carried through identical analytical steps are investigated the variance of the total method can be assessed to examine the reproducibility of the analytical method including a standard deviation a minimum number of three samples is required only 35 of the reviewed studies reported on analysing in triplicates positive and negative control samples are commonly used in analytical chemistry and described in almost all quality control protocols to verify quantitative recoveries during sample collection and preparation and the analytical measurement procedure representative positive control samples should be analysed to correct an analytical method for contaminations during sample collection preparation and the analytical identification procedure blanks should be analysed 54 of the reviewed studies reported on positive controls whilst the use of blanks was reported for 44 papers the low percentages in these categories might be explained by poor reporting 3 1 2 3 lod loq the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq indicate the capability to reliably and sensitively detect and or quantify an analyse reckoning of lods and loqs is usually performed based on a signal to noise s n ratio of 1 3 and 1 10 respectively hernández et al 2018 estimating lods and loqs in wastewater is difficult regarding the notable variations in chemical composition hernández et al 2018 for a reliable analysis the analyte should be at least 10 times the lod or loq for a sufficient sensitivity in recent years the low lod and loqs reported are mostly due to modern highly sensitive techniques that are as mentioned in previous paragraphs used in all reviewed studies 81 of the studies reviewed report lod and loq values that are sufficient to analyse illicit drugs and their metabolites 3 1 3 consumption estimation the relation between known amounts consumed by the population and the consumption as estimated from concentrations of drug residues and metabolites measured in wastewater is well described for a number of pharmaceuticals heberer and feldmann 2005 lindberg et al 2007 zuccato et al 2008 the reliability of the consumption estimate can be evaluated when the original measured concentrations of the drug and or metabolite in the influent are reported comparing data amongst studies using different calculation methods based on other approaches or equations is then feasible for 58 of the reviewed papers the measured influent concentrations are reported other important aspects to reliably estimate consumption are the stability of the molecules in wastewater the measurement of parent compounds and or metabolites the population estimated being served by a wwtp and the exact equation used for the calculation of consumption 3 1 3 1 consumption calculation metabolites the reliability of calculation of drug use depends on the selection of an appropriate drug target residue dtr which can be either the illicit drug itself or one of its metabolites due to the stability of the drugs in wastewater and human metabolism excretion it can be necessary to base consumption estimates upon metabolites for example the parent compound of cocaine is excreted in urine only for 1 9 of the original intake while benzoylecgonine and ecgoninemethylester are excreted in urine for 35 54 and 32 49 of the parent compound intake van nuijs et al 2011 the first formulas for the back calculation of 1 cocaine and 2 amphetamine like stimulants were proposed by zuccato et al in 2008 based on the main excretion products this could be summarized per dtr specifically as followed c o n s u m p t i o n m g d a y p e r 1000 i n h l o a d o f d t r m g d a y p e r 1000 i n h 1 s t a b i l i t y o f d t r 1 e x c r e t i o n o f d t r m w d r u g m w d t r where the excretion rate of the dtr is following the use of an illicit drug of interest stability of dtr is the ratio of dtr concentration after in sewer losses due to transformation and adsorption to biofilm sewer sediment and suspended solids to initial concentration biofilm and sewer sediment grow on sewer walls and can potentially change biomarkers due to chemical and microbial processes this adds to the uncertainty of the back estimation li et al 2020 mw drug is the molecular weight of the drug of interest and mw dtr is the molecular weight of the dtr however accurate excretion rates of dtrs are not always available due to the lack of pharmacokinetic data feng et al 2018 gracia lor et al 2016 or are not determined for the applied administration route snoring ingestion or intravenous injection or dose the equation used for the consumption estimation is in 16 of the reviewed studies not explained at all from concentrations of the metabolite ng l the flow rate l day of the wastewater stream and a correction factor parent compound loads g day can be calculated the correction factor is established based on the excretion rates and degradation in waste water for the parent drug and its metabolite van nuijs et al 2011 zuccato et al 2008 2005 amphetamine methamphetamine and mdma are excreted unchanged in urine up to 30 43 and 65 respectively mccall et al 2016 van nuijs et al 2011 postigo et al 2010 zuccato et al 2008 for cocaine only 1 9 is excreted in urine unchanged gracia lor et al 2016 been et al been et al 2016 reported the estimated errors using monte carlo simulations resulting in excretion rates of 30 58 for benzoylecgonine main metabolite of cocaine 15 78 for mdma 29 12 for amphetamine and 28 56 for methamphetamine 3 1 3 2 stability an important factor to estimate consumption is the stability of the excretion products in the sewer system daughton 2001 zuccato et al 2008 zheng et al 2019 ignoring losses due to sorption degradation of illicit drugs or the excreted metabolite in the sewer and presumably microbial degradation of cocaine which results in the formation of be may lead to a significant underestimation a k mccall et al 2016 thai et al 2014 zheng et al 2019 methamphetamine and mdma have a relatively high stability a mccall et al 2016 cocaine is unstable in wastewater the degradation of cocaine could lead to benzoylecgonine so by using benzoylecgonine as a dtr cocaine consumption could be overestimated however only 37 of the reviewed studies discuss sewer stability of the dtr and incorporated this in the consumption calculation 3 1 3 3 population estimation an estimation of the population being served by a wwtp is a critical factor in the back calculation of drug consumption feng et al 2018 drug loads have to be normalized to the population in order to enable comparison of the data between different wwtps an accurate population estimate is challenging because the actual number of persons being served by a particulate wwtp might vary in time due to commuting seasonal variability holidays and or special events feng et al 2018 lai et al 2013 the determination of biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater or the measurement of a stable indicator of human metabolism have been proposed for the estimation of population served by the wwtp van nuijs et al 2011 castiglioni et al 2013 many of these parameters reflect human activities rather than the population size feng et al 2018 other sources such as industrial and commercial discharges may cause significant variability feng et al 2018 some studies based consumption as measured at a wwtp on the total population of the country which is only applicable for countries with a small population like the maldives fallati et al 2020 in total fifteen papers reported a rational estimation of the population based on the amount of people serving a specific wwtp baker et al 2012 been et al 2015 bijlsma et al 2016 causanilles et al 2017 croft et al 2020 devault et al 2014a klupczynska et al 2016 krizman et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 mercan et al 2019 reid and thomas 2014 rodríguez álvarez et al 2015 shao et al 2020 x x zhang et al 2019 y y zhang et al 2019 3 1 4 critical perspective on the scoring system the systematic scoring system approach described in this paper gives a general overview of the three main sources of uncertainty in wbe and how the literature from the last decade was dealing with these uncertainties however even though the criteria should be as independent as possible some criteria might cross affect each other the scoring system does not correct for this issue an example is that the sampling procedure accurate measurement of the flow rate affects the back calculation and the mode of sampling affects the sample volume uncertainty another issue that is not recognized by the scoring system is the co consumption of drugs in an area this can affect universal correction factors based on urinary extraction for extreme weather events are less likely to occur in certain areas this might explain why some papers lack information on the weather during sampling another potential cause of uncertainty is leakage or overflowing of the sewers since this could lead to underreporting the scoring system did not take this into account another limitation of the score system is that no distinguishing is made between analyte ilis and non analyte ilis which is of great relevance for matrix effects correction and accurate quantification some papers intentionally only show temporal trends and thus are not as dependant on the uncertainties as other reports the scoring system does not correct for this and these papers will most likely score lower due to underreporting even though these uncertainties are not as applicable 3 1 5 overall reliability of methods for each of the reviewed studies quality criteria and the overall reliability is assessed table 3 none of the reviewed papers met the maximum achievable score of 22 one study had the highest score of 18 foppe et al 2018 and two studies had the second best score of 17 mastroianni et al 2017 skees et al 2018 these studies were published in 2017 or later indicating an improvement in the reporting on wbe approaches the average scores are 2 6 6 for the sampling method 7 9 10 for the analytical accuracy and 3 8 6 for the consumption estimation and 14 3 22 overall thus sampling uncertainty scored the poorest in agreement with conclusions stated by ort et al ort et al 2010a there is inherent sampling variability due to weather variation sporadic events and fluctuating flowrates still most studies fail to report sufficient details with respect to the sampling method sampling should be based on current knowledge and not just be based on the available equipment ort et al 2010 the analytical accuracy gave the best score the analytical method can be controlled by researchers whereas sample collection usually involves voluntary cooperation of treatment plant staff for this reason it was expected that this type of uncertainty would be reported in more detail and result in the best score 3 2 international drug consumption in the last decade the application of wastewater based epidemiology to monitor illicit drug loads quickly increased and the approach is currently applied on a global scale data on consumption of illicit drugs and their metabolites is reported for each continent except antarctica the variability of illicit drug consumption across the globe gives insight in substance abuse and can potentially assist health and law enforcement agencies to register and cut down drug related incidents and substance abuse lai et al 2016 an overview of drug consumption per country from literature published over the last decade is shown in table 4 for the four substances that are investigated most often these studies evaluated illicit drug use patterns in urban and rural areas and investigated weekly patterns as well as use on specific events the highest number of wbe studies was conducted in europe from where we evaluated twenty eight selected studies reporting in eighteen different countries table 4 studies on a growing number of participating cities are now organized on yearly basis by score and reported to the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction emcdda therefore also general time trends on illicit drug use in europe are well reported based on a certain period of sampling each year nowadays around 70 cities are included in this project emcdda 2020 for these europe wide studies by the emcdda the protocol to monitor drug loads is fixed and common quality control is used in all locations which makes true comparison possible overall reliability scores for european wide studies are amongst the highest table 3 the consumption of cocaine is most abundant in western european cities but a new increase in eastern european cities is also reported by the emcdda emcdda 2020 for amphetamine highest levels are detected in north and eastern europe and lower in southern europe methamphetamine consumption is relatively low in europe overall with the exception of slovakia since 2019 an increase has been reported by the emcdda in eastern germany spain and cyprus emcdda 2020 consumption of mdma is the highest in the netherlands belgium and germany but consumption peaks are also observed in england and scandinavia gonzález mariño et al 2020 table 4 the majority of the studies in europe show an increase of drug use during weekends compared to weekdays with an exception for methamphetamine emcdda 2020 these trends were also observed and reported by gonzález mariño et al gonzález mariño et al 2020 within the usa illicit drug use is a major concern foppe et al 2018 the first study using the wastewater based epidemiology approach in the usa was in 2009 banta green et al 2009 more recent studies in the usa croft et al 2020 foppe et al 2018 skees et al 2018 subedi and kannan 2014 and canada palardy et al 2015 followed since then here we evaluated five selected studies reporting on five different states table 4 a high cocaine consumption was measured in new york as well as for use of amphetamine and methamphetamine in urban and rural areas in the midwestern united states croft et al 2020 a high methamphetamine concentration can affect the amphetamine concentration due to biotransformation the data was corrected for this issue mdma loads were low for urban areas and not detected in rural areas of the midwestern states but higher in the state of new york in tennessee reported consumption data of methamphetamine and amphetamine are higher than data from new york state and kentucky whereas the cocaine consumption was lower skees et al 2018 illicit drug use in the midwestern united states is measured during week with special events showing significantly increased consumption during a festive week foppe et al 2018 compared to western countries wbe is not as often applied in south america we evaluated six selected studies reporting on two different illicit drugs in four different countries table 4 wbe in south america has been applied in brazil mariño et al 2019 f f sodré et al 2018 f sodré et al 2017 colombia bijlsma et al 2016 costa rica causanilles et al 2017 and the island of martinique devault et al 2014b to estimate the overall cocaine consumption for specific areas overall cocaine consumption in south and central america is reported to be relatively high compared to europe globe possibly related to the proximity to the production and the relatively high purity of street cocaine bijlsma et al 2016 during the last decade the wbe approach became a more popular indicator for drug consumption in asia we evaluated thirteen selected studies reporting on five different countries table 4 studies from china khan et al 2014 jing li et al 2014 shao et al 2020 south korea kim and oh 2020 yong et al 2015 vietnam nguyen et al 2018 the maldives fallati et al 2020 and malaysia du et al 2020 have been published in the last decade four megacities in china beijing guangzhou shenzhen and shanghai show significantly lower drug consumption data compared to other continents khan et al 2014 where cocaine is a popular recreational drug in north and south america and europe it is consumed much less in china however consumption of methamphetamine in china is relatively high methamphetamine use is concentrated in the centre of urban areas indicating a relation with the availability to entertainment activities even higher methamphetamine rates are reported in ho chi min vietnam and kuala lumpur malaysia table 4 lower drug consumption is reported in south korea during new year s day and christmas day the methamphetamine no noticeable changes in consumption were observed consumption of mdma and amphetamine is relatively low in china and south korea but mdma consumption for the maldives and malaysia is reported to be comparable to the high levels observed in northern europe i e the netherlands belgium the maldives and malaysia are popular holiday destinations which might explain why synthetic drugs are more popular in these places compared to the rest of asia du et al 2020 supported by the fact that drug consumption increases during the holiday season with regards to australia we evaluated four selected studies in three different states table 4 the first study that used wbe as a tool to estimate illicit drug use in australia was in 2011 irvine et al 2011 similar trends are observed as in asia the cocaine consumption is lower than consumption of methamphetamine while consumption of mdma is closer to european consumption data mdma and methamphetamine are more popular in rural areas whereas cocaine is more frequently used in urban areas noticeable is an increase in drug consumption during weekends for popular drugs such as cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine and mdma daily illicit drug consumption on an annual music festival in australia also shows an increase in mdma compared to the data from a normal week lai et al 2013 a large investigation is described on illicit use of cocaine methamphetamine and mdma lai et al 2016 identifying an overall increase in illicit drug consumption in both metropolitan and rural communities over a six year period in australia as in western europe synthetic drugs are more popular levels similar to those in australia of methamphetamine and cocaine consumption are found in new zealand kumar et al 2019 although mdma consumption is relatively low the application of wbe to monitor illicit drug use is still largely lacking in africa so far only two wwtps located in johannesburg and cape town south africa have been monitored to estimate drug use patterns archer et al 2018 methamphetamine is the primary substance detected at consumption data comparable to usa and australia clandestine manufacturing of illicit methamphetamine results in dumping events of chemical waste which could be traced via spikes including the precursors used in the production process observed at the wwtp in johannesburg archer et al 2018 cocaine consumption is found to be similar to european consumption data while consumption data for mdma are low compared to australia the usa and europe fig 2 illustrates the global consumption distribution for mdma purple methamphetamine blue cocaine red and amphetamine orange so far wbe has not been used to determine illicit drug consumption in most of the african continent the middle east and russia overall high consumption rates are found in the usa especially for cocaine and methamphetamine fig 3 for asia except for methamphetamine lowest consumption is reported cocaine production expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product gdp is the highest for colombia 2 to 3 incb 2002 while for the usa profits from drugs traffic are estimated to be 0 5 of gdp incb 2002 within europe the cocaine market is the second largest illicit drugs market with an estimated retail value of 9 1 billion euros in 2017 emcdda and europol 2019 the total value for the retail market for illicit drugs in europe was estimated at 30 billion euros in 2017 emcdda and europol 2019 the consumption of synthetic drugs such as amphetamine and mdma in europe increased in the last decade especially for the northern and eastern regions of europe similar trends are observed in europe s synthetic drug market which has rapidly grown in the past ten years emcdda and europol 2019 large scale production of mdma and amphetamine remains concentrated in the netherlands and belgium while production of methamphetamine is mainly concentrated in central europe emcdda and europol 2019 in asia drug consumption is relatively low compared to other continents according to a report by the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc in asian regions illicit drug production in asia is increasing for amphetamine like substances liu et al 2013 unodc 2008 this is proportional to the increase in methamphetamine consumption in china and south korea the reported results should be viewed with an assured degree of uncertainty consumption values are frequently reported without calculated uncertainty values ort et al 2010a only a handful of the reviewed papers causanilles et al 2017 deng et al 2020 devault et al 2018 du et al 2020 kumar et al 2019 shao et al 2020 skees et al 2018 f f sodré et al 2018 explicitly reported on uncertainty values for their consumption data xy the complete uncertainty assessment would include the sampling uncertainty analytical uncertainty and the uncertainty for the consumption estimation as mentioned in the previous chapter the trueness of the final consumption data should undergo a suitable statistical propagation various studies have used monte carlo analysis been et al 2015 croft et al 2020 jones et al 2014 shao et al 2020 y y zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 to calculate the uncertainties fig 3 shows the distribution of all reviewed papers per drug for each continent including the reliability of the method used to obtain the data points for many drug continent combinations the majority of the data fall within one order of magnitude 4 conclusion based on the relatively limited number of studies that could be identified as high quality further advancement of the wbe approach for illicit drugs is desired especially with regards to the sampling methodology however studies carried out in europe within the score research group have been using a systematic analytical approach including annual interlaboratory exercises as an important factor in making data more comparable notable is that over the years the analytical methodology is rapidly improving and the implementation of high resolution mass spectrometry techniques will allow more efficient methodologies for wide scope screening identification of untargeted suspect compounds or for the detection of metabolites and transformation products due to more advanced analytical approaches in the last decades detection limits are decreasing and became less challenging when measuring low concentrations publishing full information regarding detailed sampling and analytical methodologies even if only in the supplementary data is crucial for the interpretation of obtained results it will be necessary to harmonize the criteria for reliable identification confirmation and accurate quantification of compounds detected in samples reliable sampling and less uncertainty in population estimation this way data collected from different laboratories in different parts of the world would become more comparable to each other and valid conclusions can be drawn on illicit drug consumption in different communities on a global level this study provides an overview of the available literature reporting data on drug consumption using the wastewater based epidemiology approach overall high consumption rates are found in the usa especially for cocaine and methamphetamine consumption while lowest illicit drug consumption is reported in asia these results agree with data reported by the emcdda europe and the unodc other continents the wbe approach can identify trends in consumption quickly

16472,illicit drug use is complex hidden and often highly stigmatized behaviour which brings a vast challenge for drug surveillance systems drug consumption can be estimated by measuring human excretion products in untreated wastewater known as wastewater based epidemiology wbe over the last decade the application of wastewater based epidemiology to monitor illicit drug loads increased and wbe is currently applied on a global scale studies from over the globe are evaluated with regard to their sampling method analytical accuracy and consumption calculation aiming to further reduce relevant uncertainties in order to make reliable comparisons on a global level only a limited number is identified as high quality studies so further standardization of the wbe approach for illicit drugs is desired especially with regard to the sampling methodology only a fraction of the reviewed papers explicitly reports uncertainty ranges for their consumption data studies which had the highest reliability are recently published indicating an improvement in reporting wbe data until now wbe has not been used in large parts of africa nor in the middle east and russia an overview of consumption data across the continents on commonly studied drugs cocaine mdma amphetamine and methamphetamine is provided overall high consumption rates are confirmed in the us especially for cocaine and methamphetamine while relatively low illicit drug consumption is reported in asia graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology illicit drugs mdma cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine 1 introduction illicit drug use is complex hidden and often highly stigmatized behaviour which brings a vast challenge for drug surveillance systems the traditional way of monitoring illicit drug use is through population surveys consumer interviews and police seizures these methods yield qualitative data and provide useful information such as age sex behaviour and the mode of use ingestion injection or inhalation however due to several limitations such as self report bias and limited population coverage survey based results have difficulties in reflecting detailed spatial and temporal differences of illicit drug use to get access to quantitative data the human metabolic excretion products resulting from drug consumption can be measured in untreated wastewater the measured parent compound or metabolite can be used to calculate the daily mass loads entering a wastewater treatment plant wwtp for these compounds with the knowledge of human drug metabolism and excretion rates together with in sewer transformation rates the relation to consumption g day can be calculated from these mass loads when dividing this by the served population at the point of measurement in the sewage system the amount of illicit drugs consumed in g day inhabitant can be estimated allowing for comparisons between locations van nuijs et al 2020 while this approach provides no knowledge about the behaviour of single users it is useful for identifying the spectrum of substance use for a population serving a particular wwtp this approach provides near real time information for a specific city or region and gives insight about temporal trends it is also a promising tool to estimate the illicit drug market size together with survey based monitoring wastewater based epidemiology wbe can evaluate drugs abuse more comprehensively and potentially support governments in developing policies to scale down drug abuse lai et al 2016 using wbe to detect illicit drugs was first introduced by daughton et al in 2001 daughton 2001 and first applied by zuccato et al zuccato et al 2005 in 2005 to monitor cocaine use and track trends in local illicit drug use in italy in 2012 the first international assessment in 19 european cities was published by thomas et al thomas et al 2012 a paper discussing the uncertainties within the wbe approach has been published in 2013 by castiglioni et al castiglioni et al 2013 and a global overview of results was presented by feng et al feng et al 2018 covering publications between 2005 and 2017 wbe has shown to be an innovative and promising tool and sophisticated methodologies have been published for measuring a great variety of illicit drugs choi et al 2018 f hernández et al 2019 f hernández et al 2018 despite the fact that wbe provides an evidence based estimation on illicit drug use for a specific population it brings a number of uncertainties related to the sampling methodology the analytical procedure and the consumption calculation castiglioni et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 one of the main challenges in wbe is reducing the uncertainty for each of these variables in order to make respectable comparisons on an international level synchronising wastewater sampling and analysis will allow more accurate data o brien et al 2019 the european network of sewage analysis sewage analysis core group europe score coordinates and ensures quality control in international wbe studies this way research can be done with the same validated methods which makes results robust and comparable data on illicit drugs collected under score supervision is therefore used annually by the european monitoring center for drug and drug addiction emcdda gonzález mariño et al 2020 wastewater is an important source of public health information and can be applied in many fields of expertise like for diet and nutrition pesticide use public health and doping and currently it is used to monitor the sars cov 2 virus bivins et al 2020 the present paper first investigates the potential and reliability of wbe methodologies by critically looking at the literature published in the last decade the key areas that are evaluated to determine the reliability are the sampling methodology the analytical accuracy and the consumption estimation and overall reliability scores are considered then an overview of consumption data on the most commonly studied drugs cocaine mdma amphetamine and methamphetamine is provided evaluating spatial trends european wide studies are frequently published and discussed castrignanò et al 2018 krizman matasic et al 2019 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 but here we provide the first overview on a global scale based on a large number of data from published literature on intercontinental level finally suggestions to further improve future wbe studies are provided 2 methods 2 1 literature search one hundred and ten studies reporting on wastewater based epidemiology of illicit drugs were extracted from the scopus database and reviewed systematically haddaway et al 2017 2015 xiao and watson 2019 used search strings were wastewater based epidemiology or sewage epidemiology and illicit drug or drugs of abuse in studies published between 2010 and 2020 export data were filtered based on relevance reports that did not provide new data concerned only new psychoactive substances nps did not calculate the drug consumption or were not representative for the community were removed s i 1 searches were performed until march 2020 fifty two papers are included and reviewed on the estimated drug consumption and the overall reliability of the methodology 2 2 assessment of method reliability the reliability of the selected papers was assessed based on factors introducing uncertainties as described by ort et al 2010a van nuijs et al 2018 feng et al 2018 castiglioni et al 2013 and fernández de córdova and medina 2014 the studies are reviewed with regard to their sampling uncertainty analytical accuracy and the consumption estimation each of the three main criteria was assessed based on specific sub criteria table 1 for each sub criterion a value of 2 1 or 0 is assigned which indicates the reliability of each aspect with a maximum of 6 for the sampling uncertainty a maximum of 10 for the analytical accuracy and a maximum of 6 for the consumption estimation the overall reliability score per study has a maximum of 22 when no information is reported in the reviewed literature for a specific criterion 0 will always be assigned table 2 lists the cut off per sub criterion which is further explained and justified per sub criterion in the sections below 2 3 comparison of international drug consumption the selected fifty two papers were reviewed on drug consumption median consumptions of cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine and mdma were used to compare consumption on an intercontinental scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability of methods in this study the reliability of literature on wbe and illicit drugs published in the last decade is critically reviewed with regard to the sampling uncertainty analytical accuracy and consumption estimations over all 52 papers that are evaluated the mean score of the studies is 14 3 out of a maximum of 22 ranging from 10 to 18 table 3 according to the criteria used in this study especially with regard to the sampling and its description there are major possibilities for further improvement fig 1 shows the percentages of studies with a positive score per sub criterion further details on assigned points per sub criterion per study can be found in s i 2 3 1 1 sampling uncertainty 3 1 1 1 long and short term variations sampling can be a dominant source of uncertainty for the determination of illicit drugs in wastewater as both short term variations such as diurnal patterns in consumption and human behaviour festivals or rainfall and long term variations such as week weekend and seasonal changes do occur ort et al 2010 2010a extreme weather changes and human behaviour will change the daily flow of wastewater to a wwtp and therefore will cause variability and dilution banta green et al 2016 ort et al 2010 2010a the concentration of the analyte is also highly dependant on the season due to wet and dry weather conditions loraine and pettigrove 2006 however these sporadically extreme weather short term events do not give the same uncertainty as long term seasonal changes which are more constant the concentration of illicit drugs can increase significantly during special events and during the weekends bijlsma et al 2014 foppe et al 2018 this brings variability in human behaviour when it comes to drug consumption and will bias the overall consumption of a certain community a similar bias applies to work commuters and tourists who only take part a community for a certain amount of time therefore these are important factors regarding the uncertainty foppe et al 2018 in general long term variations are commonly reported 68 whereas short term variations are reported in only 39 of the papers this was expected because long term variations are easier to track since these are more constant factors to give a reliable estimate of illicit drug use by the local community preferably measurements should be performed during a normal week 3 1 1 2 mode of sampling the systematic sampling error depends on the sampling mode the use of 24 hour composite sampling is most common in wbe composite sampling has a clear advantage over grab sampling with respect to local heterogeneity minkkinen and esbensen 2009 as influent flow and composition may vary significantly over the timespan of sampling composite sampling can be challenging feng et al 2018 ort et al 2010b composite sampling can be performed by three approaches i e flow proportional volume proportional or time proportional flow proportional composite sampling takes a subsample volume proportional to the flow in the sewer at a constant time interval subsamples are weighted individually to form a composite sample volume proportional sampling takes samples more frequently during higher flows and less frequently during lower flows the sampling volume remains constant however this cannot provide a true average concentration since only the frequency changes and individual samples are not weighted properly according to the flow in the sewer in time proportional sampling both frequency and sampling volume are constant and therefore does not provide a true average concentration as well the flow proportional mode of sampling is regarded as most reliable choice for data on illicit drug consumption and is favoured over time and volume proportional sampling because subsamples are weighted individually ort et al 2010 2010a the majority of reviewed papers use 24 h composite influent samples while several studies used grab samples banta green et al 2016 feng et al 2018 fernández de córdova and medina 2014 ort et al 2010 2010a van nuijs et al 2018 whether the composite samples are volume proportional flow proportional or time proportional is not always reported when a detailed description of the sampling methodology is specified flow proportional is most prevalent in total only 21 of the papers specify the use of flow proportional composite sampling thus lack of description of use of flow proportional composite sampling importantly contributes to sampling uncertainty 3 1 1 3 sample volume low sample volumes reduce the power of a study and will increase error einax 2004 koelmans et al 2019 detection limits benefit from large sample volumes as extracts can reach high concentration factors because of the relatively low concentration of certain excreted illicit drugs in wastewater most common illicit drugs cocaine amphetamines will be present in wastewater with relatively high concentrations but for nps the concentration can be much lower and therefore a larger sample volume is required a total sample volume of 1 l for influent is considered sufficient ort et al 2010 subsamples can be taken for sample preparation and chemical analysis more than half 58 of the studies do not report on sample size or do not meet the requirement of collecting 1 l influent publishing full information regarding detailed sampling methodologies is crucial to interpret the obtained results together with the long and short term variations the sample size was often not reported and therefore a factor in reducing the sampling uncertainty of these methods 3 1 2 analytical accuracy 3 1 2 1 identification technique analytical uncertainty is commonly well specified in wbe studies ort et al 2010a the fact that most illicit drugs are of medium to high polarity makes lc ms ms the most attractive method for their identification and quantification all papers report a sophisticated analytical method analytical technique is described in 100 of the studies and in 98 of the studies the technique of choice is liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms or tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms one exception is analysing methamphetamine using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry as the main analytical tool gc ms ms wang et al 2019 lc ms ms is commonly used to investigate pharmaceuticals and their metabolites because of the robustness and excellent reproducibility van nuijs et al 2011 zheng et al 2019 and therefore also a favoured technique to measure concentrations of illicit drugs triple quadrupole mass analysers are used most and considered the reference technique to quantify illicit drugs and their metabolites hernández et al 2018 this technique is both sensitive and suitable for quantitative analysis and selective for identification and an excellent tool for targeted analysis new methodologies are expected to increase in the coming years e g based on mixed mode liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry koelmans et al 2019 or high resolution mass spectrometers such as orbitrap and time of flight qtof analysers in combination with ultra high performance chromatography uhplc which are more suitable for untargeted suspect screening combined these techniques will enhance the sensitivity of the overall method baz lomba reid and thomas 2016 3 1 2 2 analytical conditions specification of the analytical conditions is crucial to make a reliable estimation of the accuracy the polar ionic analytes require specific chromatographic separation separation modes are usually reversed phase rp chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic in rp a hydrophobic stationary phase is used for retention and a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of organic modifier and a water phase for elution in hilic the analytical column is polar combined with a highly organic mobile phase in which water is introduced as the eluting solvent the most commonly reported detection technique is mass spectrometry ms with electrospray ionisation esi all studies report the analytical methodology used either in the report supplementary data or referring to previous work analytical conditions are reported in more detail compared to the sampling methodologies all studies provided a detailed description of the analytical conditions this can be related to quality control protocols which are well developed krizman matasic et al 2019 and the fact that the analytical conditions are easier to control for researches 3 1 2 3 method validation internal standards replicates positive and negative controls prior to application the analytical methodology needs to be completely validated for all analytes in terms of trueness accuracy evaluated by recovery experiments and precision as repeatability selectivity specificity and limits of detection lod and quantification loq hernández et al 2018 a drawback in this field is the lack of guidelines specifically directed toward the analysis of illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater hernández et al 2018 in esi ion suppression is a major issue due to the co eluting matrix constituents of raw wastewater van nuijs et al 2011 zheng et al 2019 resulting in a decrease in sensitivity and unacceptable errors in quantification matrix effects can be corrected using isotopic labelled internal standards ilis which are commercially available for most common illicit drugs and their metabolites van nuijs et al 2011 zheng et al 2019 during method validation there is an absolute need to thoroughly evaluate if the labelled is accurately corrects for matrix effects hernández et al 2018 indeed 98 of all studies report the use of isotopic labelled internal standards when two or more samples from the same sampling location and time carried through identical analytical steps are investigated the variance of the total method can be assessed to examine the reproducibility of the analytical method including a standard deviation a minimum number of three samples is required only 35 of the reviewed studies reported on analysing in triplicates positive and negative control samples are commonly used in analytical chemistry and described in almost all quality control protocols to verify quantitative recoveries during sample collection and preparation and the analytical measurement procedure representative positive control samples should be analysed to correct an analytical method for contaminations during sample collection preparation and the analytical identification procedure blanks should be analysed 54 of the reviewed studies reported on positive controls whilst the use of blanks was reported for 44 papers the low percentages in these categories might be explained by poor reporting 3 1 2 3 lod loq the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq indicate the capability to reliably and sensitively detect and or quantify an analyse reckoning of lods and loqs is usually performed based on a signal to noise s n ratio of 1 3 and 1 10 respectively hernández et al 2018 estimating lods and loqs in wastewater is difficult regarding the notable variations in chemical composition hernández et al 2018 for a reliable analysis the analyte should be at least 10 times the lod or loq for a sufficient sensitivity in recent years the low lod and loqs reported are mostly due to modern highly sensitive techniques that are as mentioned in previous paragraphs used in all reviewed studies 81 of the studies reviewed report lod and loq values that are sufficient to analyse illicit drugs and their metabolites 3 1 3 consumption estimation the relation between known amounts consumed by the population and the consumption as estimated from concentrations of drug residues and metabolites measured in wastewater is well described for a number of pharmaceuticals heberer and feldmann 2005 lindberg et al 2007 zuccato et al 2008 the reliability of the consumption estimate can be evaluated when the original measured concentrations of the drug and or metabolite in the influent are reported comparing data amongst studies using different calculation methods based on other approaches or equations is then feasible for 58 of the reviewed papers the measured influent concentrations are reported other important aspects to reliably estimate consumption are the stability of the molecules in wastewater the measurement of parent compounds and or metabolites the population estimated being served by a wwtp and the exact equation used for the calculation of consumption 3 1 3 1 consumption calculation metabolites the reliability of calculation of drug use depends on the selection of an appropriate drug target residue dtr which can be either the illicit drug itself or one of its metabolites due to the stability of the drugs in wastewater and human metabolism excretion it can be necessary to base consumption estimates upon metabolites for example the parent compound of cocaine is excreted in urine only for 1 9 of the original intake while benzoylecgonine and ecgoninemethylester are excreted in urine for 35 54 and 32 49 of the parent compound intake van nuijs et al 2011 the first formulas for the back calculation of 1 cocaine and 2 amphetamine like stimulants were proposed by zuccato et al in 2008 based on the main excretion products this could be summarized per dtr specifically as followed c o n s u m p t i o n m g d a y p e r 1000 i n h l o a d o f d t r m g d a y p e r 1000 i n h 1 s t a b i l i t y o f d t r 1 e x c r e t i o n o f d t r m w d r u g m w d t r where the excretion rate of the dtr is following the use of an illicit drug of interest stability of dtr is the ratio of dtr concentration after in sewer losses due to transformation and adsorption to biofilm sewer sediment and suspended solids to initial concentration biofilm and sewer sediment grow on sewer walls and can potentially change biomarkers due to chemical and microbial processes this adds to the uncertainty of the back estimation li et al 2020 mw drug is the molecular weight of the drug of interest and mw dtr is the molecular weight of the dtr however accurate excretion rates of dtrs are not always available due to the lack of pharmacokinetic data feng et al 2018 gracia lor et al 2016 or are not determined for the applied administration route snoring ingestion or intravenous injection or dose the equation used for the consumption estimation is in 16 of the reviewed studies not explained at all from concentrations of the metabolite ng l the flow rate l day of the wastewater stream and a correction factor parent compound loads g day can be calculated the correction factor is established based on the excretion rates and degradation in waste water for the parent drug and its metabolite van nuijs et al 2011 zuccato et al 2008 2005 amphetamine methamphetamine and mdma are excreted unchanged in urine up to 30 43 and 65 respectively mccall et al 2016 van nuijs et al 2011 postigo et al 2010 zuccato et al 2008 for cocaine only 1 9 is excreted in urine unchanged gracia lor et al 2016 been et al been et al 2016 reported the estimated errors using monte carlo simulations resulting in excretion rates of 30 58 for benzoylecgonine main metabolite of cocaine 15 78 for mdma 29 12 for amphetamine and 28 56 for methamphetamine 3 1 3 2 stability an important factor to estimate consumption is the stability of the excretion products in the sewer system daughton 2001 zuccato et al 2008 zheng et al 2019 ignoring losses due to sorption degradation of illicit drugs or the excreted metabolite in the sewer and presumably microbial degradation of cocaine which results in the formation of be may lead to a significant underestimation a k mccall et al 2016 thai et al 2014 zheng et al 2019 methamphetamine and mdma have a relatively high stability a mccall et al 2016 cocaine is unstable in wastewater the degradation of cocaine could lead to benzoylecgonine so by using benzoylecgonine as a dtr cocaine consumption could be overestimated however only 37 of the reviewed studies discuss sewer stability of the dtr and incorporated this in the consumption calculation 3 1 3 3 population estimation an estimation of the population being served by a wwtp is a critical factor in the back calculation of drug consumption feng et al 2018 drug loads have to be normalized to the population in order to enable comparison of the data between different wwtps an accurate population estimate is challenging because the actual number of persons being served by a particulate wwtp might vary in time due to commuting seasonal variability holidays and or special events feng et al 2018 lai et al 2013 the determination of biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater or the measurement of a stable indicator of human metabolism have been proposed for the estimation of population served by the wwtp van nuijs et al 2011 castiglioni et al 2013 many of these parameters reflect human activities rather than the population size feng et al 2018 other sources such as industrial and commercial discharges may cause significant variability feng et al 2018 some studies based consumption as measured at a wwtp on the total population of the country which is only applicable for countries with a small population like the maldives fallati et al 2020 in total fifteen papers reported a rational estimation of the population based on the amount of people serving a specific wwtp baker et al 2012 been et al 2015 bijlsma et al 2016 causanilles et al 2017 croft et al 2020 devault et al 2014a klupczynska et al 2016 krizman et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 mercan et al 2019 reid and thomas 2014 rodríguez álvarez et al 2015 shao et al 2020 x x zhang et al 2019 y y zhang et al 2019 3 1 4 critical perspective on the scoring system the systematic scoring system approach described in this paper gives a general overview of the three main sources of uncertainty in wbe and how the literature from the last decade was dealing with these uncertainties however even though the criteria should be as independent as possible some criteria might cross affect each other the scoring system does not correct for this issue an example is that the sampling procedure accurate measurement of the flow rate affects the back calculation and the mode of sampling affects the sample volume uncertainty another issue that is not recognized by the scoring system is the co consumption of drugs in an area this can affect universal correction factors based on urinary extraction for extreme weather events are less likely to occur in certain areas this might explain why some papers lack information on the weather during sampling another potential cause of uncertainty is leakage or overflowing of the sewers since this could lead to underreporting the scoring system did not take this into account another limitation of the score system is that no distinguishing is made between analyte ilis and non analyte ilis which is of great relevance for matrix effects correction and accurate quantification some papers intentionally only show temporal trends and thus are not as dependant on the uncertainties as other reports the scoring system does not correct for this and these papers will most likely score lower due to underreporting even though these uncertainties are not as applicable 3 1 5 overall reliability of methods for each of the reviewed studies quality criteria and the overall reliability is assessed table 3 none of the reviewed papers met the maximum achievable score of 22 one study had the highest score of 18 foppe et al 2018 and two studies had the second best score of 17 mastroianni et al 2017 skees et al 2018 these studies were published in 2017 or later indicating an improvement in the reporting on wbe approaches the average scores are 2 6 6 for the sampling method 7 9 10 for the analytical accuracy and 3 8 6 for the consumption estimation and 14 3 22 overall thus sampling uncertainty scored the poorest in agreement with conclusions stated by ort et al ort et al 2010a there is inherent sampling variability due to weather variation sporadic events and fluctuating flowrates still most studies fail to report sufficient details with respect to the sampling method sampling should be based on current knowledge and not just be based on the available equipment ort et al 2010 the analytical accuracy gave the best score the analytical method can be controlled by researchers whereas sample collection usually involves voluntary cooperation of treatment plant staff for this reason it was expected that this type of uncertainty would be reported in more detail and result in the best score 3 2 international drug consumption in the last decade the application of wastewater based epidemiology to monitor illicit drug loads quickly increased and the approach is currently applied on a global scale data on consumption of illicit drugs and their metabolites is reported for each continent except antarctica the variability of illicit drug consumption across the globe gives insight in substance abuse and can potentially assist health and law enforcement agencies to register and cut down drug related incidents and substance abuse lai et al 2016 an overview of drug consumption per country from literature published over the last decade is shown in table 4 for the four substances that are investigated most often these studies evaluated illicit drug use patterns in urban and rural areas and investigated weekly patterns as well as use on specific events the highest number of wbe studies was conducted in europe from where we evaluated twenty eight selected studies reporting in eighteen different countries table 4 studies on a growing number of participating cities are now organized on yearly basis by score and reported to the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction emcdda therefore also general time trends on illicit drug use in europe are well reported based on a certain period of sampling each year nowadays around 70 cities are included in this project emcdda 2020 for these europe wide studies by the emcdda the protocol to monitor drug loads is fixed and common quality control is used in all locations which makes true comparison possible overall reliability scores for european wide studies are amongst the highest table 3 the consumption of cocaine is most abundant in western european cities but a new increase in eastern european cities is also reported by the emcdda emcdda 2020 for amphetamine highest levels are detected in north and eastern europe and lower in southern europe methamphetamine consumption is relatively low in europe overall with the exception of slovakia since 2019 an increase has been reported by the emcdda in eastern germany spain and cyprus emcdda 2020 consumption of mdma is the highest in the netherlands belgium and germany but consumption peaks are also observed in england and scandinavia gonzález mariño et al 2020 table 4 the majority of the studies in europe show an increase of drug use during weekends compared to weekdays with an exception for methamphetamine emcdda 2020 these trends were also observed and reported by gonzález mariño et al gonzález mariño et al 2020 within the usa illicit drug use is a major concern foppe et al 2018 the first study using the wastewater based epidemiology approach in the usa was in 2009 banta green et al 2009 more recent studies in the usa croft et al 2020 foppe et al 2018 skees et al 2018 subedi and kannan 2014 and canada palardy et al 2015 followed since then here we evaluated five selected studies reporting on five different states table 4 a high cocaine consumption was measured in new york as well as for use of amphetamine and methamphetamine in urban and rural areas in the midwestern united states croft et al 2020 a high methamphetamine concentration can affect the amphetamine concentration due to biotransformation the data was corrected for this issue mdma loads were low for urban areas and not detected in rural areas of the midwestern states but higher in the state of new york in tennessee reported consumption data of methamphetamine and amphetamine are higher than data from new york state and kentucky whereas the cocaine consumption was lower skees et al 2018 illicit drug use in the midwestern united states is measured during week with special events showing significantly increased consumption during a festive week foppe et al 2018 compared to western countries wbe is not as often applied in south america we evaluated six selected studies reporting on two different illicit drugs in four different countries table 4 wbe in south america has been applied in brazil mariño et al 2019 f f sodré et al 2018 f sodré et al 2017 colombia bijlsma et al 2016 costa rica causanilles et al 2017 and the island of martinique devault et al 2014b to estimate the overall cocaine consumption for specific areas overall cocaine consumption in south and central america is reported to be relatively high compared to europe globe possibly related to the proximity to the production and the relatively high purity of street cocaine bijlsma et al 2016 during the last decade the wbe approach became a more popular indicator for drug consumption in asia we evaluated thirteen selected studies reporting on five different countries table 4 studies from china khan et al 2014 jing li et al 2014 shao et al 2020 south korea kim and oh 2020 yong et al 2015 vietnam nguyen et al 2018 the maldives fallati et al 2020 and malaysia du et al 2020 have been published in the last decade four megacities in china beijing guangzhou shenzhen and shanghai show significantly lower drug consumption data compared to other continents khan et al 2014 where cocaine is a popular recreational drug in north and south america and europe it is consumed much less in china however consumption of methamphetamine in china is relatively high methamphetamine use is concentrated in the centre of urban areas indicating a relation with the availability to entertainment activities even higher methamphetamine rates are reported in ho chi min vietnam and kuala lumpur malaysia table 4 lower drug consumption is reported in south korea during new year s day and christmas day the methamphetamine no noticeable changes in consumption were observed consumption of mdma and amphetamine is relatively low in china and south korea but mdma consumption for the maldives and malaysia is reported to be comparable to the high levels observed in northern europe i e the netherlands belgium the maldives and malaysia are popular holiday destinations which might explain why synthetic drugs are more popular in these places compared to the rest of asia du et al 2020 supported by the fact that drug consumption increases during the holiday season with regards to australia we evaluated four selected studies in three different states table 4 the first study that used wbe as a tool to estimate illicit drug use in australia was in 2011 irvine et al 2011 similar trends are observed as in asia the cocaine consumption is lower than consumption of methamphetamine while consumption of mdma is closer to european consumption data mdma and methamphetamine are more popular in rural areas whereas cocaine is more frequently used in urban areas noticeable is an increase in drug consumption during weekends for popular drugs such as cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine and mdma daily illicit drug consumption on an annual music festival in australia also shows an increase in mdma compared to the data from a normal week lai et al 2013 a large investigation is described on illicit use of cocaine methamphetamine and mdma lai et al 2016 identifying an overall increase in illicit drug consumption in both metropolitan and rural communities over a six year period in australia as in western europe synthetic drugs are more popular levels similar to those in australia of methamphetamine and cocaine consumption are found in new zealand kumar et al 2019 although mdma consumption is relatively low the application of wbe to monitor illicit drug use is still largely lacking in africa so far only two wwtps located in johannesburg and cape town south africa have been monitored to estimate drug use patterns archer et al 2018 methamphetamine is the primary substance detected at consumption data comparable to usa and australia clandestine manufacturing of illicit methamphetamine results in dumping events of chemical waste which could be traced via spikes including the precursors used in the production process observed at the wwtp in johannesburg archer et al 2018 cocaine consumption is found to be similar to european consumption data while consumption data for mdma are low compared to australia the usa and europe fig 2 illustrates the global consumption distribution for mdma purple methamphetamine blue cocaine red and amphetamine orange so far wbe has not been used to determine illicit drug consumption in most of the african continent the middle east and russia overall high consumption rates are found in the usa especially for cocaine and methamphetamine fig 3 for asia except for methamphetamine lowest consumption is reported cocaine production expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product gdp is the highest for colombia 2 to 3 incb 2002 while for the usa profits from drugs traffic are estimated to be 0 5 of gdp incb 2002 within europe the cocaine market is the second largest illicit drugs market with an estimated retail value of 9 1 billion euros in 2017 emcdda and europol 2019 the total value for the retail market for illicit drugs in europe was estimated at 30 billion euros in 2017 emcdda and europol 2019 the consumption of synthetic drugs such as amphetamine and mdma in europe increased in the last decade especially for the northern and eastern regions of europe similar trends are observed in europe s synthetic drug market which has rapidly grown in the past ten years emcdda and europol 2019 large scale production of mdma and amphetamine remains concentrated in the netherlands and belgium while production of methamphetamine is mainly concentrated in central europe emcdda and europol 2019 in asia drug consumption is relatively low compared to other continents according to a report by the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc in asian regions illicit drug production in asia is increasing for amphetamine like substances liu et al 2013 unodc 2008 this is proportional to the increase in methamphetamine consumption in china and south korea the reported results should be viewed with an assured degree of uncertainty consumption values are frequently reported without calculated uncertainty values ort et al 2010a only a handful of the reviewed papers causanilles et al 2017 deng et al 2020 devault et al 2018 du et al 2020 kumar et al 2019 shao et al 2020 skees et al 2018 f f sodré et al 2018 explicitly reported on uncertainty values for their consumption data xy the complete uncertainty assessment would include the sampling uncertainty analytical uncertainty and the uncertainty for the consumption estimation as mentioned in the previous chapter the trueness of the final consumption data should undergo a suitable statistical propagation various studies have used monte carlo analysis been et al 2015 croft et al 2020 jones et al 2014 shao et al 2020 y y zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 to calculate the uncertainties fig 3 shows the distribution of all reviewed papers per drug for each continent including the reliability of the method used to obtain the data points for many drug continent combinations the majority of the data fall within one order of magnitude 4 conclusion based on the relatively limited number of studies that could be identified as high quality further advancement of the wbe approach for illicit drugs is desired especially with regards to the sampling methodology however studies carried out in europe within the score research group have been using a systematic analytical approach including annual interlaboratory exercises as an important factor in making data more comparable notable is that over the years the analytical methodology is rapidly improving and the implementation of high resolution mass spectrometry techniques will allow more efficient methodologies for wide scope screening identification of untargeted suspect compounds or for the detection of metabolites and transformation products due to more advanced analytical approaches in the last decades detection limits are decreasing and became less challenging when measuring low concentrations publishing full information regarding detailed sampling and analytical methodologies even if only in the supplementary data is crucial for the interpretation of obtained results it will be necessary to harmonize the criteria for reliable identification confirmation and accurate quantification of compounds detected in samples reliable sampling and less uncertainty in population estimation this way data collected from different laboratories in different parts of the world would become more comparable to each other and valid conclusions can be drawn on illicit drug consumption in different communities on a global level this study provides an overview of the available literature reporting data on drug consumption using the wastewater based epidemiology approach overall high consumption rates are found in the usa especially for cocaine and methamphetamine consumption while lowest illicit drug consumption is reported in asia these results agree with data reported by the emcdda europe and the unodc other continents the wbe approach can identify trends in consumption quickly

16473,phosphorus as a non renewable element is flowing out too fast in the past decades to sustain the development of this globally scarce resource efficient measures were taken to recover more phosphorus in the struvite form from wastewater however heavy metals in the wastewater might produce an inhibitory effect on phosphorus recovery and even worse pollutants might be incorporated in onto the crystals precipitated impurities on struvite will reduce the quality of struvite as a potential slow release fertilizer and affect the safe application of struvite in agriculture this review aims to identify the trends in the literature to present the residues of heavy metals in struvite it summarizes the current status in the residues of main metal elements on crystals and its response to wastewater properties composition and oxidation state of metals the adsorption process and potential adsorption mechanism of heavy metals during the struvite crystallization are deeply explored which might determine the latter release rate of metals when applying into the soil possible solutions are further provided to minimize the amounts of heavy metals mainly through adjusting operational conditions or employing pretreatment methods finally this review critically analyzes the limitation gap between theory and actual generalization and potential application of struvite products in the market and corresponding perspectives in the future are given to safely utilize the phosphorus resource from wastewater in the form of struvite graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metals in wastewater phosphorus struvite adsorption precipitation mechanism 1 introduction phosphorus p is a macronutrient essential for crop growth to sustain global food production the demand

across the world is less than 20 li et al 2015 such low p utilization efficiency can result in the p discharge and accumulation in local streams causing aquatic eutrophication around 8 million tons of p each year was directly discharged from farms through soil leaching and erosion elser and bennett 2011 to enable the long term p supply there is a need for better p management and recycling addressing agriculture livestock and domestic wastewater fig 1 the nutrients recovery from wastewater in the mineral precipitation form may generally have significant advantages over direct use since the final product with higher nutrient concentration is solid and dry facilitating long distance transport and application in soil lu et al 2021 shu et al 2006 up to date the most readily applicable techniques involve p recycling as fertilizers in the form of struvite le corre et al 2009 shu et al 2006 k struvite tarragó et al 2018 calcium phosphates le corre et al 2009 among them struvite was given more attention as a slow release fertilizer with advantages of high p uptake low leach rates and slow release of nutrients degryse et al 2017 everaert et al 2017 struvite crystallization occurs through eq 1 when the ion activity product of mg2 nh4 and po4 3 in wastewater is greater than its corresponding solubility product ksp le corre et al 2009 extraction of p from wastewaters in the form of struvite has been carried out from several sources including urine sludge liquor after dewatering and anaerobically digested effluent of sludge and animal waste gell et al 2011 liu et al 2014 rabinovich et al 2021 ryu and lee 2016 saerens et al 2021 the digested effluent of animal waste and sewage sludge with large quantities produced from animal breeding and wastewater treatment contained substantially higher p concentrations reaching over 100 mg l de bashan and bashan 2004 hallas et al 2019 lahav et al 2013 which was fit well for p recovery through struvite crystallization 1 h n p o 4

recovered as struvite using modeling analysis venkatesan et al 2016 which can provide 10 50 of p source required for fertilizer use le corre et al 2009 however heavy metals existed in the wastewater might be adsorbed on struvite and pose an unknown effect on struvite purity inevitably struvite loaded with metals pollution produces potential environmental and health hazards increase the product s ecological risk and make it inadequate for agricultural applications li et al 2020 lu et al 2021 currently the record for heavy metals in wastewater to interact with crystals has received less attention and the mechanism remains elusive this review presents a comprehensive description of the adsorption of heavy metals on struvite obtained from wastewater and summarized the possible mechanism on the residues of metals in struvite then the methods to reduce the content of heavy metals in struvite crystals are analyzed based on their response to reaction parameters it is anticipated that this review will offer a deep vision on the incorporation of heavy metals with struvite and a scientific research gap and future perspective on the safe application of struvite in agriculture 2 incorporation of heavy metals with struvite crystals 2 1 heavy metals in wastewater heavy metals are among the most common pollutants in wastewater including mining wastes municipal wastewater urban runoff and industrial wastewaters fu et al 2021 karvelas et al 2003 wang et al 2013 heavy metals accumulated in municipal sludge usually come from various sources such as metallic chemicals pipeline corrosion the washing machine equipment process bleaching and neutralization reza and singh 2010 karvelas et al 2003 found that manganese mn and copper cu are primarily 70 accumulated in the sludge while 47 63 of cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb iron fe nickel ni and zinc zn remained in the treated effluent in the livestock and poultry farm feed additives containing some heavy metals especially cu zn as are often applied as essential nutrients and supplements to improve animal performance and provide protection against bacterial infections jin and chang 2011 provolo et al 2018 wang et al 2013 unfortunately given their over dosage and low assimilation via livestock metabolism most of the metals ingested are excreted in feces and urine due to their non degradability and end up in waste and wastewater tao et al 2021 heavy metals in livestock wastewater varied considerably among animal species and diets provolo et al 2018 sommer et al 2013 steinmetz et al 2009 the concentrations of cu and zn in swine wastewater were up to 13 5 mg l and 94 mg l respectively do amaral et al 2014 and pig slurries typically have a higher content of cu and zn compared to that of cattle manure sommer et al 2013 chu et al 2018 observed that zn mn cu were the most abundant elements in swine wastewater 1175 3 178 0 745 4 51 5 209 3 54 4 μg l respectively another common contaminant is cr which has an average concentration of 11 μg l in human urine and up to 12 mg l in industrial wastewater ronteltap et al 2007 song et al 2004 it is known that heavy metals in the wastewater affected the utilization of soil nutrients and resulted in the assimilation of metals in crop hu et al 2020 jiao et al 2012 thus with the application of struvite products as a fertilizer in crop production heavy metals in the wastewater will transport from struvite to the environments and pose potential risks to agricultural cultivation and human health in any application the quality of the recovered product needs to be safeguarded based on these facts the research on the residues of heavy metals in struvite recovered from wastewater is required and essential 2 2 incorporation of heavy metals with struvite heavy metals in the wastewaters were simultaneously incorporated into struvite products during the crystallization process leading to the precipitation of a less stable phase instead of struvite arslanoglu 2019 huang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 2021 ronteltap et al 2007 rouff and juarez 2014 many researchers referred to the incorporation of heavy metals in struvite and table 1 illustrates the heavy metals in the varying kinds of wastewater and their residues in struvite crystals after p recovery from wastewater this unique collection of information enables a reliable overview of the concentration of heavy metals in struvite obtained from various wastewater the amounts of metals residues on crystals or removal rate of metals in the wastewater were different for various metal elements early researches mainly studied the feasibility of p recovery from different kinds of wastewater and evaluated the potential use of struvite as a fertilizer in the soil and crop growth by analyzing the heavy metals or other micropollutants contents in struvite gell et al 2011 liu et al 2011 ronteltap et al 2007 shen et al 2015 suzuki et al 2007 uysal et al 2010 uysal et al 2010 reported that approximately 71 60 49 of fe arsenic as mercury hg respectively were removed from the anaerobically digested effluent of sewage sludge during the struvite crystallization similarly liu et al 2011 observed that 43 and 37 of zn and cu in swine wastewater respectively were transformed onto struvite after p recovery shen et al 2015 reported when recovering p from swine wastewater containing cu and zn of 2 36 and 11 93 mg l cu and zn content in struvite recovered reached as high as 804 and 5039 mg kg by dosing mgo respectively in contrast other heavy metals in the precipitates were lower or substantially lower than the ruling standards of chemical fertilizer in china muhmood et al 2018 stated that along with the recovery of nutrients 40 45 66 30 20 of zn cu pb cr ni respectively were removed accompanied by the struvite crystals formed from poultry slurry respectively the results above illustrate that the metals could be incorporated into the struvite decreasing the purity of the product in most cases struvite crystals retrieved from wastewater contained shallow levels of heavy metals that were below the measurement limit or the legal limits shen et al 2015 uysal et al 2010 during the past decade researchers began to focus on the adsorption of single or several metals on struvite and their potential mechanism during the crystallization process the performance of typical heavy metals interaction with struvite including cu zn pb as cr was clarified through batch and continuous experiments using synthetic wastewater huang et al 2019 hutnik et al 2016 lu et al 2020 2021 ma and rouff 2012 rouff and juarez 2014 one predictable phenomenon is that the amount of metals in struvite is associated with the process parameters applied huang et al 2017 li et al 2020 among them solution ph might be the foremost key factor to control struvite formation and the residues of metals in struvite when solution ph increased from 8 to 10 5 cu zn cr decreased from 4 8 6 8 9 5 mg g to 0 4 2 1 7 4 mg g with a reduction ratio of 91 7 69 1 22 respectively huang et al 2019 ryu et al 2020 concluded that ph of 10 was considered the optimal condition that can minimize cu and zn contents when recovering nutrients from the anaerobic digester effluent of swine manure the reason is that the more soluble negative species metal hydroxide formed at higher ph muryanto and bayuseno 2014 as a consequence metal ion competed for po4 with mg ion however wastewater ph might produce an opposite effect on the residue of as in struvite ma and rouff 2012 observed that as iii sorption was consistently lower than that of as v but increased with ph and was highest at ph 10 it was attributed to the change of activity of the aqueous species and saturation index induced by solution ph lin et al 2016 also thought that the contents of as iii and as v in struvite increased with an increase in solution ph from 9 0 to 11 0 except for as the contents of heavy metals decreased with an increasing ph thus the specific interaction of heavy metals with struvite in response to ph is dependent on the element itself and reaction conditions and a critical ph value occurred for the least metals adsorption in struvite which remained elusive in addition initial heavy metals concentration and oxidation state of metal both posed noticeable effects on their incorporation with struvite ma and juarez 2014 rouff 2012 hutnik et al 2016 found that zn content in the product varied from 0 02 to 64 3 mg kg with increasing zn concentration from 0 1 to 2 0 mg kg lu et al 2021 concluded that the removal of heavy metals cu and zn at low concentrations 0 1 10 mg l was lower than that at higher concentrations 25 100 mg l it is concluded that the residues of heavy metals on struvite is positive with their initial concentration in the wastewater the oxidation state of elements also exerted certain influence on the final incorporation which mainly refers to cr and as element rouff 2012 observed that the cr content of struvite precipitated in the presence of 1 100 μm cr as cr iii 22 3 3030 1 mg kg was higher than that of solids from cr vi 4 5 5 1 mg kg solutions the reason is that cr iii is relatively immobile in the presence of solids compared to cr vi which inclines to remain in solution fendorf 1995 uysal et al 2010 the other reason is that the negative charge of struvite may facilitate a preferential initial electrostatic interaction of positively charged cr oh 2 compared to cro4 2 le corre et al 2007 rouff 2012 the as content of struvite in the presence of as v were consistently higher than those of as iii by at least 1 2 orders of magnitude indicating a much higher affinity of as v relative to as iii for struvite ma and rouff 2012 furthermore huang et al 2019 observed that citric acid concentration contributed to the fewer residues of metals in struvite which was attributed to the formation of stable metal complexes in total the wastewater characteristics and running conditions will affect the incorporation of metals with struvite as several metals ions usually co exist in nutrient containing wastewater which will make the precipitation process and metals adsorption more complicated the reason is that metal ions co existed will compete for p reaction and adsorption on struvite affecting their residues in crystals and the morphology of crystals lu et al 2021 observed the competitive binding of po4 between cu and zn and stated that their residues in struvite also enhanced with increasing cu and zn concentration however the performance of cu and zn in solid was different with various cu zn ratios in the solution containing cu and zn cu 50 mg l and zn 0 1 100 mg l struvite might preliminarily incorporate with cu when zn concentration was 0 1 10 mg l and po4 mainly bonded to cu to form cu po4 and zn oh was detected as the dominant zn containing phase however at higher zn concentration 50 100 mg l most of cu and zn in the solution was transformed to struvite solids and the decrease of cu po4 and increase of zn po4 indicated the competitive binding of po4 group between cu and zn and the significant formation of cu nh3 was detected lu et al 2021 huang et al 2019 studied that the increasing initial heavy metal concentration enhances heavy metal in the solid where the trend for cr was the most obvious followed by zn and cu the results indicate that these metal ions are co precipitated along with the struvite and solids which varies with the metal elements themselves their concentration and their ratio however in some occasion the competition effect among metals ion might be small rouff 2014 thought that zn as and cr was not expected to directly compete with each other due to differences in speciation and charge the extent of interaction of zn as and cr with struvite will be contingent upon the presence and concentration of other elements which may compete for similar sites in reality the competition among heavy metals in the wastewater may be minimal when their molar ratio was high for instance when the zn concentration is about an order of magnitude higher than that of other trace elements in the liquid waste their competitive effects will be mitigated uysal et al 2010 therefore the heavy metals types and their corresponding concentrations in the wastewater will ultimately determine the extent of certain metal sorption in the struvite the interactions of heavy metals with struvite were different during the struvite precipitation and after crystals formation several researchers studied the performance of the removal of heavy metals from solution using struvite crystals arslanoglu 2019 peng et al 2018 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the study of arslanoglu 2019 showed that the maximum adsorption capacity was 158 73 mg g at 20 c ph of 6 and adsorbent dosage of 1 g l for a contact time of 240 min tang et al 2019 explored six heavy metals removal from solution through adding struvite and found that heavy metal content in the solution decreased with increasing struvite from 0 5 g 1 25 g l to 3 0 g 7 5 g l meanwhile ni and mn have lower precipitation rates compared with other heavy metals including cu zn pb and cr rouff and juarez 2014 compared the zn interaction with and after struvite precipitation and concluded that the solid loadings of zn were 13 and 54 mg kg during the struvite reaction process and the adsorption of formed struvite at the 0 065 mg l of zn in solution indicating a lower removal percentage during struvite precipitation however this difference is less pronounced at higher initial zn concentrations with the maximum removal at the 6 54 mg l of zn rouff and juarez 2014 which was attributed to distinct adsorption mechanisms up to date more information on the difference of metals adsorption with and after struvite reaction and their response to reaction parameters is unknown 2 3 agronomic effectiveness and safe application of struvite struvite as a slow release fertilizer provides potential efficiency savings and environmental benefits over conventional fertilizers due to its low solubility for it can provide a longer term source of p for crop growth than readily soluble forms of p everaert et al 2017 talboys et al 2016 until now the precipitation of struvite from different p rich waste streams and fertilization efficiency in different soil environments have been thoroughly investigated during the past decades ackerman et al 2013 degryse et al 2017 hertzberger et al 2021 muys et al 2021 rech et al 2020 talboys et al 2016 they also stated that the fertilizer efficiency of struvite on crop growth is comparable to that of conventional fertilizers from phosphate rock antonini et al 2012 degryse et al 2017 liu et al 2016 ryu and lee 2016 showed that the struvite deposit better enhanced lettuce growth in comparison to commercial fertilizers through laboratory pot test and nutrients such as n p k ca and mg were abundantly measured in the vegetable tissue due to the multi nutrient supply by struvite application metals have a tendency to be persistent in the environment and can bioaccumulate in the food chain and thus there is a potential of contamination with toxic heavy metals on soil health and crop quality there are currently no legislative requirements with respect to the heavy metal content of struvite when applying as a fertilizer previous research has confirmed that struvite crystals retrieved from swine wastewater contained very low levels of heavy metals that were far below the legal limits liu et al 2011 muys et al 2021 reza et al 2019 the heavy metal application to soil can be reduced significantly when struvite was used as a fertilizer compared to the commercial fertilizers antonini et al 2012 ryu and lee 2016 for instance ryu and lee 2016 observed that the application of struvite resulted in less accumulation of hg pb cr and ni in vegetable tissue than commercial fertilizers a recent study showed that heavy metal contents in the struvite recovered from swine wastewater were lower than the korean standard limits of fertilizer and feedstock guidelines reza et al 2019 the analysis on the samples from 24 european struvite production plants showed that heavy metals content in the struvite were below the legal limits muys et al 2021 nevertheless in some occasion the contents of cu and zn were significantly high in the collected solids shen et al 2015 heavy metal contents in some struvite recovered even exceeded the legal limits for fertilizers li et al 2019 rahman et al 2014 therefore the research on the residues of heavy metals in struvite should be further processed to ensure its safe application in the future 3 potential adsorption mechanism of heavy metals the binding mechanisms by which metal elements interact with struvite have not been clearly clarified the adhesion mechanism of metal ions was mainly proceeding with electrostatic adsorption complexation and precipitation of oversaturated metal phases lu et al 2021 ma and rouff 2012 rouff 2012 rouff and juarez 2014 which were shown in fig 2 these aspects of the potential mechanism of metals interaction with struvite were illustrated recently using advanced spectroscopic analysis x ray photoelectron spectra x ray powder diffraction fourier transform infrared spectrometry scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometer system etc in the synthetic and practical wastewaters lu et al 2020 2021 rouff 2012 which mainly focused on cu zn pb as cr ion it is inferred that the adsorption mechanism largely depended on the initial metal elements concentration huang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 2021 rouff 2012 for cu and zn ions in the wastewater a prime interaction for the formation of cu oh cu po4 cu nh3 zn po4 and zn oh occurred on the surface of struvite at a low concentration of 0 1 10 mg l lu et al 2021 peng et al 2017 prohibiting the growth of struvite crystal at these specific sites however the ratio of cu oh cu po4 zn oh enhanced with their increasing concentration meaning that different adsorption mechanism occurred peng et al 2017 demonstrated that in the presence of cu2 concentrations from 200 to 800 mg l the newly generated cu oh 2 could adhere to struvite whereas with the increasing cu concentration more cu was entering into the crystal structure of struvite explaining the occurrence of the peak related to another copper compound cunh4po4 6h2o besides cu oh 2 lu et al 2020 revealed that at the low concentration 0 1 1 mg l most of the pb absorbed on the surface of struvite was amorphous forms pb oh and pb po4 bonds during the precipitation process in contrast with the pb concentration increased to above 10 mg l only 10 of pb occurred in the form of an amorphous phase and most of pb reacted with po4 at the alkaline conditions to form crystalline pb10 po4 6 oh 2 other studies also presented a similar point that more heavy metals were removed from solution at higher concentrations in the form of metal phosphate or metal hydroxide phases becoming increasingly oversaturated with a concentration based on speciation calculations rouff 2012 rouff and juarez 2014 in theory the possible adsorption forms are illustrated in fig 3 and the impurities in the struvite mainly include surface impurity interstitial impurity and substitutional impurity it means that metals are incorporated into the crystal lattice of struvite and sorbed to the surface of struvite or substituted with the original ion in struvite surface adsorption is the dominating incorporation mechanism at a low concentration of metals the hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and coordination bonding supported the ion interaction on the struvite surface through the comparison of struvite characterization before and after reaction peng et al 2018 tansel et al 2018 thereinto the newly generated amorphous particles might be adhered and grown to the surface of the struvite via hydrogen bonds peng et al 2016 which was the primary mechanism for surface adhesion while the electrostatic attraction was a secondary mechanism peng et al 2017 tansel et al 2018 at lower cu concentrations 1 10 mg l most of cu was also bonding with nh3 in the wastewater forming cu nh3 4 2 complex peng et al 2017 another study proposed that the proportion of amorphous zn3 po4 2 and zn oh 2 increased with an increase in the initial zn concentration from 0 to 150 mg l huang et al 2017 whereas heavy metals gathering to precipitate minerals was the dominant incorporation pattern with struvite at high concentrations of metals huang et al 2019 substitution with po4 nh4 and mg2 in the lattice of struvite by heavy metals was a common mechanism for metal precipitation in struvite products chand and agarwal 1991 lin et al 2013 peng et al 2018 rouff 2012 resulting in the change of struvite crystal morphology fig 3 the common site for substitution would be the mg site due to the similarity in ionic radii and covalent charge with cu zn pb as observed for the formation of znnh4po4 6h2o and cunh4po4 6h2o peng et al 2017 ravikumar et al 2010 obviously higher concentration also facilitated the precipitation of other minerals such as zn3 po4 2 h2o 4 zn4 po4 2 oh 2 h2o 3 zn oh 2 cuhpo4 cu h2po4 2 cu3 po4 2 cu5 po4 2 oh 4 mgnh4aso4 h2o 6 and cr oh 3 nh2o huang et al 2017 lu et al 2021 rouff 2012 wang et al 2020 however the critical concentration between adsorption and precipitation for each metal remains unknown their roles are likely dependent on the various conditions such as supersaturation ph ionic strength and chemical state of metals which to date have remained elusive interestingly supersaturation and ionic strength posed great effect on inhibiting the adsorption of as v on crystals for the adsorption mechanism was mainly induced by the bidentate inner sphere surface complexes and the electrostatic interaction between as v and struvite lin et al 2013 rouff et al 2016 whereas the co precipitation of as v on struvite was associated with the solution ph which would gradually be predominated as ph rise hong et al 2020 a more common fact is the coexistence of several metals in the wastewater and competitive binding of po4 among several metals will exist specifically the ratio of metal elements will dramatically affect the force types and their interaction with solid determining the percentage of amorphous and crystalline forms thus the final composition of precipitants will be complicated and be associated with their ratio and chemical properties li et al 2020 lu et al 2021 under identical condition the order of saturation index of cu zn phosphate or cu zn hydroxide is zn oh 2 cu oh 2 cu3 po4 2 3h2o zn3 po4 2 4h2o huang et al 2019 which can be used to explain the fact that amorphous precipitation like zn oh 2 and cu oh 2 mainly occurred at low concentration while mineral formation at high concentration the reaction mechanisms of heavy metals in the wastewater are greatly complicated and the difference in species properties determines the different adsorption mechanisms resulting in various formations of minerals in the struvite lu et al 2020 2021 rouff and juarez 2014 for instance the adsorption mechanism of cu and zn during p recovery process is different lu et al 2021 which might be related with the binding capacity of forming coordination compounds with nh3 in the wastewater and the saturation index of cu zn hydroxide or cu zn phosphate huang et al 2019 li et al 2020 rouff and juarez 2014 the initial metals concentration and oxidation state in wastewaters targeted for p recovery will dictate the final metal content the mechanism of sorption and impact on the struvite structure rouff 2012 lu et al 2021 described the potential mechanism based on the effect of individual and coexistence of cu and zn on the adsorption of heavy metals in struvite inferring that the mechanisms on metal interactions with struvite were mainly three pathways including adsorption individual precipitation and synergistic effect of several metals under various conditions overall the mechanism of heavy metals incorporation into struvite was summarized in fig 4 the driving force for the interaction of the metals with struvite included surface adsorption electrostatic adsorption complexation precipitation and the specific dominant force varied in response to the chemical composition of wastewater and reaction parameters at initial low concentration metal ions interacted with struvite by surface adsorption and electrostatic adsorption resulting in their adsorption on the surface of struvite crystals or precipitation of amorphous forms m oh and m po4 bonds fig 4 surface adsorption at this stage caused by these relatively lower initial concentrations of metals did not result in significant struvite morphological changes muryanto and bayuseno 2014 with the increasing metals concentration the percentage of adsorption mechanism decreased but crystalline precipitation during oversaturated metal phases increasing metal concentrations facilitated the precipitation of new minerals and substitution with po4 nh4 and mg2 resulting in a series of minerals and complexation compounds therefore higher heavy metal concentration makes slower kinetic of the struvite crystallization in terms of decreasing constant rate saidou et al 2015 leading to the decrease in the production of struvite the change of struvite crystal morphology and the impurity of struvite products arslanoglu 2019 rouff and juarez 2014 hong et al 2020 revealed that the crystal growth rate of struvite was substantially reduced by nearly 50 with the increasing as v concentration from 0 to 10 mg l the dominating force at low and high metal concentrations will both take part in metal interaction with struvite at the medium concentration still the boundary of this scope is unknown and varies with the element itself and specific crystallization conditions in turn the adsorption mechanism will affect the release rate of metals and nutrients after struvite containing metals are applied as fertilizer another worthwhile point is the difference in the adsorption of heavy metals on crystals during and after struvite crystallization those researchers focused on the removal of metals from wastewater using struvite concluded the adsorption process as surface adsorption and dissolution precipitation to produce the new minerals on the surface of struvite crystals arslanoglu 2019 peng et al 2018 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the study of arslanoglu 2019 showed that the primary mechanism governing the adsorption process of cu on struvite was weak interactions such as physical adsorption based on adsorption kinetics and isotherms in another study on the interaction of several kinds of heavy metals with struvite the results clearly evidenced the formation of cu oh 2 and growth on struvite surface suggesting the struvite functioned as heterogeneous nucleation templates for cu oh 2 through the tem images and eds mapping analysis tang et al 2019 rouff and juarez 2014 stated the difference in the zn interaction with and after struvite precipitation and concluded that a higher removal of zn from solution using struvite than that occurred during struvite precipitation which was attributed to the easy adsorption on the surface of struvite due to a large surface area of struvite crystals peng et al 2018 rouff 2012 they thought that mixed coordination bidentate complexes and tetrahedral monodentate surface adsorbates occurred in the presence of pre existing struvite whereas octahedrally coordinated adsorbates linked to the surface of struvite as a result at low concentrations higher metal removal was obtained during the adsorption with struvite but this difference is less pronounced at higher initial concentrations 4 methods to minimize the residues of heavy metals so far there is little research on how to minimize the heavy metal residues in struvite li et al 2020 the alternative pathways to control the heavy metal contents in struvite might be considered based on their interactions pathways of metals with struvite one possible method is to adjust the crystallization parameters to reduce the metals residues in crystals struvite formation and heavy metals residues are dependent on various conditions such as supersaturation ph oxidation state and ionic strength huang et al 2019 le corre et al 2009 lu et al 2020 2021 ma and rouff 2012 li et al 2020 observed that an increase in the initial solution ph of synthetic swine wastewater could significantly reduce the cu and zn co precipitation and their contents in the recovered struvite however both as iii and as v content in solid increased with the increasing ph from 8 0 to 10 0 and then decreased after continuous increasing ph ma and rouff 2012 thus the response of heavy metals to the solution ph was different for varied metal elements and various adjustments should be employed to obtain the struvite with fewer metals the chemical composition in wastewater might also affect the metals residues in struvite crystals particularly the molar ratio of mg nh4 po4 huang et al 2019 found when the nh4 po4 p molar ratio increased from 1 1 to 11 1 cr zn cu contents in struvite decreased from 10 6 10 6 8 to 7 4 3 1 0 82 mg g respectively the reason is that higher nh4 n concentration facilities the struvite crystallization due to higher ionic strength and more robust buffer capacity which can help to compete with heavy metals for po4 to form amorphous materials or coordination compounds therefore reducing their amount in the final precipitates arenas et al 2007 li et al 2020 as a consequence metal ions can be stably present and not co precipitate with struvite in comparison the ratio of mg p had much less effect on the reduction of heavy metals on struvite compared to solution ph huang et al 2019 rabinovich et al 2021 found that increasing mg concentration did not improve po4 p recovery as struvite but reduced the sorption of zn and fe with recovered solids besides dissolved organic matter not only affects the struvite formation in the wastewater but also impede the adsorption of heavy metals on struvite due to their complexation with metals wang et al 2019 however the suitable crystallization condition should be set for the composition of the heavy metals in the wastewater obtaining an acceptable struvite yield and less abundant of metals apart from adjusting the parameters numerous strategies are developed to control the metals concentration in the wastewater through pretreatment methods before struvite recovery lu et al 2021 shen et al 2015 previous researchers found that a strong association occurred between the heavy metal concentration with the suspended solids ss in wastewater chu et al 2018 suzuki et al 2007 heavy metals in the wastewater is inclined to adhere to these particles due to high specific surface area of suspended particles for instance chu et al 2018 measured that the heavy metals especially zn 97 0 and cu 96 8 in the swine wastewater were mainly distributed in the ss several techniques such as coagulation and precipitation ion exchange bio sorption and biological treatment have been proposed for reducing the heavy metals pollution in the wastewater chang et al 2006 fu and wang 2011 ma et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 during the struvite crystallization process flocculation can effectively remove the ss of wastewater and decrease the content of cu and zn in struvite precipitate from 130 and 400 mg kg to 53 and 152 mg kg respectively ma et al 2018 74 99 removal of cr at an initial concentration of 12 mg l can be achieved at an optimum coagulant dosage of 800 mg l song et al 2004 in contrast the biosorption methods using materials are time saving with high efficiency low cost and simple operation mobasherpour et al 2012 the study of zhao et al 2020 showed that the highest removal rates of cu ii and cd ii from wastewater were achieved with 96 8 and 78 respectively through adding sodium alginate at a liquid solid ratio of 12 5 ml g feasible methods for reducing the residues of heavy metals in struvite during crystallization process was listed in table 2 which also simply presented possible advantages and disadvantages accordingly a compromising stage between optimizing metal removal and the need for increasing p recovery during crystallization is required multiple variables controlling the removal efficiency of heavy metals could be optimized using modeling analysis the response surface methodology rsm could be used to optimize the reaction parameters to obtain a high removal of p and struvite purity during crystallization process kumari et al 2020 polat and sayan 2019 perwitasari et al 2018 found that through the optimization of rsm from the wastewater containing cu2 pb2 zn2 59 5 mg l of cu2 70 80 mg l of pb2 77 2 mg l of zn2 could be recovered from wastewater with an optimum struvite output of 8 34 mg respectively thus this method can provide a deep evaluation on the effect of an individual factor on metals interaction with struvite and identifies the optimum conditions for struvite recovery in real wastewater with the response in the least number of experimental runs 5 future perspectives the mechanisms of heavy metals interaction with struvite and their potential effect on the crystal properties are essential to consider there are certain limitations in terms of specific adsorption mechanisms for heavy metals in struvite and the optimization of reaction parameters for minimizing their contents in a solid product another worthwhile point is to clarify the time sequence on nucleation of struvite and adsorption and precipitation of heavy metals in the wastewater which is greatly associated with the ionic strength because their competitive interaction will determine the heavy metals residues and their composition although most researches were focusing on single metal elements at fixed conditions in reality two or more elements co existed in the practical wastewater and some other factors like suspended matter carbonate calcium ion in the wastewater will pose unknown synergistic effects on p reaction and heavy metals interaction with struvite heavy metals in the wastewater not only affect the crystallization kinetics and their residues in struvite pose potential environmental and health hazards to increase the product s ecological risk through the food chain li et al 2020 lu et al 2021 the effectiveness of struvite and commercial fertilizers is quite closely based on pilot and field experiments and majority of them proved that struvite recovered from the wastewater containing heavy metals was safe as a fertilizer for crop growth below the measurement limit or the legal limits ackerman et al 2013 liu et al 2016 ryu and lee 2016 peeva et al 2021 however the concern about the entry of various heavy metals in struvite into the human food chain has still occurred harmful metal elements in soil through the food chain has been proposed to pose potential impact on human health tóth et al 2016 the crop uptake of heavy metal contaminants and long term effect of applying struvite containing trace amounts of heavy metals has been poorly studied due to the lack of data of adequate detail and reliability even though the amount of heavy metals in struvite transferred to soil in a single application is very low or negligible shen et al 2015 uysal et al 2010 the long term application of such fertilizer might produce significant enrichment of metals in the soil posing negative effect on soil quality and human health jiao et al 2012 thus regulations should be proposed for the limits on maximum heavy metal concentrations permitted in struvite solid which will be essential for its large scale application in the future for instance it is feasible to use the allowance standards of heavy metals in fertilizers for reference to set the tolerance limits on the content of heavy metals in struvite furthermore the different adsorption forms in struvite may result in different risk of toxicity depending on the local conditions for the bioavailability of metals generally decreases with increasing ph organic matter content and clay content of soil mortvedt 1996 deep research on this aspect will be required to ensure the safe application of struvite in the long term and future investigation on the favorited application rate for various soil conditions is recommended the release rate of nutrients and heavy metals in the soil will generate a great deal of concern the highlight of the physical form of the fertilizer should also be emphasized when assessing the release properties of nutrients and pollutants from granulated or polymer coated struvite into the soil system given current fertilizer delivery systems powdered fertilizers are generally impractical whereas commercial fertilizers are commonly applied to soil in a granular form compared to soluble p fertilizers granular struvite has the advantage of minimizing p losses giving rise to less environmental concerns in high rainfall areas the reason is that it can provide a longer term source of p for crop growth which is more closely matching the crop s demand for p later in the growing season and increasing its use efficiency everaert et al 2017 liu et al 2011 talboys et al 2016 the p release kinetics and p availability of granulated struvite have recently been assessed by degryse et al 2017 who observed that the uptake of p by wheat was similar for mono ammonium phosphate and struvite when applied in powder form we measured the release and solubility of granulated struvite the diameter of 3 mm loaded with cu and zn and found that the release of heavy metals and nutrients will be still slow even in the pure water of ph 4 0 not published which might be attributed to the release of nh4 during the dissolution of struvite crystals in theory the solubility of pure struvite is low in water and soil however the low molecular weight organic acids such as oxalic citric malic and acetic acid produced from root exudates microbial metabolism and decomposition of soil organic matter might be conducive to the dissolution of nutrients in struvite to soil for the utilization of crop growth montiel rozas et al 2016 saerens et al 2021 however all these mentioned need further exploration furthermore the release properties of heavy metals and nutrients in the struvite will be related with the sorption mechanism for instance compared to mineral precipitation or substitutional impurities heavy metals with the surface adsorption species are susceptible to desorption in soil rouff et al 2006 which might be readily mobilized and toxic to plants and organisms ma and rouff 2012 based on the requirement of high quantities and containing a high p concentration the digested effluent from sewage sludge and animal manure is considered to be the leading resource research on the feasibility of recovering struvite from wastewater with heavy metals polluted and their corresponding life cycle assessment should be concentrated in the future a comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of struvite recovery processes is crucial to realize more closed p recycling for instance p recovery from wastewater will considerably reduce the discharge of p and lead to less eutrophication in the receiving aquatic environment le corre et al 2009 as well as the environmental pressure caused by exploring phosphate rock up to date a lack of research on product quality and unclear economic feasibility increases the risks for industrial scale applications struvite production from wastewater is presently undervalued the new european fertilizing products regulation will go into application in 2022 and when phosphate rock prices will rise resulting in a higher price of struvite as fertilizer in the market saerens et al 2021 6 conclusions the recovery of p from wastewater as struvite and its use as fertilizer introduces sustainability to the human p cycle conserving nonrenewable geologic p reserves and contributing significantly to closing the p cycle in the past decade researchers paid more attention to the adsorption of single or several metals on struvite and their potential mechanism during the crystallization process surface adsorption is the dominating incorporation mechanism at low concentrations of metals but increasing metal concentrations facilitated the precipitation of new minerals and decreases the percentage of physical adsorption high heavy metal concentration in the wastewater also makes slower kinetic of the struvite crystallization leading to a decrease in the struvite production and its impurity the effective strategies to reduce the metals residues in crystals is to adjust the crystallization parameters and to propose the pretreatment on wastewater with coagulation precipitation bio sorption before struvite formation the key point is the critical and acceptable amount of metals in struvite which is also associated with the risk evaluation of granulated struvite application on soil quality and crop safety in addition a comprehensive assessment of p recovery from wastewater is required to provide better support on the implication of struvite production and sell in the market declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16473,phosphorus as a non renewable element is flowing out too fast in the past decades to sustain the development of this globally scarce resource efficient measures were taken to recover more phosphorus in the struvite form from wastewater however heavy metals in the wastewater might produce an inhibitory effect on phosphorus recovery and even worse pollutants might be incorporated in onto the crystals precipitated impurities on struvite will reduce the quality of struvite as a potential slow release fertilizer and affect the safe application of struvite in agriculture this review aims to identify the trends in the literature to present the residues of heavy metals in struvite it summarizes the current status in the residues of main metal elements on crystals and its response to wastewater properties composition and oxidation state of metals the adsorption process and potential adsorption mechanism of heavy metals during the struvite crystallization are deeply explored which might determine the latter release rate of metals when applying into the soil possible solutions are further provided to minimize the amounts of heavy metals mainly through adjusting operational conditions or employing pretreatment methods finally this review critically analyzes the limitation gap between theory and actual generalization and potential application of struvite products in the market and corresponding perspectives in the future are given to safely utilize the phosphorus resource from wastewater in the form of struvite graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metals in wastewater phosphorus struvite adsorption precipitation mechanism 1 introduction phosphorus p is a macronutrient essential for crop growth to sustain global food production the demand for p has increased dramatically and will continue to do so as the global population rises exponentially juup et al 2021 currently the production of p fertilizers accounts for 80 90 of phosphate rocks mined around the world childers et al 2011 considering that phosphate deposits are renewed only on a scale of geological time p in natural mineral deposits are a non renewable element predicted to be depleted within the next 100 years cordell et al 2009 li et al 2018 reinhard et al 2017 from a geopolitical point of view the p source is also not equally distributed around globally and 71 of the phosphate rock reserves are verified in morocco and western sahara juup et al 2021 thus uncontrolled exploitation of phosphate minerals is likely to lead to a significant increase in the cost of p fertilizers making it out of reach and resulting in sensitive food security situations and political tensions cordell and white 2011 the primary unitization efficiency of p fertilizer in agriculture across the world is less than 20 li et al 2015 such low p utilization efficiency can result in the p discharge and accumulation in local streams causing aquatic eutrophication around 8 million tons of p each year was directly discharged from farms through soil leaching and erosion elser and bennett 2011 to enable the long term p supply there is a need for better p management and recycling addressing agriculture livestock and domestic wastewater fig 1 the nutrients recovery from wastewater in the mineral precipitation form may generally have significant advantages over direct use since the final product with higher nutrient concentration is solid and dry facilitating long distance transport and application in soil lu et al 2021 shu et al 2006 up to date the most readily applicable techniques involve p recycling as fertilizers in the form of struvite le corre et al 2009 shu et al 2006 k struvite tarragó et al 2018 calcium phosphates le corre et al 2009 among them struvite was

recovered as struvite using modeling analysis venkatesan et al 2016 which can provide 10 50 of p source required for fertilizer use le corre et al 2009 however heavy metals existed in the wastewater might be adsorbed on struvite and pose an unknown effect on struvite purity inevitably struvite loaded with metals pollution produces potential environmental and health hazards increase the product s ecological risk and make it inadequate for agricultural applications li et al 2020 lu et al 2021 currently the record for heavy metals in wastewater to interact with crystals has received less attention and the mechanism remains elusive this review presents a comprehensive description of the adsorption of heavy metals on struvite obtained from wastewater and summarized the possible mechanism on the residues of metals in struvite then the methods to reduce the content of heavy metals in struvite crystals are analyzed based on their response to reaction parameters it is anticipated that this review will offer a deep vision on the incorporation of heavy metals with struvite and a scientific research gap and future perspective on the safe application of struvite in agriculture 2 incorporation of heavy metals with struvite crystals 2 1 heavy metals in wastewater heavy metals are among the most common pollutants in wastewater including mining wastes municipal wastewater urban runoff and industrial wastewaters fu et al 2021 karvelas et al 2003 wang et al 2013 heavy metals accumulated in municipal sludge usually come from various sources such as metallic chemicals pipeline corrosion the washing machine equipment process bleaching and neutralization reza and singh 2010 karvelas et al 2003 found that manganese mn and copper cu are primarily 70 accumulated in the sludge while 47 63 of cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb iron fe nickel ni and zinc zn remained in the treated effluent in the livestock and poultry farm feed additives containing some heavy metals especially cu zn as are often applied as essential nutrients and supplements to improve animal performance and provide protection against bacterial infections jin and chang 2011 provolo et al 2018 wang et al 2013 unfortunately given their over dosage and low assimilation via livestock metabolism most of the metals ingested are excreted in feces and urine due to their non degradability and end up in waste and wastewater tao et al 2021 heavy metals in livestock wastewater varied considerably among animal species and diets provolo et al 2018 sommer et al 2013 steinmetz et al 2009 the concentrations of cu and zn in swine wastewater were up to 13 5 mg l and 94 mg l respectively do amaral et al 2014 and pig slurries typically have a higher content of cu and zn compared to that of cattle manure sommer et al 2013 chu et al 2018 observed that zn mn cu were the most abundant elements in swine wastewater 1175 3 178 0 745 4 51 5 209 3 54 4 μg l respectively another common contaminant is cr which has an average concentration of 11 μg l in human urine and up to 12 mg l in industrial wastewater ronteltap et al 2007 song et al 2004 it is known that heavy metals in the wastewater affected the utilization of soil nutrients and resulted in the assimilation of metals in crop hu et al 2020 jiao et al 2012 thus with the application of struvite products as a fertilizer in crop production heavy metals in the wastewater will transport from struvite to the environments and pose potential risks to agricultural cultivation and human health in any application the quality of the recovered product needs to be safeguarded based on these facts the research on the residues of heavy metals in struvite recovered from wastewater is required and essential 2 2 incorporation of heavy metals with struvite heavy metals in the wastewaters were simultaneously incorporated into struvite products during the crystallization process leading to the precipitation of a less stable phase instead of struvite arslanoglu 2019 huang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 2021 ronteltap et al 2007 rouff and juarez 2014 many researchers referred to the incorporation of heavy metals in struvite and table 1 illustrates the heavy metals in the varying kinds of wastewater and their residues in struvite crystals after p recovery from wastewater this unique collection of information enables a reliable overview of the concentration of heavy metals in struvite obtained from various wastewater the amounts of metals residues on crystals or removal rate of metals in the wastewater were different for various metal elements early researches mainly studied the feasibility of p recovery from different kinds of wastewater and evaluated the potential use of struvite as a fertilizer in the soil and crop growth by analyzing the heavy metals or other micropollutants contents in struvite gell et al 2011 liu et al 2011 ronteltap et al 2007 shen et al 2015 suzuki et al 2007 uysal et al 2010 uysal et al 2010 reported that approximately 71 60 49 of fe arsenic as mercury hg respectively were removed from the anaerobically digested effluent of sewage sludge during the struvite crystallization similarly liu et al 2011 observed that 43 and 37 of zn and cu in swine wastewater respectively were transformed onto struvite after p recovery shen et al 2015 reported when recovering p from swine wastewater containing cu and zn of 2 36 and 11 93 mg l cu and zn content in struvite recovered reached as high as 804 and 5039 mg kg by dosing mgo respectively in contrast other heavy metals in the precipitates were lower or substantially lower than the ruling standards of chemical fertilizer in china muhmood et al 2018 stated that along with the recovery of nutrients 40 45 66 30 20 of zn cu pb cr ni respectively were removed accompanied by the struvite crystals formed from poultry slurry respectively the results above illustrate that the metals could be incorporated into the struvite decreasing the purity of the product in most cases struvite crystals retrieved from wastewater contained shallow levels of heavy metals that were below the measurement limit or the legal limits shen et al 2015 uysal et al 2010 during the past decade researchers began to focus on the adsorption of single or several metals on struvite and their potential mechanism during the crystallization process the performance of typical heavy metals interaction with struvite including cu zn pb as cr was clarified through batch and continuous experiments using synthetic wastewater huang et al 2019 hutnik et al 2016 lu et al 2020 2021 ma and rouff 2012 rouff and juarez 2014 one predictable phenomenon is that the amount of metals in struvite is associated with the process parameters applied huang et al 2017 li et al 2020 among them solution ph might be the foremost key factor to control struvite formation and the residues of metals in struvite when solution ph increased from 8 to 10 5 cu zn cr decreased from 4 8 6 8 9 5 mg g to 0 4 2 1 7 4 mg g with a reduction ratio of 91 7 69 1 22 respectively huang et al 2019 ryu et al 2020 concluded that ph of 10 was considered the optimal condition that can minimize cu and zn contents when recovering nutrients from the anaerobic digester effluent of swine manure the reason is that the more soluble negative species metal hydroxide formed at higher ph muryanto and bayuseno 2014 as a consequence metal ion competed for po4 with mg ion however wastewater ph might produce an opposite effect on the residue of as in struvite ma and rouff 2012 observed that as iii sorption was consistently lower than that of as v but increased with ph and was highest at ph 10 it was attributed to the change of activity of the aqueous species and saturation index induced by solution ph lin et al 2016 also thought that the contents of as iii and as v in struvite increased with an increase in solution ph from 9 0 to 11 0 except for as the contents of heavy metals decreased with an increasing ph thus the specific interaction of heavy metals with struvite in response to ph is dependent on the element itself and reaction conditions and a critical ph value occurred for the least metals adsorption in struvite which remained elusive in addition initial heavy metals concentration and oxidation state of metal both posed noticeable effects on their incorporation with struvite ma and juarez 2014 rouff 2012 hutnik et al 2016 found that zn content in the product varied from 0 02 to 64 3 mg kg with increasing zn concentration from 0 1 to 2 0 mg kg lu et al 2021 concluded that the removal of heavy metals cu and zn at low concentrations 0 1 10 mg l was lower than that at higher concentrations 25 100 mg l it is concluded that the residues of heavy metals on struvite is positive with their initial concentration in the wastewater the oxidation state of elements also exerted certain influence on the final incorporation which mainly refers to cr and as element rouff 2012 observed that the cr content of struvite precipitated in the presence of 1 100 μm cr as cr iii 22 3 3030 1 mg kg was higher than that of solids from cr vi 4 5 5 1 mg kg solutions the reason is that cr iii is relatively immobile in the presence of solids compared to cr vi which inclines to remain in solution fendorf 1995 uysal et al 2010 the other reason is that the negative charge of struvite may facilitate a preferential initial electrostatic interaction of positively charged cr oh 2 compared to cro4 2 le corre et al 2007 rouff 2012 the as content of struvite in the presence of as v were consistently higher than those of as iii by at least 1 2 orders of magnitude indicating a much higher affinity of as v relative to as iii for struvite ma and rouff 2012 furthermore huang et al 2019 observed that citric acid concentration contributed to the fewer residues of metals in struvite which was attributed to the formation of stable metal complexes in total the wastewater characteristics and running conditions will affect the incorporation of metals with struvite as several metals ions usually co exist in nutrient containing wastewater which will make the precipitation process and metals adsorption more complicated the reason is that metal ions co existed will compete for p reaction and adsorption on struvite affecting their residues in crystals and the morphology of crystals lu et al 2021 observed the competitive binding of po4 between cu and zn and stated that their residues in struvite also enhanced with increasing cu and zn concentration however the performance of cu and zn in solid was different with various cu zn ratios in the solution containing cu and zn cu 50 mg l and zn 0 1 100 mg l struvite might preliminarily incorporate with cu when zn concentration was 0 1 10 mg l and po4 mainly bonded to cu to form cu po4 and zn oh was detected as the dominant zn containing phase however at higher zn concentration 50 100 mg l most of cu and zn in the solution was transformed to struvite solids and the decrease of cu po4 and increase of zn po4 indicated the competitive binding of po4 group between cu and zn and the significant formation of cu nh3 was detected lu et al 2021 huang et al 2019 studied that the increasing initial heavy metal concentration enhances heavy metal in the solid where the trend for cr was the most obvious followed by zn and cu the results indicate that these metal ions are co precipitated along with the struvite and solids which varies with the metal elements themselves their concentration and their ratio however in some occasion the competition effect among metals ion might be small rouff 2014 thought that zn as and cr was not expected to directly compete with each other due to differences in speciation and charge the extent of interaction of zn as and cr with struvite will be contingent upon the presence and concentration of other elements which may compete for similar sites in reality the competition among heavy metals in the wastewater may be minimal when their molar ratio was high for instance when the zn concentration is about an order of magnitude higher than that of other trace elements in the liquid waste their competitive effects will be mitigated uysal et al 2010 therefore the heavy metals types and their corresponding concentrations in the wastewater will ultimately determine the extent of certain metal sorption in the struvite the interactions of heavy metals with struvite were different during the struvite precipitation and after crystals formation several researchers studied the performance of the removal of heavy metals from solution using struvite crystals arslanoglu 2019 peng et al 2018 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the study of arslanoglu 2019 showed that the maximum adsorption capacity was 158 73 mg g at 20 c ph of 6 and adsorbent dosage of 1 g l for a contact time of 240 min tang et al 2019 explored six heavy metals removal from solution through adding struvite and found that heavy metal content in the solution decreased with increasing struvite from 0 5 g 1 25 g l to 3 0 g 7 5 g l meanwhile ni and mn have lower precipitation rates compared with other heavy metals including cu zn pb and cr rouff and juarez 2014 compared the zn interaction with and after struvite precipitation and concluded that the solid loadings of zn were 13 and 54 mg kg during the struvite reaction process and the adsorption of formed struvite at the 0 065 mg l of zn in solution indicating a lower removal percentage during struvite precipitation however this difference is less pronounced at higher initial zn concentrations with the maximum removal at the 6 54 mg l of zn rouff and juarez 2014 which was attributed to distinct adsorption mechanisms up to date more information on the difference of metals adsorption with and after struvite reaction and their response to reaction parameters is unknown 2 3 agronomic effectiveness and safe application of struvite struvite as a slow release fertilizer provides potential efficiency savings and environmental benefits over conventional fertilizers due to its low solubility for it can provide a longer term source of p for crop growth than readily soluble forms of p everaert et al 2017 talboys et al 2016 until now the precipitation of struvite from different p rich waste streams and fertilization efficiency in different soil environments have been thoroughly investigated during the past decades ackerman et al 2013 degryse et al 2017 hertzberger et al 2021 muys et al 2021 rech et al 2020 talboys et al 2016 they also stated that the fertilizer efficiency of struvite on crop growth is comparable to that of conventional fertilizers from phosphate rock antonini et al 2012 degryse et al 2017 liu et al 2016 ryu and lee 2016 showed that the struvite deposit better enhanced lettuce growth in comparison to commercial fertilizers through laboratory pot test and nutrients such as n p k ca and mg were abundantly measured in the vegetable tissue due to the multi nutrient supply by struvite application metals have a tendency to be persistent in the environment and can bioaccumulate in the food chain and thus there is a potential of contamination with toxic heavy metals on soil health and crop quality there are currently no legislative requirements with respect to the heavy metal content of struvite when applying as a fertilizer previous research has confirmed that struvite crystals retrieved from swine wastewater contained very low levels of heavy metals that were far below the legal limits liu et al 2011 muys et al 2021 reza et al 2019 the heavy metal application to soil can be reduced significantly when struvite was used as a fertilizer compared to the commercial fertilizers antonini et al 2012 ryu and lee 2016 for instance ryu and lee 2016 observed that the application of struvite resulted in less accumulation of hg pb cr and ni in vegetable tissue than commercial fertilizers a recent study showed that heavy metal contents in the struvite recovered from swine wastewater were lower than the korean standard limits of fertilizer and feedstock guidelines reza et al 2019 the analysis on the samples from 24 european struvite production plants showed that heavy metals content in the struvite were below the legal limits muys et al 2021 nevertheless in some occasion the contents of cu and zn were significantly high in the collected solids shen et al 2015 heavy metal contents in some struvite recovered even exceeded the legal limits for fertilizers li et al 2019 rahman et al 2014 therefore the research on the residues of heavy metals in struvite should be further processed to ensure its safe application in the future 3 potential adsorption mechanism of heavy metals the binding mechanisms by which metal elements interact with struvite have not been clearly clarified the adhesion mechanism of metal ions was mainly proceeding with electrostatic adsorption complexation and precipitation of oversaturated metal phases lu et al 2021 ma and rouff 2012 rouff 2012 rouff and juarez 2014 which were shown in fig 2 these aspects of the potential mechanism of metals interaction with struvite were illustrated recently using advanced spectroscopic analysis x ray photoelectron spectra x ray powder diffraction fourier transform infrared spectrometry scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometer system etc in the synthetic and practical wastewaters lu et al 2020 2021 rouff 2012 which mainly focused on cu zn pb as cr ion it is inferred that the adsorption mechanism largely depended on the initial metal elements concentration huang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 2021 rouff 2012 for cu and zn ions in the wastewater a prime interaction for the formation of cu oh cu po4 cu nh3 zn po4 and zn oh occurred on the surface of struvite at a low concentration of 0 1 10 mg l lu et al 2021 peng et al 2017 prohibiting the growth of struvite crystal at these specific sites however the ratio of cu oh cu po4 zn oh enhanced with their increasing concentration meaning that different adsorption mechanism occurred peng et al 2017 demonstrated that in the presence of cu2 concentrations from 200 to 800 mg l the newly generated cu oh 2 could adhere to struvite whereas with the increasing cu concentration more cu was entering into the crystal structure of struvite explaining the occurrence of the peak related to another copper compound cunh4po4 6h2o besides cu oh 2 lu et al 2020 revealed that at the low concentration 0 1 1 mg l most of the pb absorbed on the surface of struvite was amorphous forms pb oh and pb po4 bonds during the precipitation process in contrast with the pb concentration increased to above 10 mg l only 10 of pb occurred in the form of an amorphous phase and most of pb reacted with po4 at the alkaline conditions to form crystalline pb10 po4 6 oh 2 other studies also presented a similar point that more heavy metals were removed from solution at higher concentrations in the form of metal phosphate or metal hydroxide phases becoming increasingly oversaturated with a concentration based on speciation calculations rouff 2012 rouff and juarez 2014 in theory the possible adsorption forms are illustrated in fig 3 and the impurities in the struvite mainly include surface impurity interstitial impurity and substitutional impurity it means that metals are incorporated into the crystal lattice of struvite and sorbed to the surface of struvite or substituted with the original ion in struvite surface adsorption is the dominating incorporation mechanism at a low concentration of metals the hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and coordination bonding supported the ion interaction on the struvite surface through the comparison of struvite characterization before and after reaction peng et al 2018 tansel et al 2018 thereinto the newly generated amorphous particles might be adhered and grown to the surface of the struvite via hydrogen bonds peng et al 2016 which was the primary mechanism for surface adhesion while the electrostatic attraction was a secondary mechanism peng et al 2017 tansel et al 2018 at lower cu concentrations 1 10 mg l most of cu was also bonding with nh3 in the wastewater forming cu nh3 4 2 complex peng et al 2017 another study proposed that the proportion of amorphous zn3 po4 2 and zn oh 2 increased with an increase in the initial zn concentration from 0 to 150 mg l huang et al 2017 whereas heavy metals gathering to precipitate minerals was the dominant incorporation pattern with struvite at high concentrations of metals huang et al 2019 substitution with po4 nh4 and mg2 in the lattice of struvite by heavy metals was a common mechanism for metal precipitation in struvite products chand and agarwal 1991 lin et al 2013 peng et al 2018 rouff 2012 resulting in the change of struvite crystal morphology fig 3 the common site for substitution would be the mg site due to the similarity in ionic radii and covalent charge with cu zn pb as observed for the formation of znnh4po4 6h2o and cunh4po4 6h2o peng et al 2017 ravikumar et al 2010 obviously higher concentration also facilitated the precipitation of other minerals such as zn3 po4 2 h2o 4 zn4 po4 2 oh 2 h2o 3 zn oh 2 cuhpo4 cu h2po4 2 cu3 po4 2 cu5 po4 2 oh 4 mgnh4aso4 h2o 6 and cr oh 3 nh2o huang et al 2017 lu et al 2021 rouff 2012 wang et al 2020 however the critical concentration between adsorption and precipitation for each metal remains unknown their roles are likely dependent on the various conditions such as supersaturation ph ionic strength and chemical state of metals which to date have remained elusive interestingly supersaturation and ionic strength posed great effect on inhibiting the adsorption of as v on crystals for the adsorption mechanism was mainly induced by the bidentate inner sphere surface complexes and the electrostatic interaction between as v and struvite lin et al 2013 rouff et al 2016 whereas the co precipitation of as v on struvite was associated with the solution ph which would gradually be predominated as ph rise hong et al 2020 a more common fact is the coexistence of several metals in the wastewater and competitive binding of po4 among several metals will exist specifically the ratio of metal elements will dramatically affect the force types and their interaction with solid determining the percentage of amorphous and crystalline forms thus the final composition of precipitants will be complicated and be associated with their ratio and chemical properties li et al 2020 lu et al 2021 under identical condition the order of saturation index of cu zn phosphate or cu zn hydroxide is zn oh 2 cu oh 2 cu3 po4 2 3h2o zn3 po4 2 4h2o huang et al 2019 which can be used to explain the fact that amorphous precipitation like zn oh 2 and cu oh 2 mainly occurred at low concentration while mineral formation at high concentration the reaction mechanisms of heavy metals in the wastewater are greatly complicated and the difference in species properties determines the different adsorption mechanisms resulting in various formations of minerals in the struvite lu et al 2020 2021 rouff and juarez 2014 for instance the adsorption mechanism of cu and zn during p recovery process is different lu et al 2021 which might be related with the binding capacity of forming coordination compounds with nh3 in the wastewater and the saturation index of cu zn hydroxide or cu zn phosphate huang et al 2019 li et al 2020 rouff and juarez 2014 the initial metals concentration and oxidation state in wastewaters targeted for p recovery will dictate the final metal content the mechanism of sorption and impact on the struvite structure rouff 2012 lu et al 2021 described the potential mechanism based on the effect of individual and coexistence of cu and zn on the adsorption of heavy metals in struvite inferring that the mechanisms on metal interactions with struvite were mainly three pathways including adsorption individual precipitation and synergistic effect of several metals under various conditions overall the mechanism of heavy metals incorporation into struvite was summarized in fig 4 the driving force for the interaction of the metals with struvite included surface adsorption electrostatic adsorption complexation precipitation and the specific dominant force varied in response to the chemical composition of wastewater and reaction parameters at initial low concentration metal ions interacted with struvite by surface adsorption and electrostatic adsorption resulting in their adsorption on the surface of struvite crystals or precipitation of amorphous forms m oh and m po4 bonds fig 4 surface adsorption at this stage caused by these relatively lower initial concentrations of metals did not result in significant struvite morphological changes muryanto and bayuseno 2014 with the increasing metals concentration the percentage of adsorption mechanism decreased but crystalline precipitation during oversaturated metal phases increasing metal concentrations facilitated the precipitation of new minerals and substitution with po4 nh4 and mg2 resulting in a series of minerals and complexation compounds therefore higher heavy metal concentration makes slower kinetic of the struvite crystallization in terms of decreasing constant rate saidou et al 2015 leading to the decrease in the production of struvite the change of struvite crystal morphology and the impurity of struvite products arslanoglu 2019 rouff and juarez 2014 hong et al 2020 revealed that the crystal growth rate of struvite was substantially reduced by nearly 50 with the increasing as v concentration from 0 to 10 mg l the dominating force at low and high metal concentrations will both take part in metal interaction with struvite at the medium concentration still the boundary of this scope is unknown and varies with the element itself and specific crystallization conditions in turn the adsorption mechanism will affect the release rate of metals and nutrients after struvite containing metals are applied as fertilizer another worthwhile point is the difference in the adsorption of heavy metals on crystals during and after struvite crystallization those researchers focused on the removal of metals from wastewater using struvite concluded the adsorption process as surface adsorption and dissolution precipitation to produce the new minerals on the surface of struvite crystals arslanoglu 2019 peng et al 2018 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the study of arslanoglu 2019 showed that the primary mechanism governing the adsorption process of cu on struvite was weak interactions such as physical adsorption based on adsorption kinetics and isotherms in another study on the interaction of several kinds of heavy metals with struvite the results clearly evidenced the formation of cu oh 2 and growth on struvite surface suggesting the struvite functioned as heterogeneous nucleation templates for cu oh 2 through the tem images and eds mapping analysis tang et al 2019 rouff and juarez 2014 stated the difference in the zn interaction with and after struvite precipitation and concluded that a higher removal of zn from solution using struvite than that occurred during struvite precipitation which was attributed to the easy adsorption on the surface of struvite due to a large surface area of struvite crystals peng et al 2018 rouff 2012 they thought that mixed coordination bidentate complexes and tetrahedral monodentate surface adsorbates occurred in the presence of pre existing struvite whereas octahedrally coordinated adsorbates linked to the surface of struvite as a result at low concentrations higher metal removal was obtained during the adsorption with struvite but this difference is less pronounced at higher initial concentrations 4 methods to minimize the residues of heavy metals so far there is little research on how to minimize the heavy metal residues in struvite li et al 2020 the alternative pathways to control the heavy metal contents in struvite might be considered based on their interactions pathways of metals with struvite one possible method is to adjust the crystallization parameters to reduce the metals residues in crystals struvite formation and heavy metals residues are dependent on various conditions such as supersaturation ph oxidation state and ionic strength huang et al 2019 le corre et al 2009 lu et al 2020 2021 ma and rouff 2012 li et al 2020 observed that an increase in the initial solution ph of synthetic swine wastewater could significantly reduce the cu and zn co precipitation and their contents in the recovered struvite however both as iii and as v content in solid increased with the increasing ph from 8 0 to 10 0 and then decreased after continuous increasing ph ma and rouff 2012 thus the response of heavy metals to the solution ph was different for varied metal elements and various adjustments should be employed to obtain the struvite with fewer metals the chemical composition in wastewater might also affect the metals residues in struvite crystals particularly the molar ratio of mg nh4 po4 huang et al 2019 found when the nh4 po4 p molar ratio increased from 1 1 to 11 1 cr zn cu contents in struvite decreased from 10 6 10 6 8 to 7 4 3 1 0 82 mg g respectively the reason is that higher nh4 n concentration facilities the struvite crystallization due to higher ionic strength and more robust buffer capacity which can help to compete with heavy metals for po4 to form amorphous materials or coordination compounds therefore reducing their amount in the final precipitates arenas et al 2007 li et al 2020 as a consequence metal ions can be stably present and not co precipitate with struvite in comparison the ratio of mg p had much less effect on the reduction of heavy metals on struvite compared to solution ph huang et al 2019 rabinovich et al 2021 found that increasing mg concentration did not improve po4 p recovery as struvite but reduced the sorption of zn and fe with recovered solids besides dissolved organic matter not only affects the struvite formation in the wastewater but also impede the adsorption of heavy metals on struvite due to their complexation with metals wang et al 2019 however the suitable crystallization condition should be set for the composition of the heavy metals in the wastewater obtaining an acceptable struvite yield and less abundant of metals apart from adjusting the parameters numerous strategies are developed to control the metals concentration in the wastewater through pretreatment methods before struvite recovery lu et al 2021 shen et al 2015 previous researchers found that a strong association occurred between the heavy metal concentration with the suspended solids ss in wastewater chu et al 2018 suzuki et al 2007 heavy metals in the wastewater is inclined to adhere to these particles due to high specific surface area of suspended particles for instance chu et al 2018 measured that the heavy metals especially zn 97 0 and cu 96 8 in the swine wastewater were mainly distributed in the ss several techniques such as coagulation and precipitation ion exchange bio sorption and biological treatment have been proposed for reducing the heavy metals pollution in the wastewater chang et al 2006 fu and wang 2011 ma et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 during the struvite crystallization process flocculation can effectively remove the ss of wastewater and decrease the content of cu and zn in struvite precipitate from 130 and 400 mg kg to 53 and 152 mg kg respectively ma et al 2018 74 99 removal of cr at an initial concentration of 12 mg l can be achieved at an optimum coagulant dosage of 800 mg l song et al 2004 in contrast the biosorption methods using materials are time saving with high efficiency low cost and simple operation mobasherpour et al 2012 the study of zhao et al 2020 showed that the highest removal rates of cu ii and cd ii from wastewater were achieved with 96 8 and 78 respectively through adding sodium alginate at a liquid solid ratio of 12 5 ml g feasible methods for reducing the residues of heavy metals in struvite during crystallization process was listed in table 2 which also simply presented possible advantages and disadvantages accordingly a compromising stage between optimizing metal removal and the need for increasing p recovery during crystallization is required multiple variables controlling the removal efficiency of heavy metals could be optimized using modeling analysis the response surface methodology rsm could be used to optimize the reaction parameters to obtain a high removal of p and struvite purity during crystallization process kumari et al 2020 polat and sayan 2019 perwitasari et al 2018 found that through the optimization of rsm from the wastewater containing cu2 pb2 zn2 59 5 mg l of cu2 70 80 mg l of pb2 77 2 mg l of zn2 could be recovered from wastewater with an optimum struvite output of 8 34 mg respectively thus this method can provide a deep evaluation on the effect of an individual factor on metals interaction with struvite and identifies the optimum conditions for struvite recovery in real wastewater with the response in the least number of experimental runs 5 future perspectives the mechanisms of heavy metals interaction with struvite and their potential effect on the crystal properties are essential to consider there are certain limitations in terms of specific adsorption mechanisms for heavy metals in struvite and the optimization of reaction parameters for minimizing their contents in a solid product another worthwhile point is to clarify the time sequence on nucleation of struvite and adsorption and precipitation of heavy metals in the wastewater which is greatly associated with the ionic strength because their competitive interaction will determine the heavy metals residues and their composition although most researches were focusing on single metal elements at fixed conditions in reality two or more elements co existed in the practical wastewater and some other factors like suspended matter carbonate calcium ion in the wastewater will pose unknown synergistic effects on p reaction and heavy metals interaction with struvite heavy metals in the wastewater not only affect the crystallization kinetics and their residues in struvite pose potential environmental and health hazards to increase the product s ecological risk through the food chain li et al 2020 lu et al 2021 the effectiveness of struvite and commercial fertilizers is quite closely based on pilot and field experiments and majority of them proved that struvite recovered from the wastewater containing heavy metals was safe as a fertilizer for crop growth below the measurement limit or the legal limits ackerman et al 2013 liu et al 2016 ryu and lee 2016 peeva et al 2021 however the concern about the entry of various heavy metals in struvite into the human food chain has still occurred harmful metal elements in soil through the food chain has been proposed to pose potential impact on human health tóth et al 2016 the crop uptake of heavy metal contaminants and long term effect of applying struvite containing trace amounts of heavy metals has been poorly studied due to the lack of data of adequate detail and reliability even though the amount of heavy metals in struvite transferred to soil in a single application is very low or negligible shen et al 2015 uysal et al 2010 the long term application of such fertilizer might produce significant enrichment of metals in the soil posing negative effect on soil quality and human health jiao et al 2012 thus regulations should be proposed for the limits on maximum heavy metal concentrations permitted in struvite solid which will be essential for its large scale application in the future for instance it is feasible to use the allowance standards of heavy metals in fertilizers for reference to set the tolerance limits on the content of heavy metals in struvite furthermore the different adsorption forms in struvite may result in different risk of toxicity depending on the local conditions for the bioavailability of metals generally decreases with increasing ph organic matter content and clay content of soil mortvedt 1996 deep research on this aspect will be required to ensure the safe application of struvite in the long term and future investigation on the favorited application rate for various soil conditions is recommended the release rate of nutrients and heavy metals in the soil will generate a great deal of concern the highlight of the physical form of the fertilizer should also be emphasized when assessing the release properties of nutrients and pollutants from granulated or polymer coated struvite into the soil system given current fertilizer delivery systems powdered fertilizers are generally impractical whereas commercial fertilizers are commonly applied to soil in a granular form compared to soluble p fertilizers granular struvite has the advantage of minimizing p losses giving rise to less environmental concerns in high rainfall areas the reason is that it can provide a longer term source of p for crop growth which is more closely matching the crop s demand for p later in the growing season and increasing its use efficiency everaert et al 2017 liu et al 2011 talboys et al 2016 the p release kinetics and p availability of granulated struvite have recently been assessed by degryse et al 2017 who observed that the uptake of p by wheat was similar for mono ammonium phosphate and struvite when applied in powder form we measured the release and solubility of granulated struvite the diameter of 3 mm loaded with cu and zn and found that the release of heavy metals and nutrients will be still slow even in the pure water of ph 4 0 not published which might be attributed to the release of nh4 during the dissolution of struvite crystals in theory the solubility of pure struvite is low in water and soil however the low molecular weight organic acids such as oxalic citric malic and acetic acid produced from root exudates microbial metabolism and decomposition of soil organic matter might be conducive to the dissolution of nutrients in struvite to soil for the utilization of crop growth montiel rozas et al 2016 saerens et al 2021 however all these mentioned need further exploration furthermore the release properties of heavy metals and nutrients in the struvite will be related with the sorption mechanism for instance compared to mineral precipitation or substitutional impurities heavy metals with the surface adsorption species are susceptible to desorption in soil rouff et al 2006 which might be readily mobilized and toxic to plants and organisms ma and rouff 2012 based on the requirement of high quantities and containing a high p concentration the digested effluent from sewage sludge and animal manure is considered to be the leading resource research on the feasibility of recovering struvite from wastewater with heavy metals polluted and their corresponding life cycle assessment should be concentrated in the future a comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of struvite recovery processes is crucial to realize more closed p recycling for instance p recovery from wastewater will considerably reduce the discharge of p and lead to less eutrophication in the receiving aquatic environment le corre et al 2009 as well as the environmental pressure caused by exploring phosphate rock up to date a lack of research on product quality and unclear economic feasibility increases the risks for industrial scale applications struvite production from wastewater is presently undervalued the new european fertilizing products regulation will go into application in 2022 and when phosphate rock prices will rise resulting in a higher price of struvite as fertilizer in the market saerens et al 2021 6 conclusions the recovery of p from wastewater as struvite and its use as fertilizer introduces sustainability to the human p cycle conserving nonrenewable geologic p reserves and contributing significantly to closing the p cycle in the past decade researchers paid more attention to the adsorption of single or several metals on struvite and their potential mechanism during the crystallization process surface adsorption is the dominating incorporation mechanism at low concentrations of metals but increasing metal concentrations facilitated the precipitation of new minerals and decreases the percentage of physical adsorption high heavy metal concentration in the wastewater also makes slower kinetic of the struvite crystallization leading to a decrease in the struvite production and its impurity the effective strategies to reduce the metals residues in crystals is to adjust the crystallization parameters and to propose the pretreatment on wastewater with coagulation precipitation bio sorption before struvite formation the key point is the critical and acceptable amount of metals in struvite which is also associated with the risk evaluation of granulated struvite application on soil quality and crop safety in addition a comprehensive assessment of p recovery from wastewater is required to provide better support on the implication of struvite production and sell in the market declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16474,the objective of this study was to quantify potential mitigation of environmental impacts from the operation and construction of wastewater treatment plants wwtp from implementing specific design recommendations the study investigated small wwtps many of which are serving slow growing or declining populations life cycle assessment methodology was used to evaluate and compare the inventory and environmental impacts of nine small wwtp case studies detailed inventory data was collected from the facilities engineering design plans and utility bills one recommended practice was to avoid significant overdesign by planning for no lower than a 75 capacity utilization by the facilities end of life a theoretical correction to a 75 capacity utilization was estimated to mitigate 0 4 of lifetime electricity usage and 1 of secondary process concrete for every 1 reduction in design average flow rate relatedly a 0 4 mitigation in the carcinogenic and global warming impacts could be achieved for every 1 reduction in design average flow toward a 75 capacity utilization other suggested practices were focused on conveyance namely to minimize non process facility area and to use polyvinyl chloride pipe instead of ductile iron pipe where possible the latter practice was estimated to mitigate between 1 1 and 4 8 of the carcinogenic impact in the nine case studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords life cycle assessment wastewater treatment plant design small communities overdesign construction materials civil works 1 introduction in the global effort to minimize environmental impacts sustainability improvement opportunities are being investigated in many areas us epa 2020a us epa 2020b including municipal infrastructure wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a critical infrastructure for local regional and national sustainability in water resources although wwtps reduce environmental impacts related to water quality their construction and operation also result in environmental impacts the life cycle assessment lca methodology is an effective tool for comparing the environmental impacts of products and processes and has commonly been applied to evaluate the environmental performance of wwtps applying lca to investigate small wwtp systems serving communities with slow growing or declining populations is merited because these systems constitute a majority of wastewater systems in the united states us epa 2012 small wwtps are defined as systems serving communities with populations of less than 10 000 and an average daily flow of less than 3785 4 m3 us epa 2016 according to the clean watersheds needs survey cwns small systems make up 80 of centralized wastewater treatment systems in the united states in four states nebraska kansas iowa montana small systems constitute more than 95 as of 2012 there were 11 571 small systems in the country there are an estimated 746 new wwtps to be built between 2012 and 2032 of the 746 new wwtps 614 will be small systems and of these 470 will serve communities with populations of fewer than 1000 people an estimated 5 5 billion is needed for the construction of these 614 facilities which will serve approximately 1 1 million people us epa 2012 small systems also constitute a majority of the systems in other countries such as switzerland where 690 out of 967 facilities served a population equivalent pe of less than 10 000 doka 2003 besides the fact that they constitute the majority of wwtps an important reason to investigate small systems is the economy of scale in infrastructure facilities that treat lower flow rates were shown to use more energy per unit flow in the united states hanna et al 2018 and australia de haas and dancey 2015 one likely reason is that these smaller facilities often size their aeration equipment to treat high flows projected 20 years into the future unlike larger facilities small facilities often lack the financial and technical capability for controls that allow for varying power output that accommodate the current flow rate thompson et al 2020 additionally in a lci analysis using wwtps in switzerland class 5 wwtps pe 30 2000 were shown to use more material infrastructure per m3 of treated wastewater than class 1 pe 100 000 wwtps doka 2003 many of the communities outside of larger metropolitan regions that are served by small systems are experiencing slow growing or declining populations often resulting in overdesigned systems according to usda county population data 28 of u s non metro counties have grown less than 10 between 2010 and 2019 while 67 experienced a decline in population usda 2020 despite this many communities often design their wwtps for highly increasing populations which is generally considered good practice because of the higher safety factor another reason for overdesigning is the build it and they will come mentality that assumes the population is more likely to increase if the infrastructure is designed to handle the growth kdhe 1999 in a discussion with wastewater design engineers it was learned that some communities design for population growth even when the population has been decreasing in the past ten years suggesting that overdesign is often an active choice rather than an error in population projection this practice of overdesigning results in more material inventory lower energy efficiency and consequently higher construction operation costs and environmental impact it is worth investigating how much construction material electricity and associated environmental impacts can be reduced from avoiding significant overdesign there is already financial incentive to reduce facility energy use as electricity makes up one of the highest operational costs at small wwtps however many facilities struggle to improve their energy efficiency due to the high capital costs of implementing energy saving technologies such as vfds and scada systems rather than investigating this effective but expensive approach of retrofitting the recommendation to avoid overdesign at the design phase may save cost and environmental impact both for construction and operation the degree of overdesign can be represented by the capacity utilization cu which is the ratio of the recorded daily average flow rate to the design average daily flow rate in this study a facility is classified as overdesigned if its projected cu at design year based on current population trends is under 100 fig 1 shows the current cu of small nebraska wwtps based on recorded flow rates over the past three years from the u s epa s enforcement and compliance history online echo tool us epa 2020c and design flow rates taken from hanna et al 2018 out of 96 facilities 12 are operating over 100 cu 84 are under 100 cu and 75 of those 84 are under 75 cu of the 12 facilities exceeding a 100 cu eight have wastewater generation rates higher than one standard deviation from the average 0 625 m3 capita day this suggests that the high cu is not due to unexpected spikes in population growth rather it is due to other reasons such as significant inflow and infiltration i i or a high industrial load higher flows from i i will increase the hydraulic load at a wwtp however even if the high cu cases in fig 1 are due to i i the flows are likely still lower than the design daily peak flows which are typically around 300 500 of the design daily average flow for small facilities qasim 2017 the agencies in nebraska that provides low interest loans and grants consider average flow rates above 0 45 m3 capita day to merit evaluation of eliminating i i from their collection system as a first step before considering additions to a treatment plant ndee 2021 further many facilities have two basins each designed to handle the plant s entire flow on its own for redundancy health research inc 2014 therefore there is already an implicit overdesign that adds an extra safety factor to prevent exceeding hydraulic capacity in any case rather than overdesigning a facility to accommodate for i i it is encouraged that the problem be addressed at its source by improving collection systems ndee 2020b 2021 this study only includes design decisions within the wwtp itself and does not investigate collection systems in assessing the environmental impact of wwtps both the construction phase and the operation phase should be considered in several reviews of wwtp lca studies the construction phase was considered in less than half 22 out of 45 studies corominas et al 2013 22 of studies nguyen et al 2020a and 14 out of 43 studies gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 however several studies that included the construction phase concluded that it contributed a significant portion of the impact profile 29 4 42 7 in total environmental load ortiz et al 2007 11 in the climate change category renou et al 2008 almost 20 in the human toxicity and fossil depletion categories morera et al 2017 and 27 in the carcinogenic human health category moussavi et al 2021 further the construction phase will likely become more significant in the relative impact profile as the electricity grid transitions from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources polruang et al 2018 construction inventories that correlate strongly with flow rate include concrete and reinforcing steel morera et al 2020 which have also been identified as major contributing inventories in several construction phase impact categories morera et al 2017 nguyen et al 2020b factors contributing to environmental impact but not strongly correlated with flow rate include over design represented by cu aluminum and iron moussavi et al 2021 therefore there is potential for reducing the impact from these non flow rate related factors further research is needed to identify and quantify design practices that reduce a wwtp s environmental impact by focusing on these factors the focus of this study was narrowed to the extended aeration ea and oxidation ditch od configurations because of their prevalence in nebraska small communities of the 110 wwtps studied in a benchmarking study 52 were od or ea 28 were conventional activated sludge cas 16 were sequencing batch reactor sbr and 14 were other hanna et al 2018 the ea and od configurations are very similar with the main difference being the biological reactor ea facilities use a basin aerated by diffusers while od facilities have a racetrack shaped basin where wastewater is circulated and aerated by rotors because of their similarities these configurations are analyzed as one category rather than comparing them to each other this study aims to investigate practical design recommendations for small wwtps that reduce materials and environmental impacts related to piping and overdesign the objective of the study is to quantify the potential environmental impact mitigations based on trends seen among the case studies nine case studies are included in this research whereas past wwtp lci lca studies that included the construction phase investigated only one morera et al 2017 two nguyen et al 2020b or four morera et al 2020 case studies other novelties of this study include i its focus on small facilities serving slow growing or declining populations ii a detailed construction inventory based on engineering design plans and utility bills iii a finer breakdown of the treatment process into 10 elements and iv a discussion of practical design practices that reduce environmental impacts rather than simply identifying significant factors 2 methodology the lca method was used to evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of nine small wwtps the study includes both the construction phase using detailed inventory data from design plans and the operation phase based on the facilities utility bills design engineers and operators were consulted to identify good general design practices and related limitations or disadvantages the potential inventory and impact mitigations associated with implementing these practices were then estimated using trends seen among the nine case studies 2 1 selection of case studies the small wwtps in this study were selected based on the following criteria i represent a range of at least one order of magnitude in design flow ii have been constructed or modified after 2001 to still be operating within a 20 year design life iii are an ea or od type facility and iv have readily accessible utility bills and construction inventory data table 4 1 summarizes the facility types populations u s census bureau 2020 average recorded flow rates us epa 2020c design parameters construction year and most recent modification year ndee 2020a of the nine facilities in the study according to the population data many of these communities appear to have deliberately overestimated their population growth and the facilities will likely still be overdesigned by design year table 1 2 2 lca framework the iso 14 040 14 044 standards were used to ensure a valid comparison between the lci lca results of the nine facilities iso 2006 the four phases outlined in the iso standards are goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation 2 2 1 goal and scope definition the goal of this study was to investigate design recommendations for small ea od wwtps that reduce environmental impact from iron piping and overdesign and to quantify the associated potential impact mitigations the functional unit used was the wastewater treated throughout 20 years of operation based on the design average daily flow rate if a facility underwent modifications the most recent design average flow was used although using the recorded average flow rate is useful to compare operational phase impacts the material inventories from civil works and equipment are based on design flow rather than actual operational flow additionally because many of these systems do not include controls on their aeration equipment for varying output depending on actual flow rates the design flow may be an appropriate functional unit for the operational phase as well the system boundary included two phases construction and operation in the construction phase the foreground data collected included civil works and equipment within a facility s fenced area in the operation phase water soil and air emissions from operation were excluded from the analysis for two reasons first many of these facilities only record water and soil emission data annually and do not record air emissions at all if these were to be accounted for they would have to be extrapolated based on single annual samples or estimated using multipliers from literature which would result in high uncertainty second this study focuses on reducing electricity and construction inventory by addressing overdesign without affecting the effluent quality these changes are expected to have little effect on emissions based on data seen among more than 90 similarly sized facilities see fig s 8 in the si appendix for these reasons the operation phase was simplified to only include the electricity usage over the design life end of life impacts were beyond this study s system boundaries and were therefore excluded from this analysis the facilities in this study are still in operation therefore no end of life procedures or budgets were available the study only focuses on reducing inventory in the construction phase which also implies less impact for the end of life phase no matter which end of life practice is chosen retrofitting demolition etc 2 2 2 inventory analysis the electricity usage in the operation phase was estimated based on utility bills obtained either from the community s records or from the utility provider the mean design life for the facilities in this study was 20 years based on the facilities design documents to estimate the lifetime electricity usage in the operation phase the average annual electricity usage of each facility based on the utility bills of recent years was multiplied by a design life of 20 years the material inventory data were collected from the facilities engineering design plans and construction budgets obtained from the nebraska department of environment and energy s public records search ndee 2020a the data were simplified by reducing all inventory to 20 general representative inventories for example although there are different mixtures and water contents of concrete all concrete was represented by one general concrete type the 20 general inventories were the same as a past study with similar objectives moussavi et al 2021 an accurate accounting of reinforcing steel would be complicated and labor intensive instead the amount of reinforcing steel was estimated using a multiplier of 77 6 kg of reinforcing steel per m3 of concrete foley et al 2010 for material transport an average distance of 40 km was assumed consistent with two past wwtp lca studies morera et al 2017 moussavi et al 2021 equipment such as pumps and motors were broken down into cast iron steel aluminum copper and rubber which were estimated by their equipment nameplate power draw based on various environmental product declarations epd to address the multiple sub processes of wwtps past studies divided the lci lcia into five process elements morera et al 2017 nguyen et al 2020b this study divided the lci into ten process elements lift station pre treatment biological reactor clarifier disinfection sludge digestion sludge handling conveyance buildings and other auxiliary inventories the sludge handling element included sludge storage or dewatering after sludge digestion the conveyance element included manholes piping fittings and valves between processes starting from the headworks to the effluent manhole the other auxiliary element included pavement fences aluminum stairs and walkways and outdoor potable water piping using this approach process elements that have highly variable unit impacts among facilities could be identified and the facilities that perform environmentally well in those specific process elements could be examined for good design practices this was especially useful for the conveyance element which many past studies simply grouped into other major process elements even though it may be highly variable between facilities further not all facilities include all process elements and therefore could not be compared to each other as entire systems for example some plants do not have an on site lift station it is fairer to break down the comparison by process element although this may mean less data points for some elements e g only 7 data points for the lift station element 2 2 3 impact assessment an lca database is needed to account for all the background processes that go into the production of one unit of foreground inventory data the ecoinvent 3 4 database was selected for this study because of its high score in scope transparency comprehensiveness and update recency martínez rocamora et al 2016 and because it was used in two past studies with similar methodologies morera et al 2017 moussavi et al 2021 simapro v8 was the program used to convert inventory to impact selected for its robustness compliance with iso 14 040 and inclusion of the ecoinvent database the ten impact categories from the tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts version 2 1 traci 2 1 were used as the output metrics because of their relevance to the united states environmental regulations bare 2011 2 3 estimating potential impact mitigations the environmental impacts of the facilities were then analyzed by process element to determine which element had high impact and high impact variability the impact variability was measured by the coefficient of variation based on this analysis and a discussion with design engineers three suggested practices were identified 1 to minimize non process facility area 2 to use polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe instead of ductile iron piping dip where possible and 3 to avoid significant overdesign the potential impact mitigation associated with implementing these design recommendations were quantified using the following procedures the conveyance element accounted for all process piping fittings and valves as well as manholes diversion structures and flow control structures on site this is a critical component of the wastewater treatment system which is directly impacted by how the process basins are laid out pipe materials seen within the sample set include dip pvc and vitrified clay pipe vcp to show conveyance impact savings associated with optimizing layout the relationship between a facility s total unit piping length was plotted against its non process area non process area was defined as the area that is not occupied by a biological reactor clarifier or sludge digestion basin both the total area and non process areas were measured by aerial measurements from google earth and provided in the supplementary information si appendix to show conveyance impact savings associated with using pvc instead of dip the inventory spreadsheets of each facility were adjusted to replace some pipe lengths with pvc instead of dip the impact profile of the adjusted piping was compared to the original a conservative approach was taken that did not include adjusting the fittings limitations of pvc application were considered based on discussions with local operators and design engineers namely that it cannot be used for i raw influent piping due to their large diameters and connection to the sewer ii air piping due to pressure requirements iii sludge piping due to difficulties that may arise with the sludge pumps and iv any length of pipe with a parallel pathway within 1 5 m of a structure or basin due to pvcs low external load to estimate the amount of savings associated with addressing overdesign two models were used first the nine facilities in this study were used to determine the relationship between secondary process construction inventory to the design average flow this relationship was used to estimate inventories at other design flow rates by interpolation then a model that estimates nebraska small wwtp annual electricity usage was used to determine the potential mitigation in electricity usage from correcting for overdesign hanna et al 2018 the model used data from 85 small facilities and identified several significant variables including average flow rate sludge digestion process type sludge dewatering process type influent bod5 climate controlled floor area and cu to determine the effects of overdesign in this study s facilities all variables were kept constant except for the cu the potential electricity mitigation from addressing cu would come from using more appropriately sized equipment this is especially important for small communities which often lack control systems for modulating equipment output in response to changing facility conditions e g dissolved oxygen controls on aeration equipment thompson et al 2020 it is important to emphasize that the estimated electricity usage mitigations are not based on specific investigations into sizing new equipment for each specific facility but rather based on a model by hanna et al 2018 that was developed using data from more than 90 small facilities including the facilities in this study using this statistical benchmarking model for estimating energy use by capacity utilization is not a representation of what would occur in retrofitting a facility but rather the average energy savings anticipated when designing a new facility that is similar in every way except sized ideally same average flow rate but smaller design flow rate therefore better capacity utilization the corrected design average flow rates to achieve a 75 cu are summarized in table s 20 in the si appendix 3 results and discussion a reduction in resource inventory will result in reductions in all traci environmental impact categories however for simplicity only two categories were selected as representative impacts to present the results carcinogenic impact and global warming impact the average traci impacts of the nine wwtps are illustrated in fig 2 first divided by the treated flow over design life so that they can be compared to each other then normalized by annual u s emissions ryberg et al 2014 the carcinogenic impact in comparative toxic units ctu was selected as a representative impact because it was the dominant category at 3 97 10 12 ctu m3 ctu year although the global warming category was only the 7th most impactful category after normalization it was also selected as a representative impact because of the prevalence of climate change in the global conversation in sustainability for example almost all wwtp lca studies include climate change as a factor corominas et al 2013 and one study had climate change as the only impact factor ortiz et al 2007 the impact profile shows that the construction phase contributed an average of 32 range 15 42 and 10 range 4 14 of the overall impact in the carcinogenic and global warming categories respectively because many past wwtp lca studies did not use traci2 1 impact categories it was difficult to compare the carcinogenic human health impact to literature however the result of 31 falls within the range of one past study s general construction contribution of 29 4 42 7 to total environmental load ortiz et al 2007 climate change is a very common category in wwtp lca studies the 10 construction contribution in climate change found in this study is similar to some past studies that found it to be 11 renou et al 2008 8 moussavi et al 2021 and 8 morera et al 2017 more results by past studies in different impact categories are provided in figs s 4 and s 5 in the si appendix 3 1 construction phase impacts fig 3 summarizes the construction phase impacts of the nine facilities in the sample broken down by the ten process elements the black bar represents the 50th percentile and the top and bottom of the gray box represent the 75th and 25th percentile respectively the uv disinfection and post digestion sludge handling columns contain less than nine data points because not all facilities included these processes in their treatment in the carcinogenic category the conveyance and biological reactor elements contributed the highest average impacts at 5 6e 09 and 4 6e 09 ctu m3 respectively the biological reactor impact had low variability among facilities coefficient of variation 21 while the conveyance element had high variability coefficient of variation 73 in the global warming category the biological reactor stood out as the highest impact contributing element at an average impact of 0 015 kgco2eq m3 with a 17 coefficient of variation among facilities in the carcinogenic category reinforcing steel was the inventory most responsible for the biological reactor impact 65 average contribution and ductile iron piping dip was most responsible for the conveyance impact 93 average contribution in the global warming category concrete was the inventory most responsible for the biological reactor impact at an average contribution of 48 these results suggest that opportunities for significant construction phase impact mitigations will most likely be found in the biological reactor and conveyance elements and more specifically in reducing concrete reinforcing steel and ductile iron piping in these process elements 3 2 conveyance lci and lca mitigation opportunities the conveyance element had the highest contribution to the carcinogen impact mostly from dip and also had the highest impact variability between plants the plants with the lowest conveyance construction impact were examined to determine the reason for the low impact from this two impact reduction opportunities were identified 1 minimize facility non process area and 2 use pvc pipe instead of dip where possible based on the nine facilities in the study fig 4 shows the relationships of conveyance piping unit length to non process facility area and associated carcinogenic impact to non process facility area although there are only nine data points the plots suggest that lower non process area is correlated with less total pipe length r2 0 87 and consequently less carcinogenic impact r2 0 71 one suggested practice is to minimize the facility s non process area to the extent possible this can be done by placing the process basins closer together requiring less piping of the 9 case studies plant e had the highest non process area and consequently the highest unit piping length and associated carcinogen impact plant e s unit carcinogen impact associated with piping was more than 533 than that of plant c which had the lowest unit non process area although there are many reasons for variability in non process area this suggests that optimizing the facility layout is worth considering in design to reduce inventory and impact several advantages and disadvantages of this practice were identified from discussions with small wwtp operators and design engineers one advantage is that the saved unused land area can be used in future process additions or facility expansions depending on the topography of the area another potential advantage would be the improved hydraulics due to shorter distances between processes one potential disadvantage is more difficult design and construction for the piping due to less working space further if the basins are too close to each other future maintenance and construction that requires large vehicles on site will be more difficult with dip identified as the largest contributor to construction phase carcinogenic impact the second suggested practice was to use pvc pipe instead of dip where possible the production of pvc has been shown to have significantly lower impact than dip hajibabaei et al 2018 vahidi et al 2015 however this finding is only true for lower diameter pipes because as pvc pipe diameter increases the pipe thickness increases significantly at diameters larger than 72 cm pvc production has a higher impact than dip in the global warming impact category du et al 2013 in a discussion with local wastewater engineers it was learned that pvc piping application in small wwtp is typically limited to a range of 10 to 30 cm diameter pipes fig 5 compares the environmental impacts of dip and schedule 80 pvc pipe production from 10 to 36 cm diameters in this range pvc pipe production has higher impact than dip in only 2 out of 10 impact categories in the acidification category pvc impact is higher than dip at diameters larger than 15 cm in the fossil fuel depletion category pvc is higher than dip for the full diameter range in discussions with small wwtp operators and design engineers the advantages besides less environmental impact and limitations of pvc pipe compared to dip pipe were identified advantages of pvc include its lighter weight ease of installation due to easy cutting lower cost corrosion resistance and a smooth surface without additional lining or coating awwa 2020 further the higher smoothness of pvc compared to dip may reduce energy use in pumping operations due to less friction loss du et al 2013 several limitations of pvc application were briefly discussed in section 2 3 and more comprehensively discussed in the awwa s m23 manual awwa 2020 considering these limitations of pvc application much of the facilities dip inventory was substituted with pvc in the calculations to estimate how much environmental impact could theoretically have been avoided if this had been done the suggested practice showed up to a potential 4 8 reduction in the carcinogenic impact and no noticeable changes less than 1 in the other impact categories 3 3 lci and lca mitigation opportunities from addressing overdesign unlike the conveyance process element which had high impact variability between facilities the secondary process basins biological reactors and clarifiers had a low degree of variability this is likely because the design of these secondary process closely follows technical standards and structural requirements based on design flow rates health research inc 2014 for this reason it is difficult to identify design based impact reduction opportunities that are consistent with current design standards instead impact reduction opportunities can be achieved in the planning stage where the design average flow rate itself is decided using the inventory of the nine facilities in the sample a strong relationship was seen between the secondary process concrete m3 and excavation m3 with the design average flow m3 shown in fig 6 changing the units of concrete from cubic meters to kilograms the x axis from lifetime flow treated m3 to design flow rate m3 day and adjusting the y intercept in fig 6 allowed for a comparison with a recent study that also investigated the relationship between secondary process basin lci and design flow morera et al 2020 the referenced study found a slope of 1100 kg of secondary process concrete per m3 of treated wastewater per day while this study found a slope of 776 both studies show a strong relationship between construction inventory and design average flow the differences in the slopes of the equations are assumed to be due to the different size range of the facilities between the studies in the study by morera et al 2020 the relationship was based on four facilities with flow rates between 1500 and 21 000 m3 day whereas in this study the relationship was based on nine facilities with flow rates between 625 and 6815 m3 day using the equations from fig 6 the amount of concrete could be estimated for the facilities if they were designed for a lower average flow rate that more closely reflects the actual flow using the regression model from a nebraska wwtp energy benchmarking study hanna et al 2018 the potential percent electricity usage mitigation from correcting for overdesign was estimated and applied to the nine wwtps in the study based on these two models fig 7 summarizes the percent mitigations in 20 year electricity usage and secondary process concrete lci if the facilities had been designed to operate at a 75 cu assuming the current population is reflective of the end of life population the cu of 75 was chosen arbitrarily as a reasonable operating condition that still allows for some population growth the gray x axis represents the facilities current cu while the black x axis shows the percent reduction in design flow associated with an increase from the current cu to 75 for example plant i is currently operating at a cu of 51 and its population has only grown 2 in the past 10 years if plant i had been designed to currently operate at a 75 cu that would mean a 32 6 reduction in design average flow and would result in 10 0 and 33 2 mitigations in 20 year electricity usage and secondary process concrete as compared to the existing plant conditions respectively generally for every percent increase in cu toward 75 a 0 4 and 1 1 decrease in lifetime electricity usage and secondary process concrete can be achieved respectively secondary process reinforcing steel was estimated based on the concrete and the mitigation will be proportional to the concrete estimates the same figure done for secondary process excavation is provided in the si appendix using the potential lci mitigations in these four inventories concrete reinforcing steel excavation 20 year electricity usage the potential lca mitigations were calculated for the carcinogenic and global warming impact categories and summarized in fig 8 for example plant i is currently operating at a 51 cu gray x axis and experiencing a very slow population growth if the design average flow rate had been decreased by 32 6 black x axis so that the facility would be operating at 75 cu savings of 9 8 and 10 6 would have been achieved in the life cycle carcinogenic and global warming impact categories respectively generally for every percent increase in cu toward 75 a 0 36 and 0 40 mitigation can be achieved in the carcinogenic and global warming impacts respectively in summary sizing facilities for a slower population growth that reflects actual population trends results in a reduction in inventory and consequently a reduction in life cycle environmental impacts the material inventory mitigations also imply cost reductions which is a more immediate deciding factor for the communities 3 4 limitations several data limitations and uncertainties exist in the methods of this study there is uncertainty associated with using the model by hanna et al 2018 to estimate electricity usage associated with overdesign as cu is only one variable in the model other variables used to estimate a wwtp s annual electricity usage were kept constant such as the inclusion of certain sludge treatments or climate controlled floor area all of which may change as well with the correction in overdesign the estimates are not an actual representation of what would occur within a specific facility that downsizes as that would require modeling individual facilities at the unit process level rather the model was used to estimate the relative energy savings anticipated when designing a new facility that is similar in every way except with a lower design average flow rate there is also uncertainty with the relationship used to estimate the construction materials associated with overdesign the graph only included nine case studies which does not achieve statistical significance further the wwtps in the set only represent the basic extended aeration and oxidation ditch configurations in nebraska the benefits from the suggested practices are expected to apply to all process types and in all regions but the amounts of impact mitigation may be different this study did not include air soil and water emissions which may be significant contributors to some impact categories such as eutrophication or non carcinogenic human health pollutants however it was assumed that changes in the capacity utilization of a facility does not significantly affect its water quality this assumption is supported by fig s 8 in the si which shows that effluent quality parameters such as carbonaceous biological oxygen demand total suspended solids and ammonia do not change significantly among plants with varying capacity utilizations limitations in the construction phase accounting include i all inventory was reduced to 20 lines of general representative inventory ii multipliers from literature were used to estimate reinforcing steel and material transport distances iii there were several smaller inventories that could not be accounted for such as pipe supports thrust blocks bulbs and access hatches refer to table s 4 in the si and iv in determining the degree of overdesign the actual average flow rates were based on annual recorded flows for the past 2 4 years but assumed to be representative over the facility s life consideration of the sensitivities and uncertainties of background data is another key limitation of the study as some results may be sensitive to such data assumptions for example variability in emissions associated with local cast iron production and recycling rates may have impacts related to pipe replacement with pvc energy generation sourcing and emission specific rates of local electricity production is another major background process that results could be sensitive to and contribute to uncertainties however collecting data to support such an analysis would require significant data to help accurately inform its effect and this was beyond the scope of this study 4 conclusion this study explored three design practices for small wwtps that provide an opportunity for reduced inventory use and associated environmental impacts designing for a smaller and denser facility layout generally reduces required piping and associated environmental impact non process area is correlated with less total pipe length r2 0 87 and consequently less carcinogenic impact r2 0 71 production of pvc results in less environmental impact than dip in all impact categories except for acidification and fossil fuel depletion in one case study using pvc instead of dip where possible was estimated to result in a 4 8 mitigation in the wwtp s life cycle carcinogenic impact including both construction and electricity usage avoiding the active choice of significant overdesign can lead to mitigations in lifetime electricity usage secondary process concrete and the associated environmental impacts this practice was estimated to mitigate 0 4 of lifetime electricity usage and 1 of secondary process concrete for every percent reduction in design average flow toward a 75 capacity utilization relatedly a 0 4 mitigation in the carcinogenic and global warming impacts could be achieved for every percent reduction

16474,the objective of this study was to quantify potential mitigation of environmental impacts from the operation and construction of wastewater treatment plants wwtp from implementing specific design recommendations the study investigated small wwtps many of which are serving slow growing or declining populations life cycle assessment methodology was used to evaluate and compare the inventory and environmental impacts of nine small wwtp case studies detailed inventory data was collected from the facilities engineering design plans and utility bills one recommended practice was to avoid significant overdesign by planning for no lower than a 75 capacity utilization by the facilities end of life a theoretical correction to a 75 capacity utilization was estimated to mitigate 0 4 of lifetime electricity usage and 1 of secondary process concrete for every 1 reduction in design average flow rate relatedly a 0 4 mitigation in the carcinogenic and global warming impacts could be achieved for every 1 reduction in design average flow toward a 75 capacity utilization other suggested practices were focused on conveyance namely to minimize non process facility area and to use polyvinyl chloride pipe instead of ductile iron pipe where possible the latter practice was estimated to mitigate between 1 1 and 4 8 of the carcinogenic impact in the nine case studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords life cycle assessment wastewater treatment plant design small communities overdesign construction materials civil works 1 introduction in the global effort to minimize environmental impacts sustainability improvement opportunities are being investigated in many areas us epa 2020a us epa 2020b including municipal infrastructure wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a critical infrastructure for local regional and national sustainability in water resources although wwtps reduce environmental impacts related to water quality their construction and operation also result in environmental impacts the life cycle assessment lca methodology is an effective tool for comparing the environmental impacts of products and processes and has commonly been applied to evaluate the environmental performance of wwtps applying lca to investigate small wwtp systems serving communities with slow growing or declining populations is merited because these systems constitute a majority of wastewater systems in the united states us epa 2012 small wwtps are defined as systems serving communities with populations of less than 10 000 and an average daily flow of less than 3785 4 m3 us epa 2016 according to the clean watersheds needs survey cwns small systems make up 80 of centralized wastewater treatment systems in the united states in four states nebraska kansas iowa montana small systems constitute more than 95 as of 2012 there were 11 571 small systems in the country there are an estimated 746 new wwtps to be built between 2012 and 2032 of the 746 new wwtps 614 will be small systems and of these 470 will serve communities with populations of fewer than 1000 people an estimated 5 5 billion is needed for the construction of these 614 facilities which will serve approximately 1 1 million people us epa 2012 small systems also constitute a majority of the systems in other countries such as switzerland where 690 out of 967 facilities served a population equivalent pe of less than 10 000 doka 2003 besides the fact that they constitute the majority of wwtps an important reason to investigate small systems is the economy of scale in infrastructure facilities that treat lower flow rates were shown to use more energy per unit flow in the united states hanna et al 2018 and australia de haas and dancey 2015 one likely reason is that these smaller facilities often size their aeration equipment to treat high flows projected 20 years into the future unlike larger facilities small facilities often lack the financial and technical capability for controls that allow for varying power output that accommodate the current flow rate thompson et al 2020 additionally in a lci analysis using wwtps in switzerland class 5 wwtps pe 30 2000 were shown to use more material infrastructure per m3 of treated wastewater than class 1 pe 100 000 wwtps doka 2003 many of the communities outside of larger metropolitan regions that are served by small systems are experiencing slow growing or declining populations often resulting in overdesigned systems according to usda county population data 28 of u s non metro counties have grown less than 10 between 2010 and 2019 while 67 experienced a decline in population usda 2020 despite this many communities often design their wwtps for highly increasing populations which is generally considered good practice because of the higher safety factor another reason for overdesigning is the build it and they will come mentality that assumes the population is more likely to increase if the infrastructure is designed to handle the growth kdhe 1999 in a discussion with wastewater design engineers it was learned that some communities design for population growth even when the population has been decreasing in the past ten years suggesting that overdesign is often an active choice rather than an error in population projection this practice of overdesigning results in more material inventory lower energy efficiency and consequently higher construction operation costs and environmental impact it is worth investigating how much construction material electricity and associated environmental impacts can be reduced from avoiding significant overdesign there is already financial incentive to reduce facility energy use as electricity makes up one of the highest operational costs at small wwtps however many facilities struggle to improve their energy efficiency due to the high capital costs of implementing energy saving technologies such as vfds and scada systems rather than investigating this effective but expensive approach of retrofitting the recommendation to avoid overdesign at the design phase may save cost and environmental impact both for construction and operation the degree of overdesign can be represented by the capacity utilization cu which is the ratio of the recorded daily average flow rate to the design average daily flow rate in this study a facility is classified as overdesigned if its projected cu at design year based on current population trends is under 100 fig 1 shows the current cu of small nebraska wwtps based on recorded flow rates over the past three years from the u s epa s enforcement and compliance history online echo tool us epa 2020c and design flow rates taken from hanna et al 2018 out of 96 facilities 12 are operating over 100 cu 84 are under 100 cu and 75 of those 84 are under 75 cu of the 12 facilities exceeding a 100 cu eight have wastewater generation rates higher than one standard deviation from the average 0 625 m3 capita day this suggests that the high cu is not due to unexpected spikes in population growth rather it is due to other reasons such as significant inflow and infiltration i i or a high industrial load higher flows from i i will increase the hydraulic load at a wwtp however even if the high cu cases in fig 1 are due to i i the flows are likely still lower than the design daily peak flows which are typically around 300 500 of the design daily average flow for small facilities qasim 2017 the agencies in nebraska that provides low interest loans and grants consider average flow rates above 0 45 m3 capita day to merit evaluation of eliminating i i from their collection system as a first step before considering additions to a treatment plant ndee 2021 further many facilities have two basins each designed to handle the plant s entire flow on its own for redundancy health research inc 2014 therefore there is already an implicit overdesign that adds an extra safety factor to prevent exceeding hydraulic capacity in any case rather than overdesigning a facility to accommodate for i i it is encouraged that the problem be addressed at its source by improving collection systems ndee 2020b 2021 this study only includes design decisions within the wwtp itself and does not investigate collection systems in assessing the environmental impact of wwtps both the construction phase and the operation phase should be considered in several reviews of wwtp lca studies the construction phase was considered in less than half 22 out of 45 studies corominas et al 2013 22 of studies nguyen et al 2020a and 14 out of 43 studies gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 however several studies that included the construction phase concluded that it contributed a significant portion of the impact profile 29 4 42 7 in total environmental load ortiz et al 2007 11 in the climate change category renou et al 2008 almost 20 in the human toxicity and fossil depletion categories morera et al 2017 and 27 in the carcinogenic human health category moussavi et al 2021 further the construction phase will likely become more significant in the relative impact profile as the electricity grid transitions from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources polruang et al 2018 construction inventories that correlate strongly with flow rate include concrete and reinforcing steel morera et al 2020 which have also been identified as major contributing inventories in several construction phase impact categories morera et al 2017 nguyen et al 2020b factors contributing to environmental impact but not strongly correlated with flow rate include over design represented by cu aluminum and iron moussavi et al 2021 therefore there is potential for reducing the impact from these non flow rate related factors further research is needed to identify and quantify design practices that reduce a wwtp s environmental impact by focusing on these factors the focus of this study was narrowed to the extended aeration ea and oxidation ditch od configurations because of their prevalence in nebraska small communities of the 110 wwtps studied in a benchmarking study 52 were od or ea 28 were conventional activated sludge cas 16 were sequencing batch reactor sbr and 14 were other hanna et al 2018 the ea and od configurations are very similar with the main difference being the biological reactor ea facilities use a basin aerated by diffusers while od facilities have a racetrack shaped basin where wastewater is circulated and aerated by rotors because of their similarities these configurations are analyzed as one category rather than comparing them to each other this study aims to investigate practical design recommendations for small wwtps that reduce materials and environmental impacts related to piping and overdesign the objective of the study is to quantify the potential environmental impact mitigations based on trends seen among the case studies nine case studies are included in this research whereas past wwtp lci lca studies that included the construction phase investigated only one morera et al 2017 two nguyen et al 2020b or four morera et al 2020 case studies other novelties of this study include i its focus on small facilities serving slow growing or declining populations ii a detailed construction inventory based on engineering design plans and utility bills iii a finer breakdown of the treatment process into 10 elements and iv a discussion of practical design practices that reduce environmental impacts rather than simply identifying significant factors 2 methodology the lca method was used to evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of nine small wwtps the study includes both the construction phase using detailed inventory data from design plans and the operation phase based on the facilities utility bills design engineers and operators were consulted to identify good general design practices and related limitations or disadvantages the potential inventory and impact mitigations associated with implementing these practices were then estimated using trends seen among the nine case studies 2 1 selection of case studies the small wwtps in this study were selected based on the following criteria i represent a range of at least one order of magnitude in design flow ii have been constructed or modified after 2001 to still be operating within a 20 year design life iii are an ea or od type facility and iv have readily accessible utility bills and construction inventory data table 4 1 summarizes the facility types populations u s census bureau 2020 average recorded flow rates us epa 2020c design parameters construction year and most recent modification year ndee 2020a of the nine facilities in the study according to the population data many of these communities appear to have deliberately overestimated their population growth and the facilities will likely still be overdesigned by design year table 1 2 2 lca framework the iso 14 040 14 044 standards were used to ensure a valid comparison between the lci lca results of the nine facilities iso 2006 the four phases outlined in the iso standards are goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation 2 2 1 goal and scope definition the goal of this study was to investigate design recommendations for small ea od wwtps that reduce environmental impact from iron piping and overdesign and to quantify the associated potential impact mitigations the functional unit used was the wastewater treated throughout 20 years of operation based on the design average daily flow rate if a facility underwent modifications the most recent design average flow was used although using the recorded average flow rate is useful to compare operational phase impacts the material inventories from civil works and equipment are based on design flow rather than actual operational flow additionally because many of these systems do not include controls on their aeration equipment for varying output depending on actual flow rates the design flow may be an appropriate functional unit for the operational phase as well the system boundary included two phases construction and operation in the construction phase the foreground data collected included civil works and equipment within a facility s fenced area in the operation phase water soil and air emissions from operation were excluded from the analysis for two reasons first many of these facilities only record water and soil emission data annually and do not record air emissions at all if these were to be accounted for they would have to be extrapolated based on single annual samples or estimated using multipliers from literature which would result in high uncertainty second this study focuses on reducing electricity and construction inventory by addressing overdesign without affecting the effluent quality these changes are expected to have little effect on emissions based on data seen among more than 90 similarly sized facilities see fig s 8 in the si appendix for these reasons the operation phase was simplified to only include the electricity usage over the design life end of life impacts were beyond this study s system boundaries and were therefore excluded from this analysis the facilities in this study are still in operation therefore no end of life procedures or budgets were available the study only focuses on reducing inventory in the construction phase which also implies less impact for the end of life phase no matter which end of life practice is chosen retrofitting demolition etc 2 2 2 inventory analysis the electricity usage in the operation phase was estimated based on utility bills obtained either from the community s records or from the utility provider the mean design life for the facilities in this study was 20 years based on the facilities design documents to estimate the lifetime electricity usage in the operation phase the average annual electricity usage of each facility based on the utility bills of recent years was multiplied by a design life of 20 years the material inventory data were collected from the facilities engineering design plans and construction budgets obtained from the nebraska department of environment and energy s public records search ndee 2020a the data were simplified by reducing all inventory to 20 general representative inventories for example although there are different mixtures and water contents of concrete all concrete was represented by one general concrete type the 20 general inventories were the same as a past study with similar objectives moussavi et al 2021 an accurate accounting of reinforcing steel would be complicated and labor intensive instead the amount of reinforcing steel was estimated using a multiplier of 77 6 kg of reinforcing steel per m3 of concrete foley et al 2010 for material transport an average distance of 40 km was assumed consistent with two past wwtp lca studies morera et al 2017 moussavi et al 2021 equipment such as pumps and motors were broken down into cast iron steel aluminum copper and rubber which were estimated by their equipment nameplate power draw based on various environmental product declarations epd to address the multiple sub processes of wwtps past studies divided the lci lcia into five process elements morera et al 2017 nguyen et al 2020b this study divided the lci into ten process elements lift station pre treatment biological reactor clarifier disinfection sludge digestion sludge handling conveyance buildings and other auxiliary inventories the sludge handling element included sludge storage or dewatering after sludge digestion the conveyance element included manholes piping fittings and valves between processes starting from the headworks to the effluent manhole the other auxiliary element included pavement fences aluminum stairs and walkways and outdoor potable water piping using this approach process elements that have highly variable unit impacts among facilities could be identified and the facilities that perform environmentally well in those specific process elements could be examined for good design practices this was especially useful for the conveyance element which many past studies simply grouped into other major process elements even though it may be highly variable between facilities further not all facilities include all process elements and therefore could not be compared to each other as entire systems for example some plants do not have an on site lift station it is fairer to break down the comparison by process element although this may mean less data points for some elements e g only 7 data points for the lift station element 2 2 3 impact assessment an lca database is needed to account for all the background processes that go into the production of one unit of foreground inventory data the ecoinvent 3 4 database was selected for this study because of its high score in scope transparency comprehensiveness and update recency martínez rocamora et al 2016 and because it was used in two past studies with similar methodologies morera et al 2017 moussavi et al 2021 simapro v8 was the program used to convert inventory to impact selected for its robustness compliance with iso 14 040 and inclusion of the ecoinvent database the ten impact categories from the tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts version 2 1 traci 2 1 were used as the output metrics because of their relevance to the united states environmental regulations bare 2011 2 3 estimating potential impact mitigations the environmental impacts of the facilities were then analyzed by process element to determine which element had high impact and high impact variability the impact variability was measured by the coefficient of variation based on this analysis and a discussion with design engineers three suggested practices were identified 1 to minimize non process facility area 2 to use polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe instead of ductile iron piping dip where possible and 3 to avoid significant overdesign the potential impact mitigation associated with implementing these design recommendations were quantified using the following procedures the conveyance element accounted for all process piping fittings and valves as well as manholes diversion structures and flow control structures on site this is a critical component of the wastewater treatment system which is directly impacted by how the process basins are laid out pipe materials seen within the sample set include dip pvc and vitrified clay pipe vcp to show conveyance impact savings associated with optimizing layout the relationship between a facility s total unit piping length was plotted against its non process area non process area was defined as the area that is not occupied by a biological reactor clarifier or sludge digestion basin both the total area and non process areas were measured by aerial measurements from google earth and provided in the supplementary information si appendix to show conveyance impact savings associated with using pvc instead of dip the inventory spreadsheets of each facility were adjusted to replace some pipe lengths with pvc instead of dip the impact profile of the adjusted piping was compared to the original a conservative approach was taken that did not include adjusting the fittings limitations of pvc application were considered based on discussions with local operators and design engineers namely that it cannot be used for i raw influent piping due to their large diameters and connection to the sewer ii air piping due to pressure requirements iii sludge piping due to difficulties that may arise with the sludge pumps and iv any length of pipe with a parallel pathway within 1 5 m of a structure or basin due to pvcs low external load to estimate the amount of savings associated with addressing overdesign two models were used first the nine facilities in this study were used to determine the relationship between secondary process construction inventory to the design average flow this relationship was used to estimate inventories at other design flow rates by interpolation then a model that estimates nebraska small wwtp annual electricity usage was used to determine the potential mitigation in electricity usage from correcting for overdesign hanna et al 2018 the model used data from 85 small facilities and identified several significant variables including average flow rate sludge digestion process type sludge dewatering process type influent bod5 climate controlled floor area and cu to determine the effects of overdesign in this study s facilities all variables were kept constant except for the cu the potential electricity mitigation from addressing cu would come from using more appropriately sized equipment this is especially important for small communities which often lack control systems for modulating equipment output in response to changing facility conditions e g dissolved oxygen controls on aeration equipment thompson et al 2020 it is important to emphasize that the estimated electricity usage mitigations are not based on specific investigations into sizing new equipment for each specific facility but rather based on a model by hanna et al 2018 that was developed using data from more than 90 small facilities including the facilities in this study using this statistical benchmarking model for estimating energy use by capacity utilization is not a representation of what would occur in retrofitting a facility but rather the average energy savings anticipated when designing a new facility that is similar in every way except sized ideally same average flow rate but smaller design flow rate therefore better capacity utilization the corrected design average flow rates to achieve a 75 cu are summarized in table s 20 in the si appendix 3 results and discussion a reduction in resource inventory will result in reductions in all traci environmental impact categories however for simplicity only two categories were selected as representative impacts to present the results carcinogenic impact and global warming impact the average traci impacts of the nine wwtps are illustrated in fig 2 first divided by the treated flow over design life so that they can be compared to each other then normalized by annual u s emissions ryberg et al 2014 the carcinogenic impact in comparative toxic units ctu was selected as a representative impact because it was the dominant category at 3 97 10 12 ctu m3 ctu year although the global warming category was only the 7th most impactful category after normalization it was also selected as a representative impact because of the prevalence of climate change in the global conversation in sustainability for example almost all wwtp lca studies include climate change as a factor corominas et al 2013 and one study had climate change as the only impact factor ortiz et al 2007 the impact profile shows that the construction phase contributed an average of 32 range 15 42 and 10 range 4 14 of the overall impact in the carcinogenic and global warming categories respectively because many past wwtp lca studies did not use traci2 1 impact categories it was difficult to compare the carcinogenic human health impact to literature however the result of 31 falls within the range of one past study s general construction contribution of 29 4 42 7 to total environmental load ortiz et al 2007 climate change is a very common category in wwtp lca studies the 10 construction contribution in climate change found in this study is similar to some past studies that found it to be 11 renou et al 2008 8 moussavi et al 2021 and 8 morera et al 2017 more results by past studies in different impact categories are provided in figs s 4 and s 5 in the si appendix 3 1 construction phase impacts fig 3 summarizes the construction phase impacts of the nine facilities in the sample broken down by the ten process elements the black bar represents the 50th percentile and the top and bottom of the gray box represent the 75th and 25th percentile respectively the uv disinfection and post digestion sludge handling columns contain less than nine data points because not all facilities included these processes in their treatment in the carcinogenic category the conveyance and biological reactor elements contributed the highest average impacts at 5 6e 09 and 4 6e 09 ctu m3 respectively the biological reactor impact had low variability among facilities coefficient of variation 21 while the conveyance element had high variability coefficient of variation 73 in the global warming category the biological reactor stood out as the highest impact contributing element at an average impact of 0 015 kgco2eq m3 with a 17 coefficient of variation among facilities in the carcinogenic category reinforcing steel was the inventory most responsible for the biological reactor impact 65 average contribution and ductile iron piping dip was most responsible for the conveyance impact 93 average contribution in the global warming category concrete was the inventory most responsible for the biological reactor impact at an average contribution of 48 these results suggest that opportunities for significant construction phase impact mitigations will most likely be found in the biological reactor and conveyance elements and more specifically in reducing concrete reinforcing steel and ductile iron piping in these process elements 3 2 conveyance lci and lca mitigation opportunities the conveyance element had the highest contribution to the carcinogen impact mostly from dip and also had the highest impact variability between plants the plants with the lowest conveyance construction impact were examined to determine the reason for the low impact from this two impact reduction opportunities were identified 1 minimize facility non process area and 2 use pvc pipe instead of dip where possible based on the nine facilities in the study fig 4 shows the relationships of conveyance piping unit length to non process facility area and associated carcinogenic impact to non process facility area although there are only nine data points the plots suggest that lower non process area is correlated with less total pipe length r2 0 87 and consequently less carcinogenic impact r2 0 71 one suggested practice is to minimize the facility s non process area to the extent possible this can be done by placing the process basins closer together requiring less piping of the 9 case studies plant e had the highest non process area and consequently the highest unit piping length and associated carcinogen impact plant e s unit carcinogen impact associated with piping was more than 533 than that of plant c which had the lowest unit non process area although there are many reasons for variability in non process area this suggests that optimizing the facility layout is worth considering in design to reduce inventory and impact several advantages and disadvantages of this practice were identified from discussions with small wwtp operators and design engineers one advantage is that the saved unused land area can be used in future process additions or facility expansions depending on the topography of the area another potential advantage would be the improved hydraulics due to shorter distances between processes one potential disadvantage is more difficult design and construction for the piping due to less working space further if the basins are too close to each other future maintenance and construction that requires large vehicles on site will be more difficult with dip identified as the largest contributor to construction phase carcinogenic impact the second suggested practice was to use pvc pipe instead of dip where possible the production of pvc has been shown to have significantly lower impact than dip hajibabaei et al 2018 vahidi et al 2015 however this finding is only true for lower diameter pipes because as pvc pipe diameter increases the pipe thickness increases significantly at diameters larger than 72 cm pvc production has a higher impact than dip in the global warming impact category du et al 2013 in a discussion with local wastewater engineers it was learned that pvc piping application in small wwtp is typically limited to a range of 10 to 30 cm diameter pipes fig 5 compares the environmental impacts of dip and schedule 80 pvc pipe production from 10 to 36 cm diameters in this range pvc pipe production has higher impact than dip in only 2 out of 10 impact categories in the acidification category pvc impact is higher than dip at diameters larger than 15 cm in the fossil fuel depletion category pvc is higher than dip for the full diameter range in discussions with small wwtp operators and design engineers the advantages besides less environmental impact and limitations of pvc pipe compared to dip pipe were identified advantages of pvc include its lighter weight ease of installation due to easy cutting lower cost corrosion resistance and a smooth surface without additional lining or coating awwa 2020 further the higher smoothness of pvc compared to dip may reduce energy use in pumping operations due to less friction loss du et al 2013 several limitations of pvc application were briefly discussed in section 2 3 and more comprehensively discussed in the awwa s m23 manual awwa 2020 considering these limitations of pvc application much of the facilities dip inventory was substituted with pvc in the calculations to estimate how much environmental impact could theoretically have been avoided if this had been done the suggested practice showed up to a potential 4 8 reduction in the carcinogenic impact and no noticeable changes less than 1 in the other impact categories 3 3 lci and lca mitigation opportunities from addressing overdesign unlike the conveyance process element which had high impact variability between facilities the secondary process basins biological reactors and clarifiers had a low degree of variability this is likely because the design of these secondary process closely follows technical standards and structural requirements based on design flow rates health research inc 2014 for this reason it is difficult to identify design based impact reduction opportunities that are consistent with current design standards instead impact reduction opportunities can be achieved in the planning stage where the design average flow rate itself is decided using the inventory of the nine facilities in the sample a strong relationship was seen between the secondary process concrete m3 and excavation m3 with the design average flow m3 shown in fig 6 changing the units of concrete from cubic meters to kilograms the x axis from lifetime flow treated m3 to design flow rate m3 day and adjusting the y intercept in fig 6 allowed for a comparison with a recent study that also investigated the relationship between secondary process basin lci and design flow morera et al 2020 the referenced study found a slope of 1100 kg of secondary process concrete per m3 of treated wastewater per day while this study found a slope of 776 both studies show a strong relationship between construction inventory and design average flow the differences in the slopes of the equations are assumed to be due to the different size range of the facilities between the studies in the study by morera et al 2020 the relationship was based on four facilities with flow rates between 1500 and 21 000 m3 day whereas in this study the relationship was based on nine facilities with flow rates between 625 and 6815 m3 day using the equations from fig 6 the amount of concrete could be estimated for the facilities if they were designed for a lower average flow rate that more closely reflects the actual flow using the regression model from a nebraska wwtp energy benchmarking study hanna et al 2018 the potential percent electricity usage mitigation from correcting for overdesign was estimated and applied to the nine wwtps in the study based on these two models fig 7 summarizes the percent mitigations in 20 year electricity usage and secondary process concrete lci if the facilities had been designed to operate at a 75 cu assuming the current population is reflective of the end of life population the cu of 75 was chosen arbitrarily as a reasonable operating condition that still allows for some population growth the gray x axis represents the facilities current cu while the black x axis shows the percent reduction in design flow associated with an increase from the current cu to 75 for example plant i is currently operating at a cu of 51 and its population has only grown 2 in the past 10 years if plant i had been designed to currently operate at a 75 cu that would mean a 32 6 reduction in design average flow and would result in 10 0 and 33 2 mitigations in 20 year electricity usage and secondary process concrete as compared to the existing plant conditions respectively generally for every percent increase in cu toward 75 a 0 4 and 1 1 decrease in lifetime electricity usage and secondary process concrete can be achieved respectively secondary process reinforcing steel was estimated based on the concrete and the mitigation will be proportional to the concrete estimates the same figure done for secondary process excavation is provided in the si appendix using the potential lci mitigations in these four inventories concrete reinforcing steel excavation 20 year electricity usage the potential lca mitigations were calculated for the carcinogenic and global warming impact categories and summarized in fig 8 for example plant i is currently operating at a 51 cu gray x axis and experiencing a very slow population growth if the design average flow rate had been decreased by 32 6 black x axis so that the facility would be operating at 75 cu savings of 9 8 and 10 6 would have been achieved in the life cycle carcinogenic and global warming impact categories respectively generally for every percent increase in cu toward 75 a 0 36 and 0 40 mitigation can be achieved in the carcinogenic and global warming impacts respectively in summary sizing facilities for a slower population growth that reflects actual population trends results in a reduction in inventory and consequently a reduction in life cycle environmental impacts the material inventory mitigations also imply cost reductions which is a more immediate deciding factor for the communities 3 4 limitations several data limitations and uncertainties exist in the methods of this study there is uncertainty associated with using the model by hanna et al 2018 to estimate electricity usage associated with overdesign as cu is only one variable in the model other variables used to estimate a wwtp s annual electricity usage were kept constant such as the inclusion of certain sludge treatments or climate controlled floor area all of which may change as well with the correction in overdesign the estimates are not an actual representation of what would occur within a specific facility that downsizes as that would require modeling individual facilities at the unit process level rather the model was used to estimate the relative energy savings anticipated when designing a new facility that is similar in every way except with a lower design average flow rate there is also uncertainty with the relationship used to estimate the construction materials associated with overdesign the graph only included nine case studies which does not achieve statistical significance further the wwtps in the set only represent the basic extended aeration and oxidation ditch configurations in nebraska the benefits from the suggested practices are expected to apply to all process types and in all regions but the amounts of impact mitigation may be different this study did not include air soil and water emissions which may be significant contributors to some impact categories such as eutrophication or non carcinogenic human health pollutants however it was assumed that changes in the capacity utilization of a facility does not significantly affect its water quality this assumption is supported by fig s 8 in the si which shows that effluent quality parameters such as carbonaceous biological oxygen demand total suspended solids and ammonia do not change significantly among plants with varying capacity utilizations limitations in the construction phase accounting include i all inventory was reduced to 20 lines of general representative inventory ii multipliers from literature were used to estimate reinforcing steel and material transport distances iii there were several smaller inventories that could not be accounted for such as pipe supports thrust blocks bulbs and access hatches refer to table s 4 in the si and iv in determining the degree of overdesign the actual average flow rates were based on annual recorded flows for the past 2 4 years but assumed to be representative over the facility s life consideration of the sensitivities and uncertainties of background data is another key limitation of the study as some results may be sensitive to such data assumptions for example variability in emissions associated with local cast iron production and recycling rates may have impacts related to pipe replacement with pvc energy generation sourcing and emission specific rates of local electricity production is another major background process that results could be sensitive to and contribute to uncertainties however collecting data to support such an analysis would require significant data to help accurately inform its effect and this was beyond the scope of this study 4 conclusion this study explored three design practices for small wwtps that provide an opportunity for reduced inventory use and associated environmental impacts designing for a smaller and denser facility layout generally reduces required piping and associated environmental impact non process area is correlated with less total pipe length r2 0 87 and consequently less carcinogenic impact r2 0 71 production of pvc results in less environmental impact than dip in all impact categories except for acidification and fossil fuel depletion in one case study using pvc instead of dip where possible was estimated to result in a 4 8 mitigation in the wwtp s life cycle carcinogenic impact including both construction and electricity usage avoiding the active choice of significant overdesign can lead to mitigations in lifetime electricity usage secondary process concrete and the associated environmental impacts this practice was estimated to mitigate 0 4 of lifetime electricity usage and 1 of secondary process concrete for every percent reduction in design average flow toward a 75 capacity utilization relatedly a 0 4 mitigation in the carcinogenic and global warming impacts could be achieved for every percent reduction
