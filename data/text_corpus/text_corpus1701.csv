8505,study region the south asia study focus this paper presents future climate and runoff projections for the south asia region under the rcp8 5 scenario with climate change informed by 42 cmip5 gcms runoff is projected for 0 5 grids using hydrological models with future climate inputs obtained by empirically scaling the historical climate series new hydrological insights the modelling results indicate that future runoff will increase throughout most of the region except in the far north east and far north west the median projection shows increases in mean annual runoff of 20 30 in the indian sub continent for 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 the change in runoff is driven mainly by the change in precipitation moderated in wetter futures or intensified in drier futures by higher temperature and potential evaporation the paper also investigates the uncertainties of the projection due to scaling methods and selection of gcms the difference in runoff projections from different scaling methods is small relative to the large uncertainty in precipitation projections from the gcms sub selecting only the better performing gcms shows marginal difference in the uncertainty range of projected runoff for the broad scale projections presented here it is best to use projections informed by all the gcms to provide an indication of the full uncertainty range keywords climate change projections runoff precipitation water security south asia 1 introduction water security in south asia will be under increasing stress owing to socio economic growth and global climate change it is forecasted that the population in south asia will be more than 2 3 billion by 2050 united nations 2015 the growth of population and expanding economies will result in an increase in water demand meanwhile there is strong evidence that many parts of south asia are experiencing long term warming trends that will continue into the future hijioka et al 2014 the changes in climate will have significant impacts on water availability moreover the warmer future climate will increase evapotranspiration and hence increase demand for water in irrigated agriculture urban centres and water dependent ecosystems exacerbated by climate change it is estimated that water scarcity could cost up to 6 gdp loss in south asia by 2050 world bank 2016 as water impacts practically all sectors people agriculture industries and ecosystems there have been considerable research efforts on predicting or projecting water availability under future climate conditions e g devkota and gyawali 2015 gupta and deshpande 2004 immerzeel et al 2010 immerzeel and bierkens 2012 nepal and shrestha 2015 to inform the development of effective adaptation options for south asia most studies of hydrological response to climate change only investigate limited regions and climate scenarios for example akhtar et al 2008 simulated the hydrological response to climate change for three river basins astore gilgit and hunza in the upper indus using two downscaling approaches driven by the hadam3p gcm one of the downscaling approaches was a form of statistical downscaling using the delta change approach and another was dynamical downscaling using the precis regional climate model at 25 km resolution lutz et al 2014 assessed potential changes of water availability for the large basins in northern south asia with increased runoff projected for 2050 for the upper ganges brahmaputra salween and mekong primarily due to projected precipitation increases and for the indus due to accelerated glacier melt in the upper basin the hydrological response to climate change is generally predicted using downscaled future climate projections to drive a hydrological model chiew et al 2009a teng et al 2012a one of the key challenges in factoring climate change into water resources management lies in the uncertainty in the projections jiménez cisneros et al 2014 lopez et al 2009 the sources of the projection uncertainties could be from the gcms the downscaling approaches or the hydrological models chen et al 2011 teng et al 2012b vetter et al 2016 the performance of gcms over the south asia region have been investigated by quite a few researchers e g chaturvedi et al 2012 freychet et al 2015 jourdain et al 2013 ogata et al 2014 palazzi et al 2015 saha et al 2014 for example saha et al 2014 found that the majority of the cmip5 gcms fail to simulate the post 1950 decreasing trend of indian summer monsoon rainfall as they did not capture the weakening monsoon associated with the warming of southern indian ocean and strengthening of cyclonic formation in the tropical western pacific ocean some studies have suggested placing more weight on or using only projections from the better performing gcms as noted by palazzi et al 2015 however it is challenging in selecting better performing gcms for the region as none of gcms can reproduce all the salient features e g seasonal and annual rainfall amounts distribution and trend or the large scale atmospheric oceanic drivers of rainfall in the region like the gcms the latest dynamic downscaling runs in the cordex regional climate model experiments also do not capture the observed monsoon precipitation trends or the correct magnitude of observed warming ghimire et al 2015 mishra et al 2014 in any case the uncertainty in climate projections from gcms and from downscaling approaches must be adequately represented within the specific context and objectives of any hydrological modelling and integrated water resources management study this paper aims to present future climate precipitation temperature and potential evaporation and runoff projections across south asia and the associated uncertainties and robustness of the projections from different considerations or treatments of climate change projections and hydrological modelling the future runoff is projected using hydrological models with future climate inputs informed by 42 gcms reported in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 ipcc 2013 the paper investigates i the sensitivity of runoff to changes in the climate variables ii the projected runoff change resulting from different hydrological modelling approaches iii the projected runoff change using different empirical downscaling approaches iv the uncertainties of runoff projection within and across the gcms and v whether using a sub set of the better performing gcms can reduce the uncertainties in the projection the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 outlines the data and methods used section 3 presents and discusses the projected changes in the climate variables across south asia section 4 presents the climate change impacts on runoff and water supply security and also discusses results and implications from different modelling considerations section 5 presents the summary and conclusions 2 data and methods in this study the south asia region refers to the domain between 5 25 38 00 n and 65 25 93 75 e to facilitate presentation and discussion of results nine sub regions based on the freshwater ecoregion map of abell et al 2008 are used the nine sub regions as shown in fig 1 are north west region nw part of the tibetan plateau tp indus river basin ind ganges brahmaputra river basin ga part of the arakan coast ac narmad tapti river basin nt deccan plateau dp ghats coast gh and sri lanka island sl 2 1 baseline observations and cmip5 database the baseline period of 1976 2005 is used for this study baseline present and historical are used interchangeably throughout the paper they all refer to the period 1976 2005 the daily gridded climate data of precipitation temperature wind speed air pressure and radiation are obtained from the princeton global forcing pgf dataset with spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 sheffield et al 2006 fig 1 shows the annual mean of precipitation temperature potential evaporation and aridity index for the baseline period across the south asia region the precipitation and temperature comes directly from the pgf dataset potential evaporation is estimated from the pgf climate variables using morton s formulation of wet environment or equilibrium or areal potential evaporation morton 1983 chiew and mcmahon 1991 aridity index is defined as mean annual potential evaporation divided by mean annual precipitation the future climate scenarios are derived from the cmip5 database http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 which archives transient climate experiments from more than 20 climate modelling groups around the world all the ensemble runs of 42 cmip5 gcms with both historical and future outputs available on 15 march 2013 the same date as that adopted by ipcc ar5 are used here the results presented in this study are for a future period over 2046 2075 relative to the baseline period 1976 2005 for rcp8 5 high representative greenhouse gas concentration pathway corresponding to radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 by 2100 relative to pre industrial value see moss et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 it is worth noting that the discussions and results presented throughout this paper are applicable for any future global warming pathway or scenario but the projected changes would be smaller for lower rcps like rcp4 5 rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 2 2 empirical downscaling of gcm climate variables downscaling is the process of translating or modelling the coarse resolution outputs from gcms to catchment scale climate that is required for impact adaptation vulnerability studies and hydrological modelling there are three types of downscaling approaches fowler et al 2007 chen et al 2011 ekström et al 2015 1 empirical downscaling or change factor method which applies the change informed by gcms for a future period relative to a baseline period to perturb the baseline observations to reflect a future climate 2 statistical downscaling which develops a statistical relationship between gcm atmospheric variables and observed climate variables and then use this relationship to derive future climate variables from future gcm variables and 3 dynamical downscaling where regional climate models rcms are used kumar et al 2013 to model the physical atmospheric and land surface processes at smaller spatial scale informed or constrained by a larger scale gcm many downscaling comparisons have been conducted chen et al 2011 fowler et al 2007 and generally conclude that no single downscaling method is better and this is largely because like gcms different downscaling methods are tailored for different applications chiew et al 2010 found that results from empirical downscaling typically lie within the range of other regionally available statistical and dynamical downscaling methods frost et al 2011 recommends using empirical downscaling methods for regional water resource planning applications due principally to the method s robustness this study therefore uses empirical scaling to scale the baseline climate observations informed by gcm outputs for a future period relative to the baseline period to reflect a future climate zheng et al 2015 for the empirical downscaling here the scaling factor for precipitation and potential evaporation is estimated as 1 s f x f x h where xf and xh are the gcm simulation for the future 2046 2075 and baseline 1976 2005 periods respectively once derived the scaling factor is then used to scale the baseline climate observations 1976 2005 to produce a future climate time series as the gcms spatial resolutions are different to the observations and different gcms have different spatial resolutions the scaling factors derived for each of the gcms are resampled to match with the 0 5 x 0 5 grid in princeton dataset in eq 1 if xf and xh are annual means then the scaling approach is defined as annual scaling where all the daily values of precipitation or potential evaporation in the 30 year baseline period 1976 2005 are scaled by this single annual scaling factor to provide a 30 year future 2046 2075 daily precipitation or potential evaporation series most of the results presented here describing runoff sensitivity to climate inputs section 4 1 and comparing different modelling approaches section 4 2 are for annual scaling the study here in section 4 3 also explores the difference in runoff projection where the climate variables in the different seasons are scaled by factors estimated separately for the different seasons seasonal scaling and where daily precipitation amounts or percentiles are scaled differently daily scaling in the seasonal scaling the original seasonal scaling factors are firstly estimated for each of the four seasons dec jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov informed by the gcm outputs these factors are then rescaled such that the eventual future climate series has the same change to that from annual scaling approach at the mean annual level the rescaled seasonal scaling factors are estimated as 2 s f i s f i s f a x h s f i x h i where sfi and sfi are the original and rescaled seasonal scaling factors for season i respectively sfa is the annual scaling factor and xh i is the observed baseline mean for season i the daily scaling is carried out only for precipitation mainly to reflect potentially different climate change impact signal in the higher daily precipitation intensity here for each season 53 daily scaling factors are calculated representing the changes in the highest 50 daily precipitation values as reflected by the gcm and changes in the average of the 51 100th daily precipitation values 101 200th daily precipitation values and 200th onward daily precipitation values similar to the rescaling of seasonal factors the original daily scaling factors derived from the gcms are rescaled for each season to ensure the seasonal change is the same when the corresponding rescaled seasonal scaling factor is used the annual scaling therefore uses a single factor to scale all the baseline daily precipitation or potential evaporation to reflect a future climate the seasonal scaling uses four different factors to scale the precipitation or potential evaporation in the different seasons the daily scaling scales the daily precipitation in accordance with 53 4 scaling factors the rescaling procedure mentioned above ensures that the change in mean annual precipitation or potential evapotranspiration in the annual scaling seasonal scaling and daily scaling are the same as reflected by the gcm at the mean annual scale and allows results from the different empirical scaling methods to be directly compared the intention here is not to find the best method but to explore potential uncertainties owing to different empirical scaling treatments to obtain the future climate series different to precipitation and potential evaporation the scaling factor of temperature is defined as the absolute change of temperature and is expressed as 3 s f t f t h where tf and th are the gcm simulated annual seasonal mean daily temperature for the future and baseline periods respectively both annual and seasonal scaling factors of temperature are derived herein in the above empirical scaling methods the future daily climate sequence is the same as the baseline climate sequence scaled by different factors the annual seasonal and daily empirical scaling are applied to precipitation for temperature and potential evaporation only the annual and seasonal scaling are applied to explore climate change impact on water supply reliability in section 2 4 and section 4 4 the potential change in future climate sequence is also considered here a quantile mapping bias correction approach is used where the gcm daily precipitation value at a given percentile rank in the baseline period is matched to the observed daily precipitation value at the princeton 0 5 grid at the same percentile rank and this relationship is then used to translate the future gcm daily precipitation series to an 0 5 grid future daily precipitation series this quantile mapping bias correction is processed as 4 x f u t f o b s 1 f h i s x f u t where fobs is the cumulative distribution function of the historical observation fhis is the cumulative distribution function of the historical gcm simulation xfut is the future daily gcm precipitation value and x fut is the future 0 5 grid precipitation value the cumulative distribution function is considered separately for each of the four seasons and only precipitation amounts greater than 0 01 mm are considered like in the empirical scaling methods the future precipitation series here is rescaled such that the change in seasonal means are the same as those in the empirical seasonal scaling and the change in the annual mean is the same as that in the empirical annual scaling it should be noted that the distribution of daily precipitation simulated by gcms can be very different to the distribution of observed daily precipitation daily precipitation is smaller in gcms and there are more rain days in gcms and the quantile mapping bias correction can introduce large errors and artificially corrupt future gcm projected trends and characteristics hay and clark 2003 maraun 2013 piani et al 2010 2 3 modelling climate change impact on runoff the climate change impact on runoff presented and discussed in various parts of section 4 come from three sources 1 direct simulations from the gcms 2 budyko relationship estimates for the future relative to the baseline using annual means with scaling factors of precipitation and potential evaporation and 3 h08 hydrological modelling for the future relative to the baseline using daily climate inputs with scaling factors of precipitation and temperature the similarities and differences in the runoff projections from the different sources and methods are explored the budyko relationship budyko 1974 is the most widely used equation to describe basin or regional scale long term energy and water balance oudin et al 2008 sivapalan et al 2003 teng et al 2012b zhang et al 2004 the budyko relationship is commonly presented as 5 e p ϕ t a n h 1 ϕ 1 exp ϕ 1 2 ϕ p e t p where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration p is the mean annual precipitation pet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and ø is the aridity index over a long enough time period several years the mean annual runoff q can be estimated from the above equation as the difference between mean annual precipitation and mean annual actual evaporation q p e this simple budyko relationship is remarkably robust for estimating large scale energy and water balance and has been used in literally thousands of studies including adaptations to account for landscape features particularly vegetation and for local conditions and to represent sub annual and inter annual time scales in this study the simple basic budyko relationship above is used to directly estimate the baseline 1976 2005 and future 2046 2075 mean annual runoffs from mean annual values of precipitation and potential evaporation the h08 model used here is one of the main global hydrological models used in regional and global water modelling studies hanasaki et al 2008 haddeland et al 2011 warszawski et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the runoff simulation scheme in h08 is based on the bucket model concept manabe 1969 but modified by using a leaky bucket formulation in which subsurface runoff occurs continually as a function of soil moisture the algorithm used in h08 for pet estimation is the mass transfer method dalton 1802 penman 1948 which relates pet to vapour pressure deficit and wind speed the h08 runs on a daily time step and consists of six main modules land surface hydrology river routing crop growth reservoir operation environmental flow and anthropogenic water withdrawal this study uses only the land surface hydrology module which conceptualises each grid or catchment as interconnected stores with equations describing the hydrological processes including snowmelt processes and movement of water between stores the daily climate inputs needed to run the model are precipitation temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed the suggested or default parameters of h08 hanasaki et al 2008 are used for the modelling here without further calibration against local data global hydrological models like h08 has limitation in simulating reliably the actual runoff values at a particular location but they can reasonably simulate the runoff variability over annual and longer time scales and the trend in runoff as well as relative changes in runoff resulting from changes in the climate inputs haddeland et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 unlike the simple budyko relationship the h08 hydrological model runs on a daily time step and dynamically models the different hydrological fluxes and stores the h08 model is therefore likely to better represent the hydrology of the region compared to the budyko relationship as well as take into account changes in the climate inputs at the sub annual scale the h08 modelling here at 0 5 grid resolution therefore provides a consistent and broad scale estimation of the climate change impact on runoff across the south asia region but cannot replace the need for more detailed and intensive modelling efforts like parameter calibration and model validation to fully inform specific management planning or adaptation in local catchments or basins 2 4 modelling climate change impact on water supply security the climate change impact on water availability will be reflected not only in the average streamflow volume but also in other river flow characteristics the seasonality in river flow is likely to increase with wet seasons becoming wetter and dry seasons becoming drier ashfaq et al 2009 sivakumar and stefanski 2011 this enhanced hydrologic variability will change the reliability of water supply thus compounding water management and climate adaptation challenges to investigate the impact of climate change on water supply security a storage analysis mcmahon and adeloye 2005 mcmahon et al 2007 is carried out where the dynamic monthly water balance of a hypothetical reservoir storage is modelled as 6 s t 1 s t q t d t 0 s s m a x where st 1 and st are the reservoir storages in month t and t 1 respectively qt is the runoff or inflow into the storage in month t and dt is water demand or withdrawal in month t for the hypothetical modelling here the storage capacity smax is set equal to the mean annual runoff and the monthly water demand assumed to also include evaporation from the reservoir is set to 0 9 times the mean monthly runoff to express the storage modelling results a reservoir or storage reliability is defined here as 100 minus the percentage time or months that the demand cannot be adequately met i e when st 1 is negative and has to be set to zero 3 projected climate change across south asia from cmip5 the plots in fig 2 4 show the range of projected changes in the daily average temperature potential evaporation and precipitation respectively across south asia presented for each of the four seasons and annual values the plots show the median value 25 75th percentile range and 10 90th percentile range from the 42 cmip5 gcms for rcp8 5 the range of temperature projections in fig 2 and to a large extent precipitation projections in fig 4 are consistent with those in the ipcc ar5 atlas of global and regional climate projections ipcc 2013 however the projections here are presented at higher temporal and spatial resolutions and come from a much larger and complete set of cmip5 gcms to adequately reflect the range of uncertainty in hydrological modelling to inform impact vulnerability adaptation assessments of water resources and related sectors across south asia as shown in fig 2 there is reasonable agreement between the gcms in the temperature projections for example all the gcms project increases in temperature compared to precipitation where projection can range from large increases to large decrease fig 4 averaged across the south asia region the median projection for rcp8 5 is an increase in daily average temperature of 2 9 c by 2046 2075 relative to the baseline period 1976 2005 with a 25 75th percentile range of 2 6 to 3 5 c and 10 90th percentile range of 2 3 to 4 0 c the projected increase in daily minimum temperature is slightly higher and the projected increase in daily maximum temperature is slightly lower than the projected increase in daily average temperature not presented here seasonally the projected temperature increase is slightly higher in winter djf than in summer jja spatially the projected temperature increase is noticeably higher in the north high altitude regions than in the south which is consistent with that found by mountain research initiative edw working group 2015 there is also general agreement in the potential evaporation projections fig 3 where the potential evaporation for each gcm grid is estimated from the solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures and actual vapour pressure data using morton s wet environment or equilibrium or areal potential evaporation formulation morton 1983 these projected increases in potential evaporation are driven mainly by the increase in temperature most gcms also show a slight increase in vapour pressure deficit which will also increase potential evaporation but there is little change and agreement between gcms in the direction of change of other variables solar radiation and wind speed that influence potential evaporation averaged across the south asia region the median projection for rcp8 5 is an increase in mean annual potential evaporation of 6 2 by 2046 2075 relative to baseline with a 25 75th percentile range of 4 8 to 7 6 and 10 90th percentile range of 3 4 to 8 8 at the extreme percentile some of the projections show a decrease in potential evaporation in summer due to higher relative humidity and possible decrease in solar radiation seasonally the projected percentage increase in potential evaporation is considerably greater in winter djf than in summer jja spatially the projected percentage increase in potential evaporation tends to be greater in the north west there is much greater uncertainty in the precipitation projections with large variations between gcms and in the different seasons and regions fig 4 nevertheless a higher proportion of gcms project an increase in precipitation particularly in the north east and much more so in the monsoon summer jun jul aug than in winter dec jan feb the higher monsoon precipitation under a warmer climate is also consistent with those reported in climate processes and climate modelling studies briefly described in the introduction above averaged across the southern half of the south asia region latitude below 25 n the median projection for rcp8 5 is a change in annual precipitation of 11 with a large 10 90th percentile range of 2 to 41 by 2046 2075 relative to the 1976 2005 baseline and averaged across the northern half of the region latitude above 25 n the median projection for rcp8 5 is a change in precipitation of 7 with a 10 90th percentile range of 9 to 35 the projections also suggest possible intensification in the high extreme precipitation i e the highest 0 1 percentile daily precipitation particularly in the southern parts not shown here 4 climate change impact on water across south asia 4 1 climate elasticity of runoff across south asia the plots in fig 5 show the climate elasticity of runoff which is a useful concept that describes the sensitivity of runoff to changes in precipitation potential evaporation and temperature as simulated by the budyko relationship and the h08 hydrological model the climate elasticity of runoff is defined as the percentage change in runoff for a one percent change in precipitation or potential evaporation or a one degree change in temperature schaake 1990 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2001 chiew et al 2006 chiew 2006 to estimate the climate elasticity of runoff the climate data of the baseline period is perturbed from 10 to 10 for precipitation and potential evaporation with gradations of 1 and from 2 0 c to 2 0 c for temperature with gradations of 0 1 c the perturbed climate data is then used as inputs into the budyko relationship and h08 hydrological model and the modelled runoff for the perturbed climate is compared with the modelled runoff for the baseline climate to estimate the climate elasticity of runoff the mean of the estimated elasticity basing on all the perturbations are then presented in fig 5 as discussed earlier potential evaporation for the budyko relationship is estimated here using morton s areal potential evaporation formulation whilst the h08 model estimates potential evaporation directly using the algorithms in the model the h08 modelling results in fig 5 indicate that the precipitation elasticity of runoff generally range from about 1 5 or 2 0 i e a 10 change in precipitation is amplified as a 15 20 change in runoff in the wetter regions in the west coast east coast and north east to greater than 2 0 i e a 10 change in precipitation is amplified as a 20 change in runoff in the drier regions in the north west and inland south as expected both the h08 hydrological model and the budyko relationship show the similar spatial trends in the precipitation elasticity of runoff fig 5 however the runoff sensitivity to changes in precipitation is higher in the budyko relationship with precipitation elasticity of runoff of 2 2 for regions with aridity index ϕ p e t p of 1 and 3 0 for aridity index of 2 it is worth mentioning that the budyko relationship is developed and parameterised from global energy and water datasets and will give the same results for regions with the same aridity index for cold regions like the north west and the tibetan plateau the budyko relationship may not lend itself to extrapolation into the future where higher temperatures will affect snow glacier and permafrost processes in contrast the h08 model simulates the hydrological dynamics and fluxes and storages at a daily time scale and therefore reflect in more detail the hydroclimatology of the region for the baseline climate data here and the hydrology as conceptualised and parameterised in h08 both the h08 hydrological model and budyko relationship also show the similar spatial trends in the potential evaporation elasticity of runoff fig 5 the runoff sensitivity to potential evaporation is slightly greater in the h08 model particularly in the western arid regions with 1 increase in potential evaporation resulting in 2 5 decrease in runoff compared to the budyko relationship indicating a 2 3 decrease in runoff for a 1 increase in potential evaporation because of the complementarity in the runoff sensitivity to precipitation and runoff sensitivity to potential evaporation as can be seen in the budyko relationship see also arora 2002 dooge et al 1999 zheng et al 2009 the regions with high positive precipitation elasticity of runoff also have high negative potential evaporation elasticity of runoff the sensitivity of runoff to higher future temperature reflects clearly the increase in potential evaporation from the increase in temperature causing the decrease in runoff the spatial trends in the temperature elasticity of runoff and potential evaporation elasticity of runoff are therefore the same in most regions across sa the h08 hydrological model indicates that a 1 c increase in temperature will result in about 5 increase in potential evaporation which in turn leads to a 5 10 decrease in runoff the elasticity is close to the clausius clapeyron rate which means an increase in the water holding capacity of air the saturation water vapour pressure of approximately 7 per degree celsius rise in temperature held and soden 2006 4 2 modelled climate change impact on mean annual runoff across south asia the plots in fig 6 show the percentage change in mean annual runoff for the rcp8 5 scenario for 2046 2075 relative to the baseline 1976 2005 modelled by the h08 hydrological model budyko relationship and global climate models gcms the future runoff for h08 and budyko are modelled using future 2046 2075 precipitation potential evaporation and temperature daily series for h08 and annual values for budyko obtained by scaling the baseline climate using empirical annual scaling factors derived from the 42 gcms the plots in fig 6 present the median as well as the 10th and 90th percentile of annual runoff change across the south asia the percentiles of h08 and budyko come from the 42 future climate projections informed by the 42 gcms while the percentiles of the gcm modelled runoffs come from only 17 models where runoff outputs are readily available nevertheless the percentiles of h08 and budyko estimated from the same subset of 17 gcm show relatively minor differences compared to those estimated from all the 42 gcms the median projections from the h08 hydrological modelling indicate that runoff will be greater in the future across most of south asia except in the north west where projections show a 12 decline in mean annual runoff in 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 baseline elsewhere the median h08 modelling projections indicate increases in mean annual runoff of about 10 in indus region ind tibetan plateau region tp and arakan coast region ac about 15 in ganges brahmaputra region ga deccan plateau region dp and ghats coast region gh and a bit more than 20 in narmad tapti region nt and sri lanka sl there is large uncertainty in the projections with the 10th percentile and 90th percentile estimates of percentage change in future mean annual runoff differing by more than 50 in most regions and more than 100 in some regions nevertheless there is good agreement in the direction of projected change in future precipitation fig 4 and future runoff fig 6 over the south central and north east of the south asia region with practically all the modelling results projecting an increase in future runoff in the regions in contrast in the north east there is considerable disagreement between the gcms in the direction of change in future precipitation and therefore future runoff it is comforting to see much similarity in the projected change in future runoff from the h08 budyko and gcm modelling in the spatial trends and the direction of change and to a lesser extent also the modelled values this gives some confidence in the broad scale direction and range of plausible future projections in the climate and runoff however despite the similarities and consistency in the projections from the different modelling approaches there are several key exceptions first the median projection from h08 indicate runoff increase in the indus region but the median projection from budyko show little change and the median gcm projection indicate runoff decrease second the future runoff projections from the gcms and to a lesser extent the budyko relationship are wetter in the south compared to the projections from h08 modelling slightly wetter in the median projection and considerably wetter in the 90th percentile projection the higher projected absolute runoff change by the budyko relationship compared to the h08 hydrological model in all regions drier in the north west and wetter and elsewhere occurs because of the higher precipitation elasticity of runoff in the budyko equation as discussed in section 4 1 third the range and therefore uncertainty in the projections from the gcms is higher than in the h08 modelling this is most likely because of the different land surface hydrology conceptualisation and parameterisation in the gcms compared to the single h08 parameterisation modelling the change in runoff resulting from the change in the climate inputs the uncertainty in the future runoff projection mainly comes from the uncertainty in the future precipitation projection this is illustrated in fig 7 which shows the range of percentage change in future runoff modelled by h08 from projected changes in precipitation alone the baseline temperature and potential evaporation series is used for these simulations and from projected increases in temperature and potential evaporation alone the baseline precipitation series is used for these simulations the results in fig 7 indicate that the small range or differences in the projected increase in temperature and potential evaporation from the 42 gcms translates to a relatively small range in the projected decrease in the modelled future runoff in contrast the large range in the projected change in precipitation with gcms disagreeing in the direction of change particularly in the north west translates to a large range in the modelled change in future runoff the modelled change in mean annual runoff is driven by the projected change in the climate variables section 3 and the runoff sensitivity to the climate variables section 4 1 however the modelled change in future runoff is not a direct sum of the change due to precipitation change alone and due to temperature and potential evaporation change alone this is partly because of the nonlinearity in the hydrological response to the different climate variables and partly because of the different possible combinations of changes in the climate variables in the gcms for example the median projected change in future runoff does not necessarily come from the median projected changes in all the different climate variables in general the h08 modelling results indicate that the future change in runoff by 2046 2075 across most of south asia is driven mainly by the change in precipitation and moderated where a runoff increase is projected or amplified where a runoff decrease is projected by the change in temperature and or potential evaporation 4 3 runoff projections from different empirical scaling treatments to obtain future climate change inputs the plots in fig 8 show the h08 modelled changes in future runoff using future climate inputs derived using annual scaling seasonal scaling and daily scaling respectively the results indicate that the future runoff projections from the seasonal scaling is wetter than those from the annual scaling where the median projection from the seasonal scaling show 2 4 greater increase in future mean annual runoff this is because the seasonal scaling method reflects the proportionally higher projection of precipitation increase in the summer monsoon jun jul aug when higher runoff occurs compared to winter see fig 4 the seasonal scaling treatment therefore enhances the summer monsoon runoff and subsequently the annual runoff compared to the annual scaling treatment similarly since daily scaling reflects the proportionally higher increases in the high daily precipitation amounts that generate high runoff projected by the gcms particularly in the south the future runoff projections from daily scaling is wetter than those from the seasonal scaling except in the far north the increases in future mean annual runoff modelled with future precipitation inputs from the daily scaling for the median projection are 3 10 greater more in the south than in the seasonal scaling as also shown in fig 8 the 10th percentile median and 90th percentile of the projection for each scaling method indicate the uncertainty in the future runoff projections resulting from the uncertainty or range in the future precipitation projected by gcms the uncertainty of runoff projections owing to empirical scaling treatments are relatively smaller than that due to the range in the future precipitation projections however the difference of runoff projection from the three empirical scaling treatments can be significant and may need to be accounted for in detailed modelling studies to inform planning and adaptation particularly when the projected changes at the seasonal and daily scale are supported by multiple lines of evidence from climate science and climate modelling and where simulations of river flow characteristics other than just the long term averages are required 4 4 modelling climate change impact on future water supply security table 1 shows the storage reliability for the two grid cells where the brahmani baitarani and koshi basins are located see fig 1 the storage analysis is discussed in section 2 4 the runoff or inflow inputs for the storage analysis come from the h08 modelling with the baseline period 1976 2005 and the projected runoff of the future derived from the annual scaling seasonal scaling daily scaling and bias correction methods table 1 shows that the storage reliability from the modelling with baseline climate data 1976 2005 is 95 for the brahmani baitarani grid and 91 for the koshi grid the results from the three empirical scaling treatments to obtain the future climate inputs are very similar little change in brahmani baitarani and very small increase in storage reliability in koshi accounting for the different changes in the climate inputs through the year in seasonal scaling and daily scaling therefore made little difference to the projection of future water supply security in these two grids compared to applying a uniform constant percentage change through the year annual scaling although the results could be quite different elsewhere however the results from the bias correction using quantile mapping are considerably different to those from the three empirical scaling methods this is because the quantile mapping takes into account changes in the sequencing in the future climate series as well as the inter annual and multi year variability characteristics reflected by the gcms this highlights the importance of considering key climate drivers other than long term averages that significantly influence the hydrologic metrics important for decision making and planning the storage or water supply security in this particular example nevertheless as discussed earlier end of section 2 2 simulations using bias corrected gcm or even dynamically downscaled regional climate model outputs must be interpreted cautiously because of the often large bias corrections required for gcm and rcm precipitation this limitation and uncertainty is also reflected in the much larger range of results from the bias corrected quantile mapping compared to the empirical scaling methods table 1 4 5 uncertainty in runoff projections from uncertainty in gcm precipitation projections fig 9 shows the changes in future mean annual runoff modelled by the h08 hydrological model for the brahmani baitarani and koshi grid cells 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 informed by projected future climate from all ensemble runs for all 42 cmip5 gcms for rcp8 5 the first column g00 shows results from the first run of each of the 42 gcms which was used for the presentation and discussion in the preceding sections the other columns g01 to g42 show the modelled changes in future runoff using climate projections from all the available ensemble runs for each of the 42 gcms the plots show again the large range in runoff projections resulting from the uncertainty in future projections of precipitation g00 as well as show that the uncertainty in the projections within many gcms can be as large as the differences in projections between gcms the differences in the modelled future change in runoff using future precipitation projections from all 42 gcms versus using projections from only the better gcms are also investigated with the results shown in fig 10 here the gcm performance is evaluated by comparing the ranked annual precipitation simulated by the gcm versus the princeton 0 5 grid observed precipitation 30 values over 1975 2006 the root mean square error is calculated with a lower value indicating better agreement between the gcm and observed annual precipitation distributions and therefore a better gcm ability in reproducing the baseline precipitation the modelling results from using the best five best 10 best 15 best 20 and all 42 gcms are presented in fig 10 overall there are no clear trends or conclusions from the results although the better gcms tend to project slightly wetter futures particularly daily scaling for brahmani baitarani the uncertainty or range in the projections are also similar for the different sub selections of gcms except the best five gcms for koshi to put this into context there have been many studies on gcm sub selection with most studies indicating little correlation between future precipitation projections and gcm performance arnell 2011 brekke et al 2008 chiew et al 2009b palazzi et al 2015 many studies favour the use of projections from all gcms to represent the full range of uncertainty chiew et al 2009b palazzi et al 2015 although some studies sub select gcms to either remove the clearly poorly performing gcms or to consider only gcms with different or independent representation of the physical processes stainforth et al 2005 2007 evans et al 2011 it is also difficult to adequately assess and determine which are the better performing gcms e g assessment against simulation of different precipitation and climate characteristics assessment for the location of interest or regionally or globally assessment against the large scale drivers indices of local regional precipitation and the relationship between them based on the limited consideration and assessment here and for the broad scale projections presented here it is probably best to use projections from all the available gcms to provide an indication of the full range of uncertainty 5 summary and conclusion the paper presents future climate and runoff projections estimated using a consistent method across south asia the future runoff is modelled using the budyko relationship and h08 global hydrological model with future climate inputs informed by projections from the 42 cmip5 gcms the modelling results indicate that future runoff will increase throughout most of the region indian sub continent except in the far north east southern part of the tibetan plateau and the arid far north west region the median projection shows increases in mean annual runoff of 20 30 in the indian sub continent for 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 for rcp8 5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway however there is considerable uncertainty in the projections with a 10th and 90th percentile range of more than 50 the uncertainty in the future runoff projections come mainly from the uncertainty in the future precipitation projections both within and between gcms practically all the 42 gcms project a wetter future throughout the indian sub continent particularly in the south but there is little agreement between gcms in the direction of precipitation change in the far north east and far north west of the south asia region the percentage change in precipitation is generally amplified as a 1 5 2 0 for wet areas to 2 for dry areas change in runoff the change in runoff by 2046 2075 is driven mainly by the change in precipitation moderated where runoff increase is projected or intensified where runoff decrease is projected by higher temperature and potential evaporation the different hydrological modelling approaches h08 hydrological model budyko relationship runoff outputs from gcms show similar results providing confidence in the broad scale runoff projections presented here the differences in modelled future runoffs using future climate inputs derived from different empirical scaling methods can be significant but are relatively smaller than the uncertainty resulting from the large range in future precipitation projections the choice of scaling method to reflect changes in future precipitation and climate characteristics that drive runoff can therefore be important in hydrological modelling studies to inform planning and adaptation particularly where simulations of river flow characteristics other than just the long term averages are needed however the methods used including downscaling particularly where significant modelling effort is required must account for uncertainty from the range of gcms and supported by scientific understanding of atmospheric oceanic circulation processes in a warmer world there is little difference in the projections from using only the better performing gcms versus using all 42 gcms in the modelling here therefore for the broad scale projections presented here it is best to use projections from all the gcms to provide an indication of the full range of uncertainty conflict of interest none acknowledgements this work is

8505,study region the south asia study focus this paper presents future climate and runoff projections for the south asia region under the rcp8 5 scenario with climate change informed by 42 cmip5 gcms runoff is projected for 0 5 grids using hydrological models with future climate inputs obtained by empirically scaling the historical climate series new hydrological insights the modelling results indicate that future runoff will increase throughout most of the region except in the far north east and far north west the median projection shows increases in mean annual runoff of 20 30 in the indian sub continent for 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 the change in runoff is driven mainly by the change in precipitation moderated in wetter futures or intensified in drier futures by higher temperature and potential evaporation the paper also investigates the uncertainties of the projection due to scaling methods and selection of gcms the difference in runoff projections from different scaling methods is small relative to the large uncertainty in precipitation projections from the gcms sub selecting only the better performing gcms shows marginal difference in the uncertainty range of projected runoff for the broad scale projections presented here it is best to use projections informed by all the gcms to provide an indication of the full uncertainty range keywords climate change projections runoff precipitation water security south asia 1 introduction water security in south asia will be under increasing stress owing to socio economic growth and global climate change it is forecasted that the population in south asia will be more than 2 3 billion by 2050 united nations 2015 the growth of population and expanding economies will result in an increase in water demand meanwhile there is strong evidence that many parts of south asia are experiencing long term warming trends that will continue into the future hijioka et al 2014 the changes in climate will have significant impacts on water availability moreover the warmer future climate will increase evapotranspiration and hence increase demand for water in irrigated agriculture urban centres and water dependent ecosystems exacerbated by climate change it is estimated that water scarcity could cost up to 6 gdp loss in south asia by 2050 world bank 2016 as water impacts practically all sectors people agriculture industries and ecosystems there have been considerable research efforts on predicting or projecting water availability under future climate conditions e g devkota and gyawali 2015 gupta and deshpande 2004 immerzeel et al 2010 immerzeel and bierkens 2012 nepal and shrestha 2015 to inform the development of effective adaptation options for south asia most studies of hydrological response to climate change only investigate limited regions and climate scenarios for example akhtar et al 2008 simulated the hydrological response to climate change for three river basins astore gilgit and hunza in the upper indus using two downscaling approaches driven by the hadam3p gcm one of the downscaling approaches was a form of statistical downscaling using the delta change approach and another was dynamical downscaling using the precis regional climate model at 25 km resolution lutz et al 2014 assessed potential changes of water availability for the large basins in northern south asia with increased runoff projected for 2050 for the upper ganges brahmaputra salween and mekong primarily due to projected precipitation increases and for the indus due to accelerated glacier melt in the upper basin the hydrological response to climate change is generally predicted using downscaled future climate projections to drive a hydrological model chiew et al 2009a teng et al 2012a one of the key challenges in factoring climate change into water resources management lies in the uncertainty in the projections jiménez cisneros et al 2014 lopez et al 2009 the sources of the projection uncertainties could be from the gcms the downscaling approaches or the hydrological models chen et al 2011 teng et al 2012b vetter et al 2016 the performance of gcms over the south asia region have been investigated by quite a few researchers e g chaturvedi et al 2012 freychet et al 2015 jourdain et al 2013 ogata et al 2014 palazzi et al 2015 saha et al 2014 for example saha et al 2014 found that the majority of the cmip5 gcms fail to simulate the post 1950 decreasing trend of indian summer monsoon rainfall as they did not capture the weakening monsoon associated with the warming of southern indian ocean and strengthening of cyclonic formation in the tropical western pacific ocean some studies have suggested placing more weight on or using only projections from the better performing gcms as noted by palazzi et al 2015 however it is challenging in selecting better performing gcms for the region as none of gcms can reproduce all the salient features e g seasonal and annual rainfall amounts distribution and trend or the large scale atmospheric oceanic drivers of rainfall in the region like the gcms the latest dynamic downscaling runs in the cordex regional climate model experiments also do not capture the observed monsoon precipitation trends or the correct magnitude of observed warming ghimire et al 2015 mishra et al 2014 in any case the uncertainty in climate projections from gcms and from downscaling approaches must be adequately represented within the specific context and objectives of any hydrological modelling and integrated water resources management study this paper aims to present future climate precipitation temperature and potential evaporation and runoff projections across south asia and the associated uncertainties and robustness of the projections from different considerations or treatments of climate change projections and hydrological modelling the future runoff is projected using hydrological models with future climate inputs informed by 42 gcms reported in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 ipcc 2013 the paper investigates i the sensitivity of runoff to changes in the climate variables ii the projected runoff change resulting from different hydrological modelling approaches iii the projected runoff change using different empirical downscaling approaches iv the uncertainties of runoff projection within and across the gcms and v whether using a sub set of the better performing gcms can reduce the uncertainties in the projection the structure of the paper is

present and historical are used interchangeably throughout the paper they all refer to the period 1976 2005 the daily gridded climate data of precipitation temperature wind speed air pressure and radiation are obtained from the princeton global forcing pgf dataset with spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 sheffield et al 2006 fig 1 shows the annual mean of precipitation temperature potential evaporation and aridity index for the baseline period across the south asia region the precipitation and temperature comes directly from the pgf dataset potential evaporation is estimated from the pgf climate variables using morton s formulation of wet environment or equilibrium or areal potential evaporation morton 1983 chiew and mcmahon 1991 aridity index is defined as mean annual potential evaporation divided by mean annual precipitation the future climate scenarios are derived from the cmip5 database http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 which archives transient climate experiments from more than 20 climate modelling groups around the world all the ensemble runs of 42 cmip5 gcms with both historical and future outputs available on 15 march 2013 the same date as that adopted by ipcc ar5 are used here the results presented in this study are for a future period over 2046 2075 relative to the baseline period 1976 2005 for rcp8 5 high representative greenhouse gas concentration pathway corresponding to radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 by 2100 relative to pre industrial value see moss et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 it is worth noting that the discussions and results presented throughout this paper are applicable for any future global warming pathway or scenario but the projected changes would be smaller for lower rcps like rcp4 5 rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 2 2 empirical downscaling of gcm climate variables downscaling is the process of translating or modelling the coarse resolution outputs from gcms to catchment scale climate that is required for impact adaptation vulnerability studies and hydrological modelling there are three types of downscaling approaches fowler et al 2007 chen et al 2011 ekström et al 2015 1 empirical downscaling or change factor method which applies the change informed by gcms for a future period relative to a baseline period to perturb the baseline observations to reflect a future climate 2 statistical downscaling which develops a statistical relationship between gcm atmospheric variables and observed climate variables and then use this relationship to derive future climate variables from future gcm variables and 3 dynamical downscaling where regional climate models rcms are used kumar et al 2013 to model the physical atmospheric and land surface processes at smaller spatial scale informed or constrained by a larger scale gcm many downscaling comparisons have been conducted chen et al 2011 fowler et al 2007 and generally conclude that no single downscaling method is better and this is largely because like gcms different downscaling methods are tailored for different applications chiew et al 2010 found that results from empirical downscaling typically lie within the range of other regionally available statistical and dynamical downscaling methods frost et al 2011 recommends using empirical downscaling methods for regional water resource planning applications due principally to the method s robustness this study therefore uses empirical scaling to scale the baseline climate observations informed by gcm outputs for a future period relative to the baseline period to reflect a future climate zheng et al 2015 for the empirical downscaling here the scaling factor for precipitation and potential evaporation is estimated as 1 s f x f x h where xf and xh are the gcm simulation for the future 2046 2075 and baseline 1976 2005 periods respectively once derived the scaling factor is then used to scale the baseline climate observations 1976 2005 to produce a future climate time series as the gcms spatial resolutions are different to the observations and different gcms have different spatial resolutions the scaling factors derived for each of the gcms are resampled to match with the 0 5 x 0 5 grid in princeton dataset in eq 1 if xf and xh are annual means then the scaling approach is defined as annual scaling where all the daily values of precipitation or potential evaporation in the 30 year baseline period 1976 2005 are scaled by this single annual scaling factor to provide a 30 year future 2046 2075 daily precipitation or potential evaporation series most of the results presented here describing runoff sensitivity to climate inputs section 4 1 and comparing different modelling approaches section 4 2 are for annual scaling the study here in section 4 3 also explores the difference in runoff projection where the climate variables in the different seasons are scaled by factors estimated separately for the different seasons seasonal scaling and where daily precipitation amounts or percentiles are scaled differently daily scaling in the seasonal scaling the original seasonal scaling factors are firstly estimated for each of the four seasons dec jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov informed by the gcm outputs these factors are then rescaled such that the eventual future climate series has the same change to that from annual scaling approach at the mean annual level the rescaled seasonal scaling factors are estimated as 2 s f i s f i s f a x h s f i x h i where sfi and sfi are the original and rescaled seasonal scaling factors for season i respectively sfa is the annual scaling factor and xh i is the observed baseline mean for season i the daily scaling is carried out only for precipitation mainly to reflect potentially different climate change impact signal in the higher daily precipitation intensity here for each season 53 daily scaling factors are calculated representing the changes in the highest 50 daily precipitation values as reflected by the gcm and changes in the average of the 51 100th daily precipitation values 101 200th daily precipitation values and 200th onward daily precipitation values similar to the rescaling of seasonal factors the original daily scaling factors derived from the gcms are rescaled for each season to ensure the seasonal change is the same when the corresponding rescaled seasonal scaling factor is used the annual scaling therefore uses a single factor to scale all the baseline daily precipitation or potential evaporation to reflect a future climate the seasonal scaling uses four different factors to scale the precipitation or potential evaporation in the different seasons the daily scaling scales the daily precipitation in accordance with 53 4 scaling factors the rescaling procedure mentioned above ensures that the change in mean annual precipitation or potential evapotranspiration in the annual scaling seasonal scaling and daily scaling are the same as reflected by the gcm at the mean annual scale and allows results from the different empirical scaling methods to be directly compared the intention here is not to find the best method but to explore potential uncertainties owing to different empirical scaling treatments to obtain the future climate series different to precipitation and potential evaporation the scaling factor of temperature is defined as the absolute change of temperature and is expressed as 3 s f t f t h where tf and th are the gcm simulated annual seasonal mean daily temperature for the future and baseline periods respectively both annual and seasonal scaling factors of temperature are derived herein in the above empirical scaling methods the future daily climate sequence is the same as the baseline climate sequence scaled by different factors the annual seasonal and daily empirical scaling are applied to precipitation for temperature and potential evaporation only the annual and seasonal scaling are applied to explore climate change impact on water supply reliability in section 2 4 and section 4 4 the potential change in future climate sequence is also considered here a quantile mapping bias correction approach is used where the gcm daily precipitation value at a given percentile rank in the baseline period is matched to the observed daily precipitation value at the princeton 0 5 grid at the same percentile rank and this relationship is then used to translate the future gcm daily precipitation series to an 0 5 grid future daily precipitation series this quantile mapping bias correction is processed as 4 x f u t f o b s 1 f h i s x f u t where fobs is the cumulative distribution function of the historical observation fhis is the cumulative distribution function of the historical gcm simulation xfut is the future daily gcm precipitation value and x fut is the future 0 5 grid precipitation value the cumulative distribution function is considered separately for each of the four seasons and only precipitation amounts greater than 0 01 mm are considered like in the empirical scaling methods the future precipitation series here is rescaled such that the change in seasonal means are the same as those in the empirical seasonal scaling and the change in the annual mean is the same as that in the empirical annual scaling it should be noted that the distribution of daily precipitation simulated by gcms can be very different to the distribution of observed daily precipitation daily precipitation is smaller in gcms and there are more rain days in gcms and the quantile mapping bias correction can introduce large errors and artificially corrupt future gcm projected trends and characteristics hay and clark 2003 maraun 2013 piani et al 2010 2 3 modelling climate change impact on runoff the climate change impact on runoff presented and discussed in various parts of section 4 come from three sources 1 direct simulations from the gcms 2 budyko relationship estimates for the future relative to the baseline using annual means with scaling factors of precipitation and potential evaporation and 3 h08 hydrological modelling for the future relative to the baseline using daily climate inputs with scaling factors of precipitation and temperature the similarities and differences in the runoff projections from the different sources and methods are explored the budyko relationship budyko 1974 is the most widely used equation to describe basin or regional scale long term energy and water balance oudin et al 2008 sivapalan et al 2003 teng et al 2012b zhang et al 2004 the budyko relationship is commonly presented as 5 e p ϕ t a n h 1 ϕ 1 exp ϕ 1 2 ϕ p e t p where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration p is the mean annual precipitation pet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and ø is the aridity index over a long enough time period several years the mean annual runoff q can be estimated from the above equation as the difference between mean annual precipitation and mean annual actual evaporation q p e this simple budyko relationship is remarkably robust for estimating large scale energy and water balance and has been used in literally thousands of studies including adaptations to account for landscape features particularly vegetation and for local conditions and to represent sub annual and inter annual time scales in this study the simple basic budyko relationship above is used to directly estimate the baseline 1976 2005 and future 2046 2075 mean annual runoffs from mean annual values of precipitation and potential evaporation the h08 model used here is one of the main global hydrological models used in regional and global water modelling studies hanasaki et al 2008 haddeland et al 2011 warszawski et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the runoff simulation scheme in h08 is based on the bucket model concept manabe 1969 but modified by using a leaky bucket formulation in which subsurface runoff occurs continually as a function of soil moisture the algorithm used in h08 for pet estimation is the mass transfer method dalton 1802 penman 1948 which relates pet to vapour pressure deficit and wind speed the h08 runs on a daily time step and consists of six main modules land surface hydrology river routing crop growth reservoir operation environmental flow and anthropogenic water withdrawal this study uses only the land surface hydrology module which conceptualises each grid or catchment as interconnected stores with equations describing the hydrological processes including snowmelt processes and movement of water between stores the daily climate inputs needed to run the model are precipitation temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed the suggested or default parameters of h08 hanasaki et al 2008 are used for the modelling here without further calibration against local data global hydrological models like h08 has limitation in simulating reliably the actual runoff values at a particular location but they can reasonably simulate the runoff variability over annual and longer time scales and the trend in runoff as well as relative changes in runoff resulting from changes in the climate inputs haddeland et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 unlike the simple budyko relationship the h08 hydrological model runs on a daily time step and dynamically models the different hydrological fluxes and stores the h08 model is therefore likely to better represent the hydrology of the region compared to the budyko relationship as well as take into account changes in the climate inputs at the sub annual scale the h08 modelling here at 0 5 grid resolution therefore provides a consistent and broad scale estimation of the climate change impact on runoff across the south asia region but cannot replace the need for more detailed and intensive modelling efforts like parameter calibration and model validation to fully inform specific management planning or adaptation in local catchments or basins 2 4 modelling climate change impact on water supply security the climate change impact on water availability will be reflected not only in the average streamflow volume but also in other river flow characteristics the seasonality in river flow is likely to increase with wet seasons becoming wetter and dry seasons becoming drier ashfaq et al 2009 sivakumar and stefanski 2011 this enhanced hydrologic variability will change the reliability of water supply thus compounding water management and climate adaptation challenges to investigate the impact of climate change on water supply security a storage analysis mcmahon and adeloye 2005 mcmahon et al 2007 is carried out where the dynamic monthly water balance of a hypothetical reservoir storage is modelled as 6 s t 1 s t q t d t 0 s s m a x where st 1 and st are the reservoir storages in month t and t 1 respectively qt is the runoff or inflow into the storage in month t and dt is water demand or withdrawal in month t for the hypothetical modelling here the storage capacity smax is set equal to the mean annual runoff and the monthly water demand assumed to also include evaporation from the reservoir is set to 0 9 times the mean monthly runoff to express the storage modelling results a reservoir or storage reliability is defined here as 100 minus the percentage time or months that the demand cannot be adequately met i e when st 1 is negative and has to be set to zero 3 projected climate change across south asia from cmip5 the plots in fig 2 4 show the range of projected changes in the daily average temperature potential evaporation and precipitation respectively across south asia presented for each of the four seasons and annual values the plots show the median value 25 75th percentile range and 10 90th percentile range from the 42 cmip5 gcms for rcp8 5 the range of temperature projections in fig 2 and to a large extent precipitation projections in fig 4 are consistent with those in the ipcc ar5 atlas of global and regional climate projections ipcc 2013 however the projections here are presented at higher temporal and spatial resolutions and come from a much larger and complete set of cmip5 gcms to adequately reflect the range of uncertainty in hydrological modelling to inform impact vulnerability adaptation assessments of water resources and related sectors across south asia as shown in fig 2 there is reasonable agreement between the gcms in the temperature projections for example all the gcms project increases in temperature compared to precipitation where projection can range from large increases to large decrease fig 4 averaged across the south asia region the median projection for rcp8 5 is an increase in daily average temperature of 2 9 c by 2046 2075 relative to the baseline period 1976 2005 with a 25 75th percentile range of 2 6 to 3 5 c and 10 90th percentile range of 2 3 to 4 0 c the projected increase in daily minimum temperature is slightly higher and the projected increase in daily maximum temperature is slightly lower than the projected increase in daily average temperature not presented here seasonally the projected temperature increase is slightly higher in winter djf than in summer jja spatially the projected temperature increase is noticeably higher in the north high altitude regions than in the south which is consistent with that found by mountain research initiative edw working group 2015 there is also general agreement in the potential evaporation projections fig 3 where the potential evaporation for each gcm grid is estimated from the solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures and actual vapour pressure data using morton s wet environment or equilibrium or areal potential evaporation formulation morton 1983 these projected increases in potential evaporation are driven mainly by the increase in temperature most gcms also show a slight increase in vapour pressure deficit which will also increase potential evaporation but there is little change and agreement between gcms in the direction of change of other variables solar radiation and wind speed that influence potential evaporation averaged across the south asia region the median projection for rcp8 5 is an increase in mean annual potential evaporation of 6 2 by 2046 2075 relative to baseline with a 25 75th percentile range of 4 8 to 7 6 and 10 90th percentile range of 3 4 to 8 8 at the extreme percentile some of the projections show a decrease in potential evaporation in summer due to higher relative humidity and possible decrease in solar radiation seasonally the projected percentage increase in potential evaporation is considerably greater in winter djf than in summer jja spatially the projected percentage increase in potential evaporation tends to be greater in the north west there is much greater uncertainty in the precipitation projections with large variations between gcms and in the different seasons and regions fig 4 nevertheless a higher proportion of gcms project an increase in precipitation particularly in the north east and much more so in the monsoon summer jun jul aug than in winter dec jan feb the higher monsoon precipitation under a warmer climate is also consistent with those reported in climate processes and climate modelling studies briefly described in the introduction above averaged across the southern half of the south asia region latitude below 25 n the median projection for rcp8 5 is a change in annual precipitation of 11 with a large 10 90th percentile range of 2 to 41 by 2046 2075 relative to the 1976 2005 baseline and averaged across the northern half of the region latitude above 25 n the median projection for rcp8 5 is a change in precipitation of 7 with a 10 90th percentile range of 9 to 35 the projections also suggest possible intensification in the high extreme precipitation i e the highest 0 1 percentile daily precipitation particularly in the southern parts not shown here 4 climate change impact on water across south asia 4 1 climate elasticity of runoff across south asia the plots in fig 5 show the climate elasticity of runoff which is a useful concept that describes the sensitivity of runoff to changes in precipitation potential evaporation and temperature as simulated by the budyko relationship and the h08 hydrological model the climate elasticity of runoff is defined as the percentage change in runoff for a one percent change in precipitation or potential evaporation or a one degree change in temperature schaake 1990 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2001 chiew et al 2006 chiew 2006 to estimate the climate elasticity of runoff the climate data of the baseline period is perturbed from 10 to 10 for precipitation and potential evaporation with gradations of 1 and from 2 0 c to 2 0 c for temperature with gradations of 0 1 c the perturbed climate data is then used as inputs into the budyko relationship and h08 hydrological model and the modelled runoff for the perturbed climate is compared with the modelled runoff for the baseline climate to estimate the climate elasticity of runoff the mean of the estimated elasticity basing on all the perturbations are then presented in fig 5 as discussed earlier potential evaporation for the budyko relationship is estimated here using morton s areal potential evaporation formulation whilst the h08 model estimates potential evaporation directly using the algorithms in the model the h08 modelling results in fig 5 indicate that the precipitation elasticity of runoff generally range from about 1 5 or 2 0 i e a 10 change in precipitation is amplified as a 15 20 change in runoff in the wetter regions in the west coast east coast and north east to greater than 2 0 i e a 10 change in precipitation is amplified as a 20 change in runoff in the drier regions in the north west and inland south as expected both the h08 hydrological model and the budyko relationship show the similar spatial trends in the precipitation elasticity of runoff fig 5 however the runoff sensitivity to changes in precipitation is higher in the budyko relationship with precipitation elasticity of runoff of 2 2 for regions with aridity index ϕ p e t p of 1 and 3 0 for aridity index of 2 it is worth mentioning that the budyko relationship is developed and parameterised from global energy and water datasets and will give the same results for regions with the same aridity index for cold regions like the north west and the tibetan plateau the budyko relationship may not lend itself to extrapolation into the future where higher temperatures will affect snow glacier and permafrost processes in contrast the h08 model simulates the hydrological dynamics and fluxes and storages at a daily time scale and therefore reflect in more detail the hydroclimatology of the region for the baseline climate data here and the hydrology as conceptualised and parameterised in h08 both the h08 hydrological model and budyko relationship also show the similar spatial trends in the potential evaporation elasticity of runoff fig 5 the runoff sensitivity to potential evaporation is slightly greater in the h08 model particularly in the western arid regions with 1 increase in potential evaporation resulting in 2 5 decrease in runoff compared to the budyko relationship indicating a 2 3 decrease in runoff for a 1 increase in potential evaporation because of the complementarity in the runoff sensitivity to precipitation and runoff sensitivity to potential evaporation as can be seen in the budyko relationship see also arora 2002 dooge et al 1999 zheng et al 2009 the regions with high positive precipitation elasticity of runoff also have high negative potential evaporation elasticity of runoff the sensitivity of runoff to higher future temperature reflects clearly the increase in potential evaporation from the increase in temperature causing the decrease in runoff the spatial trends in the temperature elasticity of runoff and potential evaporation elasticity of runoff are therefore the same in most regions across sa the h08 hydrological model indicates that a 1 c increase in temperature will result in about 5 increase in potential evaporation which in turn leads to a 5 10 decrease in runoff the elasticity is close to the clausius clapeyron rate which means an increase in the water holding capacity of air

in fig 6 show the percentage change in mean annual runoff for the rcp8 5 scenario for 2046 2075 relative to the baseline 1976 2005 modelled by the h08 hydrological model budyko relationship and global climate models gcms the future runoff for h08 and budyko are modelled using future 2046 2075 precipitation potential evaporation and temperature daily series for h08 and annual values for budyko obtained by scaling the baseline climate using empirical annual scaling factors derived from the 42 gcms the plots in fig 6 present the median as well as the 10th and 90th percentile of annual runoff change across the south asia the percentiles of h08 and budyko come from the 42 future climate projections informed by the 42 gcms while the percentiles of the gcm modelled runoffs come from only 17 models where runoff outputs are readily available nevertheless the percentiles of h08 and budyko estimated from the same subset of 17 gcm show relatively minor differences compared to those estimated from all the 42 gcms the median projections from the h08 hydrological modelling indicate that runoff will be greater in the future across most of south asia except in the north west where projections show a 12 decline in mean annual runoff in 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 baseline elsewhere the median h08 modelling projections indicate increases in mean annual runoff of about 10 in indus region ind tibetan plateau region tp and arakan coast region ac about 15 in ganges brahmaputra region ga deccan plateau region dp and ghats coast region gh and a bit more than 20 in narmad tapti region nt and sri lanka sl there is large uncertainty in the projections with the 10th percentile and 90th percentile estimates of percentage change in future mean annual runoff differing by more than 50 in most regions and more than 100 in some regions nevertheless there is good agreement in the direction of projected change in future precipitation fig 4 and future runoff fig 6 over the south central and north east of the south asia region with practically all the modelling results projecting an increase in future runoff in the regions in contrast in the north east there is considerable disagreement between the gcms in the direction of change in future precipitation and therefore future runoff it is comforting to see much similarity in the projected change in future runoff from the h08 budyko and gcm modelling in the spatial trends and the direction of change and to a lesser extent also the modelled values this gives some confidence in the broad scale direction and range of plausible future projections in the climate and runoff however despite the similarities and consistency in the projections from the different modelling approaches there are several key exceptions first the median projection from h08 indicate runoff increase in the indus region but the median projection from budyko show little change and the median gcm projection indicate runoff decrease second the future runoff projections from the gcms and to a lesser extent the budyko relationship are wetter in the south compared to the projections from h08 modelling slightly wetter in the median projection and considerably wetter in the 90th percentile projection the higher projected absolute runoff change by the budyko relationship compared to the h08 hydrological model in all regions drier in the north west and wetter and elsewhere occurs because of the higher precipitation elasticity of runoff in the budyko equation as discussed in section 4 1 third the range and therefore uncertainty in the projections from the gcms is higher than in the h08 modelling this is most likely because of the different land surface hydrology conceptualisation and parameterisation in the gcms compared to the single h08 parameterisation modelling the change in runoff resulting from the change in the climate inputs the uncertainty in the future runoff projection mainly comes from the uncertainty in the future precipitation projection this is illustrated in fig 7 which shows the range of percentage change in future runoff modelled by h08 from projected changes in precipitation alone the baseline temperature and potential evaporation series is used for these simulations and from projected increases in temperature and potential evaporation alone the baseline precipitation series is used for these simulations the results in fig 7 indicate that the small range or differences in the projected increase in temperature and potential evaporation from the 42 gcms translates to a relatively small range in the projected decrease in the modelled future runoff in contrast the large range in the projected change in precipitation with gcms disagreeing in the direction of change particularly in the north west translates to a large range in the modelled change in future runoff the modelled change in mean annual runoff is driven by the projected change in the climate variables section 3 and the runoff sensitivity to the climate variables section 4 1 however the modelled change in future runoff is not a direct sum of the change due to precipitation change alone and due to temperature and potential evaporation change alone this is partly because of the nonlinearity in the hydrological response to the different climate variables and partly because of the different possible combinations of changes in the climate variables in the gcms for example the median projected change in future runoff does not necessarily come from the median projected changes in all the different climate variables in general the h08 modelling results indicate that the future change in runoff by 2046 2075 across most of south asia is driven mainly by the change in precipitation and moderated where a runoff increase is projected or amplified where a runoff decrease is projected by the change in temperature and or potential evaporation 4 3 runoff projections from different empirical scaling treatments to obtain future climate change inputs the plots in fig 8 show the h08 modelled changes in future runoff using future climate inputs derived using annual scaling seasonal scaling and daily scaling respectively the results indicate that the future runoff projections from the seasonal scaling is wetter than those from the annual scaling where the median projection from the seasonal scaling show 2 4 greater increase in future mean annual runoff this is because the seasonal scaling method reflects the proportionally higher projection of precipitation increase in the summer monsoon jun jul aug when higher runoff occurs compared to winter see fig 4 the seasonal scaling treatment therefore enhances the summer monsoon runoff and subsequently the annual runoff compared to the annual scaling treatment similarly since daily scaling reflects the proportionally higher increases in the high daily precipitation amounts that generate high runoff projected by the gcms particularly in the south the future runoff projections from daily scaling is wetter than those from the seasonal scaling except in the far north the increases in future mean annual runoff modelled with future precipitation inputs from the daily scaling for the median projection are 3 10 greater more in the south than in the seasonal scaling as also shown in fig 8 the 10th percentile median and 90th percentile of the projection for each scaling method indicate the uncertainty in the future runoff projections resulting from the uncertainty or range in the future precipitation projected by gcms the uncertainty of runoff projections owing to empirical scaling treatments are relatively smaller than that due to the range in the future precipitation projections however the difference of runoff projection from the three empirical scaling treatments can be significant and may need to be accounted for in detailed modelling studies to inform planning and adaptation particularly when the projected changes at the seasonal and daily scale are supported by multiple lines of evidence from climate science and climate modelling and where simulations of river flow characteristics other than just the long term averages are required 4 4 modelling climate change impact on future water supply security table 1 shows the storage reliability for the two grid cells where the brahmani baitarani and koshi basins are located see fig 1 the storage analysis is discussed in section 2 4 the runoff or inflow inputs for the storage analysis come from the h08 modelling with the baseline period 1976 2005 and the projected runoff of the future derived from the annual scaling seasonal scaling daily scaling and bias correction methods table 1 shows that the storage reliability from the modelling with baseline climate data 1976 2005 is 95 for the brahmani baitarani grid and 91 for the koshi grid the results from the three empirical scaling treatments to obtain the future climate inputs are very similar little change in brahmani baitarani and very small increase in storage reliability in koshi accounting for the different changes in the climate inputs through the year in seasonal scaling and daily scaling therefore made little difference to the projection of future water supply security in these two grids compared to applying a uniform constant percentage change through the year annual scaling although the results could be quite different elsewhere however the results from the bias correction using quantile mapping are considerably different to those from the three empirical scaling methods this is because the quantile mapping takes into account changes in the sequencing in the future climate series as well as the inter annual and multi year variability characteristics reflected by the gcms this highlights the importance of considering key climate drivers other than long term averages that significantly influence the hydrologic metrics important for decision making and planning the storage or water supply security in this particular example nevertheless as discussed earlier end of section 2 2 simulations using bias corrected gcm or even dynamically downscaled regional climate model outputs must be interpreted cautiously because of the often large bias corrections required for gcm and rcm precipitation this limitation and uncertainty is also reflected in the much larger range of results from the bias corrected quantile mapping compared to the empirical scaling methods table 1 4 5 uncertainty in runoff projections from uncertainty in gcm precipitation projections fig 9 shows the changes in future mean annual runoff modelled by the h08 hydrological model for the brahmani baitarani and koshi grid cells 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 informed by projected future climate from all ensemble runs for all 42 cmip5 gcms for rcp8 5 the first column g00 shows results from the first run of each of the 42 gcms which was used for the presentation and discussion in the preceding sections the other columns g01 to g42 show the modelled changes in future runoff using climate projections from all the available ensemble runs for each of the 42 gcms the plots show again the large range in runoff projections resulting from the uncertainty in future projections of precipitation g00 as well as show that the uncertainty in the projections within many gcms can be as large as the differences in projections between gcms the differences in the modelled future change in runoff using future precipitation projections from all 42 gcms versus using projections from only the better gcms are also investigated with the results shown in fig 10 here the gcm performance is evaluated by comparing the ranked annual precipitation simulated by the gcm versus the princeton 0 5 grid observed precipitation 30 values over 1975 2006 the root mean square error is calculated with a lower value indicating better agreement between the gcm and observed annual precipitation distributions and therefore a better gcm ability in reproducing the baseline precipitation the modelling results from using the best five best 10 best 15 best 20 and all 42 gcms are presented in fig 10 overall there are no clear trends or conclusions from the results although the better gcms tend to project slightly wetter futures particularly daily scaling for brahmani baitarani the uncertainty or range in the projections are also similar for the different sub selections of gcms except the best five gcms for koshi to put this into context there have been many studies on gcm sub selection with most studies indicating little correlation between future precipitation projections and gcm performance arnell 2011 brekke et al 2008 chiew et al 2009b palazzi et al 2015 many studies favour the use of projections from all gcms to represent the full range of uncertainty chiew et al 2009b palazzi et al 2015 although some studies sub select gcms to either remove the clearly poorly performing gcms or to consider only gcms with different or independent representation of the physical processes stainforth et al 2005 2007 evans et al 2011 it is also difficult to adequately assess and determine which are the better performing gcms e g assessment against simulation of different precipitation and climate characteristics assessment for the location of interest or regionally or globally assessment against the large scale drivers indices of local regional precipitation and the relationship between them based on the limited consideration and assessment here and for the broad scale projections presented here it is probably best to use projections from all the available gcms to provide an indication of the full range of uncertainty 5 summary and conclusion the paper presents future climate and runoff projections estimated using a consistent method across south asia the future runoff is modelled using the budyko relationship and h08 global hydrological model with future climate inputs informed by projections from the 42 cmip5 gcms the modelling results indicate that future runoff will increase throughout most of the region indian sub continent except in the far north east southern part of the tibetan plateau and the arid far north west region the median projection shows increases in mean annual runoff of 20 30 in the indian sub continent for 2046 2075 relative to 1976 2005 for rcp8 5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway however there is considerable uncertainty in the projections with a 10th and 90th percentile range of more than 50 the uncertainty in the future runoff projections come mainly from the uncertainty in the future precipitation projections both within and between gcms practically all the 42 gcms project a wetter future throughout the indian sub continent particularly in the south but there is little agreement between gcms in the direction of precipitation change in the far north east and far north west of the south asia region the percentage change in precipitation is generally amplified as a 1 5 2 0 for wet areas to 2 for dry areas change in runoff the change in runoff by 2046 2075 is driven mainly by the change in precipitation moderated where runoff increase is projected or intensified where runoff decrease is projected by higher temperature and potential evaporation the different hydrological modelling approaches h08 hydrological model budyko relationship runoff outputs from gcms show similar results providing confidence in the broad scale runoff projections presented here the differences in modelled future runoffs using future climate inputs derived from different empirical scaling methods can be significant but are relatively smaller than the uncertainty resulting from the large range in future precipitation projections the choice of scaling method to reflect changes in future precipitation and climate characteristics that drive runoff can therefore be important in hydrological modelling studies to inform planning and adaptation particularly where simulations of river flow characteristics other than just the long term averages are needed however the methods used including downscaling particularly where significant modelling effort is required must account for uncertainty from the range of gcms and supported by scientific understanding of atmospheric oceanic circulation processes in a warmer world there is little difference in the projections from using only the better performing gcms versus using all 42 gcms in the modelling here therefore for the broad scale projections presented here it is best to use projections from all the gcms to provide an indication of the full range of uncertainty conflict of interest none acknowledgements this work is

8506,study region this study took place in portland oregon a city of over 600 000 residents located in the willamette valley in the state of oregon in the pacific northwest region of the united states portland experiences a temperate climate with mediterranean features study focus runoff patterns from two extensive green roofs with substrate depths of 75 and 125 mm situated on a 5000 square meter retail store were compared over a one year period precipitation irrigation and storm water discharge were continuously monitored and the performance of the green roofs for storm water control was investigated in detail new hydrological insights for the region over the study period the 125 mm and 75 mm green roofs retained 32 9 and 23 2 of all precipitation by volume respectively the hydrologic response of the green roofs during individual storm events was found to depend strongly on the total depth of the storm event as well as the length of the antecedent dry weather period differences in performance between the two substrate depths were most pronounced for small storms with long antecedent dry weather periods both green roofs showed strong seasonal dependence in storm water retention with higher percent retention in the relatively dry summer months compared to lower retention in the wetter winter months these findings have important implications for the effective installation of green roofs for stormwater management in our region because of the increased frequency of storm events during the pacific northwest winters it is imperative that efforts to increase storage capacity through increased substrate depth be paired with efforts to ensure rapid removal if deeper substrates are to be utilized effectively more research is needed to identify ways to increase evapotranspiration for example via more informed plant selection during wet winter months keywords storm water green roofs substrate depth flow attenuation hydrology 1 introduction as cities grow and become more densely populated the fraction of the urban surface made up of impervious materials increases e g carlson and arthur 2000 jia et al 2002 among other challenges such expansion leads to increased stress on storm water management systems driving interest in innovative solutions to reduce storm water volume and peak flow u s epa 2015 miles and band 2015 green roofs also known as eco roofs living roofs or vegetated roofs provide numerous benefits including aesthetic appeal additional habitat for wildlife increased energy efficiency of the building and mitigation of urban heat island effects getter and rowe 2006 lundholm 2006 sailor and hagos 2011 susca et al 2011 green roofs also affect storm water runoff as they are able to temporarily detain some of the incident precipitation this results in a delay in the timing of peak flow rates into storm water systems through evaporation from the substrate surface and transpiration from the vegetation green roofs are also able to reduce runoff when considering green roofs for storm water management reducing total runoff volume and attenuating peak flows are often of greatest concern past studies have shown that green roofs are able to retain storm water reduce peak flow and increase time to peak flow villarreal and bengtsson 2005 spolek 2008 voyde et al 2010 controlling storm water runoff is important to reduce risks of flooding in urban environments of the many factors in play when considering the performance of a green roof for storm water control during a storm event one well studied yet also debated factor is substrate depth it would seem intuitive that deeper substrate would be an important factor that should improve storm water performance however conflicting evidence has been reported in a 12 month study of extensive green roofs in new zealand voyde et al 2010 found no significant difference in performance between 50 mm and 70 mm deep extensive green roofs in another study from new zealand where four green roofs of varying substrate depth were concurrently monitored runoff reduction was not shown to depend on substrate depth fassman beck et al 2013 in a three year study of five different extensive green roofs in seattle wa berkompas et al 2008 reported no relationship between storm water retention and substrate depth for substrate depths 100 mm perhaps the counter intuitive relationship between depth and retention can be explained by the known influence of precipitation characteristics on storm water retention by green roofs environmental conditions especially storm frequency may affect the degree to which additional storage created by increased depth can be accessed in a study of an 80 mm deep test bed stovin 2010 reported that the storm water performance depended most strongly on rainfall amount rainfall intensity and length of the antecedent dry period fassman beck et al 2013 also found runoff reduction during storm events by green roofs to be well predicted by the size of the storm voyde et al 2010 reported that the antecedent dry period for a storm was the most important factor in predicting rates of storm water retention the storm water performance vis à vis reducing total runoff of a green roof has also been found to decrease during wetter seasons and when storm events occur close together e g voyde et al 2010 stovin 2010 for example van seters et al 2009 reported that in comparison to a conventional roof an extensive green roof in toronto reduced runoff by 42 in two wet months but reduced runoff by 70 93 during the drier summer months in their study of three green roofs in new york city researchers were able to demonstrate a seasonal influence on runoff for storms of 10 40 mm in depth carson et al 2013 spolek 2008 reported strong seasonal variation in the performance of a green roof in portland or with runoff reductions of 12 in winter compared with 42 in summer it should be noted that out of all studies mentioned above the two conducted in new zealand a subtropical climate with an average of 137 wet days spread relatively evenly throughout the year were the only ones not showing significant seasonal variation in performance the works discussed here provide evidence that rainfall patterns are an important factor in predicting green roof performance for storm water mitigation substrate depth is a key factor being considered by managers when establishing design criteria yet the relationship between increasing depth and increased retention is not well understood differences in storm event characteristics could explain variation in the substrate depth effect additional research on this topic is especially needed in the pacific northwest of the u s due to its unique climate and dense concentration of green roofs we compared the performance of green roofs with different substrate depths 75 and 125 mm across a range of storm scenarios typical of urban portland or in order to advance our understanding of the interplay between substrate depth and storm characteristics and their effect on green roof performance storm water mitigation associated with two green roof installations on the same building in portland was analyzed over the course of 12 months and individual storm events were analyzed in detail so that any relationships among substrate depth runoff and precipitation patterns could be established 2 methodology 2 1 study site the present study was conducted on a test roof on a new large retail store in portland or w 45 52 n 122 68 building construction was completed in late 2013 and installation of the sensors and equipment on the roof was finished in january 2014 the study site included an extensive green roof divided into three equal 1200 m2 sections of varying substrate depths next to an impermeable 1468 m2 conventional white membrane roof section each roof section was isolated from the others forming unique drainage basins an additional section of roughly 4000 m2 conventional white membrane roof was not monitored one section of green roof had a soil depth of 75 mm the second had a depth of 125 mm and the third section featured spatially varying soil substrate depth only the uniform depth green roof sections were analyzed in this research fig 1 shows a schematic of the roof along with locations of the weather stations used to monitor air temperature rainfall wind direction wind speed solar radiation and soil conditions images of the various roof sections and monitoring stations are shown in fig 2 as illustrated in fig 3 the green roof construction included a waterproof membrane a coarse aggregate foundation layer surface substrate and vegetation the substrate consisted of pumice compost and sandy loam progro oregon vegetation included an assortment of cuttings of nine sedum plant species sedum spurium sedum floriferum weihenstephaner gold sedum phedimus takesimense sedum rupestre angelina sedum divergens sedum album micranthemum sedum album athoum and sedum sexangulare and a seed mixture of 15 additional species lomatium urticulatum eriophyllum lanatum viola praemorsa collinsia grandiflora plagiobothyrs

measured independently from the 75 mm thick green roof the 125 mm green roof and the conventional roof section using plasti fab extra large 60 degree trapezoidal flumes recording five minute averages of flow runoff from the third section of green roof featuring varying soil depths was not measured rainfall was recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge located on the conventional roof in increments of 0 254 mm rainfall and soil moisture content measurements were recorded at a sampling rate of 5 min and averaged over 15 min 2 3 irrigation and leakage on test site the irrigation schedule for both green roofs was controlled by a hydropoint controller which used local weather conditions to estimate evapotranspiration and soil moisture content the green roofs were irrigated daily from april 14 2014 to october 8 2014 during the test period february 1 2014 to january 31 2015 the hydropoint system was set to water according to evaporative demand as estimated by the irrigation control system using data from the weather station the irrigation was assumed to have been distributed evenly between both green roof sections since both roofs were irrigated with the same amounts and at the same times we are still able to test for the treatment effect of depth under these conditions there was no evidence of runoff from either roof being caused solely by irrigation i e all runoff was recorded during or following rain events at any point during the study period with one exception in june 2014 during this time there was a leak in the irrigation system which intermittently caused large amounts of water to be poured onto the roof between june 9 2014 and june 28 2014 the largest value for irrigation during this time was recorded on june 17 and was equivalent to 42 1 mm of precipitation being added to each roof due to its location evidence of this leak was only seen in the runoff from the 75 mm green roof and the conventional white roof the artificial runoff coming from the leakage made analysis of four distinct june rain events impossible but was determined to be inconsequential for the rain event on june 22 2014 outside of this leak irrigation values were recorded as daily total volumes and had an average daily value of 14 0 m3 which is equivalent to 2 9 mm of precipitation being added to the green roof we were able to capture runoff for every storm from both sections with the exception of two events runoff measurements from the 75 mm roof were unavailable for a 62 1 mm storm event on october 21 and a 13 7 mm storm on december 10 for the sake of statistical analysis and consistency only events in which complete runoff data from both the 75 mm and 125 mm roofs was available are included in the comparison between substrate depths 2 4 statistical analysis in order to test for substrate treatment effects on runoff while also accounting for storm size as a co variate with runoff ancova analysis compared the slopes of storm size runoff relationships for the two substrate size categories proc glm sas version 9 2 sas institute cary nc this assumes a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff we confirmed this using the shapiro wilks test for the normality of the regression residuals because storm size was not normally distributed in our study we further compared the average percent retention within different storm size categories using paired t tests 3 results continuous rainfall and runoff measurements were taken for 12 full months beginning february 1 2014 and ending january 31 2015 analysis of the entire year of data omitting all storms and time periods with incomplete data is presented below 3 1 precipitation and irrigation during test period and seasonal performance there was a total of 807 6 mm of measured precipitation on the test site during the study period the precipitation varied strongly with the season 70 of the yearly runoff occurred in the six months from nov apr for the purpose of this study a rain event was defined as any event with greater than 0 50 mm precipitation and with a dry period of least six hours before and after any measurable precipitation voyde et al 2010 runoff events had an average size of 9 8 mm but a median value of 5 2 mm indicating that most runoff events were relatively small with some outlying large storms runoff for individual storm events was calculated as all runoff discharged from the green roof beginning with the first measurable precipitation and continuing until the start of the next rain event this method of calculating runoff ensures that the sum of runoff from all storm events will be equal to the total annual runoff and also accounts for all runoff due to each individual storm there were 82 rain events with complete runoff data from both roofs available runoff and precipitation from events with incomplete data are not included aggregate monthly statistics of precipitation and runoff are summarized in fig 4 the solid line reflects the combination of irrigation and rain which peaks in the summer months but results in virtually no runoff due to the controlled rates of application of irrigation the peak runoff occurs in the month of march over the course of the entire study the 125 mm green roof retained 32 9 of all rainfall and the 75 mm green roof retained 23 2 however there was actually greater runoff from the 125 mm green roof during the months of february and december an effect that is not readily explained from the available data table 1 presents summary statistics for discrete precipitation events for the 75 mm and 125 mm green roofs the performance of the green roofs was considered as a percentage of rain retained each season the 12 month study period was broken down into four seasons of three months each in order to gain a better understanding of the climatic effects on the performance of the roof the performance of both the 75 mm and 125 mm showed a strong seasonal dependence with high retention values in the summer months and low retention in the winter months 3 2 performance during storm events of different size and antecedent moisture conditions the capacity of a green roof to retain storm water depends on several parameters that can be controlled i e substrate depth slope substrate vegetation and on some that cannot be controlled namely the size and frequency of precipitation events 3 2 1 effect of size of rain event table 2 breaks down the performance of both green roofs by the size of individual precipitation events both roofs show significantly better performance for small storms retention during storm events was calculated as the runoff during the storm and extending six hours after the end of measurable precipitation for each event no overall effect of depth on mm retained was found to be significant t test p 0 28 further tests were run including only storms within defined ranges of depth same depth ranges as in table 2 storms between 5 and 10 mm in depth were the only range to show a statistically significant effect of depth t test p 0 03 fig 5 shows the runoff for each individual storm event plotted against the size of the rain event a linear relationship is seen for both substrate depths the slope of the linear best fit for the 125 mm green roof was lower than that of the 75 mm green roof suggesting that it was able to retain more storm water during events an ancova analysis of runoff and precipitation data showed when the influence of storm size on runoff was factored out as using the type iii sum of squares results there was no significant effect of substrate depth on runoff p 0 17 fig 6 shows the residuals associated with these aforementioned regressions after fewer than 8 outliers were removed shapiro wilks testing confirmed normality of these residuals w 0 98 p 0 69 α 0 05 3 2 2 antecedent dry weather period and storm water retention the retention for individual events showed a strong dependence on both the length of the antecedent dry weather period and the size of the event it was found that when storm events fall closely together in time the performance of both roofs suffered figs 7 and 8 demonstrate the effect of antecedent dry weather period adwp on retention the storm depicted in fig 7 occurred after a period of seven days without precipitation and featured 10 7 mm of precipitation over 19 5 h the difference in performance between substrate depths was substantial in this storm fig 8 is a hydrograph of a 36 3 mm storm event in march which occurred after an antecedent dry period of only 38 h runoff from both roofs is nearly identical throughout the event with the 125 mm roof retaining 5 4 mm and the 75 mm roof retaining 4 8 mm of precipitation the poor performance of both roofs in this storm was found to be typical of storms with short adwp it is clear that the roofs are unable to dry out with these short dry periods in between storms indicating that the longer the dry period between storms the better the roofs will perform 4 discussion this study found that the storm water runoff performance of side by side green roofs of different depths depended strongly on the precipitation patterns adwp and size of rain events the largest differences between the two depths was seen only when the soil was below saturation level before precipitation events and for small rain events 5 10 mm for storm events measuring between 5 10 mm precipitation the 125 mm green roof retained significantly more 57 rainfall compared to 32 8 for the 75 mm green roof for large storm events 35 mm there was little difference seen between substrate depths where average retention per event was 13 2 and 15 9 for the 125 mm and 75 mm roofs respectively more research is needed to understand how the shallower roof slightly outperformed the deeper roof in this storm size category one explanation might be that large storms could push stored water previously held by gravity into runoff and deeper substrates presumably have more water in storage another explanation might be that the shallow roof heated up more quickly evaporating water away and creating more storage capacity the antecedent dry period was found berkompas et al 2008 voyde et al 2010 to be one of the most important parameters in predicting storm water performance we also have evidence to support this in our study substrate depth effects on runoff were more pronounced when there was a longer antecedent dry weather period figs 7 and 8 additional data on substrate moisture content or load cell measurements could be used to compare rates of evapotranspiration in the different substrate depths however due to the large size of the roof we were not able to get readings that we felt would be representative of the different microclimates present for both substrate depths performance in summer months was much higher than winter performance the poor winter and strong summer performance demonstrated here has been reported in other similar studies of extensive green roofs specifically in the pacific northwest e g spolek 2008 schroll et al 2011 berkompas et al 2008 this is also consistent with the findings of viola et al 2017 whose model of green roof performance in different climate showed the worst performance in mediterranean climates where rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were mismatched from our analysis it is apparent that consistently wet climates such as the pacific northwest winter months make it difficult for green roofs to retain a large fraction of incoming precipitation while the average yearly rainfall in portland is close to the national average the number of wet days is higher than average resulting in soil moisture values that hover close to saturation levels for extended periods of time at the same time the region experiences several months of drought during the warm and dry summer months with more than half of annual precipitation falling in the months of november through february the strong dependence of green roof performance on weather conditions and the generally lower temperatures and extended periods of precipitation characteristic of the pacific northwest schroll et al 2011 make it apparent that storm water management via green roofs for this region is a complicated task it is unlikely that irrigation affected the overall findings of this study that increasing substrate depth did not proportionally reduce annual runoff this is largely a result of the fact that most of the runoff during the study period 70 occurred during times for which no irrigation was applied due to the aforementioned dry summers irrigation is typical of many green roofs in portland however most of the green roofs documented in the local online database managed by the authors and the city of portland https ecoroofs research pdx edu do not report any irrigation information for the 80 or so sites that do report on irrigation 75 percent indicate some kind of watering practice as such despite the fact that the roofs in our study were irrigated our findings are still broadly applicable since this practice is typical in our region overall ancova analysis showed no significant effect of increased substrate depth on runoff that was consistent over the entire range of storms we experienced in our study fig 5 this analysis is useful for identifying effects of greenroof design on runoff that might otherwise be masked by the large effect of storm size on runoff however using ancova in this way does require the relationship between rainfall and runoff to be linear like others in our region schroll et al 2011 we were able to demonstrate this relationship and carry out this test fig 6 in other locations where the rainfall runoff relationship is for example quadratic elliott et al 2016 the curve may need to be sectioned out or a different test chosen future research should explore the effects of even more variable substrate depths on stormwater retention by green roofs perhaps via modeling for the portland region the performance of a green roof in mitigating storm water is of greatest importance during storm events when flooding or combined storm water sewage system overflow is possible even though the ancova analysis didn t find a consistently higher rate of retention by the deeper roof an annual 10 increase in retention from the deeper roof could have meaningful effects on stormwater management in the portland region if this water storage comes at the right time of year the benefit of additional substrate depth was shown in the study for the spring and fall months this could have some effect on combined sewer overflow that could occur during late fall and early spring but little effect was noted for winter storms when the risk of cso would be greatest it should be further noted that these findings are based on measurements from irrigated green roofs planted in an herbaceous succulent mix subject to the weather and precipitation of portland oregon future work should explore different design combinations that might increase retention in the pacific northwest especially given that this was a new roof constructed in 2014 it may even be possible that once the plants become more established that the depth effect on overall retention will increase through the process of evapotranspiration for example these plants may reduce the length of adwp necessary to produce this desired retention variable substrate depth could allow for an increased plant palette thuring et al 2010 as well as measures of plant growth such as coverage and root density durhman and rowe 2007 getter and rowe 2009 lu et al 2015 a strong interaction between substrate depth and planting type was observed for 120 and 200 mm deep green roofs in italy nardini et al 2011 5 conclusions by studying annual precipitation patterns including frequency and magnitude of storm events in various climates better decisions can be made in regard to storm water management practices in order for a deeper green roof to perform better than a shallow one the soil must be dry enough so that its capacity to hold water is higher than the shallow roof in conclusion our findings suggest that when portland s annual weather patterns and storm characteristics are taken into account increasing green roof substrate depth by 50 mm may result in a 10 increase in annual retention however we also found that the effect of increased substrate depth was only statistically significant for 5 10 mm storms accounting for only a third of the annual precipitation total future studies involving a larger range of substrate depths might reveal more substantial effects we advise managers to consider whether the timing of the retention that results from added substrate depth is relevant to storm water management challenges thus when designing a green roof system for storm water retention it is imperative that efforts to increase storage capacity through increased substrate depth be paired with efforts to ensure rapid removal if deeper substrates are to be utilized effectively more research is needed

8506,study region this study took place in portland oregon a city of over 600 000 residents located in the willamette valley in the state of oregon in the pacific northwest region of the united states portland experiences a temperate climate with mediterranean features study focus runoff patterns from two extensive green roofs with substrate depths of 75 and 125 mm situated on a 5000 square meter retail store were compared over a one year period precipitation irrigation and storm water discharge were continuously monitored and the performance of the green roofs for storm water control was investigated in detail new hydrological insights for the region over the study period the 125 mm and 75 mm green roofs retained 32 9 and 23 2 of all precipitation by volume respectively the hydrologic response of the green roofs during individual storm events was found to depend strongly on the total depth of the storm event as well as the length of the antecedent dry weather period differences in performance between the two substrate depths were most pronounced for small storms with long antecedent dry weather periods both green roofs showed strong seasonal dependence in storm water retention with higher percent retention in the relatively dry summer months compared to lower retention in the wetter winter months these findings have important implications for the effective installation of green roofs for stormwater management in our region because of the increased frequency of storm events during the pacific northwest winters it is imperative that efforts to increase storage capacity through increased substrate depth be paired with efforts to ensure rapid removal if deeper substrates are to be utilized effectively more research is needed to identify ways to increase evapotranspiration for example via more informed plant selection during wet winter months keywords storm water green roofs substrate depth flow attenuation hydrology 1 introduction as cities grow and become more densely populated the fraction of the urban surface made up of impervious materials increases e g carlson and arthur 2000 jia et al 2002 among other challenges such expansion leads to increased stress on storm water management systems driving interest in innovative solutions to reduce storm water volume and peak flow u s epa 2015 miles and band 2015 green roofs also known as eco roofs living roofs or vegetated roofs provide numerous benefits including aesthetic appeal additional habitat for wildlife increased energy efficiency of the building and mitigation of urban heat island effects getter and rowe 2006 lundholm 2006 sailor and hagos 2011 susca et al 2011 green roofs also affect storm water runoff as they are able to temporarily detain some of the incident precipitation this results in a delay in the timing of peak flow rates into storm water systems through evaporation from the substrate surface and transpiration from the vegetation green roofs are also able to reduce runoff when considering green roofs for storm water management reducing total runoff volume and attenuating peak flows are often of greatest concern past studies have shown that green roofs are able to retain storm water reduce peak flow and increase time to peak flow villarreal and bengtsson 2005 spolek 2008 voyde et al 2010 controlling storm water runoff is important to reduce risks of flooding in urban environments of the many factors in play when considering the performance of a green roof for storm water control during a storm event one well studied yet also debated factor is substrate depth it would seem intuitive that deeper substrate would be an important factor that should improve storm water performance however conflicting evidence has been reported in a 12 month study of extensive green roofs in new zealand voyde et al 2010 found no significant difference in performance between 50 mm and 70 mm deep extensive green roofs in another study from new zealand where four green roofs of varying substrate depth were concurrently monitored runoff reduction was not shown to depend on substrate depth fassman beck et al 2013 in a three year study of five different extensive green roofs in seattle wa berkompas et al 2008 reported no relationship between storm water retention and substrate depth for substrate depths 100 mm perhaps the counter intuitive relationship between depth and retention can be explained by the known influence of precipitation characteristics on storm water retention by green roofs environmental conditions especially storm frequency may affect the degree to which additional storage created by increased depth can be accessed in a study of an 80 mm deep test bed stovin 2010 reported that the storm water performance depended most strongly on rainfall amount rainfall intensity and length of the antecedent dry period fassman beck et al 2013 also found runoff reduction during storm events by green roofs to be well predicted by the size of the storm voyde et al 2010 reported that the antecedent dry period for a storm was the most important factor in predicting rates of storm water retention the storm water performance vis à vis reducing total runoff of a green roof has also been found to decrease during wetter seasons and when storm events occur close together e g voyde et al 2010 stovin 2010 for example van seters et al 2009 reported that in comparison to a conventional roof an extensive green roof in toronto reduced runoff by 42 in two wet months but reduced runoff by 70 93 during the drier summer months in their study of three green roofs in new york city researchers were able to demonstrate a seasonal influence on runoff for storms of 10 40 mm in depth carson et al 2013 spolek 2008 reported strong seasonal variation in the performance of a green roof in portland or with runoff reductions of 12 in winter compared with 42 in summer it should be noted that out of all studies mentioned above the two conducted in new zealand a subtropical climate with an average of 137 wet days spread relatively evenly throughout the year were the only ones not showing significant seasonal variation in performance the works discussed here provide evidence that rainfall patterns are an important factor in predicting green roof performance for storm water mitigation substrate depth is a key factor being considered by managers when establishing design criteria yet the relationship between increasing depth and increased retention is not well understood differences in storm event characteristics could explain variation in the substrate depth effect additional research on this topic is especially needed in the pacific northwest of the u s due to its unique climate and dense concentration of green roofs we compared the performance of green roofs with different substrate depths 75 and 125 mm across a range of storm scenarios typical of urban portland or in order to advance our understanding of the interplay between substrate depth and storm characteristics and their effect on green roof performance storm water mitigation associated with two green roof installations on the same building in portland was analyzed over the course of 12 months and individual storm events were analyzed in detail so that any relationships among substrate depth runoff and precipitation patterns could be established 2 methodology 2 1 study site the present study was conducted on a test roof on a new large retail store in portland or w 45 52 n 122 68 building construction was completed in late 2013 and installation of the sensors and equipment on the roof was finished in january 2014 the study site included an extensive green roof divided into three equal 1200 m2 sections of varying substrate depths next to an impermeable 1468 m2 conventional white membrane roof section each roof section was isolated from the others forming unique drainage basins an additional section of roughly 4000 m2 conventional white membrane roof was not monitored one section of green roof had a soil depth of 75 mm the second had a depth of 125 mm and the third section featured spatially varying soil substrate depth only the uniform depth green roof sections were analyzed in this research fig 1 shows a schematic of the roof along with locations of the weather stations used to monitor air temperature rainfall wind direction wind speed solar radiation and soil conditions images of the various roof sections and monitoring stations are shown in fig 2 as illustrated in fig 3 the green roof construction included a waterproof membrane a coarse aggregate foundation layer surface substrate and vegetation the substrate consisted of pumice compost and sandy loam progro oregon vegetation included an assortment of cuttings of nine sedum plant species sedum spurium sedum floriferum weihenstephaner gold sedum phedimus takesimense sedum rupestre angelina sedum divergens sedum album micranthemum sedum album athoum and sedum sexangulare and a seed mixture of 15 additional species lomatium urticulatum eriophyllum lanatum viola praemorsa collinsia grandiflora plagiobothyrs nothofulvus camassia quamash dianthus deltoids talinum calycinum clarkia sp penstemon sp achillea millefolium geranium sanguineum phlox sp lewisia sp erigeron aureus 2 2 instrumentation runoff was measured independently from the 75 mm thick green roof the 125 mm green roof and the conventional roof section using plasti fab extra large 60 degree trapezoidal flumes recording five minute averages of flow runoff from the third section of green roof featuring varying soil depths was not measured rainfall was recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge located on the conventional roof in increments of 0 254 mm rainfall and soil moisture content measurements were recorded at a sampling rate of 5 min and averaged over 15 min 2 3 irrigation and leakage on test site the irrigation schedule for both green roofs was controlled by a hydropoint controller which used local weather conditions to estimate evapotranspiration and soil moisture content the green roofs were irrigated daily from april 14 2014 to october 8 2014 during the test period february 1 2014 to january 31 2015 the hydropoint system was set to water according to evaporative demand as estimated by the irrigation control system using data from the weather station the irrigation was assumed to have been distributed evenly between both green roof sections since both roofs were irrigated with the same amounts and at the same times we are still able to test for the treatment effect of depth under these conditions there was no evidence of runoff from either roof being caused solely by irrigation i e all runoff was recorded during or following rain events at any point during the study period with one exception in june 2014 during this time there was a leak in the irrigation system which intermittently caused large amounts of water to be poured onto the roof between june 9 2014 and june 28 2014 the largest value for irrigation during this time was recorded on june 17 and was equivalent to 42 1 mm of precipitation being added to each roof due to its location evidence of this leak was only seen in the runoff from the 75 mm green roof and the conventional white roof the artificial runoff coming from the leakage made analysis of four distinct june rain events impossible but was determined to be inconsequential for the rain event on june 22 2014 outside of this leak irrigation values were recorded as daily total volumes and had an average daily value of 14 0 m3 which is equivalent to 2 9 mm of precipitation being added to the green roof we were able to capture runoff for every storm from both sections with the exception of two events runoff measurements from the 75 mm roof were unavailable for a 62 1 mm storm event on october 21 and a 13 7 mm storm on december 10 for the sake of statistical analysis and consistency only events in which complete runoff data from both the 75 mm and 125 mm roofs was available are included in the comparison between substrate depths 2 4 statistical analysis in order to test for substrate treatment effects on runoff while also accounting for storm size as a co variate with runoff ancova analysis compared the slopes of storm size runoff relationships for the two substrate size categories proc glm sas version 9 2 sas institute cary nc this assumes a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff we confirmed this using the shapiro wilks test for the normality of the regression residuals because storm size was not normally distributed in our study we further compared the average percent retention within different storm size categories using paired t tests 3 results continuous rainfall and runoff measurements were taken for 12 full months beginning february 1 2014 and ending january 31 2015 analysis of the entire year of data omitting all storms and time periods with incomplete data is presented below 3 1 precipitation and irrigation during test period and seasonal performance there was a total of 807 6 mm of measured precipitation on the test site during the study period the precipitation varied strongly with the season 70 of the yearly runoff occurred in the six months from nov apr for the purpose of this study a rain event was defined as any event with greater than 0 50 mm precipitation and with a dry period of least six hours before and after any measurable precipitation voyde et al 2010 runoff events had an average size of 9 8 mm but a median value of 5 2 mm indicating that most runoff events were relatively small with some outlying large storms runoff for individual storm events was calculated as all runoff discharged from the green roof beginning with the first measurable precipitation and continuing until the start of the next rain event this method of calculating runoff ensures that the sum of runoff from all storm events will be equal to the total annual runoff and also accounts for all runoff due to each individual storm there were 82 rain events with complete runoff data from both roofs available runoff and precipitation from events with incomplete data are not included aggregate monthly statistics of precipitation and runoff are summarized in fig 4 the solid line reflects the combination of irrigation and rain which peaks in the summer months but results in virtually no runoff due to the controlled rates of application of irrigation the peak runoff occurs in the month of march over the course of the entire study the 125 mm green roof retained 32 9 of all rainfall and the 75 mm green roof retained 23 2 however there was actually greater runoff from the 125 mm green roof during the months of february and december an effect that is not readily explained from the available data table 1 presents summary statistics for discrete precipitation events for the 75 mm and 125 mm green roofs the performance of the green roofs was considered as a percentage of rain retained each season the 12 month study period was broken down into four seasons of three months each in order to gain a better understanding of the climatic effects on the performance of the roof the performance of both the 75 mm and 125 mm showed a strong seasonal dependence with high retention values in the summer months and low retention in the winter months 3 2 performance during storm events of different size and antecedent moisture conditions the capacity of a green roof to retain storm water depends on several parameters that can be controlled i e substrate depth slope substrate vegetation and on some that cannot be controlled namely the size and frequency of precipitation events 3 2 1 effect of size of rain event table 2 breaks down the performance of both green roofs by the size of individual precipitation events both roofs show significantly better performance for small storms retention during storm events was calculated as the runoff during the storm and extending six hours after the end of measurable precipitation for each event no overall effect of depth on mm retained was found to be significant t test p 0 28 further tests were run including only storms within defined ranges of depth same depth ranges as in table 2 storms between 5 and 10 mm in depth were the only range to show a statistically significant effect of depth t test p 0 03 fig 5 shows the runoff for each individual storm event plotted against the size of the rain event a linear relationship is seen for both substrate depths the slope of the linear best fit for the 125 mm green roof was lower than that of the 75 mm green roof suggesting that it was able to retain more storm water during events an ancova analysis of runoff and precipitation data showed when the influence of storm size on runoff was factored out as using the type iii sum of squares results there was no significant effect of substrate depth on runoff p 0 17 fig 6 shows the residuals associated with these aforementioned regressions after fewer than 8 outliers were removed shapiro wilks testing confirmed normality of these residuals w 0 98 p 0 69 α 0 05 3 2 2 antecedent dry weather period and storm water retention the retention for individual events showed a strong dependence on both the length of the antecedent dry weather period and the size of the event it was found that when storm events fall closely together in time the performance of both roofs suffered figs 7 and 8 demonstrate the effect of antecedent dry weather period adwp on retention the storm depicted in fig 7 occurred after a period of seven days without precipitation and featured 10 7 mm of precipitation over 19 5 h the difference in performance between substrate depths was substantial in this storm fig 8 is a hydrograph of a 36 3 mm storm event in march which occurred after an antecedent dry period of only 38 h runoff from both roofs is nearly identical throughout the event with the 125 mm roof retaining 5 4 mm and the 75 mm roof retaining 4 8 mm of precipitation the poor performance of both roofs in this storm was found to be typical of storms with short adwp it is clear that the roofs are unable to dry out with these short dry periods in between storms indicating that the longer the dry period between storms the better the roofs will perform 4 discussion this study found that the storm water runoff performance of side by side green roofs of different depths depended strongly on the precipitation patterns adwp and size of rain events the largest differences between the two depths was seen only when the soil was below saturation level before precipitation events and for small rain events 5 10 mm for storm events measuring between 5 10 mm precipitation the 125 mm green roof retained significantly more 57 rainfall compared to 32 8 for the 75 mm green roof for large storm events 35 mm there was little difference seen between substrate depths where average retention per event was 13 2 and 15 9 for the 125 mm and 75 mm roofs respectively more research is needed to understand how the shallower roof slightly outperformed the deeper roof in this storm size category one explanation might be that large storms could push stored water previously held by gravity into runoff and deeper substrates presumably have more water in storage another explanation might be that the shallow roof heated up more quickly evaporating water away and creating more storage capacity the antecedent dry period was found berkompas et al 2008 voyde et al 2010 to be one of the most important parameters in predicting storm water performance we also have evidence to support this in our study substrate depth effects on runoff were more pronounced when there was a longer antecedent dry weather period figs 7 and 8 additional data on substrate moisture content or load cell measurements could be used to compare rates of evapotranspiration in the different substrate depths however due to the large size of the roof we were not able to get readings that we felt would be representative of the different microclimates present for both substrate depths performance in summer months was much higher than winter performance the poor winter and strong summer performance demonstrated here has been reported in other similar studies of extensive green roofs specifically in the pacific northwest e g spolek 2008 schroll et al 2011 berkompas et al 2008 this is also consistent with the findings of viola et al 2017 whose model of green roof performance in different climate showed the worst performance in mediterranean climates where rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were

8507,study region brussels belgium and nantes france two cities located in oceanic settings study focus the article assesses the capabilities of detecting the presence of groundwater in sewers and waste water in storm sewers also called parasitic waters which increase sewer overflows risk augment the water treatment plant operation costs and pollute downstream rivers this is done by means of laser absorption spectroscopy las instruments that favor the development of stable isotopes δ18o and δd as tracer of urban waters the study first describes the factors affecting isotopic composition of urban waters it also describes how to optimize the use of stable isotopes either alone or coupled with other tracers to detect parasitic waters new hydrological insights in nantes groundwater intrusions were detected above 8 of the sewer water flow and waste water inflows above 14 of the sewer water flow in brussels the stable isotopes may trace the presence of parasitic groundwater in a small part of the city territory 9 km2 this study concludes that stable isotopes can be used as tracer of parasitic waters in low altitude cities close to the ocean when domestic water originates from catchments extending into the continent in this case tracing studies may take advantage of the seasonal variation of the isotopic composition of waste waters on the condition of assessing the other factors that impact the isotopic composition of urban waters as done here keywords δ18o δd stable isotopes parasitic water groundwater waste water inflows sewers 1 introduction 1 1 stable isotopes as tracer water stable isotopes δ18o δd have long been used as tracer in hydrological studies in natural catchments and are increasingly used in urban settings iaea 2002 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the δ18o and δd values expressed in of one particular water body depend on the physico chemical processes e g evaporation and condensation and the climate conditions to which the water body has been subjected iaea 2000a therefore δ18o or δd values may be used to qualify and or quantify the specific climate conditions or the processes that have impacted the different water bodies rozanski 1985 schulte et al 2011 and assess the relative proportion of two or more water sources also called end members in a water body barth and veizer 2004 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 however their applicability as tracers requires sufficient isotopic differences between end members klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the application of such tracers therefore depends on the correct definition of the isotopic composition of each end member and its variability in both time and space and often requires numerous samples and analyses 1 2 parasitic waters an important issue in this article δ18o and δd values are used as tracers in the case of parasitic waters detection in sewers of brussels belgium and nantes france applied to urban areas the term parasitic water refers to the waters that should not be present in sewers they may be sorted into four types 1 groundwater present in combined or sanitary sewers 2 waste water present in the separate storm sewers 3 rainwater present in the separate sanitary sewers 4 domestic waters leaking from supply pipes and entering the combined or sanitary sewers this paper focuses on the first two types of parasitic waters by estimating the mixing proportion of waste water and groundwater in sewers parasitic groundwater generally enters sewers sanitary and combined sewers through cracks openings or failures of the sewer walls where the water table level is higher than the invert of sewers penckwitt et al 2016 groundwater entrances in the sewers can also be caused by direct connections with man made drains set up to protect house basements and or to dry up natural resurgences weiss et al 2002 broadhead et al 2013 parasitic groundwater has damaging consequences i the limitation of the carrying capacity of the combined sewers and consequently the increase of floods and sewer overflows risks ii the augmentation of the volume of water to be treated by water treatment plants wtp with as consequence higher operational costs and through the dilution of the pollutants the reduction of their removal process efficiency de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005a iii the interception of groundwater normally feeding the urban water courses walsh et al 2012 parasitic waste water mainly enters stormwater sewers through undesirable connections from buildings from cross connections between stormwater and waste water sewers or by leakage through failures in the walls of the sewers panasiuk et al 2015 despite their accidental cause these undesirable connections constitute a common problem in many cities which face major difficulties trying to detect and correct these waste water inflows and reduce their negative impacts schilperoort 2004 irvine et al 2011 stormwater sewers are generally not connected to wtp and directly discharge into rivers ponds and lakes therefore parasitic waste water containing nutrients microbes pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds constitutes a potential source of pollution for water bodies these pollutants are toxic for the water biota increase the biological oxygen demand favor the eutrophication of the receiving water body and represent a human health issue if the contaminated water is consumed or even used for recreational purposes prüss 1998 schwarzenbach et al 2010 panasiuk et al 2015 solving parasitic water problems requires detailed knowledge of the waste water inflows and groundwater intrusions in the whole sewer network the systematic inspection of all sewers segments represents an enormous task which demands precautions man power materials and large budgets ellis and butler 2015 in strasbourg france a budget of more than 2 m year is allocated to the rehabilitation program of the sewer system 1600 km length inculding close circuit television cctv inspections astee 2015 kim et al 2009 indicate cctv inspection costs around 7 4 usd per meter of sewer and a budget of 12 7 million usd to inspect the sewers of the city of los angeles moreover the visual inspection of sewers is not able to detect all types of parasitic water entrances panasiuk et al 2015 new scientific methods are thus required to complement optimize and or limit sewer investigations in cities prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 staufer et al 2012 such methods may aim at two different objectives 1 quantification of parasitic water either as absolute i e m3 h or relative values e g of the total flow is generally performed on the main sewers to assess the impact of parasitic waters at the scale of the whole sewer system it should be exhaustive and provide comparable results for all the parts of the sewer system the quantification procedure must be representative by considering either a whole year or several years or a period of high inputs when groundwater table is high generally during winter and spring the expected uncertainty should be in the same range as the uncertainty on the flow rate measurements around 20 of the assessed absolute value bertrand krajewski et al 2000 2 detection aims at providing a presence absence information of parasitic water which is useful at the scale of a particular sewer segment to decide whether detailed investigations i e cctv inspections should be performed detection campaigns performed on a punctual basis and or over limited periods produce valuable results as detection of a parasitic water entrance is an important information to decide on the more detailed inspection and or renovation of sewers consequently representativeness over time although advisable is not a strict requirement as in the quantification procedure being relatively simple to set up the applicability of detection procedures may potentially be compared from one city to another this paper mainly discusses the detection procedure which can be achieved by instant grab sampling and isotope δ18o δd analyses 1 3 stable isotopes to trace parasitic water presence parasitic water flows are generally quantified based on the daily variation of sewer water flow rates de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005a however these methods generally overestimate the parasitic water flows and fail in describing their diurnal variations in addition to flow rate measurements the use of geochemical tracers helps to limit the uncertainty on the calculated volumes of parasitic water flows kracht and gujer 2005 these tracers as salts ammonia concentration chemical oxygen demand may also be used alone to detect the presence of parasitic water but their application is constrained by the varying composition of wastewater during the day kracht and gujer 2005 panasiuk et al 2015 artificial tracers as dye may be used to detect waste water inflows but not groundwater infiltrations because of the high chemical background and the turbidity of the wastewater penckwitt et al 2016 stable isotopes have numerous advantages and may be used alone or in complement to other tracers and methods to detect parasitic waters one first advantage is that stable isotopes are conservative tracers houhou et al 2010 klaus et al 2015 they preserve the original signal of the different parent water bodies involved in a mixing independently of chemical reactions sedimentation etc a second advantage is that they are present in every type of water which is not the case of other geochemical tracers almeida et al 1999 and may detect different types of parasitic waters e g waste water and groundwater stable isotopes have previously and successfully been applied to quantify the parasitic groundwater flows in sewers and water treatment plants wtp of lyon de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b zurich kracht et al 2007 and nancy houhou et al 2010 in these cities domestic water is produced from aquifers or surface water in catchments localized in continental climate nearby high mountains vosges alps fig 1 the high altitude and the lower temperatures affect the isotopic composition of mountain waters with more depleted δ18o and δd values therefore the domestic water derived from high altitude water sources present a more depleted isotopic composition δ18o and δd when compared with the shallow groundwater present under the cities moreover in continental climate large differences of temperature between summer and winter usually induce a modification of the isotopic composition of the rainwater and surface waters with less depleted δ18o and δd values in summer this variation of δ18o and δd value during the year is called seasonality effect iaea 2000b these combined effects altitude and seasonality can differentiate the isotopic composition of groundwater and domestic water up to 3 4 δ18o in lyon and 12 5 δd in zurich de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b kracht et al 2007 other studies tried to apply this method in oceanic climates with moderate success schilperoort 2004 schilperoort et al 2007 dirckx et al 2009 the reason is that in oceanic regions the different water bodies involved present less isotopic variability because of insufficient differences in seasonal temperatures and limited topography effect consequently these studies faced difficulties finding sufficient differences in the isotopic composition between groundwater and domestic water to properly apply the tracing methodology among the 7 cases examined in these studies only two provided satisfactory results there were carried out in arnhem in the netherlands schilperoort et al 2007 and in hamme in belgium dirckx et al 2009 fig 1 in these cities the applications were succesfull because the δ18o distinctiveness between groundwater and domestic water reached 2 25 and 1 4 respectively however the end members were not sufficiently characterized to understand if the method was applicable for the whole city or for a restricted area among all the case studies examined both successful and unsuccessful limiting factors have been pointed out such as the heterogeneity of the isotopic composition of the infiltrating groundwater the variability of the domestic water composition along the year the complexity of the domestic water network however these studies did not assess separately each factor and consequently their results are difficult to compare the potential of stable isotopes methods to localize and quantify parasitic water in oceanic cities remains thus uncertain and difficult to assess with respect to the available literature overall the current literature presents gaps on the use of stable isotopes to trace parasitic waters for instance when first proposed more than 10 years ago stable isotopes methods were constrained by limited analytical capacities today thanks to laser absorption spectroscopy las instruments isotopic studies can be based on a large number of samples to better characterize the composition of the end members and its variation in time and space berman et al 2009 van geldern and barth 2012 past studies in continental and oceanic climates also commonly used only one water isotope to quantify parasitic groundwater now that δ18o and δd are simultaneously analyzed with the same las instrument at higher frequency and with smaller sample volumes it is possible to test both tracers δ18o and δd on the same samples finally past studies considered that domestic water and waste water have the same isotopic composition because the differences found were weak in comparison to analytical uncertainty schilperoort 2004 the increased precision of the new laser instruments for δd and the possible higher frequency of measurement allow us to detect small isotopic differences between the different urban waters 1 4 objectives while existing literature principally detailed the method and its adaptation with post treatment or complementary tracers this study emphasizes the determination of the end members isotopic composition the objective of this study is to highlight the necessary work to obtain a reliable idea of the potential of stable isotopes as tracer of parasitic water for a city and to give the main keys to optimize the use of stable isotopes as tracers this article also aims at filling the gaps in current knowledge that can be summarized by the 4 following questions 1 what is the influence of seasonality on the applicability of the method in oceanic settings 2 what is the impact of end member isotopic variability on the method 3 is the isotopic composition of waste water the same as that of domestic water 4 what are the benefits of using two isotopes measured with reduced analytical uncertainty to answer these questions we consider the cases of nantes and brussels two cities presenting a priori unfavorable conditions for stable isotopic methods because of their oceanic climate and low altitude however part of the domestic water in these two cities is produced from river water with catchments extending further in the continent fig 1 the domestic water thus potentially presents a seasonality effect that may favor the application of stable isotopes as tracers of parasitic waters the comparison of the two case studies presenting different environmental conditions and water infrastructure highlights the general factors determining the potential of stable isotopes for the detection of parasitic waters in oceanic cities and gives the tools to optimize the sampling campaigns 2 case studies 2 1 brussels brussels area 161 km2 is centered on the senne valley in a relatively flat setting with local hills and valleys ranging from 15 m near the river to 110 m in the heights located mainly to the east southeast and to a lesser extent to the northwest of the city it is located about 110 km east of the north sea coast here we consider the potential use of stable isotopes to trace the entrance of groundwater from the brussels sands aquifer system and the ypresian hills aquifer system brussels environment 2011 into the combined sewer system in the brussels sands aquifer system the water table depth ranges from few meters below the surface in the bottom of valleys to more than 30 m in the middle of the highest hills dam et al 1986 the brussels sands aquifer largely extends on the eastern bank of the senne 55 of the brussels area the intrusion of groundwater into the combined sewers potentially occurs only in limited geographic areas where the topographical surface cuts the base of the sandy aquifer underlined by impermeable clay buffel and matthijs 2008 a similar scenario is present in the valley where the water table is near the surface the ypresian hills aquifer system is composed of alternating sand and clay layers of 5 10 m in thickness this aquifer presents about twenty springs feeding ponds and streams which are connected to the sewer system downstream these springs visible in public parks and green zones are located at different altitudes because of the presence of clay layers and small perched aquifers this complex aquifer system is present in the north west of brussels and covers about 13 of the brussels area brussels environment 2011 for the most impacted sewers in brussels the parasitic groundwater may represent up to 77 of the total volume of water brussels environment 2011 because during urbanization most streams and small rivers were incorporated or redirected into the sewer network mahaut et al 2011 the sources of these rivers remain connected to the sewers and probably contribute large volumes of parasitic water in addition groundwater also infiltrates through cracks and permeable joints of the old sewers brussels environment 2011 the relative contribution and the localization of these two types of entrance of parasitic waters springs and deteriorated pipes are unknown however this information is fundamental for a sustainable management of brussels waters for the production of domestic water in brussels local groundwater is extracted from the brussels sands aquifer with 7 wells and 1 underground gallery providing only 2 of the brussels water supply most groundwater is extracted outside brussels from natural springs wells quarry lakes and underground galleries in 17 production sites localized up to 80 km away from brussels water from the meuse river is pumped 50 km south east of brussels in profondeville and provides nowaday about 30 of the city s water supply vivaqua 2012 the meuse catchment upstream of the production plant extends southward to the meuse spring localized 350 km from brussels fig 1 in brussels water from the different production plants is mixed in varying proportions as a function of the season the maintenance works the consumption and the reselling to other distribution companies in belgium dirckx et al 2009 brussels domestic water is therefore composed of a variable mix of meuse river water and groundwater 2 2 nantes located at the confluence of the loire the erdre and the sevre rivers 55 km far from the atlantic coast the city of nantes has a gentle topography with an altitude varying between 5 and 80 m a s l the city territory 65 2 km2 extends onto the major bed of the loire and onto a plateau composed of bedrock with superficial deposits notched by small valleys given the geology two types of shallow aquifers can be found the plateau aquifers eolian silt over weathered bedrock and the alluvial aquifers here we consider the aquifers in the plateau area which is located on the northern bank of the loire and covers 67 of the city territory in most of the area the groundwater depth is within 5 m below the surface in many locations within the nantes underground groundwater infiltrates into the sewers reducing the carrying capacity of the stormwater network and increasing the volume of water treated in wtp of nantes belhadj et al 1995 half of the city area mainly the city center is equipped with combined sewers while separate sewers extend underneath the other half domestic water in the city of nantes is exclusively produced from the loire river pumped 15 km upstream of the city center this study details a sampling campaign that occurred in the pin sec neighborhood localized in the east of nantes whose surface area is 31 ha in this area the separate sewer network is composed of a 7 3 km waste water sewer and a 4 km stormwater sewer the pin sec sector is the hydrological catchment defined by the outlet of the stormwater sewer this catchment has a mean altitude of 22 m asl and a mean slope of 0 9 two geological configurations are present in this area 1 silt over locally weathered mica schist is predominant on the upstream part of the neighborhood and 2 alluvial deposits are located downstream in the valley of the gohards stream to which the stormwater sewer is connected the water table is between 1 and 2 5 m deep in winter and 3 4 m deep in summer le delliou et al 2009 3 methods 3 1 the mixing line method during dry periods the water flowing into the sewers is composed of a mix of groundwater and waste water as showed by de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b the mixing line method applied with stable isotopes either δ18o or δd estimates a dimensionless proportion of a component e g groundwater in a compound waste water groundwater for an absolute assessment e g flow or volumes complementary discharge information must be added to the obtained proportion estimation the mixing line method as developed by de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b can only be applied if there are two distinct end members e g waste water and groundwater contributing to the mixing of waters in sewers if the end members are unknown and or if there are more than 2 end members other methods such as the end member mixing analysis emma should be used christophersen et al 1990 liu et al 2008 burns et al 2001 vazquez sune et al 2010 the emma method has the advantage of integrating multiple tracers which could be specific of the local groundwater and of the domestic uses it could therefore be applied to detect parasitic waters in sewers however the results are dependent of the type and the number of tracers and therefore could be difficult to compare between case studies barthold et al 2011 to reveal the capabilities and the specificities of the stable isotopes as tracer we decided to apply the mixing line method with stable isotopes only the proportion of parasitic groundwater p in the sample is calculated with eq 1 if δ18o is used as tracer then a and b are calculated with the eqs 2a and 3a if δd is used one should refer to the eqs 2b and 3b to estimate the proportion of waste water inflows the terms a b must be inverted in the eq 1 1 p 100 a a b 2a a δ 18 o m i x δ 18 o w w 2b a δdmix δdww 3a b δ o 18 gw δ o 18 mix 3b b δdgw δdmix where p is the he proportion of parasitic groundwater a is the distance in between the measured sample on the mixing line δ18omix or δdmix and the waste water end member δ18oww or δdww and b is the distance in between the groundwater end member δ18ogw or δdgw and the same sample δ18omix or δdmix 3 2 uncertainty on the proportion of parasitic water the suitability of the mixing line method for the detection of parasitic water depends on the uncertainty of the proportion estimation eq 4 expresses the uncertainty on p σp obtained by propagating uncertainty on the eqs 1 3 jcgm 2008 the σp depends on the analytical uncertainty of the measurement realized on the sewer water sample σmix on the uncertainty associated to the mean isotopic composition of the end members σgw and σww on the distance between the end members a b and on the position of the sample on the mixing line a and b σmix corresponds to the analytical uncertainty on one measurement σgw and σww integrate the analytical uncertainty but also the spatial and temporal variability of the end members calculated on analyses of many samples the analytical uncertainty is commonly one order of magnitude smaller than the variability of the end members in this case the analytical uncertainty could be neglected for the calculation of the end member uncertainty 4 σ p 100 a b 2 b 2 σ m i x 2 σ w w 2 a 2 σ m i x 2 σ g w 2 where σp is the uncertainty on p σmix in is the analytical uncertainty of the measurement realized on the sewer water sample σgw in is the uncertainty associated to the mean isotopic composition of the groundwater end member σww in is the uncertainty associated to the mean isotopic composition of the waste water end members p may be calculated using either δ18o p18o or δd pd measurements but the two tracers may be also coupled to reduce the uncertainty on the calculated proportion in this case pm is the mean of p18o and pd and σpm is calculated with the eq 5 5 σ p m σ 2 p 18 o σ 2 p d 2 where σp18o is the uncertainty on p calculated with δ18o σpd is the uncertainty on p calculated with δd and σpm is the uncertainty on p calculated with δ18o and δd eq 5 without a covariance term is valid only if δ18o or δd are independent tracers jcgm 2008 however measuring δ18o and δd simultaneously with the same instrument on a single sample may introduce an analytical correlation between δ18o and δd indeed the absorption peak of the abundant isotopologue h2 16o is used to calculate both δ18o and δd values moreover the experimental conditions may affect similarly the measurements of the two isotopes this analytical correlation has been assessed through control measurements that were realized on the same sample between november 2013 and february 2017 121 measurements cf table a1 in appendix a the correlation coefficient found is weak r2 0 4 and it has been verified that the covariance cov 0 004 is negligible in comparison with the terms of eq 5 for all the results presented here 3 3 detection threshold of the isotopic mixing line method the sources of uncertainty in eq 5 are the factors limiting the stable isotopes mixing line method already pointed out before in this study and in the literature de benedittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b schilperoort 2004 therefore the uncertainty on parasitic water proportion σp could potentially be used as indicator of the applicability of the mixing line method however σp calculated on one single sample eq 4 depends on the mixing proportions and therefore varies from one sample to another so we define another indicator to synthesize the combined effect of all sources of uncertainty that we call the detection threshold p0 p0 is the smallest value of p that indicates the presence of parasitic water with a confidence level of 95 under the assumption of normal distribution of p p0 is the smallest value of p higher than 2σp if the value of p measured for a sample is equal or higher than p0 for one tracer or for the average eq 5 parasitic water is detected in the sample fig 2 the concept of detection threshold is similar to the limit of detection lod defined for analytical methods jcgm 2012 but the value of p0 also takes into account factors of uncertainty as the spatial and or temporal variability of the two end members as the isotopic composition of the two end members is rarely homogeneous and constant over entire cities p0 varies with time and from one part of the city to another in this study we determine and compare the lowest p0 available in brussels and nantes over periods of 2 3 months the duration is pragmatically selected as the time required to include a sufficient number of dry days to organize sewer sampling campaigns indeed parasitic water detection using stable isotopes requires the organization of multiple sampling campaigns to reach more precise results see further and to explore the numerous sewer segments potentially impacted by parasitic water 3 4 sampling and analyses a total of 265 water samples were collected during the period october 2010 september 2014 in glass or high density poly ethylene bottles hermetically sealed with caps dedicated for long time storage and with paraffin film the bottles were stored in the dark at 4 c before analyses at the vrije universiteit brussels stable isotopes laboratory we performed replication tests that showed that storage time did not affect the quality of the results groundwater was sampled in natural springs or in groundwater pumping stations and observation wells after the water in pipes and wells potentially in contact with air was totally purged the domestic water was collected in household taps located within the investigated parts of the cities once or twice a month also after purging the water already present in pipes the waste water was manually collected in manholes and segments of sewers in the morning 8a m 1p m in both case studies rainwater was collected in samplers that automatically close after the rain event to avoid fractionation of the isotopic composition due to evaporation groundwater rainwater and waste water samples were filtered at 0 2 μm via syringe filters before analysis using a laser absorption spectroscopy las instrument picarro l2130 i the las instruments make isotopic analysis relatively robust fast and low cost las instruments determine the isotopic composition of water by measuring the energy absorption in the near infra red range by the rotational vibrational transitions in three isotopologues h2 18o h2 16o and hd16o of the water molecule van geldern and barth 2012 however las measurements are vulnerable to dissolved organic carbon methane and methanol present in water which may interfere with the absorption spectrum of the water vapor and could affect the calculation of the isotope ratios brand et al 2009 this bias was reported for isotopic analyses of water extracted from plants and soils west et al 2010 martin gomez et al 2015 but could potentially be also present in river or waste waters singleton et al 2009 therefore we conducted a test by comparing isotopic analyses of waste water and domestic water with the picarro l 2130i in different configurations and withisotope ratio mass spectrometer cf table b1 in appendix b the different configurations of the picarro l 2130i depend on the carrying gas n2 or dry air in the second configuration the absorption peak of water isotopes is automatically corrected if methane or methanol is present while in the first configuration no correction was performed picarro personal communication when using irms the water isotopic composition is not modified by dissolved organic carbon methanol and or methane west et al 2010 the drinking waters are taken as reference as they typically contain very low concentration in dissolved organic carbon methane and methanol the results of the test show no effect due to the possible presence of these components as the isotopic composition of waste water are identical for irms and las analyses the las instrument are typically affected by a memory effect which is a shift in the isotopic value of the sample due to traces of the preceding sample in the current analysis to lower the impact of the memory effect we adapted the experimental protocols during the study the best option found is to calculate a memory effect ratio by parts of the experiment and then correct it following the procedure described by iaea and usgs 2013 moreover we injected the samples 6 7 times but we calculated the mean δ18o and δd values on the last 3 injections only the resulting analytical uncertainty with the las instrument at the amgc laboratory is 0 06 for δ18o and 0 3 for δd 2σ this typical analytical uncertainty is calculated on replicates of control house standard randomly placed between samples in different experiments and constitutes an improvement in comparison with uncertainties of analyses reported in previous studies which were at best 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd 2σ de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b houhou et al 2010 4 results this section details the post treatment steps of the isotopic results to characterize the mean isotopic composition of the end members to obtain significant detection thresholds for both cities and to test the method in situ table 1 reports the mean isotopic data and the standard deviation for all water types analyzed during this study the individual analyses are reported in the table c1 in appendix c 4 1 groundwater end members the characterization of the isotopic composition of groundwater represents an important step to assess the potential of the method to detect parasitic water it defines the uncertainty of one end member and partly determines the length of the mixing line in nantes groundwater from plateau aquifers was sampled in two locations distant of 15 km from each other in the west part chézine and in the eastern part pin sec of nantes table 1 the sampling stations show isotopic compositions constant through seasons and from one year to another within the range of 5 58 to 5 26 for δ18o and 35 8 to 32 2 for δd cf table c1 in appendix c the groundwater from these two locations is considered as a single gw end member with a mean isotopic composition of 5 43 33 8 and a variability σ of 0 10 1 2 for δ18o and δd respectively in brussels two aquifers were sampled the ypresian hills aquifer system north west and the brussels sands aquifer system east of brussels the results in table 1 shows that both aquifers have a similar mean isotopic composition but different seasonal variability this observed isotopic variability is mainly explained by the resurgence of ypresian hills groundwater into springs streams and ponds which are connected to the sewers these open air water bodies are subject to evaporation that enriches their isotopic compositions in heavy isotopes the enrichment varies according to the season stronger in summer the micro climate conditions temperature air moisture and the residence time of the water at open air de bondt and claeys 2015 open air streams and ponds collected into the sewers largely contribute to the parasitic water flows and lead to a higher uncertainty on the isotopic value of the ypresian hills aquifer in summer the brussels sands aquifer is covered by urban settings and by the sonian forest in the forested part many natural springs feed ponds and streams but these water bodies are connected to water courses and not to the sewers in the urban part ponds and streams have generally been drained and covered therefore the groundwater infiltrates the sewers in the underground without being affected by evaporation the brussels sands aquifer under urban settings presents an isotopic composition that is geographically homogeneous and remains stable through the seasons and the years around the mean isotopic composition of 7 18 for and 47 9 for δ18o and δd respectively table 1 table c1 in appendix c de bondt and claeys 2015 the large seasonal variability of the isotopic composition of ypresian hills end member table 1 is a potential source of uncertainty for the mixing line method looking for the best situation possible we limit the application of the mixing line method to parts of the territory where the brussels sands aquifer is the gw end member it is interesting to note that the distinction between these two aquifers is not only based on their different geological characteristics but is also and mainly related to the type of parasitic groundwater intrusion open air streams or underground leakage 4 2 waste water end members previous studies often considered the waste water and domestic water isotopic composition to be identical de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b kracht et al 2007 houhou et al 2010 however schilperoort 2004 studied the fractionation processes occurring during domestic use and assessed separately the effect of various water usages bath shower toilet cooking and the addition of urine on the isotopic composition of domestic water when combined these effects induce an enrichment in heavy isotopes of 0 12 for δ18o this enrichment value is calculated on a daily mean and undoubtedly can change during the day depending on the domestic water use almeida et al 1999 the varying fractionations increase the uncertainty on the isotopic signal of waste water and should therefore be further characterized to characterize the possible enrichment we compared the isotopic composition of waste and domestic waters from the same areas fig 3 the sampling sites were carefully chosen to collect only waste water at these locations the local groundwater is situated below the base of the sewer pipes in the underground the waste water samples were exclusively collected in dry periods more than 48 h after rain events in all the sampling campaigns we note a systematic enrichment in heavier isotopes of waste water compared to domestic water the shift in brussels is of 0 13 for δ18o and 0 7 for δd this enrichment presents a mean slope of 5 2 on a δd δ18o diagram that may indicate a partial evaporation iaea 2000b and supports the hypothesis that the usage of domestic water for bath shower and cooking in combination with the presence of urine causes the enrichment of the waste water in heavy isotopes in nantes undiluted waste water was collected in may 2013 and march 2014 in the sewer of a collective housing building here as well the isotopic composition of the waste water was enriched by 0 14 and 1 0 for δ18o and δd respectively when compared to tap water collected the same day we therefore consider the waste water end member signal to be equal to the isotopic composition of domestic water plus a mean enrichment of 0 13 for δ 18o and 0 8 for δd this shift is valid for both cities but for the morning only as the domestic water use may induce other enrichment for other periods of the day it is interesting to note that the sampling campaigns occurred in the summer therefore condensing boilers which may also cause a strong fractionation of the domestic water signal schilperoort 2004 were most likely not contributing to this enrichment the enrichment shift calculated for nantes and brussels may therefore also vary according to the seasons and should be characterized before organizing detection campaigns from the results of these sampling campaigns we consider for the rest of the work the uncertainty 2σ on the isotopic composition of the waste water end member equal to 0 2 for δ 18o and 0 6 for δd 4 3 seasonality effect domestic waters from rivers are impacted by a seasonality effect that may create sufficient isotopic distance denominator a b in eq 4 between end members to identify parasitic waters to characterize this effect we organized the regular sampling of the domestic water once or twice a month in nantes and brussels revealing variation of normalized δ18o and δd distances through the seasons fig 4 in brussels domestic water from meuse water is enriched in δ18o and δd during the late summer fig 4 in comparison with local groundwater because of the δ18o and δd rich hot summer precipitations iaea 2000b such enrichment may also result from stronger evaporation of surface waters in winter snow cover melting from the upper part of the meuse catchment 500 m a s l explains the depleted signatures nantes show a continental effect iaea 2000b as almost all the loire water is more depleted in δ18o and δd than the local groundwater moreover the isotopic composition of the loire largely varies according to the season during late winter or spring δ18o and δd values are lower fig 4 because of the snow melting upstream of the loire catchment in the massif central iaea 2000b the late melting period of 2013 is clearly identifiable 4 4 detection thresholds periods of two to three months with the largest isotopic distance between ground and domestic water were identified base on the seasonality effect in brussels optimal conditions for sampling occurred in july september 2011 and august september 2012 while in nantes from mid may to the beginning of august in 2013 and from february to april in 2014 using eqs 5 and 6 the detection thresholds for parasitic groundwater in brussels are 13 for 2011 and 23 for 2012 line d in table 2 detection thresholds of waste water inflows have also been calculated even if in a combined sewer as in brussels waste water is not a parasitic water in nantes the detection thresholds are similar from one year to another with 7 or 8 for parasitic groundwater and 14 or 15 for waste water inflows lines c d in table 2 the most important difference between brussels and nantes that can explain the difference in the detection thresholds is the total distance between end members a second key parameter influencing the detection thresholds is the isotopic variability of the end members as an example the waste water detection thresholds of brussels in 2011 and those of nantes are similar line e table 2 because of the smaller isotopic variability of the gw end member in brussels in this case the end member variability factor is almost as important as the distance factor the mixing line using both δ18o and δd resulted in lower detection thresholds than those based on one tracer only indeed when the detection thresholds with δ18o and δd are similar the coupling of the two tracers through eq 5 lowers the detection threshold of 4 the small instrumental uncertainty achieved in this study also lowered detection thresholds particularly in brussels up to 13 4 5 detection campaigns in real condition in nantes the detection thresholds calculated in the previous section provide valuable information on the potential of the method in both cities however to test the method in real conditions we conducted two detection campaigns in the pin sec catchment nantes in may 2013 and march 2014 we collected groundwater in 5 observation wells to characterize the mean groundwater isotopic composition we also collected 31 samples in the waste water and stormwater sewers between 8 and 12 a m the isotopic composition of the waste water end member corresponds to the tap water sample collected the same day plus the isotopic shift its uncertainty is that of the waste water shift the low detection thresholds table 3 are due to the very large and favorable isotopic distances between the end members fig 4 the campaign of 2013 shows 8 sewer segments with detectable parasitic groundwater and 2 stormwater sewer segments with waste water inflows table 3 these waste water inflows were not detected at the outlet of the network neither in the march 2014 campaign suggesting that waste water inflows in the stormwater sewers may be very sudden panasiuk et al 2015 the campaign highlighted also another benefit of the combined use of δ18o and δd the possibility to verify that the mixing system is well described which is a necessary condition to apply the mixing line method houhou et al 2010 kracht et al 2007 the sewer samples are plotted in a δ18o δd diagram that traces the mixing line fig 5 and show that the end members are well determined as most of the samples fall on the δ18o δd mixing line however for the march 2014 campaign the proportions of parasitic water in 3 sewer segments in red in table 3 deviate from the mixing line apparently other sources of water or local variations of the end members contribute to the water volume in these 3 pipes this is interesting as it points out the sewers affected by complex or specific groundwater intrusions that must be taken into account when adapting the sewer renovation program to the local situation the mixing line method applied with only one tracer is not able to detect these 3 outlying samples 5 discussion 5 1 applicability of the isotopic mixing line method in brussels and nantes the detection thresholds in brussels were 13 of parasitic groundwater in 2011 and 23 in 2012 which allow detection of most groundwater intrusions in 2011 but may limit the potential of detection in 2012 other factors also lower the applicability of the stable isotopes method in brussels first the optimal period for applying the isotopic method is summer when groundwater levels are the lowest and only permanent groundwater intrusions are present de ville et al 2017 making seasonal winter intrusions non detectable second a sector of 9 km2 6 of the city area in the south of brussels receives meuse water only as domestic water with potential brussels sands groundwater intrusions therefore the rest of the city is expected to present higher detection thresholds due to the lack of seasonality effect in waste water isotopic composition and or increased uncertainty on the isotopic composition of the end members waste water and groundwater the city of brussels should then be divided in homogeneous isotopic sectors each having a determined pair of end members groundwater and waste water the extension of each sector depends on the local geology the type of parasitic water entrance the water supply sources and their mixing in the water supply system sector s extension may thus be highly variable this work allows to assess the applicability and the efforts required by the stable isotopes method and show that it is not ideal to detect groundwater intrusions in brussels however in brussels the applicability of the method mays benefits from the short time variation of the isotopic composition of the meuse water cf fig 4 a possible strategy could be to regularly monitor the isotopic composition of the domestic water in summer and in winter to organize short sampling campaigns when the conditions are optimal during few days or weeks with such intense monitoring effort the stable isotopes method could be applied during the winter to detect seasonnal groundwater intrusions and extended to sectors where meuse water is mixed with other water supply sources about 40 of the city area in nantes the detection threshold are 7 8 of parasitic groundwater which is sufficient to locate most of the relevant groundwater entrances into the sewer system at any time of the day the detection threshold of waste water is also relatively small 14 15 and makes the stable isotopes method fully capable of detecting waste water inflows into the stormwater sewers these low detection thresholds are caused by a large isotopic difference between loire water and the groundwater in the plateau aquifers in spring i e the distance between end members the periods when the distance between end members is the largest snow melting in the massif central may be foreseen weeks in advance the mixing line method may also be applied during less optimal seasons certainly with higher thresholds but sufficient to determine seasonal groundwater intrusions moreover the domestic water supply network is simple and does not divide the city into sectors the only division made in nantes could be between the plateau aquifers and the alluvial aquifers not assessed in this study 5 2 quantification procedures in water treatment plants or sector by sector although this study focuses on the detection of parasitic water presence lessons can be drawn for the application of a quantification approach with stable isotopes in combination with flow measurements with an uncertainty 2σ on the calculated proportion of less than 10 of the total volume as in nantes the method seems applicable for quantification approaches eventually by organizing night sampling campaigns when groundwater flow proportions are higher however it is important to remember that the results from nantes are valid only for the plateau aquifers in other areas alluvial aquifers probably also contribute to the parasitic flows arriving in wtp increasing the end members heterogeneity and affecting the distance between the end members in general if multiple sectors contribute to the sewer water flow a precise quantification may be difficult to reach in wtp and in large catchments conversely the stable isotope method is facilitated when it is applied sector by sector 5 3 practical application of stable isotopes and other tracers in sewers in this study we choose to use stable isotopesalone to compare the case studies and to reveal the capabilities but also the limits of the stable isotopes as tracer in sewers the first limitation concerns the use of stable isotopes as tracers at the city scale see before the second limitation is that stable isotopes are unable to discriminate parasitic waters having similar end members as an example for the sampling campaigns in nantes the domestic waters are positioned in the alignment of the mixing line fig 5 and in this case a parasitic domestic water leaking from supply pipes would not deviate the samples from the mixing line and would not be discriminated from parasitic waste water moreover the presence of infiltrated rainwater in sewers may or may not lead samples deviating from the mixing line depending on the isotopic composition of the rain events along the lmwl fig 5 the discrimination potential of stable isotopes for all the different types of water is therefore variable and case specific if multiple types of parasitic waters are present in the sewers other tracers should be applied in addition to stable isotopes as δ34s or δ18oso4 houhou et al 2010 if stable isotopes are part of the tracers set we recommend performing detailed studies similar to the one proposed here to asses all the factors influencing the stable isotopes potential these preliminary studies should cover one year minimum with a sampling campaign once a month or more to assess the seasonality effect and should have as objective to divide the city in isotopic sectors based on the identification of different end members the time and resources invested in such preliminary study will be counter balanced with the benefits for the tracing studies the evaluation of the potential of stable isotopes as tracer all year long allows to optimize the set of tracers from one season or period to another the division of the city territory in sectors makes it possible to adapt the number and types of tracers from one sector to another and to reduce the uncertainty on the isotopic composition of end members this optimization process would improve the results whatever the mixing method used and may reduce analytical or sampling cost time of the tracing studies these benefits will be particularly valuable in the framework of a continuous monitoring of the sewer system the continuous monitoring aims at increasing and updating knowledge on the system to improve the sewer renovation program and assess the impact of this last such monitoring program is receiving increasing attention for example continuous monitoring of sewers is now prescribed by french regulations joannis et al 2015 in this case the initial investments in time and resources decrease for continuous monitoring based on multiple years 6 conclusions and perspectives the first objective of this work was to assess the potential of the mixing line method with stable isotopes to trace parasitic waters in cities close to ocean to get an overall indicator of applicability we proposed to calculate detection thresholds in different conditions in nantes and brussels in nantes the stable isotopes are applicable to detect groundwater intrusions above 8 of the sewer flow of and waste water inflows above 14 of the sewer flow for the whole plateau area in brussels the applicability of the method is limited as it strongly varies from one year to another moreover its applicability is demonstrated over only 6 of the city and the methode requires intense efforts to monitor the variability in time of the end members for the rest of the city this study also assessed the individual factors determining the applicability of stable isotopes by comparing the detection thresholds for different conditions with the real sampling campaigns we answer the question derived from the current literature and raised in the introduction 1 what is the influence of the seasonality on the applicability of the method in oceanic settings if issued from rivers domestic water and thus waste water shows a seasonality effect that may vary across years in intensity in duration and in period making it difficult to define a priori in our case studies the seasonality effect has a major impact on the applicability of the method 2 what is the impact of the variability of the isotopic composition of the end members end members variability has a determining impact on the applicability of the mixing line method especially for cities where the isotopic distance is small as in brussels dividing cities into homogeneous isotopic sectors based on the geology the type of connection with the sewers and the water supply network structure is a strategy that can help to reduce this impact 3 is the isotopic composition of waste water the same as than that of domestic water no the isotopic composition of pure waste water collected in sewers of nantes and brussels is enriched in heavy isotopes with respect to the domestic water due to the household uses 4 what are the benefits of using two isotopes measured with reduced analytical uncertainty here the application of the mixing line method with both δ18o and δd measured with good analytical uncertainty resulted in detection thresholds of parasitic groundwater reduced of 20 in brussels and of 11 in nantes in comparison with the application of the mixing line with δ18o measured with common analytical uncertainty identification of mixing anomalies in the sewers as the three outlyers samples in the pin sec campiagns is a secondary benefit thanks to the development of the las instrument stable isotopes may become common tracers of urban water bodies using stable isotopes requires a precise understanding of all the factors determining their efficiency therefore the focus on stable isotopes in this article together with the work on the seasonality effect on the isotopic sectors and on detection thresholds shows how to perform optimized mixing studies this benefits to the application of the mixing line method to detect parasitic waters in oceanic cities but could also favor studies with other objectives and or under different climate this optimization process could also benefit to mixing studies with stables isotopes coupled with other tracers this should be tested and constitutes an interesting perspective of work conflict of

8507,study region brussels belgium and nantes france two cities located in oceanic settings study focus the article assesses the capabilities of detecting the presence of groundwater in sewers and waste water in storm sewers also called parasitic waters which increase sewer overflows risk augment the water treatment plant operation costs and pollute downstream rivers this is done by means of laser absorption spectroscopy las instruments that favor the development of stable isotopes δ18o and δd as tracer of urban waters the study first describes the factors affecting isotopic composition of urban waters it also describes how to optimize the use of stable isotopes either alone or coupled with other tracers to detect parasitic waters new hydrological insights in nantes groundwater intrusions were detected above 8 of the sewer water flow and waste water inflows above 14 of the sewer water flow in brussels the stable isotopes may trace the presence of parasitic groundwater in a small part of the city territory 9 km2 this study concludes that stable isotopes can be used as tracer of parasitic waters in low altitude cities close to the ocean when domestic water originates from catchments extending into the continent in this case tracing studies may take advantage of the seasonal variation of the isotopic composition of waste waters on the condition of assessing the other factors that impact the isotopic composition of urban waters as done here keywords δ18o δd stable isotopes parasitic water groundwater waste water inflows sewers 1 introduction 1 1 stable isotopes as tracer water stable isotopes δ18o δd have long been used as tracer in hydrological studies in natural catchments and are increasingly used in urban settings iaea 2002 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the δ18o and δd values expressed in of one particular water body depend on the physico chemical processes e g evaporation and condensation and the climate conditions to which the water body has been subjected iaea 2000a therefore δ18o or δd values may be used to qualify and or quantify the specific climate conditions or the processes that have impacted the different water bodies rozanski 1985 schulte et al 2011 and assess the relative proportion of two or more water sources also called end members in a water body barth and veizer 2004 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 however their applicability as tracers requires sufficient isotopic differences between end members klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the application of such tracers therefore depends on the correct definition of the isotopic composition of each end member and its variability in both time and space and often requires numerous samples and analyses 1 2 parasitic waters an important issue in this article δ18o and δd values are used as tracers in the case of parasitic waters detection in sewers of brussels belgium and nantes france applied to urban areas the term parasitic water refers to the waters that should not be present in sewers they may be sorted into four types 1 groundwater present in combined or sanitary sewers 2 waste water present in the separate storm sewers 3 rainwater present in the separate sanitary sewers 4 domestic waters leaking from supply pipes and entering the combined or sanitary sewers this paper focuses on the first two types of parasitic waters by estimating the mixing proportion of waste water and groundwater in sewers parasitic groundwater generally enters sewers sanitary and combined sewers through cracks openings or failures of the sewer walls where the water table level is higher than the invert of sewers penckwitt et al 2016 groundwater entrances in the sewers can also be caused by direct connections with man made drains set up to protect house basements and or to dry up natural resurgences weiss et al 2002 broadhead et al 2013 parasitic groundwater has damaging consequences i the limitation of the carrying capacity of the combined sewers and consequently the increase of floods and sewer overflows risks ii the augmentation of the volume of water to be treated by water treatment plants wtp with as consequence higher operational costs and through the dilution of the pollutants the reduction of their removal process efficiency de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005a iii the interception of groundwater normally feeding the urban water courses walsh et al 2012 parasitic waste water mainly enters stormwater sewers through undesirable connections from buildings from cross connections between stormwater and waste water sewers or by leakage through failures in the walls of the sewers panasiuk et al 2015 despite their accidental cause these undesirable connections constitute a common problem in many cities which face major difficulties trying to detect and correct these waste water inflows and reduce their negative impacts schilperoort 2004 irvine et al 2011 stormwater sewers are generally not connected to wtp and directly discharge into rivers ponds and lakes therefore parasitic waste water containing nutrients microbes pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds constitutes a potential source of pollution for water bodies these pollutants are toxic for the water biota increase the biological oxygen demand favor the eutrophication of the receiving water body and represent a human health issue if the contaminated water is consumed or even used for recreational purposes prüss 1998 schwarzenbach et al 2010 panasiuk et al 2015 solving parasitic water problems requires detailed knowledge of the waste water inflows and groundwater intrusions in the whole sewer network the systematic inspection of all sewers segments represents an enormous task which demands precautions man power materials and large budgets ellis and butler 2015 in strasbourg france a budget of more than 2 m year is allocated to the rehabilitation program of the sewer system 1600 km length inculding close circuit television cctv inspections astee 2015 kim et al 2009 indicate cctv inspection costs around 7 4 usd per meter of sewer and a budget of 12 7 million usd to inspect the sewers of the city of los angeles moreover the visual inspection of sewers is not able to detect all types of parasitic water entrances panasiuk et al 2015 new scientific methods are thus required to complement optimize and or limit sewer investigations in cities prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 staufer et al 2012 such methods may aim at two different objectives 1 quantification of parasitic water either as absolute i e m3 h or relative values e g of the total flow is generally performed on the main sewers to assess the impact of parasitic waters at the scale of the whole sewer system it should be exhaustive and provide comparable results for all the parts of the sewer system the quantification procedure must be representative by considering either a whole year or several years or a period of high inputs when groundwater table is high generally during winter and spring the expected uncertainty should be in the same range as the uncertainty on the flow rate measurements around 20 of the assessed absolute value bertrand krajewski et al 2000 2 detection aims at providing a presence absence information of parasitic water which is useful at the scale of a particular sewer segment to decide whether detailed investigations i e cctv inspections should be performed detection campaigns performed on a punctual basis and or over limited periods produce valuable results as detection of a parasitic water entrance is an important information to decide on the more detailed inspection and or renovation of sewers consequently representativeness over time although advisable is not a strict requirement as in the quantification procedure being relatively simple to set up the applicability of detection procedures may potentially be compared from one city to another this paper mainly discusses the detection procedure which can be achieved by instant grab sampling and isotope δ18o δd analyses 1 3 stable isotopes to trace parasitic water presence parasitic water flows are generally quantified based on the daily variation of sewer water flow rates de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005a however these methods generally overestimate the parasitic water flows and fail in describing their diurnal variations in addition to flow rate measurements the use of geochemical tracers helps to limit the uncertainty on the calculated volumes of parasitic water flows kracht and gujer 2005 these tracers as salts ammonia concentration chemical oxygen demand may also be used alone to detect the presence of parasitic water but their application is constrained by the varying composition of wastewater during the day kracht and gujer 2005 panasiuk et al 2015 artificial tracers as dye may be used to detect waste water inflows but not groundwater infiltrations because of the high chemical background and the turbidity of the wastewater penckwitt et al 2016 stable isotopes have numerous advantages and may be used alone or in complement to other tracers and methods to detect parasitic waters one first advantage is that stable isotopes are conservative tracers houhou et al 2010 klaus et al 2015 they preserve the original signal of the different parent water bodies involved in a mixing independently of chemical reactions sedimentation etc a second advantage is that they are present in every type of water which is not the case of other geochemical tracers almeida et al 1999 and may detect different types of parasitic waters e g waste water and groundwater stable isotopes have previously and successfully been applied to quantify the parasitic groundwater flows in sewers and water treatment plants wtp of lyon de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b zurich kracht et al 2007 and nancy houhou et al 2010 in these cities domestic water is produced from aquifers or surface water in catchments localized in continental climate nearby high mountains vosges alps fig 1 the high altitude and the lower temperatures affect the isotopic composition of mountain waters with more depleted δ18o and δd values therefore the domestic water derived from high altitude water sources present a more depleted isotopic composition δ18o and δd when compared with the shallow groundwater present under the cities moreover in continental climate large differences of temperature between summer and winter usually induce a modification of the isotopic composition of the rainwater and surface waters with less depleted δ18o and δd values in summer this variation of δ18o and δd value during the year is called seasonality effect iaea 2000b these combined effects altitude and seasonality can differentiate the isotopic composition of groundwater and domestic water up to 3 4 δ18o in lyon and 12 5 δd in zurich de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b kracht et al 2007 other studies tried to apply this method in oceanic climates with moderate success schilperoort 2004 schilperoort et al 2007 dirckx et al 2009 the reason is that in oceanic regions the different water bodies involved present less isotopic variability because of insufficient differences in seasonal temperatures and limited topography effect consequently these studies faced difficulties finding sufficient differences in the isotopic composition between groundwater and domestic water to properly apply the tracing methodology among the 7 cases examined in these studies only two provided satisfactory results there were carried out in arnhem in the netherlands schilperoort et al 2007 and in hamme in belgium dirckx et al 2009 fig 1 in these cities the applications were succesfull because the δ18o distinctiveness between groundwater and domestic water reached 2 25 and 1 4 respectively however the end members were not sufficiently characterized to understand if the method was applicable for the whole city or for a restricted area among all the case studies examined both successful and unsuccessful limiting factors have been pointed out such as the heterogeneity of the isotopic composition of the infiltrating groundwater the variability of the domestic water composition along the year the complexity of the domestic water network however these studies did not assess separately each factor and consequently their results are difficult to compare the potential of stable isotopes methods to localize and quantify parasitic water in oceanic cities remains thus uncertain and difficult to assess with respect to the available literature overall the current literature presents gaps on the use of stable isotopes to trace parasitic waters for instance when first proposed more than 10 years ago stable isotopes methods were constrained by limited analytical capacities today thanks to laser absorption spectroscopy las instruments isotopic studies can be based on a large number of samples to better characterize the composition of the end members and its variation in time and space berman et al 2009 van geldern and barth 2012 past studies in continental and oceanic climates also commonly used only one water isotope to quantify parasitic groundwater now that δ18o and δd are simultaneously analyzed with the same las instrument at higher frequency and with smaller sample volumes it is possible to test both tracers δ18o and δd on the same samples finally past studies considered that domestic water and waste water have the same isotopic composition because the differences found were weak in comparison to analytical uncertainty schilperoort 2004 the increased precision of the new laser instruments for δd and the possible higher frequency of measurement allow us to detect small isotopic differences between the different urban waters 1 4 objectives while existing literature principally detailed the method and its adaptation with post treatment or complementary tracers this study emphasizes the determination of the end members isotopic composition the objective of this study is to highlight the necessary work to obtain a reliable idea of the potential of stable isotopes as tracer of parasitic water for a city and to give the main keys to optimize the use of stable isotopes as tracers this article also aims at filling the gaps in current knowledge that can be summarized by the 4 following questions 1 what is the influence of seasonality on the applicability of the method in oceanic settings 2 what is the impact of end member isotopic variability on the method 3 is the isotopic composition of waste water the same as that of domestic water 4 what are the benefits of using two isotopes measured with reduced analytical uncertainty to answer these questions we consider the cases of nantes and brussels two cities presenting a priori unfavorable conditions for stable isotopic methods because of their oceanic climate and low altitude however part of the domestic water in these two cities is produced from river water with catchments extending further in the continent fig 1 the domestic water thus potentially presents a seasonality effect that may favor the application of stable isotopes as tracers of parasitic waters the comparison of the two case studies presenting different environmental conditions and water infrastructure highlights the general factors determining the potential of stable isotopes for the detection of parasitic waters in oceanic cities and gives the tools to optimize the sampling campaigns 2 case studies 2 1 brussels brussels area 161 km2 is centered on the senne valley in a relatively flat setting with local hills and valleys ranging from 15 m near the river to 110 m in the heights located mainly to the east southeast and to a lesser extent to the northwest of the city it is located about 110 km east of the north sea coast here we consider the potential use of stable isotopes to trace the entrance of groundwater from the brussels sands aquifer system and the ypresian hills aquifer system brussels environment 2011 into the combined sewer system in the brussels sands aquifer system the water table depth ranges from few meters below the surface in the bottom of valleys to more than 30 m in the middle of the highest hills dam et al 1986 the brussels sands aquifer largely extends on the eastern bank of the senne 55 of the brussels area the intrusion of groundwater into the combined sewers potentially occurs only in limited geographic areas where the topographical surface cuts the base of the sandy aquifer underlined by impermeable clay buffel and matthijs 2008 a similar scenario is present in the valley where the water table is near the surface the ypresian hills aquifer system is composed of alternating sand and clay layers of 5 10 m in thickness this aquifer presents about twenty springs feeding ponds and streams which are connected to the sewer system downstream these springs visible in public parks and green zones are located at different altitudes because of the presence of clay layers and small perched aquifers this complex aquifer system is present in the north west of brussels and covers about 13 of the brussels area brussels environment 2011 for the most impacted sewers in brussels the parasitic groundwater may represent up to 77 of the total volume of water brussels environment 2011 because during urbanization most streams and small rivers were incorporated or redirected into the sewer network mahaut et al 2011 the sources of these rivers remain connected to the sewers and probably contribute large volumes of parasitic water in addition groundwater also infiltrates through cracks and permeable joints of the old sewers brussels environment 2011 the relative contribution and the localization of these two types of entrance of parasitic waters springs and deteriorated pipes are unknown however this information is fundamental for a sustainable management of brussels waters for the production of domestic water in brussels local groundwater is extracted from the brussels sands aquifer with 7 wells and 1 underground gallery providing only 2 of the brussels water supply most groundwater is extracted outside brussels from natural springs wells quarry lakes and underground galleries in 17 production sites localized up to 80 km away from brussels water from the meuse river is pumped 50 km south east of brussels in profondeville and provides nowaday about 30 of the city s water supply vivaqua 2012 the meuse catchment upstream of the production plant extends southward to the meuse spring localized 350 km from brussels fig 1 in brussels water from the different production plants is mixed in varying proportions as a function of the season the maintenance works the consumption and the reselling to other distribution companies in belgium dirckx et al 2009 brussels domestic water is therefore composed of a variable mix of meuse river water and groundwater 2 2 nantes located at the confluence of the loire the erdre and the sevre rivers 55 km far from the atlantic coast the city of nantes has a gentle topography with an altitude varying between 5 and 80 m a s l the city territory 65 2 km2 extends onto the major bed of the loire and onto a plateau composed of bedrock with superficial deposits notched by small valleys given the geology two types of shallow aquifers can be found the plateau aquifers eolian silt over weathered bedrock and the alluvial aquifers here we consider the aquifers in the plateau area which is located on the northern bank of the loire and covers 67 of the city territory in most of the area the groundwater depth is within 5 m below the surface in many locations within the nantes underground groundwater infiltrates into the sewers reducing the carrying capacity of the stormwater network and increasing the volume of water treated in wtp of nantes belhadj et al 1995 half of the city area mainly the city center is equipped with combined sewers while separate sewers extend underneath the other half domestic water in the city of nantes is exclusively produced from the loire river pumped 15 km upstream of the city center this study details a sampling campaign that occurred in the pin sec neighborhood localized in the east of nantes whose surface area is 31 ha in this area the separate sewer network is composed of a 7 3 km waste water sewer and a 4 km stormwater sewer the pin sec sector is the hydrological catchment defined by the outlet of the stormwater sewer this catchment has a mean altitude of 22 m asl and a mean slope of 0 9 two geological configurations are present in this area 1 silt over locally weathered mica schist is predominant on the upstream part of the neighborhood and 2 alluvial deposits are located downstream in the valley of the gohards stream to which the stormwater sewer is connected the water table is between 1 and 2 5 m deep in winter and 3 4 m deep in summer le delliou et al 2009 3 methods 3 1 the mixing line method during dry periods the water flowing into the sewers is composed of a mix of groundwater and waste water as showed by de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b the mixing line method applied with stable isotopes either δ18o or δd estimates a dimensionless proportion of a component e g groundwater in a compound waste water groundwater for an absolute assessment e g flow or volumes complementary discharge information must be added to the obtained proportion estimation the mixing line method as developed by de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b can only be applied if there are two distinct end members e g waste water and groundwater contributing to the mixing of waters in sewers if the end members are unknown and or if there are more than 2 end members other methods such as the end member mixing analysis emma should be used christophersen et al 1990 liu et al 2008 burns et al 2001 vazquez sune et al 2010 the emma method has the advantage of integrating multiple tracers which could be specific of the local groundwater and of the domestic uses it could therefore be applied to detect parasitic waters in sewers however the results are dependent of the type and the number of tracers and therefore could be difficult to compare between case studies barthold et al 2011 to reveal the capabilities and the specificities of the stable isotopes as tracer we decided to apply the mixing line method with stable isotopes only the proportion of parasitic groundwater p in the sample is calculated with eq 1 if δ18o is used as tracer then a and b are calculated with the eqs 2a and 3a if δd is used one should refer to the eqs 2b and 3b to estimate the proportion of waste water inflows the terms a b must be inverted in the eq 1 1 p 100 a a b 2a a δ 18 o m i x δ 18 o w w 2b a δdmix δdww 3a b δ o 18 gw δ o 18 mix 3b b δdgw δdmix where p is the he proportion of parasitic groundwater a is the distance in between the measured sample on the mixing line δ18omix or δdmix and the waste water end member δ18oww or δdww and b is the distance in between the groundwater end member δ18ogw or δdgw and the same sample δ18omix or δdmix 3 2 uncertainty on the proportion of parasitic water the suitability of the mixing line method for the detection of parasitic water depends on the uncertainty of the proportion estimation eq 4 expresses the uncertainty on p σp obtained by propagating uncertainty on the eqs 1 3 jcgm 2008 the σp depends on the analytical uncertainty of the measurement realized on the sewer water sample σmix on the uncertainty associated to the mean isotopic composition of the end members σgw and σww on the distance between the end members a b and on the position of the sample on the mixing line a and b σmix corresponds to the analytical uncertainty on one measurement σgw and σww integrate the analytical uncertainty but also the spatial and temporal variability of the end members calculated on analyses of many samples the analytical uncertainty is commonly one order of magnitude smaller than the variability of the end members in this case the analytical uncertainty could be neglected for the calculation of the end member uncertainty 4 σ p 100 a b 2 b 2 σ m i x 2 σ w w 2 a 2 σ m i x 2 σ g w 2 where σp is the uncertainty on p σmix in is the analytical uncertainty of the measurement realized on the sewer water sample σgw in is the uncertainty associated to the mean isotopic composition of the groundwater end member σww in is the uncertainty associated to the mean isotopic composition of the waste water end members p may be calculated using either δ18o p18o or δd pd measurements but the two tracers may be also coupled to reduce the uncertainty on the calculated proportion in this case pm is the mean of p18o and pd and σpm is calculated with the eq 5 5 σ p m σ 2 p 18 o σ 2 p d 2 where σp18o is the uncertainty on p calculated with δ18o σpd is the uncertainty on p calculated with δd and σpm is the uncertainty on p calculated with δ18o and δd eq 5 without a covariance term is valid only if δ18o or δd are independent tracers jcgm 2008 however measuring δ18o and δd simultaneously with the same instrument on a single sample may introduce an analytical correlation between δ18o and δd indeed the absorption peak of the abundant isotopologue h2 16o is used to calculate both δ18o and δd values moreover the experimental conditions may affect similarly the measurements of the two isotopes this analytical correlation has been assessed through control measurements that were realized on the same sample between november 2013 and february 2017 121 measurements cf table a1 in appendix a the correlation coefficient found is weak r2 0 4 and it has been verified that the covariance cov 0 004 is negligible in comparison with the terms of eq 5 for all the results presented here 3 3 detection threshold of the isotopic mixing line method the sources of uncertainty in eq 5 are the factors limiting the stable isotopes mixing line method already pointed out before in this study and in the literature de benedittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b schilperoort 2004 therefore the uncertainty on parasitic water proportion σp could potentially be used as indicator of the applicability of the mixing line method however σp calculated on one single sample eq 4 depends on the mixing proportions and therefore varies from one sample to another so we define another indicator to synthesize the combined effect of all sources of uncertainty that we call the detection threshold p0 p0 is the smallest value of p that indicates the presence of parasitic water with a confidence level of 95 under the assumption of normal distribution of p p0 is the smallest value of p higher than 2σp if the value of p measured for a sample is equal or higher than p0 for one tracer or for the average eq 5 parasitic water is detected in the sample fig 2 the concept of detection threshold is similar to the limit of detection lod defined for analytical methods jcgm 2012 but the value of p0 also takes into account factors of uncertainty as the spatial and or temporal variability of the two end members as the isotopic composition of the two end members is rarely homogeneous and constant over entire cities p0 varies with time and from one part of the city to another in this study we determine and compare the lowest p0 available in brussels and nantes over periods of 2 3 months the duration is pragmatically selected as the time required to include a sufficient number of dry days to organize sewer sampling campaigns indeed parasitic water detection using stable isotopes requires the organization of multiple sampling campaigns to reach more precise results see further and to explore the numerous sewer segments potentially impacted by parasitic water 3 4 sampling and analyses a total of 265 water samples were collected during the period october 2010 september 2014 in glass or high density poly ethylene bottles hermetically sealed with caps dedicated for long time storage and with paraffin film the bottles were stored in the dark at 4 c before analyses at the vrije universiteit brussels stable isotopes laboratory we performed replication tests that showed that storage time did not affect the quality of the results groundwater was sampled in natural springs or in groundwater pumping stations and observation wells after the water in pipes and wells potentially in contact with air was totally purged the domestic water was collected in household taps located within the investigated parts of the cities once or twice a month also after purging the water already present in pipes the waste water was manually collected in manholes and segments of sewers in the morning 8a m 1p m in both case studies rainwater was collected in samplers that automatically close after the rain event to avoid fractionation of the isotopic composition due to evaporation groundwater rainwater and waste water samples were filtered at 0 2 μm via syringe filters before analysis using a laser absorption spectroscopy las instrument picarro l2130 i the las instruments make isotopic analysis relatively robust fast and low cost las instruments determine the isotopic composition of water by measuring the energy absorption in the near infra red range by the rotational vibrational transitions in three isotopologues h2 18o h2 16o and hd16o of the water molecule van geldern and barth 2012 however las measurements are vulnerable to dissolved organic carbon methane and methanol present in water which may interfere with the absorption spectrum of the water vapor and could affect the calculation of the isotope ratios brand et al 2009 this bias was reported for isotopic analyses of water extracted from plants and soils west et al 2010 martin gomez et al 2015 but could potentially be also present in river or waste waters singleton et al 2009 therefore we conducted a test by comparing isotopic analyses of waste water and domestic water with the picarro l 2130i in different configurations and withisotope ratio mass spectrometer cf table b1 in appendix b the different configurations of the picarro l 2130i depend on the carrying gas n2 or dry air in the second configuration the absorption peak of water isotopes is automatically corrected if methane or methanol is present while in the first configuration no correction was performed picarro personal communication when using irms the water isotopic composition is not modified by dissolved organic carbon methanol and or methane west et al 2010 the drinking waters are taken as reference as they typically contain very low concentration in dissolved organic carbon methane and methanol the results of the test show no effect due to the possible presence of these components as the isotopic composition of waste water are identical for irms and las analyses the las instrument are typically affected by a memory effect which is a shift in the isotopic value of the sample due to traces of the preceding sample in the current analysis to lower the impact of the memory effect we adapted the experimental protocols during the study the best option found is to calculate a memory effect ratio by parts of the experiment and then correct it following the procedure described by iaea and usgs 2013 moreover we injected the samples 6 7 times but we calculated the mean δ18o and δd values on the last 3 injections only the resulting analytical uncertainty with the las instrument at the amgc laboratory is 0 06 for δ18o and 0 3 for δd 2σ this typical analytical uncertainty is calculated on replicates of control house standard randomly placed between samples in different experiments and constitutes an improvement in comparison with uncertainties of analyses reported in previous studies which were at best 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd 2σ de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b houhou et al 2010 4 results this section details the post treatment steps of the isotopic results to characterize the mean isotopic composition of the end members to obtain significant detection thresholds for both cities and to test the method in situ table 1 reports the mean isotopic data and the standard deviation for all water types analyzed during this study the individual analyses are reported in the table c1 in appendix c 4 1 groundwater end members the characterization of the isotopic composition of groundwater represents an important step to assess the potential of the method to detect parasitic water it defines the uncertainty of one end member and partly determines the length of the mixing line in nantes groundwater from plateau aquifers was sampled in two locations distant of 15 km from each other in the west part chézine and in the eastern part pin sec of nantes table 1 the sampling stations show isotopic compositions constant through seasons and from one year to another within the range of 5 58 to 5 26 for δ18o and 35 8 to 32 2 for δd cf table c1 in appendix c the groundwater from these two locations is considered as a single gw end member with a mean isotopic composition of 5 43 33 8 and a variability σ of 0 10 1 2 for δ18o and δd respectively in brussels two aquifers were sampled the ypresian hills aquifer system north west and the brussels sands aquifer system east of brussels the results in table 1 shows that both aquifers have a similar mean isotopic composition but different seasonal variability this observed isotopic variability is mainly explained by the resurgence of ypresian hills groundwater into springs streams and ponds which are connected to the sewers these open air water bodies are subject to evaporation that enriches their isotopic compositions in heavy isotopes the enrichment varies according to the season stronger in summer the micro climate conditions temperature air moisture and the residence time of the water at open air de bondt and claeys 2015 open air streams and ponds collected into the sewers largely contribute to the parasitic water flows and lead to a higher uncertainty on the isotopic value of the ypresian hills aquifer in summer the brussels sands aquifer is covered by urban settings and by the sonian forest in the forested part many natural springs feed ponds and streams but these water bodies are connected to water courses and not to the sewers in the urban part ponds and streams have generally been drained and covered therefore the groundwater infiltrates the sewers in the underground without being affected by evaporation the brussels sands aquifer under urban settings presents an isotopic composition that is geographically homogeneous and remains stable through the seasons and the years around the mean isotopic composition of 7 18 for and 47 9 for δ18o and δd respectively table 1 table c1 in appendix c de bondt and claeys 2015 the large seasonal variability of the isotopic composition of ypresian hills end member table 1 is a potential source of uncertainty for the mixing line method looking for the best situation possible we limit the application of the mixing line method to parts of the territory where the brussels sands aquifer is the gw end member it is interesting to note that the distinction between these two aquifers is not only based on their different geological characteristics but is also and mainly related to the type of parasitic groundwater intrusion open air streams or underground leakage 4 2 waste water end members previous studies often considered the waste water and domestic water isotopic composition to be identical de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005b kracht et al 2007 houhou et al 2010 however schilperoort 2004 studied the fractionation processes occurring during domestic use and assessed separately the effect of various water usages bath shower toilet cooking and the addition of urine on the isotopic composition of domestic water when combined these effects induce an enrichment in heavy isotopes of 0 12 for δ18o this enrichment value is calculated on a daily mean and undoubtedly can change during the day depending on the domestic water use almeida et al 1999 the varying fractionations increase the uncertainty on the isotopic signal of waste water and should therefore be further characterized to characterize the possible enrichment we compared the isotopic composition of waste and domestic waters from the same areas fig 3 the sampling sites were carefully chosen to collect only waste water at these locations the local groundwater is situated below the base of the sewer pipes in the underground the waste water samples were exclusively collected in dry periods more than 48 h after rain events in all the sampling campaigns we note a systematic enrichment in heavier isotopes of waste water compared to domestic water the shift in brussels is of 0 13 for δ18o and 0 7 for δd this enrichment presents a mean slope of 5 2 on a δd δ18o diagram that may indicate a partial evaporation iaea 2000b and supports the hypothesis that the usage of domestic water for bath shower and cooking in combination with the presence of urine causes the enrichment of the waste water in heavy isotopes in nantes undiluted waste water was collected in may 2013 and march 2014 in the sewer of a collective housing building here as well the isotopic composition of the waste water was enriched by 0 14 and 1 0 for δ18o and δd respectively when compared to tap water collected the same day we therefore consider the waste water end member signal to be equal to the isotopic composition of domestic water plus a mean enrichment of 0 13 for δ 18o and 0 8 for δd this shift is valid for both cities but for the morning only as the domestic water use may induce other enrichment for other periods of the day it is interesting to note that the sampling campaigns occurred in the summer therefore condensing boilers which may also cause a strong fractionation of the domestic water signal schilperoort 2004 were most likely not contributing to this enrichment the enrichment shift calculated for nantes and brussels may therefore also vary according to the seasons and should be characterized before organizing detection campaigns from the results of these sampling campaigns we consider for the rest of the work the uncertainty 2σ on the isotopic composition of the waste water end member equal to 0 2 for δ 18o and 0 6 for δd 4 3 seasonality effect domestic waters from rivers are impacted by a seasonality effect that may create sufficient isotopic distance denominator a b in eq 4 between end members to identify parasitic waters to characterize this effect we organized the regular sampling of the domestic water once or twice a month in nantes and brussels revealing variation of normalized δ18o and δd distances through the seasons fig 4 in brussels domestic water from meuse water is enriched in δ18o and δd during the late summer fig 4 in comparison with local groundwater because of the δ18o and δd rich hot summer precipitations iaea 2000b such enrichment may also result from stronger evaporation of surface waters in winter snow cover melting from the upper part of the meuse catchment 500 m a s l explains the depleted signatures nantes show a continental effect iaea 2000b as almost all the loire water is more depleted in δ18o and δd than the local groundwater moreover the isotopic composition of the loire largely varies according to the season during late winter or spring δ18o and δd values are lower fig 4 because of the snow melting upstream of the loire catchment in the massif central iaea 2000b the late melting period of 2013 is clearly identifiable 4 4 detection thresholds periods of two to three months with the largest isotopic distance between ground and domestic water were identified base on the seasonality effect in brussels optimal conditions for sampling occurred in july september 2011 and august september 2012 while in nantes from mid may to the beginning of august in 2013 and from february to april in 2014 using eqs 5 and 6 the detection thresholds for parasitic groundwater in brussels are 13 for 2011 and 23 for 2012 line d in table 2 detection thresholds of waste water inflows have also been calculated even if in a combined sewer as in brussels waste water is not a parasitic water in nantes the detection thresholds are similar from one year to another with 7 or 8 for parasitic groundwater and 14 or 15 for waste water inflows lines c d in table 2 the most important difference between brussels and nantes that can explain the difference in the detection thresholds is the total distance between end members a second key parameter influencing the detection thresholds is the isotopic variability of the end members as an example the waste water detection thresholds of brussels in 2011 and those of nantes are similar line e table 2 because of the smaller isotopic variability of the gw end member in brussels in this case the end member variability factor is almost as important as the distance factor the mixing line using both δ18o and δd resulted in lower detection thresholds than those based on one tracer only indeed when the detection thresholds with δ18o and δd are similar the coupling of the two tracers through eq 5 lowers the detection threshold of 4 the small instrumental uncertainty achieved in this study also lowered detection thresholds particularly in brussels up to 13 4 5 detection campaigns in real condition in nantes the detection thresholds calculated in the previous section provide valuable information on the potential of the method in both cities however to test the method in real conditions we conducted two detection campaigns in the pin sec catchment nantes in may 2013 and march 2014 we collected groundwater in 5 observation wells to characterize the mean groundwater isotopic composition we also collected 31 samples in the waste water and stormwater sewers between 8 and 12 a m the isotopic composition of the waste water end member corresponds to the tap water sample collected the same day plus the isotopic shift its uncertainty is that of the waste water shift the low detection thresholds table 3 are due to the very large and favorable isotopic distances between the end members fig 4 the campaign of 2013 shows 8 sewer segments with detectable parasitic groundwater and 2 stormwater sewer segments with waste water inflows table 3 these waste water inflows were not detected at the outlet of the network neither in the march 2014 campaign suggesting that waste water inflows in the stormwater sewers may be very sudden panasiuk et al 2015 the campaign highlighted also another benefit of the combined use of δ18o and δd the possibility to verify that the mixing system is well described which is a necessary condition to apply the mixing line method houhou et al 2010 kracht et al 2007 the sewer samples are plotted in a δ18o δd diagram that traces the mixing line fig 5 and show that the end members are well determined as most of the samples fall on the δ18o δd mixing line however for the march 2014 campaign the proportions of parasitic water in 3 sewer segments in red in table 3 deviate from the mixing line apparently other sources of water or local variations of the end members contribute to the water volume in these 3 pipes this is interesting as it points out the sewers affected by complex or specific groundwater intrusions that must be taken into account when adapting the sewer renovation program to the local situation the mixing line method applied with only one tracer is not able to detect these 3 outlying samples 5 discussion 5 1 applicability of the isotopic mixing line method in brussels and nantes the detection thresholds in brussels were 13 of parasitic groundwater in 2011 and 23 in 2012 which allow detection of most groundwater intrusions in 2011 but may limit the potential of detection in 2012 other factors also lower the applicability of the stable isotopes method in brussels first the optimal period for applying the isotopic method is summer when groundwater levels are the lowest and only permanent groundwater intrusions are present de ville et al 2017 making seasonal winter intrusions non detectable second a sector of 9 km2 6 of the city area in the south of brussels receives meuse water only as domestic water with potential brussels sands groundwater intrusions therefore the rest of the city is expected to present higher detection thresholds due to the lack of seasonality effect in waste water isotopic composition and or increased uncertainty on the isotopic composition of the end members waste water and groundwater the city of brussels should then be divided in homogeneous isotopic sectors each having a determined pair of end members groundwater and waste water the extension of each sector depends on the local geology the type of parasitic water entrance the water supply sources and their mixing in the water supply system sector s extension may thus be highly variable this work allows to assess the applicability and the efforts required by the stable isotopes method and show that it is not ideal to detect groundwater intrusions in brussels however in brussels the applicability of the method mays benefits from the short time variation of the isotopic composition of the meuse water cf fig 4 a possible strategy could be to regularly monitor the isotopic composition of the domestic water in summer and in winter to organize short sampling campaigns when the conditions are optimal during few days or weeks with such intense monitoring effort the stable isotopes method could be applied during the winter to detect seasonnal groundwater intrusions and extended to sectors where meuse water is mixed with other water supply sources about 40 of the city area in nantes the detection threshold are 7 8 of parasitic groundwater which is sufficient to locate most of the relevant groundwater entrances into the sewer system at any time of the day the detection threshold of waste water is also relatively small 14 15 and makes the stable isotopes method fully capable of detecting waste water inflows into the stormwater sewers these low detection thresholds are caused by a large isotopic difference between loire water and the groundwater in the plateau aquifers in spring i e the distance between end members the periods when the distance between end members is the largest snow melting in the massif central may be foreseen weeks in advance the mixing line method may also be applied during less optimal seasons certainly with higher thresholds but sufficient to determine seasonal groundwater intrusions moreover the domestic water supply network is simple and does not divide the city into sectors the only division made in nantes could be between the plateau aquifers and the alluvial aquifers not assessed in this study 5 2 quantification procedures in water treatment plants or sector by sector although this study focuses on the detection of parasitic water presence lessons can be drawn for the application of a quantification approach with stable isotopes in combination with flow measurements with an uncertainty 2σ on the calculated proportion of less than 10 of the total volume as in nantes the method seems applicable for quantification approaches eventually by organizing night sampling campaigns when groundwater flow proportions are higher however it is important to remember that the results from nantes are valid only for the plateau aquifers in other areas alluvial aquifers probably also contribute to the parasitic flows arriving in wtp increasing the end members heterogeneity and affecting the distance between the end members in general if multiple sectors contribute to the sewer water flow a precise quantification may be difficult to reach in wtp and in large catchments conversely the stable isotope method is facilitated when it is applied sector by sector 5 3 practical application of stable isotopes and other tracers in sewers in this study we choose to use stable isotopesalone to compare the case studies and to reveal the capabilities but also the limits of the stable isotopes as tracer in sewers the first limitation concerns the use of stable isotopes as tracers at the city scale see before the second limitation is that stable isotopes are unable to discriminate parasitic waters having similar end members as an example for the sampling campaigns in nantes the domestic waters are positioned in the alignment of the mixing line fig 5 and in this case a parasitic domestic water leaking from supply pipes would not deviate the samples from the mixing line and would not be discriminated from parasitic waste water moreover the presence of infiltrated rainwater in sewers may or may not lead samples deviating from the mixing line depending on the isotopic composition of the rain events along the lmwl fig 5 the discrimination potential of stable isotopes for all the different types of water is therefore variable and case specific if multiple types of parasitic waters are present in the sewers other tracers should be applied in addition to stable isotopes as δ34s or δ18oso4 houhou et al 2010 if stable isotopes are part of the tracers set we recommend performing detailed studies similar to the one proposed here to asses all the factors influencing the stable isotopes potential these preliminary studies should cover one year minimum with a sampling campaign once a month or more to assess the seasonality effect and should have as objective to divide the city in isotopic sectors based on the identification of different end members the time and resources invested in such preliminary study will be counter balanced with the benefits for the tracing studies the evaluation of the potential of stable isotopes as tracer all year long allows to optimize the set of tracers from one season or period to another the division of the city territory in sectors makes it possible to adapt the number and types of tracers from one sector to another and to reduce the uncertainty on the isotopic composition of end members this optimization process would improve the results whatever the mixing method used and may reduce analytical or sampling cost time of the tracing studies these benefits will be particularly valuable in the framework of a continuous monitoring of the sewer system the continuous monitoring aims at increasing and updating knowledge on the system to improve the sewer renovation program and assess the impact of this last such monitoring program is receiving increasing attention for example continuous monitoring of sewers is now prescribed by french regulations joannis et al 2015 in this case the initial investments in time and resources decrease for continuous monitoring based on multiple years 6 conclusions and perspectives the first objective of this work was to assess the potential of the mixing line method with stable isotopes to trace parasitic waters in cities close to ocean to get an overall indicator of applicability we proposed to calculate detection thresholds in different conditions in nantes and brussels in nantes the stable isotopes are applicable to detect groundwater intrusions above 8 of the sewer flow of and waste water inflows above 14 of the sewer flow for the whole plateau area in brussels the applicability of the method is limited as it strongly varies from one year to another moreover its applicability is demonstrated over only 6 of the city and the methode requires intense efforts to monitor the variability in time of the end members for the rest of the city this study also assessed the individual factors determining the applicability of stable isotopes by comparing the detection thresholds for different conditions with the real sampling campaigns we answer the question derived from the current literature and raised in the introduction 1 what is the influence of the seasonality on the applicability of the method in oceanic settings if issued from rivers domestic water and thus waste water shows a seasonality effect that may vary across years in intensity in duration and in period making it difficult to define a priori in our case studies the seasonality effect has a major impact on the applicability of the method 2 what is the impact of the variability of the isotopic composition of the end members end members variability has a determining impact on the applicability of the mixing line method especially for cities where the isotopic distance is small as in brussels dividing cities into homogeneous isotopic sectors based on the geology the type of connection with the sewers and the water supply network structure is a strategy that can help to reduce this impact 3 is the isotopic composition of waste water the same as than that of domestic water no the isotopic composition of pure waste water collected in sewers of nantes and brussels is enriched in heavy isotopes with respect to the domestic water due to the household uses 4 what are the benefits of using two isotopes measured with reduced analytical uncertainty here the application of the mixing line method with both δ18o and δd measured with good analytical uncertainty resulted in detection thresholds of parasitic groundwater reduced of 20 in brussels and of 11 in nantes in comparison with the application of the mixing line with δ18o measured with common analytical uncertainty identification of mixing anomalies in the sewers as the three outlyers samples in the pin sec campiagns is a secondary benefit thanks to the development of the las instrument stable isotopes may become common tracers of urban water bodies using stable isotopes requires a precise understanding of all the factors determining their efficiency therefore the focus on stable isotopes in this article together with the work on the seasonality effect on the isotopic sectors and on detection thresholds shows how to perform optimized mixing studies this benefits to the application of the mixing line method to detect parasitic waters in oceanic cities but could also favor studies with other objectives and or under different climate this optimization process could also benefit to mixing studies with stables isotopes coupled with other tracers this should be tested and constitutes an interesting perspective of work conflict of

8508,study region in the lower mekong river basin the watershed development such as reclamation has been rapidly going on the reclamation is expected to cause many problems on this important watershed environment study focus the objective of this research is to quantitatively clarify the impact of reclamation on the watershed environment of the lower mekong river basin new hydrological insights the locations of reclamation areas were extracted using mndwi ndvi and ndsi derived by landsat data as a result the 49 reclamation areas covering approximately 95 of all 52 reclamation areas determined by visual extraction were extracted then the multiple logistic regression model was constructed to find the tendency of the occurrence of reclamation and reproduce the occurrence of reclamation the test of goodness of fit such as hosmer lemeshow test and nagelkerke coefficient shows high adaptability r2 0 89 of the probability model the probability of occurrence of reclamation could be explained by the distance from the phnom penh city and the distance from the river channels moreover the existence of reclamation areas was incorporated into the flood inundation model and total phosphorus transportation model changing the value of the elevation and the phosphorus loading respectively consequently the inundation water level increases about 3 8 m and total phosphorus concentration increases about 0 71 mg l around phnom penh in case of the reclamation of 10 of all inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province keywords watershed development cambodia remote sensing ndwi multiple logistic regression flood inundation model 1 introduction floodplains that originate from floods and the inundation of rivers are regarded as one of the most productive areas and the floodplain s role in biodiversity and agriculture is extremely important junk et al 2013 it has been reported that floods and inundation are strongly related to agriculture or vegetation in many floodplains a study of the amazon found that some of the most influential factors that determine the vegetation distribution and composition are the water level and flood duration in the floodplain worbes 1997 ferreira and stohlgren 1999 parolin et al 2004 in the okavango delta in botswana the plant species composition was also found to be driven by flooding with the inter annual flooding frequency as the main driver of herbaceous plant distribution murray hudson 2009 murray hudson et al 2011 in the northern territory of australia a strong flooding seasonality was found to be responsible for the floodplain s biophysical patterns bowman and mcdonough 1991 finlayson 2005 warfe et al 2011 moreover in the floodplain of the mekong river it was concluded that canopy height and species richness of vegetation are strongly related to annual flood duration arias et al 2013 in addition amano and kazama showed that flooding and inundation make the soil fertile in the mekong river basin in light of the nutrient balance of the mekong river s flooding water soil and paddy rice amano and kazama 2016 this study concluded that flooding and inundation are vital concerns for the agriculture in the mekong river basin although the studies on agriculture and vegetation or material circulation in floodplains have been done as indicated above none of them included the impact of watershed development such as reclamation of the floodplain other than above studies a cost benefit analysis in terms of the benefit of agriculture and fisheries and the cost at the maximum flood kazama et al 2003 the estimation of the amount of groundwater resources kazama et al 2007 and the estimation of the risk of water borne disease amano et al 2011 have been done so far in the mekong river basin however the impact of watershed development has not been discussed in those studies yet currently according to economic and population growth it is becoming more important and necessary to focus on watershed development in many floodplains around the world particularly in cambodia located in the lower mekong river basin industrial areas and residential areas have been expanded rapidly around the capital city phnom penh and around each city with outstanding economic growth the majority of these developed areas were initially floodplain and have been reclaimed and created fig 1 because of this urban development in the lower mekong river basin the floodplain is being changed steadily recently the floodplain in the mekong river basin is extremely important since it plays roles in agricultural fishing groundwater recharge and water purification however the increase of land reclamation that is the decrease of the area of this important floodplain in the mekong river basin could lead to the loss of these functions and many problems for example reclamation increases the risk of flooding and inundation downstream because of the loss of storage not only the loss of the function of storage but also the decrease in base flow caused by the decrease of groundwater are also regarded as problems kazama et al 2007 in addition in terms of environmental issues many problems are also concerns such as the decrease of spawning grounds for fishes prawns and crabs or the loss of water purification under such circumstances the impacts of reclamation have been discussed only qualitatively and they have not been considered as serious problems by many cambodian government officials recently in the lower mekong river basin the impact of dam construction and climate change on the environment of the watershed has been discussed often shrestha et al 2016 arias et al 2014 but a study that evaluates the impact of floodplain reclamation quantitatively has not been done so far the quantitative evaluation of the impact of reclamation could lead to one of the guidelines of watershed development of the mekong river basin in cambodia where the development is going on rapidly moreover since similar problems are also concerns in other river basins such as the irrawaddy river basin in southeast asia or the ganges river basin thi myat et al 2012 this research could be helpful in providing beneficial information to other river basins therefore the objective of this research is to quantitatively clarify the impact of reclamation on the watershed environment of the lower mekong river basin to achieve our goal in this research as the initial analysis the locations of reclaimed areas were extracted by a remote sensing analysis in the study area in cambodia furthermore a logistic regression analysis has been done to determine the tendency of reclaimed land to be located in the floodplain then a probability model of the occurrence of reclamation was developed in the study area based on the results of the probability model the distribution of reclamation in the future was shown in the study area and the existence of reclamation areas was incorporated into the flood and inundation model and nutrient transportation model by changing the value of the elevation and the phosphorus loading in reclamation areas respectively 2 study area the mekong river the largest river in the southeast asia contains rich water resources forest resources and aquatic resources the study area for the present work is a specific region of this river basin in the lower mekong river basin in cambodia it is shown as the red framed area 140 km 110 km and the capital city of cambodia phnom penh is in the center of the study area in fig 2 in this study area the mekong river joins the tonlesap river at phnom penh and is divided into the bassac river fig 2 large scale inundation happens by flood water conveyed by colmatage in this area every rainy season in the lower mekong river basin in cambodia and vietnam an area of 30 000 40 000 km2 is inundated due to colmatage every year colmatage is a type of excavated dyke and traditional irrigation system of cambodia the flood water which has a silt component can be distributed to agricultural areas by these excavated dykes on the mekong river and the bassac river or by a setting culvert there are many types of these dykes but generally they have a depth of 2 3 m a width of 10 m and a length of 2 km in addition the main land cover of the study area is rice paddies and crop land rice paddies account for 38 and cropland accounts for 28 of the total study area there are also forests and vegetation areas and urban areas such as phnom penh account for 0 7 of the total study area the climate of the study area is tropical monsoon the rainy season is from may to november and the dry season is from december to april the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm 3 methods 3 1 derivation of ndwi ndvi ndsi and mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference soil index ndsi and normalized difference water index ndwi are the remote sensing derived indexes quantifying each land covers from the difference of reflectance at each channel of remote sensing data in this article these were used for specifying the land cover of each cell in the study area so that the reclamation areas could be extracted the derivation of each normalized index was based on the method of derivation by takeuchi and yasuoka 2004 each normalized index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference soil index ndsi and normalized difference water index ndwi were defined as eqs 1 3 1 n d w i v i s n i r v i s n i r 2 n d v i n i r v i s n i r v i s 3 n d s i s w i r n i r s w i r n i r where vis is the visible reflectance nir is the near infrared reflectance and swir is the short wave infrared reflectance in addition mndwi was derived by using mir the middle infrared reflectance instead of nir eq 4 4 m n d w i v i s m i r v i s m i r mndwi is the modified ndwi that more accurately discriminates between reclamation areas from the water regions hanqiu 2006 since the application of the ndwi in water regions with a built up land background does not identify water regions and built up land as expected the mndwi was suggested the concept of the mndwi uses the mir instead of the nir in eq 1 in built up land such as reclamation areas the values of the nir and vis could be similar therefore the value of the ndwi could be positive or 0 for both the water regions and reclamation areas therefore it might be difficult to distinguish the reclamation areas from water regions on the other hand since the mir shows much higher values than the vis in the reclamation areas the mndwi is likely to show a positive value in water regions and a negative value in reclamation areas based on the above the mndwi is more suitable for discrimination between water regions and reclamation areas 3 2 dataset for the numerical model elevation data and the location of the river channel were obtained from srtm shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation data produced by nasa in the flood and inundation model the daily water depth data at kampong cham prek dam tan chau and chau doc in the study area were obtained from the mrc mekong river commission and used as boundary conditions the resolution of srtm data is 90 m 90 m the initial water depth of the river channel was calculated by the linear interpolation method in light of the daily water depth data although this initial condition does not represent the actual water depth exactly it has a small effect on the accuracy of the numerical model because the numerical model simulation was started in the dry season the distribution of the initial water depth in the inundation area and the distribution of the groundwater depth were obtained by the simulation of a few years and used as initial conditions in the nutrient transportation model the concentration of total phosphorus in the river channels obtained from the mrc was used as the boundary condition the concentration of total phosphorus in river channels is measured every month by the mrc the total phosphorus source unit values were determined by the combination of land cover data and the phosphorus source unit values of each type of land cover introduced by yoshimura and takeuchi 2007 modq12 2000 was used for the land cover data in the study area based on the distribution of this land cover the distribution of total phosphorus source unit values was obtained and used as input data fig 3 3 3 flood and inundation model the method of calculation of flood and inundation is based on kazama et al 2007 in this method the hydrological model is composed of the following four main components the two dimensional non uniform flow model for water distribution in the inundation area the one dimensional dynamic wave model for river discharge simulations the overflow model for reproduction of the excavating dykes colmatage namely to combine the river flow model and the inundation model and a two dimensional groundwater flow model the width of the mekong river is actually greater than 1000 m and the widths of the bassac and tonle sap rivers are greater than 500 m since these widths are much greater than the spatial resolution required for the distributed model on a local scale the water discharges of the rivers were independently calculated in the model in addition the flood and inundation via the excavating dykes or colmatage are reproduced in the model by complete overflow and submerge overflow equations when the floodwater flows to dry land through a colmatage cut a complete overflow occurs there and when floodwater flows to wet areas through the colmatage cut a submerged overflow occurs additionally the groundwater recharge is estimated based on the calculated depths of inundation and the river then the groundwater level is estimated in the model the time interval and spatial resolution of the calculation are 2 s and 250 m respectively the value of evaporation from the water surface is 150 mm month which is the approximate value for tropical regions and the infiltration rate is 10 mm hour inoue et al 2000 fig 4 shows the distribution of the annual maximum water depth in the study area obtained by this model 3 3 1 model validation this flood and inundation model has been applied to the two flood and inundation events in the study area and validated by a comparison with observational data kazama et al 2007 and kazama et al 2012 the observational data are the groundwater levels 1996 1998 the inundation area derived by satellite image from july 2000 to december 2000 and the river water levels 1993 1997 and 1998 as a result of those validations this model represents the flood and inundation events with good accuracy in the study area example the inundation areas obtained from the calculation by this model were compared with observed satellite images radarsat on september 4 2000 it showed a good agreement between estimated inundation areas and the satellite image kazama et al 2007 also comparison showed that the model estimated water levels are in good agreement with the observed water levels at phonem penh since the details of the model validations has been reported in the previous studies kazama et al 2007 and kazama et al 2012 they are not mentioned in this article 3 4 nutrient transport model the method of calculation of nutrient transport is based on amano and kazama 2016 in this method only phosphorus transport is modeled because phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in this study area rather than nitrogen or silicon amano and kazama 2016 in addition as to the reason why only phosphorus transportation is modeled the transportation of nitrogen or silicon is too complicated to model therefore the accuracy of their transportation models could not be assured at a large scale like this study area in this model the occurrence and loading advection and sedimentation of total phosphorus are considered and reproduced the forms of phosphorus are not distinguished in the model and total phosphorus transport is modeled by assuming that the phosphorus is adsorbed to ss according to the high correlation 0 86 between the total phosphorus concentration and the ss concentration amano and kazama 2016 it could be said that this assumption is appropriate 3 4 1 total phosphorus transport calculation phosphorus transport is expressed by eq 5 as follows 5 l i t l a l i n l o u t l s where l i t is the amount of phosphorus in cell i at time t g l a is the phosphorus source unit determined by the land cover g l i n is the inflowing amount of phosphorus g l o u t is the outflowing amount of phosphorus g and l s is the amount of the phosphorus sedimentation g these are obtained as follows 6 l i n q i n c i 1 t 1 d t 7 l o u t q o u t c i t 1 d t 8 l s v s c i t 1 d x 2 d t where q i n is the inflow m3 s q o u t is the outflow m3 s c i t is the concentration of phosphorus of cell i at time t g m3 and v s is the sedimentation velocity in addition l a was determined in light of the land cover of each cell according to each phosphorus source unit value of cropland natural vegetation and urban areas yoshimura and takeuchi 2007 the sedimentation velocity of the total phosphorus was set as 0 5 m s in this research according to previous studies lung et al 1976 and sahoo et al 2010 and calibration with field observation data from amano and kazama 2016 it could be said that this value of sedimentation velocity includes the effect of diffusion or wind up because it was calibrated with field observation values 4 results and discussion 4 1 extraction of reclamation areas by a remote sensing analysis 4 1 1 extraction of reclamation areas by normalized indices the mndwi ndvi and ndsi were derived using the pixel values of each band from both jan 1993 data from landsat tm and jan 2015 data from landsat oli in light of the maximum water level of the mekong river for the last 30 years the data from jan 1993 which has a small scale of flooding and the data from jan 2015 which has a large scale of flooding were used to avoid the mis extraction of the reclamation area the spatial resolution of normalized indices is 30 m 30 m after deriving each index the threshold value of each index used to distinguish land cover was found by the algorithm of natural classification from jenks 1967 the threshold values were determined as follows the value of mndwi was bigger than 0 03 in water regions between 0 42 and 0 03 in soil regions and smaller than 0 42 in natural vegetation regions in the study area the extracted water information from the mndwi and this threshold value achieve an overall accuracy of 98 55 when comparing the five places such as the wetlands or the river channels in the study area determined by visual extraction fig 5 in light of the area of each place then the comparison of each normalized index of jan 1993 and jan 2015 was completed for each cell by those threshold values then the reclamation areas were extracted in the study area the definition of extracted reclamation areas is the land that was initially part of the water region then changed to a sand region by landfill especially those used as residential regions or industrial regions the reason why the reclamation areas used as residential regions or industrial regions are especially focused is that the urban development is the targeted watershed development in this research finally the cells regarded as water regions in 1993 and as soil regions in 2015 were extracted as the reclamation area to remove the cells that are different from the definition of reclamation areas such as cropland or sandbanks out of all cells regarded as water regions in 1993 and as soil regions in 2015 the ndvi and ndsi were used from all cells extracted by the mndwi only cells that had a ndvi value less than 0 30 and a ndsi value larger than 0 were extracted once again based on the above the results of the extraction of reclamation areas were derived and shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the yellow colored areas are the cells extracted as reclamation areas by remote sensing analysis namely the yellow colored areas were initially parts of the water regions then changed to sand regions by landfill and are used as residential regions or industrial regions now 4 1 2 accuracy verification of the result of extraction of reclamation areas the 49 reclamation areas were extracted by a remote sensing analysis and then a comparison of these results with the reclamation areas selected by visual extraction was done the reclamation areas that have a relatively large scale bigger than 250 m2 were extracted by visual extraction as a result of the comparison 49 reclamation areas that are approximately 95 of the 52 reclamation areas determined by visual extraction were extracted by the remote sensing analysis however only approximately 10 of the total area determined by visual extraction was extracted that is because of over extraction therefore not only the lands that were initially water regions and then changed to sand regions but also the lands that were initially soil or sand regions and then changed to residential or industrial regions were determined to be reclamation areas additionally many natural sandbanks which are located in different areas from the reclamation areas determined by visual extraction were also extracted the total area of extracted sand banks is approximately 25 of the total area of all extracted cells hence it could undeniably influence the results of extraction although it is difficult to distinguish natural sandbanks from reclamation areas since manmade reclamation areas are also located at the river channel the countermeasures such as indices to distinguish between sand regions and artificial structures need to be considered to remove the influence of natural sandbanks 4 2 probability model of the occurrence of reclamation 4 2 1 developing the probability model of the occurrence of reclamation in this research a probability model of the occurrence of reclamation by a multiple logistic regression model was constructed to find the tendency of occurrence of reclamation and reproduce the occurrence of reclamation in the study area for the logistic regression analysis 61 reclamation areas 49 areas extracted by the remote sensing analysis and matched with visual extraction and 12 areas extracted by the remote sensing analysis were targeted the existence of reclamation areas at 95 wetland areas in phnom penh and kandal province fig 2 was set as the objective value as explanatory variables the annual maximum water depth annual inundation duration population distance from the center of phnom penh and distance from river channels were set at first then to find the variables best able to express the objective variable a variable reduction method was used to minimize the aic akaike s information criterion value dirick et al 2015 the results of multiple logistic regression analysis are shown in table 1 the regression equation i e the probability model of the occurrence of reclamation is shown as eq 9 9 p i 1 1 exp b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 where p i is the probability of occurrence of reclamation in each cell b 0 b 1 b 2 are each regression coefficients x 1 is the distance from the center of phnom penh km and x 2 is the distance from the river channel km according to this model the map of the distribution of probability of occurrence of reclamation could be obtained and it is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 only the cells in which the annual maximum water depth existed in phnom penh and kandal province are shown the high probability areas are distributed around phnom penh hence it is obvious that the effect of the distance from the center of phnom penh is significant 4 2 2 goodness of fit of the logistic regression model the hosmer lemeshow test has been used for the evaluation of the goodness of fit of the model in this method the values of probability by a regression equation are divided into plural groups to make the number of lines of every group same and the goodness of fit of model could be discussed by the difference between the observation frequency and the expectation frequency calculated from the estimated probability in each group susanne and david 2003 as a result of the hosmer lemeshow test the significance of the probability was approximately 0 78 which is larger than the significance level of 0 05 this result means that the null hypothesis that the model accuracy is high could not be dismissed therefore the goodness of fit of the model is reasonably good in addition as the evaluation of the goodness of fit of the model the nagelkerke r 2 that is the generalized determination coefficient for a linear regression analysis was obtained n j d nagelkerke 1991 as a result when the distances from the center of phnom penh and river channels are set as explanatory variables the nagelkerke r 2 was approximately 0 89 the maximum value additionally the new reclamation areas were found by visual extraction from jan 2015 and nov 2016 of the landsat oli composite and the locations of those reclamation areas in the distribution map fig 7 were checked consequently five new reclamation areas were found and all of them are located in areas where the probability of occurrence of reclamation is more than 0 99 in the distribution map based on those results it was found that this model expresses the occurrence of reclamation in the study area reasonably well 4 3 impact of reclamation on hydraulic characteristics by the flood and inundation model 4 3 1 reproduction of reclamation areas in the flood and inundation model the existence of reclamation was reproduced and incorporated into the flood and inundation model by changing the elevation value on the calculation of flood and inundation from 1996 to avoid inundation in reclamation areas in referring the reclamation of boengkok lake 2012 at phnom penh the elevation of the reclamation area was set as 18 m in the srtm data based on the distribution map of the probability model fig 7 reclamations of 10 30 and 50 of all inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province hereinafter called the a area were reproduced and incorporated into the flood and inundation model these values of 10 30 and 50 are based on the areas of watershed development around phnom penh in cambodia and ayutthaya in thailand in 1989 2016 hiraga et al 2017 4 3 2 impact of reclamation on hydraulic characteristics the impact of reclamation on hydraulic characteristics was considered by using the difference of the results of the flood and inundation model when the reclamation is taken into account or not the difference in the annual maximum water depth between the flood and inundation of 1996 not including the reclamation and the one including the reclamation of 10 30 and 50 of the a area is shown in fig 8 in fig 8 the difference in the water depth in the cells whose elevations were changed is not shown additionally the difference within 0 05 m which is regarded in an error range is not shown from fig 8 an increase in the inundation water depth of approximately 3 8 m could be found around retention ponds in phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of the a area additionally an approximately 1 0 m increase in the inundation water depth could be found between the mekong river and the tonlesap river around phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of the a area these results are because of the intensive inflow of inundation water to those areas due to the decrease of retention ponds around phnom penh in addition the gradual increase of the inundation water depth was found in the remaining floodplain next to the reclaimed area between the mekong river and the tonlesap river for example an increase in the inundation water depth of approximately 60 70 cm was found there with an increase of the reclamation area from 10 to 30 of the a area moreover in case of the reclamation of 50 of the a area the increase in the water depth in the lower river basin could be found and the increase in the water depth happens gradually along with the increase of the area of reclamation furthermore in the case of the reclamation of 50 of the a area a decrease in the water depth of approximately 2 0 m could be found in the northern part of the study area this is because there is a decrease in the inundation area by large reclamation thus the inundation water was not provided to the area where a decrease in the water depth was found accordingly it is shown quantitatively that reclamation could change the hydraulic characteristics of the study area dramatically as shown above the increase in the water depth in the floodplain next to reclamation areas the decrease in the water depth in the floodplain near large reclamation areas and the increase in the inundation water depth in the lower river basin with an increase of reclamation area could be important knowledge for understanding the hydraulic impact of reclamation therefore it is one of the key indexes for watershed development 4 4 impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics by the total phosphorus transport model 4 4 1 reproduction of reclamation areas in the total phosphorus transport model the existence of reclamation was reproduced and incorporated into the total phosphorus transport model by changing the total phosphorus source unit values of reclamation cells on the step of the occurrence and loading in the process of the occurrence of total phosphorus the source unit values of reclamation areas were changed to be the value of urban areas fig 3 366 kg ha 1 year 1 yoshimura and takeuchi 2007 in the process of loading the total phosphorus load was divided equally and loaded into the cells that have an inundation water depth and are adjacent to reclamation cells these were applied to the reclamation areas of 10 30 and 50 of the a area and the distribution of total phosphorus concentration affected by reclamation was obtained by a numerical model on the other hand in reality the wastewater including phosphorus from the reclamation areas could be discharged to one specific place nevertheless it is difficult to get a model of determination of the loading places and also the distribution of total phosphorus that depends on the place of loading therefore the total phosphorus load was divided equally and loaded into the cells that have an inundation water depth and are adjacent to the reclamation cells in this research in addition the value ought to depend on the original land use in the reclamation areas however the model of land use in the reclamation areas such as the one that enables a determination of industrial areas and resort areas has not been constructed yet in this research hence the source unit value of urban areas was given to the reclamation areas 4 4 2 impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics the impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics was considered by the difference in the results of the total phosphorus transportation models when reclamation is taken into account or not the difference in the total phosphorus concentration averaged in the wet season may to november between the flood and inundation of 1996 not including reclamation and the one including the reclamation levels of 10 30 and 50 of the a area is shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the cells in which the total phosphorus value became larger than the criteria value due to reclamation are only shown by color here the value of criteria of total phosphorus is 0 125 mg l and it is for the quality of surface freshwater set for the maintenance of aquatic life by the who enderlein et al 2015 from fig 9 an increase in the total phosphorus concentration of approximately 0 71 mg l could be found around retention ponds in phnom penh in the case of reclamation of 10 of the a area additionally in the northern part of the study area the total phosphorus concentration value became 1 10 mg l along the tonlesap river due to reclamation and it is the almost 10 times the criteria value furthermore the increase of the total phosphorus concentration at a large scale was found around prey veng lake and the increase at the edge of the lake stood out approximately 0 40 mg l in fig 9 in prey veng the fishery in this lake is the main industry and is very important for supporting the lives of regidents open development cambodia 2012 therefore this significant increase in the total phosphorus concentration at prey veng lake in which the value became much larger than the criteria for the maintenance of aquatic life is a remarkable result economically ecologically and sanitarily from the above it is shown quantitatively that reclamation could change the water quality characteristics of the study area dramatically in the future modeling the determination of the place of loading or the determination of loading value by the land use type will be needed to consider the effects on water quality more precisely 5 conclusions this study clarified the impact of reclamation on the watershed environment of the lower mekong river basin quantitatively and provides fundamental knowledge of the impact of reclamation initially the locations of reclamation areas were extracted by a remote sensing analysis the extraction of reclamation areas was done using the mndwi ndvi and ndsi from landsat data of jan 1993 and jan 2015 as a result 49 reclamation areas which is approximately 95 of the 52 reclamation areas identified by visual extraction were extracted by the remote sensing analysis then a probabilistic model of the occurrence of reclamation was developed based on a multiple logistic regression analysis the goodness of fit of the model is confirmed as reasonably good by the hosmer lemeshow test and nagelkerke r2 it is shown that the probability of occurrence of reclamation could be explained by the distance from the phnom penh city and the distance from the river channels the high probability areas of occurrence of reclamation are distributed around phnom penh hence it is obvious that the effect of the distance from the center of phnom penh is significant finally the existence of reclamation areas was incorporated into the flood inundation model and total phosphorus transportation model changing the value of the elevation and the phosphorus loading at reclamation areas respectively as a result the impact of reclamation on the hydraulic characteristics was clarified by the flood and inundation model for example an increase of approximately 3 8 m in the inundation water depth could be found around retention ponds at phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of all the inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province moreover the impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics was clarified by the total phosphorus transport model for example an increase in the total phosphorus concentration of approximately 0 71 mg l could be found around retention ponds in phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of all inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province also the increase in the total phosphorus concentration at a large scale max 0 40 mg l was found around prey veng lake and the total phosphorus became much greater than that necessary for the maintenance of aquatic life set by the who these results can contribute to flood plain management in the downstream areas of the mekong river and also share common problems with the floodplains of continental rivers a quick response is necessary for not only wildlife but also human activities in very vulnerable floodplain regions acknowledgements this research was partially supported by the ministry of education science sports and culture grant in aid for scientific

8508,study region in the lower mekong river basin the watershed development such as reclamation has been rapidly going on the reclamation is expected to cause many problems on this important watershed environment study focus the objective of this research is to quantitatively clarify the impact of reclamation on the watershed environment of the lower mekong river basin new hydrological insights the locations of reclamation areas were extracted using mndwi ndvi and ndsi derived by landsat data as a result the 49 reclamation areas covering approximately 95 of all 52 reclamation areas determined by visual extraction were extracted then the multiple logistic regression model was constructed to find the tendency of the occurrence of reclamation and reproduce the occurrence of reclamation the test of goodness of fit such as hosmer lemeshow test and nagelkerke coefficient shows high adaptability r2 0 89 of the probability model the probability of occurrence of reclamation could be explained by the distance from the phnom penh city and the distance from the river channels moreover the existence of reclamation areas was incorporated into the flood inundation model and total phosphorus transportation model changing the value of the elevation and the phosphorus loading respectively consequently the inundation water level increases about 3 8 m and total phosphorus concentration increases about 0 71 mg l around phnom penh in case of the reclamation of 10 of all inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province keywords watershed development cambodia remote sensing ndwi multiple logistic regression flood inundation model 1 introduction floodplains that originate from floods and the inundation of rivers are regarded as one of the most productive areas and the floodplain s role in biodiversity and agriculture is extremely important junk et al 2013 it has been reported that floods and inundation are strongly related to agriculture or vegetation in many floodplains a study of the amazon found that some of the most influential factors that determine the vegetation distribution and composition are the water level and flood duration in the floodplain worbes 1997 ferreira and stohlgren 1999 parolin et al 2004 in the okavango delta in botswana the plant species composition was also found to be driven by flooding with the inter annual flooding frequency as the main driver of herbaceous plant distribution murray hudson 2009 murray hudson et al 2011 in the northern territory of australia a strong flooding seasonality was found to be responsible for the floodplain s biophysical patterns bowman and mcdonough 1991 finlayson 2005 warfe et al 2011 moreover in the floodplain of the mekong river it was concluded that canopy height and species richness of vegetation are strongly related to annual flood duration arias et al 2013 in addition amano and kazama showed that flooding and inundation make the soil fertile in the mekong river basin in light of the nutrient balance of the mekong river s flooding water soil and paddy rice amano and kazama 2016 this study concluded that flooding and inundation are vital concerns for the agriculture in the mekong river basin although the studies on agriculture and vegetation or material circulation in floodplains have been done as indicated above none of them included the impact of watershed development such as reclamation of the floodplain other than above studies a cost benefit analysis in terms of the benefit of agriculture and fisheries and the cost at the maximum flood kazama et al 2003 the estimation of the amount of groundwater resources kazama et al 2007 and the estimation of the risk of water borne disease amano et al 2011 have been done so far in the mekong river basin however the impact of watershed development has not been discussed in those studies yet currently according to economic and population growth it is becoming more important and necessary to focus on watershed development in many floodplains around the world particularly in cambodia located in the lower mekong river basin industrial areas and residential areas have been expanded rapidly around the capital city phnom penh and around each city with outstanding economic growth the majority of these developed areas were initially floodplain and have been reclaimed and created fig 1 because of this urban development in the lower mekong river basin the floodplain is being changed steadily recently the floodplain in the mekong river basin is extremely important since it plays roles in agricultural fishing groundwater recharge and water purification however the increase of land reclamation that is the decrease of the area of this important floodplain in the mekong river basin could lead to the loss of these functions and many problems for example reclamation increases the risk of flooding and inundation downstream because of the loss of storage not only the loss of the function of storage but also the decrease in base flow caused by the decrease of groundwater are also regarded as problems kazama et al 2007 in addition in terms of environmental issues many problems are also concerns such as the decrease of spawning grounds for fishes prawns and crabs or the loss of water purification under such circumstances the impacts of reclamation have been discussed only qualitatively and they have not been considered as serious problems by many cambodian government officials recently in the lower mekong river basin the impact of dam construction and climate change on the environment of the watershed has been discussed often shrestha et al 2016 arias et al 2014 but a study that evaluates the impact of floodplain reclamation quantitatively has not been done so far the quantitative evaluation of the impact of reclamation could lead to one of the guidelines of watershed development of the mekong river basin in cambodia where the development is going on rapidly moreover since similar problems are also concerns in other river basins such as the irrawaddy river basin in southeast asia or the ganges river basin thi myat et al 2012 this research could be helpful in providing beneficial information to other river basins therefore the objective of this research is to quantitatively clarify the impact of reclamation on the watershed environment of the lower mekong river basin to achieve our goal in this research as the initial analysis the locations of reclaimed areas were extracted by a remote sensing analysis in the study area in cambodia furthermore a logistic regression analysis has been done to determine the tendency of reclaimed land to be located in the floodplain then a probability model of the occurrence of reclamation was developed in the study area based on the results of the probability model the distribution of reclamation in the future was shown in the study area and the existence of reclamation areas was incorporated into the flood and inundation model and nutrient transportation model by changing the value of the elevation and the phosphorus loading in reclamation areas respectively 2 study area the mekong river the largest river in the southeast asia contains rich water resources forest resources and aquatic resources the study area for the present work is a specific region of this river basin in the lower mekong river basin in cambodia it is shown as the red framed area 140 km 110 km and the capital city of cambodia phnom penh is in the center of the study area in fig 2 in this study area the mekong river joins the tonlesap river at phnom penh and is divided into the bassac river fig 2 large scale inundation happens by flood water conveyed by colmatage in this area every rainy season in the lower mekong river basin in cambodia and vietnam an area of 30 000 40 000 km2 is inundated due to colmatage every year colmatage is a type of excavated dyke and traditional irrigation system of cambodia the flood water which has a silt component can be distributed to agricultural areas by these excavated dykes on the mekong river and the bassac river or by a setting culvert there are many types of these dykes but generally they have a depth of 2 3 m a width of 10 m and a length of 2 km in addition the main land cover of the study area is rice paddies and crop land rice paddies account for 38 and cropland accounts for 28 of the total study area there are also forests and vegetation areas and urban areas such as phnom penh account for 0 7 of the total study area the climate of the study area is tropical monsoon the rainy season is from may to november and the dry season is from december to april the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm 3 methods 3 1 derivation of ndwi ndvi ndsi and mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference soil index ndsi and normalized difference water index ndwi are the remote sensing derived indexes quantifying each land covers from the difference of reflectance at each channel of remote sensing data in this article these were used for specifying the land cover of each cell in the study area so that the reclamation areas could be extracted the derivation of each normalized index was based on the method of derivation by takeuchi and yasuoka 2004 each normalized index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference soil index ndsi and normalized difference water index ndwi were defined as eqs 1 3 1 n d w i v i s n i r v i s n i r 2 n d v i n i r v i s n i r v i s 3 n d s i s w i r n i r s w i r n i r where vis is the visible reflectance nir is the near infrared reflectance and swir is the short wave infrared reflectance in addition mndwi was derived by using mir the middle infrared reflectance instead of nir eq 4 4 m n d w i v i s m i r v i s m i r mndwi is the modified ndwi that more accurately discriminates between reclamation areas from the water regions hanqiu 2006 since the application of the ndwi in water regions with a built up land background does not identify water regions and built up land as expected the mndwi was suggested the concept of the mndwi uses the mir instead of the nir in eq 1 in built up land such as reclamation areas the values of the nir and vis could be similar therefore the value of the ndwi could be positive or 0 for both the water regions and reclamation areas therefore it might be difficult to distinguish the reclamation areas from water regions on the other hand since the mir shows much higher values than the vis in the reclamation areas the mndwi is likely to show a positive value in water regions and a negative value in reclamation areas based on the above the mndwi is more suitable for discrimination between water regions and reclamation areas 3 2 dataset for the numerical model elevation data and the location of the river channel were obtained from srtm shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation data produced by nasa in the flood and inundation model the daily water depth data at kampong cham prek dam tan chau and chau doc in the study area were obtained from the mrc mekong river commission and used as boundary conditions the resolution of srtm data is 90 m 90 m the initial water depth of the river channel was calculated by the linear interpolation method in light of the daily water depth data although this initial condition does not represent the actual water depth exactly it has a small effect on the accuracy of the numerical model because the numerical model simulation was started in the dry season the distribution of the initial water depth in the inundation area and the distribution of the groundwater depth were obtained by the simulation of a few years and used as initial conditions in the nutrient transportation model the concentration of total phosphorus in the river channels obtained from the mrc was used as the boundary condition the concentration of total phosphorus in river channels is measured every month by the mrc the total phosphorus source unit values were determined by the combination of land cover data and the phosphorus source unit values of each type of land cover introduced by yoshimura and takeuchi 2007 modq12 2000 was used for the land cover data in the study area based on the distribution of this land cover the distribution of total phosphorus source unit values was obtained and used as input data fig 3 3 3 flood and inundation model the method of calculation of flood and inundation is based on kazama et al 2007 in this method the hydrological model is composed of the following four main components the two dimensional non uniform flow model for water distribution in the inundation area the one dimensional dynamic wave model for river discharge simulations the overflow model for reproduction of the excavating dykes colmatage namely to combine the river flow model and the inundation model and a two dimensional groundwater flow model the width of the mekong river is actually greater than 1000 m and the widths of the bassac and tonle sap rivers are greater than 500 m since these widths are much greater than the spatial resolution required for the distributed model on a local scale the water discharges of the rivers were independently calculated in the model in addition the flood and inundation via the excavating dykes or colmatage are reproduced in the model by complete overflow and submerge overflow equations when the floodwater flows to dry land through a colmatage cut a complete overflow occurs there and when floodwater flows to wet areas through the colmatage cut a submerged overflow occurs additionally the groundwater recharge is estimated based on the calculated depths of inundation and the river then the groundwater level is estimated in the model the time interval and spatial resolution of the calculation are 2 s and 250 m respectively the value of evaporation from the water surface is 150 mm month which is the approximate value for tropical regions and the infiltration rate is 10 mm hour inoue et al 2000 fig 4 shows the distribution of the annual maximum water depth in the study area obtained by this model 3 3 1 model validation this flood and inundation model has been applied to the two flood and inundation events in the study area and validated by a comparison with observational data kazama et al 2007 and kazama et al 2012 the observational data are the groundwater levels 1996 1998 the inundation area derived by satellite image from july 2000 to december 2000 and the river water levels 1993 1997 and 1998 as a result of those validations this model represents the flood and inundation events with good accuracy in the study area example the inundation areas obtained from the calculation by this model were compared with observed satellite images radarsat on september 4 2000 it showed a good agreement between estimated inundation areas and the satellite image kazama et al 2007 also comparison showed that the model estimated water levels are in good agreement with the observed water levels at phonem penh since the details of the model validations has been reported in the previous studies kazama et al 2007 and kazama et al 2012 they are not mentioned in this article 3 4 nutrient transport model the method of calculation of nutrient transport is based on amano and kazama 2016 in this method only phosphorus transport is modeled because phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in this study area rather than nitrogen or silicon amano and kazama 2016 in addition as to the reason why only phosphorus transportation is modeled the transportation of nitrogen or silicon is too complicated to model therefore the accuracy of their transportation models could not be assured at a large scale like this study area in this model the occurrence and loading advection and sedimentation of total phosphorus are considered and reproduced the forms of phosphorus are not distinguished in the model and total phosphorus transport is modeled by assuming that the phosphorus is adsorbed to ss according to the high correlation 0 86 between the total phosphorus concentration and the ss concentration amano and kazama 2016 it could be said that this assumption is appropriate 3 4 1 total phosphorus transport calculation phosphorus transport is expressed by eq 5 as follows 5 l i t l a l i n l o u t l s where l i t is the amount of phosphorus in cell i at time t g l a is the phosphorus source unit determined by the land cover g l i n is the inflowing amount of phosphorus g l o u t is the outflowing amount of phosphorus g and l s is the amount of the phosphorus sedimentation g these are obtained as follows 6 l i n q i n c i 1 t 1 d t 7 l o u t q o u t c i t 1 d t 8 l s v s c i t 1 d x 2 d t where q i n is the inflow m3 s q o u t is the outflow m3 s c i t is the concentration of phosphorus of cell i at time t g m3 and v s is the sedimentation velocity in addition l a was determined in light of the land cover of each cell according to each phosphorus source unit value of cropland natural vegetation and urban areas yoshimura and takeuchi 2007 the sedimentation velocity of the total phosphorus was set as 0 5 m s in this research according to previous studies lung et al 1976 and sahoo et al 2010 and calibration with field observation data from amano and kazama 2016 it could be said that this value of sedimentation velocity includes the effect of diffusion or wind up because it was calibrated with field observation values 4 results and discussion 4 1 extraction of reclamation areas by a remote sensing analysis 4 1 1 extraction of reclamation areas by normalized indices the mndwi ndvi and ndsi were derived using the pixel values of each band from both jan 1993 data from landsat tm and jan 2015 data from landsat oli in light of the maximum water level of the mekong river for the last 30 years the data from jan 1993 which has a small scale of flooding and the data from jan 2015 which has a large scale of flooding were used to avoid the mis extraction of the reclamation area the spatial resolution of normalized indices is 30 m 30 m after deriving each index the threshold value of each index used to distinguish land cover was found by the algorithm of natural classification from jenks 1967 the threshold values were determined as follows the value of mndwi was bigger than 0 03 in water regions between 0 42 and 0 03 in soil regions and smaller than 0 42 in natural vegetation regions in the study area the extracted water information from the mndwi and this threshold value achieve an overall accuracy of 98 55 when comparing the five places such as the wetlands or the river channels in the study area determined by visual extraction fig 5 in light of the area of each place then the comparison of each normalized index of jan 1993 and jan 2015 was completed for each cell by those threshold values then the reclamation areas were extracted in the study area the definition of extracted reclamation areas is the land that was initially part of the water region then changed to a sand region by landfill especially those used as residential regions or industrial regions the reason why the reclamation areas used as residential regions or industrial regions are especially focused is that the urban development is the targeted watershed development in this research finally the cells regarded as water regions in 1993 and as soil regions in 2015 were extracted as the reclamation area to remove the cells that are different from the definition of reclamation areas such as cropland or sandbanks out of all cells regarded as water regions in 1993 and as soil regions in 2015 the ndvi and ndsi were used from all cells extracted by the mndwi only cells that had a ndvi value less than 0 30 and a ndsi value larger than 0 were extracted once again based on the above the results of the extraction of reclamation areas were derived and shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the yellow colored areas are the cells extracted as reclamation areas by remote sensing analysis namely the yellow colored areas were initially parts of the water regions then changed to sand regions by landfill and are used as residential regions or industrial regions now 4 1 2 accuracy verification of the result of extraction of reclamation areas the 49 reclamation areas were extracted by a remote sensing analysis and then a comparison of these results with the reclamation areas selected by visual extraction was done the reclamation areas that have a relatively large scale bigger than 250 m2 were extracted by visual extraction as a result of the comparison 49 reclamation areas that are approximately 95 of the 52 reclamation areas determined by visual extraction were extracted by the remote sensing analysis however only approximately 10 of the total area determined by visual extraction was extracted that is because of over extraction therefore not only the lands that were initially water regions and then changed to sand regions but also the lands that were initially soil or sand regions and then changed to residential or industrial regions were determined to be reclamation areas additionally many natural sandbanks which are located in different areas from the reclamation areas determined by visual extraction were also extracted the total area of extracted sand banks is approximately 25 of the total area of all extracted cells hence it could undeniably influence the results of extraction although it is difficult to distinguish natural sandbanks from reclamation areas since manmade reclamation areas are also located at the river channel the countermeasures such as indices to distinguish between sand regions and artificial structures need to be considered to remove the influence of natural sandbanks 4 2 probability model of the occurrence of reclamation 4 2 1 developing the probability model of the occurrence of reclamation in this research a probability model of the occurrence of reclamation by a multiple logistic regression model was constructed to find the tendency of occurrence of reclamation and reproduce the occurrence of reclamation in the study area for the logistic regression analysis 61 reclamation areas 49 areas extracted by the remote sensing analysis and matched with visual extraction and 12 areas extracted by the remote sensing analysis were targeted the existence of reclamation areas at 95 wetland areas in phnom penh and kandal province fig 2 was set as the objective value as explanatory variables the annual maximum water depth annual inundation duration population distance from the center of phnom penh and distance from river channels were set at first then to find the variables best able to express the objective variable a variable reduction method was used to minimize the aic akaike s information criterion value dirick et al 2015 the results of multiple logistic regression analysis are shown in table 1 the regression equation i e the probability model of the occurrence of reclamation is shown as eq 9 9 p i 1 1 exp b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 where p i is the probability of occurrence of reclamation in each cell b 0 b 1 b 2 are each regression coefficients x 1 is the distance from the center of phnom penh km and x 2 is the distance from the river channel km according to this model the map of the distribution of probability of occurrence of reclamation could be obtained and it is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 only the cells in which the annual maximum water depth existed in phnom penh and kandal province are shown the high probability areas are distributed around phnom penh hence it is obvious that the effect of the distance from the center of phnom penh is significant 4 2 2 goodness of fit of the logistic regression model the hosmer lemeshow test has been used for the evaluation of the goodness of fit of the model in this method the values of probability by a regression equation are divided into plural groups to make the number of lines of every group same and the goodness of fit of model could be discussed by the difference between the observation frequency and the expectation frequency calculated from the estimated probability in each group susanne and david 2003 as a result of the hosmer lemeshow test the significance of the probability was approximately 0 78 which is larger than the significance level of 0 05 this result means that the null hypothesis that the model accuracy is high could not be dismissed therefore the goodness of fit of the model is reasonably good in addition as the evaluation of the goodness of fit of the model the nagelkerke r 2 that is the generalized determination coefficient for a linear regression analysis was obtained n j d nagelkerke 1991 as a result when the distances from the center of phnom penh and river channels are set as explanatory variables the nagelkerke r 2 was approximately 0 89 the maximum value additionally the new reclamation areas were found by visual extraction from jan 2015 and nov 2016 of the landsat oli composite and the locations of those reclamation areas in the distribution map fig 7 were checked consequently five new reclamation areas were found and all of them are located in areas where the probability of occurrence of reclamation is more than 0 99 in the distribution map based on those results it was found that this model expresses the occurrence of reclamation in the study area reasonably well 4 3 impact of reclamation on hydraulic characteristics by the flood and inundation model 4 3 1 reproduction of reclamation areas in the flood and inundation model the existence of reclamation was reproduced and incorporated into the flood and inundation model by changing the elevation value on the calculation of flood and inundation from 1996 to avoid inundation in reclamation areas in referring the reclamation of boengkok lake 2012 at phnom penh the elevation of the reclamation area was set as 18 m in the srtm data based on the distribution map of the probability model fig 7 reclamations of 10 30 and 50 of all inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province hereinafter called the a area were reproduced and incorporated into the flood and inundation model these values of 10 30 and 50 are based on the areas of watershed development around phnom penh in cambodia and ayutthaya in thailand in 1989 2016 hiraga et al 2017 4 3 2 impact of reclamation on hydraulic characteristics the impact of reclamation on hydraulic characteristics was considered by using the difference of the results of the flood and inundation model when the reclamation is taken into account or not the difference in the annual maximum water depth between the flood and inundation of 1996 not including the reclamation and the one including the reclamation of 10 30 and 50 of the a area is shown in fig 8 in fig 8 the difference in the water depth in the cells whose elevations were changed is not shown additionally the difference within 0 05 m which is regarded in an error range is not shown from fig 8 an increase in the inundation water depth of approximately 3 8 m could be found around retention ponds in phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of the a area additionally an approximately 1 0 m increase in the inundation water depth could be found between the mekong river and the tonlesap river around phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of the a area these results are because of the intensive inflow of inundation water to those areas due to the decrease of retention ponds around phnom penh in addition the gradual increase of the inundation water depth was found in the remaining floodplain next to the reclaimed area between the mekong river and the tonlesap river for example an increase in the inundation water depth of approximately 60 70 cm was found there with an increase of the reclamation area from 10 to 30 of the a area moreover in case of the reclamation of 50 of the a area the increase in the water depth in the lower river basin could be found and the increase in the water depth happens gradually along with the increase of the area of reclamation furthermore in the case of the reclamation of 50 of the a area a decrease in the water depth of approximately 2 0 m could be found in the northern part of the study area this is because there is a decrease in the inundation area by large reclamation thus the inundation water was not provided to the area where a decrease in the water depth was found accordingly it is shown quantitatively that reclamation could change the hydraulic characteristics of the study area dramatically as shown above the increase in the water depth in the floodplain next to reclamation areas the decrease in the water depth in the floodplain near large reclamation areas and the increase in the inundation water depth in the lower river basin with an increase of reclamation area could be important knowledge for understanding the hydraulic impact of reclamation therefore it is one of the key indexes for watershed development 4 4 impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics by the total phosphorus transport model 4 4 1 reproduction of reclamation areas in the total phosphorus transport model the existence of reclamation was reproduced and incorporated into the total phosphorus transport model by changing the total phosphorus source unit values of reclamation cells on the step of the occurrence and loading in the process of the occurrence of total phosphorus the source unit values of reclamation areas were changed to be the value of urban areas fig 3 366 kg ha 1 year 1 yoshimura and takeuchi 2007 in the process of loading the total phosphorus load was divided equally and loaded into the cells that have an inundation water depth and are adjacent to reclamation cells these were applied to the reclamation areas of 10 30 and 50 of the a area and the distribution of total phosphorus concentration affected by reclamation was obtained by a numerical model on the other hand in reality the wastewater including phosphorus from the reclamation areas could be discharged to one specific place nevertheless it is difficult to get a model of determination of the loading places and also the distribution of total phosphorus that depends on the place of loading therefore the total phosphorus load was divided equally and loaded into the cells that have an inundation water depth and are adjacent to the reclamation cells in this research in addition the value ought to depend on the original land use in the reclamation areas however the model of land use in the reclamation areas such as the one that enables a determination of industrial areas and resort areas has not been constructed yet in this research hence the source unit value of urban areas was given to the reclamation areas 4 4 2 impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics the impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics was considered by the difference in the results of the total phosphorus transportation models when reclamation is taken into account or not the difference in the total phosphorus concentration averaged in the wet season may to november between the flood and inundation of 1996 not including reclamation and the one including the reclamation levels of 10 30 and 50 of the a area is shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the cells in which the total phosphorus value became larger than the criteria value due to reclamation are only shown by color here the value of criteria of total phosphorus is 0 125 mg l and it is for the quality of surface freshwater set for the maintenance of aquatic life by the who enderlein et al 2015 from fig 9 an increase in the total phosphorus concentration of approximately 0 71 mg l could be found around retention ponds in phnom penh in the case of reclamation of 10 of the a area additionally in the northern part of the study area the total phosphorus concentration value became 1 10 mg l along the tonlesap river due to reclamation and it is the almost 10 times the criteria value furthermore the increase of the total phosphorus concentration at a large scale was found around prey veng lake and the increase at the edge of the lake stood out approximately 0 40 mg l in fig 9 in prey veng the fishery in this lake is the main industry and is very important for supporting the lives of regidents open development cambodia 2012 therefore this significant increase in the total phosphorus concentration at prey veng lake in which the value became much larger than the criteria for the maintenance of aquatic life is a remarkable result economically ecologically and sanitarily from the above it is shown quantitatively that reclamation could change the water quality characteristics of the study area dramatically in the future modeling the determination of the place of loading or the determination of loading value by the land use type will be needed to consider the effects on water quality more precisely 5 conclusions this study clarified the impact of reclamation on the watershed environment of the lower mekong river basin quantitatively and provides fundamental knowledge of the impact of reclamation initially the locations of reclamation areas were extracted by a remote sensing analysis the extraction of reclamation areas was done using the mndwi ndvi and ndsi from landsat data of jan 1993 and jan 2015 as a result 49 reclamation areas which is approximately 95 of the 52 reclamation areas identified by visual extraction were extracted by the remote sensing analysis then a probabilistic model of the occurrence of reclamation was developed based on a multiple logistic regression analysis the goodness of fit of the model is confirmed as reasonably good by the hosmer lemeshow test and nagelkerke r2 it is shown that the probability of occurrence of reclamation could be explained by the distance from the phnom penh city and the distance from the river channels the high probability areas of occurrence of reclamation are distributed around phnom penh hence it is obvious that the effect of the distance from the center of phnom penh is significant finally the existence of reclamation areas was incorporated into the flood inundation model and total phosphorus transportation model changing the value of the elevation and the phosphorus loading at reclamation areas respectively as a result the impact of reclamation on the hydraulic characteristics was clarified by the flood and inundation model for example an increase of approximately 3 8 m in the inundation water depth could be found around retention ponds at phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of all the inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province moreover the impact of reclamation on water quality characteristics was clarified by the total phosphorus transport model for example an increase in the total phosphorus concentration of approximately 0 71 mg l could be found around retention ponds in phnom penh in the case of the reclamation of 10 of all inundation areas of phnom penh and kandal province also the increase in the total phosphorus concentration at a large scale max 0 40 mg l was found around prey veng lake and the total phosphorus became much greater than that necessary for the maintenance of aquatic life set by the who these results can contribute to flood plain management in the downstream areas of the mekong river and also share common problems with the floodplains of continental rivers a quick response is necessary for not only wildlife but also

8509,study region the study region is the southern quebec river network dataset on dams as well as daily flow recorded at stations were used study focus dam construction and operation can have significant impacts on hydrological regimes if dam construction induces some basic alterations to basin hydrology dam operation can introduce dynamic alterations in streamflow assessing the impacts of dam operation can be crucial for many applications where recorded flow series are used as a proxy for flow at nearby ungauged basins in regional flood frequency analysis or for hydrological modelling the potential influence of dam operation on recorded flows was assessed through statistical testing that verified the unimodality of the daily flow distribution the degree of regulation dor index was then used to relate the potential influences of dam operation to basic physiographic and dam characteristics new hydrological insights for the region application of a unimodality test to daily flow series recorded at stations located in the study region confirms that dam operation can result in non unimodal daily flow distribution estimation of dor values for all reaches of the study region shows that regulated river reaches could be potentially influenced by dam operation when dor 8 of the 29 regulated river reaches i e with one or more upstream dams approximately 30 could be potentially influenced dor 8 by dam operation keywords dam operation daily flow distribution unimodality degree of regulation index southern quebec 1 introduction the construction of dams have altered the natural flow regimes of many watersheds across the world graf 1999 nilsson et al 2005 grill et al 2015 and this will become even more important as dam construction is expected to continue increasing in the future zarfl et al 2015 dams have major impacts on hydrology as they can alter low flow regime and reduce peak flows change the interannual flow variability fitzhugh and vogel 2011 magilligan and nislow 2005 and alter geomorphology and aquatic ecosystems for a description of these impacts see poff and hart 2002 poff and schmidt 2016 in order to evaluate the impact of dam construction on hydrological regimes many studies have compared hydrographic characteristics estimated from pre and post dam construction on flows at downstream gaging stations e g magilligan and nislow 2005 graf 2006 poff et al 2006 gao et al 2009 hydrological indices inspired from those initially proposed by richter et al 1996 and the nature conservancy 2006 also called indicators of hydrologic alteration iha are often used to assess the hydrological changes resulting from dam construction these studies showed that globally dams tend to decrease flow peak frequency magnitude and duration while generally increasing the frequency magnitude and duration of low flows magilligan and nislow 2005 magilligan et al 2003 other impacts such as those related to downstream channel changes as a result of dams have also been analyzed schmidt and wilcock 2008 assessments of dam construction on streamflow by means of comparing pre and post dam hydrographic characteristics e g annual peak flow or annual minimum flows imply that some range of values are defined for natural flow regimes and that certain metrics are used to assess if post dam values significantly differ from natural values or pre dam conditions this type of comparison can be very challenging since many watershed characteristics e g areas altitudes and latitudes may influence hydrographic characteristics e g low flow values annual peak flow carlisle et al 2010 and therefore the influence of dam construction cannot be unambiguously assessed in certain cases assessing the specific impacts of dam operation are necessary if recorded flow series are used as a proxy for flow at nearby ungauged basins in regional flood frequency analysis or for hydrological modelling in this sense evaluating the specific impacts of dam operation can be important as non operated dams can be assimilated to storage capacities as pointed out by villarini and smith 2010 structural alterations to basin hydrology such as those induced by dams are the norm for flood records and analyses of flow distributions should reflect such anthropogenic changes dam operation however can induced dynamic alterations to streamflow that may overlap with the more basic changes introduced by dam construction comparing pre and post dam construction flows does not allow for the separation of the impacts of dam construction from its operation many studies have analyzed the influence of dam construction on flow regimes e g magilligan and nislow 2005 assani et al 2006 lajoie et al 2007 gross and moglen 2007 matteau et al 2009 peñas et al 2016 mei et al 2017 but very few studies have looked at the specific impacts of dam operation on flows i e how operations change flows in comparison to the situation where dams are not operated white et al 2005 using wavelet analysis evaluated the impact of glen canyon dam colorado river by comparing pre and post dam construction hourly flows at a downstream station they showed that clear operating cycles related to hydroelectricity production could be detected from hourly flow series zimmerman et al 2010 compared hourly flow series downstream of dams flood control run of river hydropower and peaking hydropower operated by the us army corps of engineers on the connecticut river basin to assess the potential impacts of dam operations on sub daily flow regimes these studies demonstrated that there was a distinctive signature for dam operation on sub daily flow other more recent studies have also addressed this issue of dam operation on streamflows e g meile et al 2011 carolli et al 2015 chen et al 2015 bevelhimer et al 2015 collectively these studies considered sub daily flow series and only hydroelectric dams the question however remains if dam operation other than hydroelectric dams can also have an impact on daily flows and if other types of dams e g flood control dams may also have a detectable impact on daily flow or a more general feature of the daily hydrogram the detection of characteristic signatures of dam operation on daily streamflow is difficult for many reasons firstly operation records or operation rules are unknown and in many cases operation status i e is the dam operated or not is even unknown secondly even when operation records are available operations have an impact on the short term flow and it remains difficult to assess their overall impact on hydrographs furthermore operation frequency can vary considerably from one dam to another depending on the specific use of the dam e g hydroelectricity production flood control thus making it even more difficult to detect the possible impacts on downstream flow incidentally studies have reported the impacts of dam operation on sub daily flow records arguing that flow variability changes induced by dam operation mainly affects sub daily flow and that a daily time scale is to coarse to characterize the possible influence of dam operations white et al 2005 zimmerman et al 2010 additionally it remains difficult to specifically assess the impacts of operations on downstream recorded flow given that stations are located at varying distances from operated dams finally upstream watersheds may include many dams being operated to varying degrees with varying operation schedules therefore increasing the difficulty of identifying distinct signatures of dam operation on recorded flows the main goal of this study was to define an index that can be readily estimated at any ungauged river reach from the available watershed and dam characteristics thus providing information about the potential impacts of dam operations on streamflow this was achieved through three main sub objectives first we investigated the impact of dam operation on recorded daily flow herein we propose a novel hydrological indicator of dam influence based on the unimodal or multi modal character of the daily flow distribution this indicator was validated through a comprehensive analysis of all streamflow records available for southern quebec second we propose an index based on readily available dam and hydrographic characteristics to assess the potential influence of dam operation on ungauged river reaches finally we have applied the proposed index to a river network in southern quebec and generated a map assessing the potential influence of dam operation on each reach the present study is organized as follows section 2 describes the dam and station datasets used in this study section 3 describes how the various dam configurations upstream of each station were structured in order to analyze the potential influence of dam operations on recorded flow section 4 describes the unimodality test and presents the results for the unregulated and regulated watersheds upstream of daily flow gauging stations section 5 presents the index based on readily available dam and watershed characteristics used to assess the potential influence of dam operation at ungauged river reaches section 6 presents some results of the global application of this index to the hydrographic network of southern quebec finally conclusions and perspectives for future work are presented in section 7 2 datasets 2 1 dam dataset dataset from the répertoire des barrages du québec quebec dam register available at http www cehq gouv qc ca barrages was used for the present study the dataset contains information on 6 529 dams located in the province of quebec canada the majority of the dataset focuses on dams in the southern part of the province available data are a name and identifier b latitude and longitude c altitude d area of upstream watershed e maximum reservoir capacity f function e g hydropower production water supply flood control g construction year h outlet structures i owner provincial or federal government hydropower companies municipalities private companies private owners associations etc a detailed description of the dam register is provided in cehq 2014 the dataset does not provide information regarding dam operation or operating status operated or not operated the only exceptions are the dams operated by the ministère du développement durable de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques mddelcc whose dates of operation and gate apertures are specified only dams with upstream watersheds larger than 15 km2 were considered in the present study reducing the number of dams to 1 889 dams were further classified as operable or non operable based on outlet structures e g sluice gate spillway leading to 857 operable dams the operable subgroup therefore includes all dams that could be operated even if their operating status is unknown with an upstream watershed of 15 km2 or more fig 1 presents a map with locations of these dams and fig 2 presents box plots of the reservoir capacities of these dams in relation to dam function note that dams may have more than one function thus according to the dam register for the selected dams 761 89 dams were assigned a single function 74 9 two functions 10 1 three functions and 7 1 four functions note that the function is unknown for 5 operable dams with upstream watersheds larger than 15 km2 therefore a given dam may appear up to four times in fig 2 as presented in fig 2 hydroelectric and flood control dams have the largest storage capacities while the largest number of dams are for recreation purposes e g lake outlets however these dams have on average much smaller storage capacities hereafter dams will refer to operable dams with upstream watersheds larger than 15 km2 these dams are owned and possibly operated by different organizations and groups provincial government hydropower companies municipalities private companies private owners associations etc 2 2 recorded flows a total of 443 hydrometric stations located in the province of québec canada and operated by the mddlecc were initially considered for the present study instantaneous daily flows are archived at each station the daily recording time may change from station to station but is generally midnight personal communication from william larouche chef division de l hydrométrie mddelcc stations complying with the following selection criteria were targeted for further analysis 1 stations must have a minimum of 5 valid years a valid year is defined as a year with less than 10 missing daily values 2 stations must not contain a sequence of more than five consecutive missing years 3 stations must be localized south of 50 n 4 upstream watersheds must be larger than 100 km2 5 upstream watersheds must be completely located in the province of québec this last condition is necessary as the dam repertoire only includes quebec s dams a total of 259 stations complied with these criteria a comprehensive analysis of available daily flow records at the 259 stations was carried out to check for possible trends break points and abnormal values or sequences e g series of zero values in watersheds where such a sequence is highly unlikely stepwise series over certain periods of time that may indicate changes in resolution based on the comprehensive analysis a further thirty three 33 stations were discarded abnormal values were also discarded e g values from early recording periods with much lower resolution than the values recorded for following periods in many station records fig 3 presents the map of the 226 stations considered in the present study 3 methods 3 1 station dam configurations recorded flows at stations were analyzed according to the dam configurations in the upstream watersheds which in many cases have changed over time with the construction of new dams fig 4 in the following recording periods at each station were partitioned into sub periods according to the construction year of the different dams only sub periods with 5 valid years or more were further considered after discarding the 2 year period preceding the construction of the dam and the year following the construction of the dam a hypothetical scenario is presented in fig 4 in fig 4 considering that all years are valid three stations periods were defined a first period with no upstream dam a second with one upstream dam and a third with four upstream dams two periods between the construction of dam d2 and d3 and dams d3 and d4 were not considered given that these span less than 5 valid years these periods associated with specific stations and specific upstream dam configurations are hereafter referred to as stations periods a total of 174 stations periods were therefore defined with 70 stations periods 40 having no dams in their upstream watersheds fig 5 presents the histogram of the number of stations periods with one or more dams in their upstream watersheds 104 station period as can be seen 48 stations periods 46 have one dam in their upstream watersheds while the remaining 56 have more than one dam upstream some stations periods have a large number of dams in their upstream watersheds up to 24 dams to our knowledge no dams have been removed and therefore the number of dams in the upstream watersheds has either increased or remained unchanged over time fig 6 presents the histogram of the number of available valid years of records for both stations periods with and without dams 3 2 detection of the influence of dam operation on daily flow distribution a metric based on the unimodality of the daily flow distribution was analyzed to assess the potential impacts of dam operation on daily flow the application of such a metric was motivated by the existence of dam operating rules aimed at maintaining discharges within a fixed range of flow during specific periods of the year such rules may result in sustained flows over these periods and consequently in more than one mode in the daily flow distribution downstream of the dam in comparison natural flows or flows downstream of non operated dams usually leads to a unimodal distribution fig 7 presents an example in which two modes can be clearly seen these modes were associated with the two targeted flows by the dam operator the first at 1 4 m3 s generally set during summer and the second at 3 m3 s set during autumn and winter personal communication julie lafleur mddelcc the main advantage of this approach compared to the one based on hydrological indices such as indicators of hydrology alteration iha richter et al 1996 is that the distribution unimodality can be simply and quickly assessed using a statistical test while changes in indices can be cumbersome as one needs to compare values from operated and non operated dams which may depend for instance on upstream watershed superficies mailhot et al 2014 furthermore non unimodality can be directly linked to dam operation while approaches based on iha cannot disentangle the potential influences of dam operation from those due to dam construction unimodality was assessed using the dip test hereafter called unimodality test developed by hartigan and hartigan 1985 the non unimodality distribution was tested at the 5 significance level and associated with the influence of dam operation on recorded flows two special features of the daily flow series were considered since they led to spurious unimodality test results the first feature was related to the coarse flow resolution or changes in recorded flow resolution over time the second feature was related to the presence of constant flow values over many days in some of the records coarse resolution or changing resolution led to stepwise discontinuities in the cumulative function distribution of daily flow that were interpreted as a non unimodal distribution by the unimodality test in this circumstance random values uniformly distributed were added to the recorded values to generate a continuous series the second feature relates to the presence in some of the records of constant flow values over many days for the period prior to 1966 1967 flows were manually recorded by an observer prior to 1966 1967 and constant flow values are presumably related to the observer assiduity personal communication from william larouche chef division de l hydrométrie mddelcc therefore we decided to discard recorded flows prior to 1966 from all stations periods 3 3 assessing the potential influence of dam operation on flow at ungauged river reaches the application of the unimodality test necessitates that recorded flows are available at the reaches where potential influences of dam operation are sought an assessment of the potential impacts of dam operation on river reaches without gauging stations requires that an index be defined linking the potential impacts of dam operation with dam location characteristics and the hydrographic characteristics of the considered river reach two main factors may determine the potential influence of dam operation on streamflow at a given reach 1 the capacity of the dam reservoirs compared to the reach flow a large capacity flow ratio suggests that the dam may induce a large relative change in flow and 2 the relative location of the dam and the river reach the impact of dam operation is expected to decrease for reaches further downstream of a dam previous studies have defined indices to characterize the potential influences of dam construction or operation on downstream flow the impounded runoff index iri singer 2007 has been defined as the ratio of reservoir capacity to median annual flood runoff volume a slightly different index named impounded runoff ir defined as the ratio of reservoir capacity to annual runoff has been proposed by batalla et al 2004 in order to take into consideration the possible influence of multiple upstream dams singer 2007 also used the total upstream reservoir capacity for stations under the influence of multiple dams more recently lehner et al 2011 in order to evaluate the environmental impacts of dams on biodiversity ecosystem functioning and fluvial geomorphology due to hydrological alterations introduced the degree of regulation dor metric see also grill et al 2014 dor is defined as the ratio of total storage capacity to total annual flow volume at the considered reach 1 d o r j 100 d j i 1 n j s i j where s i j is the storage capacity of dam i upstream of reach j n j is the number of dams upstream of reach j and d j is the annual flow volume at reach j water volume within the river channel corresponds to the average discharge based on an approximation of channel width and depth grill et al 2014 this metric is very similar to the iri index and both are designed to quantify hydrological alterations induced by dams a large dor value corresponds to a configuration allowing a significant fraction of the annual discharge volume at a given reach to be stored and released at later time dor was therefore used in the present study as a proxy for how streamflow at a given reach may be altered by upstream dam operations grill et al 2014 since annual flow volumes were not available for all reaches volumes were estimated using the linear regression between median annual flow volume and the upstream watershed area not shown for conciseness dor values were therefore estimated and compared to the result of the unimodality test for the available stations periods it is expected that altered flows due to dam operation detected through non unimodal flow distribution is more likely to occur for reaches with high dor values in order to assess the potential influences of dams operated by the mddelcc the relative dor index was also defined relative dor corresponds to the fraction of the total reservoir capacity upstream from a given reach that is associated with mddelcc operated dams a relative dor value equal to zero therefore indicates that the stations periods do not include a mddelcc dam in its upstream watershed while a value of one means that all upstream dams are mddelcc operated dams 4 results 4 1 application of the unimodality test to available stations periods table 1 summarizes the results of the unimodality test for all stations periods it was first applied to the 70 unregulated stations periods i e with no upstream dam when applying the unimodality test to these 70 stations periods we obviously expected a unimodal daily flow distribution given the absence of upstream dams the results of this application indicate that all distributions were effectively unimodal except for four stations periods these four stations periods are located downstream of unregulated watersheds over their entire recording periods mistassini 49 32 n 72 64 e 4 194 km2 7 year record bell 48 32 n 77 30 e 1 902 km2 7 year record waswanipi 4986 n 77 19 e 31 272 km2 51 year record and désert 46 59 n 76 04 e 1 644 km2 12 year record the four non unimodal stations are indicated by triangles in fig 3 the first three stations are located in the northern part of the study region north of 48 n while the remaining station is located further south fig 8 presents an example of daily flow distribution and its corresponding mean annual hydrograph for the waswanipi station northernmost station with the longest record and the largest upstream watershed among the four unregulated stations periods with non unimodal daily flow distribution as can be seen in fig 8 the annual hydrograph is characterized by a recession following the spring peak that extends to september and october after which flows increase in november and finally decrease for another extended period during winter the two modes of the distribution were therefore associated with a low flow period from february to mid april first peak at 200 m3 sec and the second mode extended plateau in the distribution from 300 to 800 m3 sec was associated with the august to december period this example is representative of the three northernmost stations and also of some other watersheds located north of 50 latitude not shown for conciseness this demonstrates that seasonal hydrological regimes for some northern watersheds may lead to non unimodal daily flow distributions the unimodality test should therefore be applied with caution when assessing the impacts of dam operation in northern watersheds the fourth case désert station presents a different feature which is characterized by very low flow and very low variability of daily flow series from september to november over a 10 year period not shown for conciseness this explains the non unimodality of the daily flow distribution no other reason e g watershed characteristics or some problems with recording set up was found that could explain this result this situation demonstrates that in some very specific cases non unimodal daily flow distributions can be observed further research is needed to investigate this point the unimodality test was then applied to stations periods with one or more dams in their upstream watersheds table 1 of the 104 stations periods belonging to this category 88 85 were classified as unimodal of the 46 stations periods with at least one dam operated by the mddelcc operated dam regardless of their locations in the upstream watershed or their capacities 13 28 were classified as influenced by upstream dam operation since their daily flow distributions were non unimodal while for the 58 remaining stations periods with no upstream dams operated by the mddelcc operated dam only 3 were classified as being influenced by dam operation non unimodal daily flow distribution 4 2 potential influence of dam operation on flow at ungauged river reaches fig 9 presents the relative dor and dor values for all stations periods with upstream dams and the results of the unimodality test 5 significance level this figure reveals some interesting features the first is that the available stations periods with upstream mddelcc dams have dor values close or larger than 10 1 the second is that no station period was classified as influenced non unimodal daily flow distribution according to the unimodality test for dor 8 i e reaches where the total upstream dam capacity represents 8 or more of the median annual volume transiting this reach this result therefore supports the hypothesis that impacts of dam operation on daily streamflow is more easily detected for larger dor values it also suggests that dor values may be used as a proxy to assess the potential modification of streamflow due to dam operation for river reaches where no recorded streamflow are available it however does not imply that a reach with dor 8 is necessarily influenced by dam operation river reaches with dor values larger than 8 may be in fact non influenced by upstream dam operations simply because these dams are not operated or that their operations have negligible impact on daily streamflow river reaches with dor 8 are therefore designated as potentially influenced by dam operation 4 3 application to southern quebec river network the intent of the proposed approach is to provide an indicator identifying the river reaches that are potentially influenced by operation at upstream dams such information can be crucial for many applications where recorded flow series at specific reaches are used as proxies for flow at nearby ungauged basins in regional flood frequency analysis or for hydrological modelling a large scale application of the proposed approach to the southern quebec river network using readily available data was therefore realized dor values were estimated for reaches with upstream watersheds completely located within quebec boundaries for a total of 4 200 reaches with an average reach length of 16 km of these river reaches 3 384 reaches 81 were unregulated no upstream dams and dor values of zero fig 10 presents the cumulative distribution of dor values for all regulated reaches it is interesting to note that approximately 30 of the regulated river reaches could be potentially influenced dor 8 by dam operation according to our previous analysis fig 11 presents two examples of dor values for the rivière st françois watershed fig 11a and saguenay watershed fig 11b these examples show that some classification of the reaches according to the potential influence of dam operation on flows can be made for instance river reaches with dor 8 could be associated with potentially influenced reaches 5 conclusion some applications need to assess the potential influence of dam operation on flow at given river reaches for example when recorded flows at a gauged watershed are used as a proxy for a neighbouring ungauged watershed or downstream reaches or when using recorded flows for modelling purpose e g calibration or validation of hydrological models non operated dams can be assimilated to storage facilities and corresponding large scale alterations to basin hydrology could be considered as the norm for flood records flow distribution analysis should therefore reflect such anthropogenic changes villarini and smith 2010 dam operation however introduces a dynamic component to flow alterations that can be more difficult to detect and take into consideration in regional flood analysis in this context it is important to assess potential changes to natural flows due to dam operation and to identify stations and river reaches that may be influenced by dam operation generally dam operating status is unknown when the operating status is known dam operating records may still not be available very vaguely described or even confidential the non unimodality of daily flow distributions was examined as a possible signature of dam operation on daily recorded flow the main hypothesis underlying the use of this metric is that many dams are operated according to some specific rules aiming at targeting specific ranges of flow values for certain flow conditions or periods of the year recorded flows at 226 stations across southern quebec were analyzed records at these stations were partitioned into sub periods according to the upstream dam configuration each of these sub periods called station period therefore corresponds to a daily flow series with a given upstream dam configuration a unimodality test aiming at verifying the hypothesis that the daily flow distribution was unimodal was first applied to the 174 available station periods results demonstrated that for the 70 unregulated stations periods i e with no upstream dams four were classified as non unimodal a close examination of these four cases showed that three correspond to watersheds located in the northern part of the study region in these cases the slow decrease of the spring flood and persistence of the spring flow regime over a large part of the summer months explains the non unimodality of the daily flow distribution non unimodality of the fourth watershed remains at this point unexplained application of the unimodality test to the 104 stations periods with one or more upstream dams suggested that the impacts of dam operation can be detected in some cases many stations downstream of watersheds with one or more large capacity dams with known operation status mddelcc operated dams displayed non unimodal daily flow distributions consistency of results for unregulated stations periods unimodal distributions and regulated stations periods downstream of the dams operated by the mddelcc operated dams some displaying non unimodal distributions supports the hypothesis that non unimodality can be attributed to dam operation in order to be able to extend the analysis to ungauged river reaches the ratio of the total reservoir capacity to the median annual volume transiting through a given river reach was defined this ratio called degree of regulation dor initially proposed by lehner et al 2011 is conceptually similar to the iri used by singer 2007 it is based on the idea that the potential influence of dam operation will likely be more important when the upstream reservoir capacity stocks a large fraction of the median annual flow transiting in the downstream river reach estimation of the dor values for all stations periods with one or more upstream dams showed that station period influenced by dam operation according to the unimodality test have dor values larger than 8 a threshold value for dor values could therefore be define as a proxy for the potential influence of dam operation on flows note that dor values were designed to identify the potential influence of dam operation that is an influence that could be detected if the dam is operated a river reach with a large dor value may not in fact be influenced by dam operation for instance if the dam is not actually operated small dor values are as well interpreted as indicative that possible dam operations will not influence river reach flows many factors may determine the magnitude of the impacts of dam operation on downstream flows such as the dam s function hydroelectricity production water supply flood protection etc operation rules operation frequency daily weekly seasonal annual reservoir capacity dam outlets gates spillway etc etc unimodality test measures one specific type of influence modality of daily flow distribution other indices e g iha indices may therefore be needed to detect other possible impacts of dam operation on flows using standard indices such as iha indices however imply that some reference range of index values be defined for non influenced or natural configurations and that some metric be defined to measure possible departure from these values unimodality test in contrast provides interesting ways to assess the potential influence of dam operation on daily flow and is easy to implement and interpret furthermore this index is more directly linked to dam operation note that non unimodal daily flow distributions can also be observed rarely according to our results for unregulated watersheds future work should extend the study to other regions in order to verify how dam operations affect the daily flow distributions as reported in this study additionally results based on unimodality test should be compared with those produced from approaches based on indicators of hydrologic alteration peñas et al 2016 conflict of

8509,study region the study region is the southern quebec river network dataset on dams as well as daily flow recorded at stations were used study focus dam construction and operation can have significant impacts on hydrological regimes if dam construction induces some basic alterations to basin hydrology dam operation can introduce dynamic alterations in streamflow assessing the impacts of dam operation can be crucial for many applications where recorded flow series are used as a proxy for flow at nearby ungauged basins in regional flood frequency analysis or for hydrological modelling the potential influence of dam operation on recorded flows was assessed through statistical testing that verified the unimodality of the daily flow distribution the degree of regulation dor index was then used to relate the potential influences of dam operation to basic physiographic and dam characteristics new hydrological insights for the region application of a unimodality test to daily flow series recorded at stations located in the study region confirms that dam operation can result in non unimodal daily flow distribution estimation of dor values for all reaches of the study region shows that regulated river reaches could be potentially influenced by dam operation when dor 8 of the 29 regulated river reaches i e with one or more upstream dams approximately 30 could be potentially influenced dor 8 by dam operation keywords dam operation daily flow distribution unimodality degree of regulation index southern quebec 1 introduction the construction of dams have altered the natural flow regimes of many watersheds across the world graf 1999 nilsson et al 2005 grill et al 2015 and this will become even more important as dam construction is expected to continue increasing in the future zarfl et al 2015 dams have major impacts on hydrology as they can alter low flow regime and reduce peak flows change the interannual flow variability fitzhugh and vogel 2011 magilligan and nislow 2005 and alter geomorphology and aquatic ecosystems for a description of these impacts see poff and hart 2002 poff and schmidt 2016 in order to evaluate the impact of dam construction on hydrological regimes many studies have compared hydrographic characteristics estimated from pre and post dam construction on flows at downstream gaging stations e g magilligan and nislow 2005 graf 2006 poff et al 2006 gao et al 2009 hydrological indices inspired from those initially proposed by richter et al 1996 and the nature conservancy 2006 also called indicators of hydrologic alteration iha are often used to assess the hydrological changes resulting from dam construction these studies showed that globally dams tend to decrease flow peak frequency magnitude and duration while generally increasing the frequency magnitude and duration of low flows magilligan and nislow 2005 magilligan et al 2003 other impacts such as those related to downstream channel changes as a result of dams have also been analyzed schmidt and wilcock 2008 assessments of dam construction on streamflow by means of comparing pre and post dam hydrographic characteristics e g annual peak flow or annual minimum flows imply that some range of values are defined for natural flow regimes and that certain metrics are used to assess if post dam values significantly differ from natural values or pre dam conditions this type of comparison can be very challenging since many watershed characteristics e g areas altitudes and latitudes may influence hydrographic characteristics e g low flow values annual peak flow carlisle et al 2010 and therefore the influence of dam construction cannot be unambiguously assessed in certain cases assessing the specific impacts of dam operation are necessary if recorded flow series are used as a proxy for flow at nearby ungauged basins in regional flood frequency analysis or for hydrological modelling in this sense evaluating the specific impacts of dam operation can be important as non operated dams can be assimilated to storage capacities as pointed out by villarini and smith 2010 structural alterations to basin hydrology such as those induced by dams are the norm for flood records and analyses of flow distributions should reflect such anthropogenic changes dam operation however can induced dynamic alterations to streamflow that may overlap with the more basic changes introduced by dam construction comparing pre and post dam construction flows does not allow for the separation of the impacts of dam construction from its operation many studies have analyzed the influence of dam construction on flow regimes e g magilligan and nislow 2005 assani et al 2006 lajoie et al 2007 gross and moglen 2007 matteau et al 2009 peñas et al 2016 mei et al 2017 but very few studies have looked at the specific impacts of dam operation on flows i e how operations change flows in comparison to the situation where dams are not operated white et al 2005 using wavelet analysis evaluated the impact of glen canyon dam colorado river by comparing pre and post dam construction hourly flows at a downstream station they showed that clear operating cycles related to hydroelectricity production could be detected from hourly flow series zimmerman et al 2010 compared hourly flow series downstream of dams flood control run of river hydropower and peaking hydropower operated by the us army corps of engineers on the connecticut river basin to assess the potential impacts of dam operations on sub daily flow regimes these studies demonstrated that there was a distinctive signature for dam operation on sub daily flow other more recent studies have also addressed this issue of dam operation on streamflows e g meile et al 2011 carolli et al 2015 chen et al 2015 bevelhimer et al 2015 collectively these studies considered sub daily flow series and only hydroelectric dams the question however remains if dam operation other than hydroelectric dams can also have an impact on daily flows and if other types of dams e g flood control dams may also have a detectable impact on daily flow or a more general feature of the daily hydrogram the detection of characteristic signatures of dam operation on daily streamflow is difficult for many reasons firstly operation records or operation rules are unknown and in many cases operation status i e is the dam operated or not is even unknown secondly even when operation records are available operations have an impact on the short term flow and it remains difficult to assess their overall impact on hydrographs furthermore operation frequency can vary considerably from one dam to another depending on the specific use of the dam e g hydroelectricity production flood control thus making it even more difficult to detect the possible impacts on downstream flow incidentally studies have reported the impacts of dam operation on sub daily flow records arguing that flow variability changes induced by dam operation mainly affects sub daily flow and that a daily time scale is to coarse to characterize the possible influence of dam operations white et al 2005 zimmerman et al 2010 additionally it remains difficult to specifically assess the impacts of operations on downstream recorded flow given that stations are located at varying distances from operated dams finally upstream watersheds may include many dams being operated to varying degrees with varying operation schedules therefore increasing the difficulty of identifying distinct signatures of dam operation on recorded flows the main goal of this study was to define an index that can be readily estimated at any ungauged river reach from the available watershed and dam characteristics thus providing information about the potential impacts of dam operations on streamflow this was achieved through three main sub objectives first we investigated the impact of dam operation on recorded daily flow herein we propose a novel hydrological indicator of dam influence based on the unimodal or multi modal character of the daily flow distribution this indicator was validated through a comprehensive analysis of all streamflow records available for southern quebec second we propose an index based on readily available dam and hydrographic characteristics to assess the potential influence of dam operation on ungauged river reaches finally we have applied the proposed index to a river network in southern quebec and generated a map assessing the potential influence of dam operation on each reach the present study is organized as follows section 2 describes the dam and station datasets used in this study section 3 describes how the various dam configurations upstream of each station were structured in order to analyze the potential influence of dam operations on recorded flow section 4 describes the unimodality test and presents the results for the unregulated and regulated watersheds upstream of daily flow gauging stations section 5 presents the index based on readily available dam and watershed characteristics used to assess the potential influence of dam operation at ungauged river reaches section 6 presents some results of the global application of this index to the hydrographic network of southern quebec finally conclusions and perspectives for future work are presented in section 7 2 datasets 2 1 dam dataset dataset from the répertoire des barrages du québec quebec dam register available at http www cehq gouv qc ca barrages was used for the present study the dataset contains information on 6 529 dams located in the province of quebec canada the majority of the dataset focuses on dams in the southern part of the province available data are a name and identifier b latitude and longitude c altitude d area of upstream watershed e maximum reservoir capacity f function e g hydropower production water supply flood control g construction year h outlet structures i owner provincial or federal government hydropower companies municipalities private companies private owners associations etc a detailed description of the dam register is provided in cehq 2014 the dataset does not provide information regarding dam operation or operating status operated or not operated the only exceptions are the dams operated by the ministère du développement durable de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques mddelcc whose dates of operation and gate apertures are specified only dams with upstream watersheds larger than 15 km2 were considered in the present study reducing the number of dams to 1 889 dams were further classified as operable or non operable based on outlet structures e g sluice gate spillway leading to 857 operable dams the operable subgroup therefore includes all dams that could be operated even if their operating status is unknown with an upstream watershed of 15 km2 or more fig 1 presents a map with locations of these dams and fig 2 presents box plots of the reservoir capacities of these dams in relation to dam function note that dams may have more than one function thus according to the dam register for the selected dams 761 89 dams were assigned a single function 74 9 two functions 10 1 three functions and 7 1 four functions note that the function is unknown for 5 operable dams with upstream watersheds larger than 15 km2 therefore a given dam may appear up to four times in fig 2 as presented in fig 2 hydroelectric and flood control dams have the largest storage capacities while the largest number of dams are for recreation purposes e g lake outlets however these dams have on average much smaller storage capacities hereafter dams will refer to operable dams with upstream watersheds larger than 15 km2 these dams are owned and possibly operated by different organizations and groups provincial government hydropower companies municipalities private companies private owners associations etc 2 2 recorded flows a total of 443 hydrometric stations located in the province of québec canada and operated by the mddlecc were initially considered for the present study instantaneous daily flows are archived at each station the daily recording time may change from station to station but is generally midnight personal communication from william larouche chef division de l hydrométrie mddelcc stations complying with the following selection criteria were targeted for further analysis 1 stations must have a minimum of 5 valid years a valid year is defined as a year with less than 10 missing daily values 2 stations must not contain a sequence of more than five consecutive missing years 3 stations must be localized south of 50 n 4 upstream watersheds must be larger than 100 km2 5 upstream watersheds must be completely located in the province of québec this last condition is necessary as the dam repertoire only includes quebec s dams a total of 259 stations complied with these criteria a comprehensive analysis of available daily flow records at the 259 stations was carried out to check for possible trends break points and abnormal values or sequences e g series of zero values in watersheds where such a sequence is highly unlikely stepwise series over certain periods of time that may indicate changes in resolution based on the comprehensive analysis a further thirty three 33 stations were discarded abnormal values were also discarded e g values from early recording periods with much lower resolution than the values recorded for following periods in many station records fig 3 presents the map of the 226 stations considered in the present study 3 methods 3 1 station dam configurations recorded flows at stations were analyzed according to the dam configurations in the upstream watersheds which in many cases have changed over time with the construction of new dams fig 4 in the following recording periods at each station were partitioned into sub periods according to the construction year of the different dams only sub periods with 5 valid years or more were further considered after discarding the 2 year period preceding the construction of the dam and the year following the construction of the dam a hypothetical scenario is presented in fig 4 in fig 4 considering that all years are valid three stations periods were defined a first period with no upstream dam a second with one upstream dam and a third with four upstream dams two periods between the construction of dam d2 and d3 and dams d3 and d4 were not considered given that these span less than 5 valid years these periods associated with specific stations and specific upstream dam configurations are hereafter referred to as stations periods a total of 174 stations periods were therefore defined with 70 stations periods 40 having no dams in their upstream watersheds fig 5 presents the histogram of the number of stations periods with one or more dams in their upstream watersheds 104 station period as can be seen 48 stations periods 46 have one dam in their upstream watersheds while the remaining 56 have more than one dam upstream some stations periods have a large number of dams in their upstream watersheds up to 24 dams to our knowledge no dams have been removed and therefore the number of dams in the upstream watersheds has either increased or remained unchanged over time fig 6 presents the histogram of the number of available valid years of records for both stations periods with and without dams 3 2 detection of the influence of dam operation on daily flow distribution a metric based on the unimodality of the daily flow distribution was analyzed to assess the potential impacts of dam operation on daily flow the application of such a metric was motivated by the existence of dam operating rules aimed at maintaining discharges within a fixed range of flow during specific periods of the year such rules may result in sustained flows over these periods and consequently in more than one mode in the daily flow distribution downstream of the dam in comparison natural flows or flows downstream of non operated dams usually leads to a unimodal distribution fig 7 presents an example in which two modes can be clearly seen these modes were associated with the two targeted flows by the dam operator the first at 1 4 m3 s generally set during summer and the second at 3 m3 s set during autumn and winter personal communication julie lafleur mddelcc the main advantage of this approach compared to the one based on hydrological indices such as indicators of hydrology alteration iha richter et al 1996 is that the distribution unimodality can be simply and quickly assessed using a statistical test while changes in indices can be cumbersome as one needs to compare values from operated and non operated dams which may depend for instance on upstream watershed superficies mailhot et al 2014 furthermore non unimodality can be directly linked to dam operation while approaches based on iha cannot disentangle the potential influences of dam operation from those due to dam construction unimodality was assessed using the dip test hereafter called unimodality test developed by hartigan and hartigan 1985 the non unimodality distribution was tested at the 5 significance level and associated with the influence of dam operation on recorded flows two special features of the daily flow series were considered since they led to spurious unimodality test results the first feature was related to the coarse flow resolution or changes in recorded flow resolution over time the second feature was related to the presence of constant flow values over many days in some of the records coarse resolution or changing resolution led to stepwise discontinuities in the cumulative function distribution of daily flow that were interpreted as a non unimodal distribution by the unimodality test in this circumstance random values uniformly distributed were added to the recorded values to generate a continuous series the second feature relates to the presence in some of the records of constant flow values over many days for the period prior to 1966 1967 flows were manually recorded by an observer prior to 1966 1967 and constant flow values are presumably related to the observer assiduity personal communication from william larouche chef division de l hydrométrie mddelcc therefore we decided to discard recorded flows prior to 1966 from all stations periods 3 3 assessing the potential influence of dam operation on flow at ungauged river reaches the application of the unimodality test necessitates that recorded flows are available at the reaches where potential influences of dam operation are sought an assessment of the potential impacts of dam operation on river reaches without gauging stations requires that an index be defined linking the potential impacts of dam operation with dam location characteristics and the hydrographic characteristics of the considered river reach two main factors may determine the potential influence of dam operation on streamflow at a given reach 1 the capacity of the dam reservoirs compared to the reach flow a large capacity flow ratio suggests that the dam may induce a large relative change in flow and 2 the relative location of the dam and the river reach the impact of dam operation is expected to decrease for reaches further downstream of a dam previous studies have defined indices to characterize the potential influences of dam construction or operation on downstream flow the impounded runoff index iri singer 2007 has been defined as the ratio of reservoir capacity to median annual flood runoff volume a slightly different index named impounded runoff ir defined as the ratio of reservoir capacity to annual runoff has been proposed by batalla et al 2004 in order to take into consideration the possible influence of multiple upstream dams singer 2007 also used the total upstream reservoir capacity for stations under the influence of multiple dams more recently lehner et al 2011 in order to evaluate the environmental impacts of dams on biodiversity ecosystem functioning and fluvial geomorphology due to hydrological alterations introduced the degree of regulation dor metric see also grill et al 2014 dor is defined as the ratio of total storage capacity to total annual flow volume at the considered reach 1 d o r j 100 d j i 1 n j s i j where s i j is the storage capacity of dam i upstream of reach j n j is the number of dams upstream of reach j and d j is the annual flow volume at reach j water volume within the river channel corresponds to the average discharge based on an approximation of channel width and depth grill et al 2014 this metric is very similar to the iri index and both are designed to quantify hydrological alterations induced by dams a large dor value corresponds to a configuration allowing a significant fraction of the annual discharge volume at a given reach to be stored and released at later time dor was therefore used in the present study as a proxy for how streamflow at a given reach may be altered by upstream dam operations grill et al 2014 since annual flow volumes were not available for all reaches volumes were estimated using the linear regression between median annual flow volume and the upstream watershed area not shown for conciseness dor values were therefore estimated and compared to the result of the unimodality test for the available stations periods it is expected that altered flows due to dam operation detected through non unimodal flow distribution is more likely to occur for reaches with high dor values in order to assess the potential influences of dams operated by the mddelcc the relative dor index was also defined relative dor corresponds to the fraction of the total reservoir capacity upstream from a given reach that is associated with mddelcc operated dams a relative dor value equal to zero therefore indicates that the stations periods do not include a mddelcc dam in its upstream watershed while a value of one means that all upstream dams are mddelcc operated dams 4 results 4 1 application of the unimodality test to available stations periods table 1 summarizes the results of the unimodality test for all stations periods it was first applied to the 70 unregulated stations periods i e with no upstream dam when applying the unimodality test to these 70 stations periods we obviously expected a unimodal daily flow distribution given the absence of upstream dams the results of this application indicate that all distributions were effectively unimodal except for four stations periods these four stations periods are located downstream of unregulated watersheds over their entire recording periods mistassini 49 32 n 72 64 e 4 194 km2 7 year record bell 48 32 n 77 30 e 1 902 km2 7 year record waswanipi 4986 n 77 19 e 31 272 km2 51 year record and désert 46 59 n 76 04 e 1 644 km2 12 year record the four non unimodal stations are indicated by triangles in fig 3 the first three stations are located in the northern part of the study region north of 48 n while the remaining station is located further south fig 8 presents an example of daily flow distribution and its corresponding mean annual hydrograph for the waswanipi station northernmost station with the longest record and the largest upstream watershed among the four unregulated stations periods with non unimodal daily flow distribution as can be seen in fig 8 the annual hydrograph is characterized by a recession following the spring peak that extends to september and october after which flows increase in november and finally decrease for another extended period during winter the two modes of the distribution were therefore associated with a low flow period from february to mid april first peak at 200 m3 sec and the second mode extended plateau in the distribution from 300 to 800 m3 sec was associated with the august to december period this example is representative of the three northernmost stations and also of some other watersheds located north of 50 latitude not shown for conciseness this demonstrates that seasonal hydrological regimes for some northern watersheds may lead to non unimodal daily flow distributions the unimodality test should therefore be applied with caution when assessing the impacts of dam operation in northern watersheds the fourth case désert station presents a different feature which is characterized by very low flow and very low variability of daily flow series from september to november over a 10 year period not shown for conciseness this explains the non unimodality of the daily flow distribution no other reason e g watershed characteristics or some problems with recording set up was found that could explain this result this situation demonstrates that in some very specific cases non unimodal daily flow distributions can be observed further research is needed to investigate this point the unimodality test was then applied to stations periods with one or more dams in their upstream watersheds table 1 of the 104 stations periods belonging to this category 88 85 were classified as unimodal of the 46 stations periods with at least one dam operated by the mddelcc operated dam regardless of their locations in the upstream watershed or their capacities 13 28 were classified as influenced by upstream dam operation since their daily flow distributions were non unimodal while for the 58 remaining stations periods with no upstream dams operated by the mddelcc operated dam only 3 were classified as being influenced by dam operation non unimodal daily flow distribution 4 2 potential influence of dam operation on flow at ungauged river reaches fig 9 presents the relative dor and dor values for all stations periods with upstream dams and the results of the unimodality test 5 significance level this figure reveals some interesting features the first is that the available stations periods with upstream mddelcc dams have dor values close or larger than 10 1 the second is that no station period was classified as influenced non unimodal daily flow distribution according to the unimodality test for dor 8 i e reaches where the total upstream dam capacity represents 8 or more of the median annual volume transiting this reach this result therefore supports the hypothesis that impacts of dam operation on daily streamflow is more easily detected for larger dor values it also suggests that dor values may be used as a proxy to assess the potential modification of streamflow due to dam operation for river reaches where no recorded streamflow are available it however does not imply that a reach with dor 8 is necessarily influenced by dam operation river reaches with dor values larger than 8 may be in fact non influenced by upstream dam operations simply because these dams are not operated or that their operations have negligible impact on daily streamflow river reaches with dor 8 are therefore designated as potentially influenced by dam operation 4 3 application to southern quebec river network the intent of the proposed approach is to provide an indicator identifying the river reaches that are potentially influenced by operation at upstream dams such information can be crucial for many applications where recorded flow series at specific reaches are used as proxies for flow at nearby ungauged basins in regional flood frequency analysis or for hydrological modelling a large scale application of the proposed approach to the southern quebec river network using readily available data was therefore realized dor values were estimated for reaches with upstream watersheds completely located within quebec boundaries for a total of 4 200 reaches with an average reach length of 16 km of these river reaches 3 384 reaches 81 were unregulated no upstream dams and dor values of zero fig 10 presents the cumulative distribution of dor values for all regulated reaches it is interesting to note that approximately 30 of the regulated river reaches could be potentially influenced dor 8 by dam operation according to our previous analysis fig 11 presents two examples of dor values for the rivière st françois watershed fig 11a and saguenay watershed fig 11b these examples show that some classification of the reaches according to the potential influence of dam operation on flows can be made for instance river reaches with dor 8 could be associated with potentially influenced reaches 5 conclusion some applications need to assess the potential influence of dam operation on flow at given river reaches for example when recorded flows at a gauged watershed are used as a proxy for a neighbouring ungauged watershed or downstream reaches or when using recorded flows for modelling purpose e g calibration or validation of hydrological models non operated dams can be assimilated to storage facilities and corresponding large scale alterations to basin hydrology could be considered as the norm for flood records flow distribution analysis should therefore reflect such anthropogenic changes villarini and smith 2010 dam operation however introduces a dynamic component to flow alterations that can be more difficult to detect and take into consideration in regional flood analysis in this context it is important to assess potential changes to natural flows due to dam operation and to identify stations and river reaches that may be influenced by dam operation generally dam operating status is unknown when the operating status is known dam operating records may still not be available very vaguely described or even confidential the non unimodality of daily flow distributions was examined as a possible signature of dam operation on daily recorded flow the main hypothesis underlying the use of this metric is that many dams are operated according to some specific rules aiming at targeting specific ranges of flow values for certain flow conditions or periods of the year recorded flows at 226 stations across southern quebec were analyzed records at these stations were partitioned into sub periods according to the upstream dam configuration each of these sub periods called station period therefore corresponds to a daily flow series with a given upstream dam configuration a unimodality test aiming at verifying the hypothesis that the daily flow distribution was unimodal was first applied to the 174 available station periods results demonstrated that for the 70 unregulated stations periods i e with no upstream dams four were classified as non unimodal a close examination of these four cases showed that three correspond to watersheds located in the northern part of the study region in these cases the slow decrease of the spring flood and persistence of the spring flow regime over a large part of the summer months explains the non unimodality of the daily flow distribution non unimodality of the fourth watershed remains at this point unexplained application of the unimodality test to the 104 stations periods with one or more upstream dams suggested that the impacts of dam operation can be detected in some cases many stations downstream of watersheds with one or more large capacity dams with known operation status mddelcc operated dams displayed non unimodal daily flow distributions consistency of results for unregulated stations periods unimodal distributions and regulated stations periods downstream of the dams operated by the mddelcc operated dams some displaying non unimodal distributions supports the hypothesis that non unimodality can be attributed to dam operation in order to be able to extend the analysis to ungauged river reaches the ratio of the total reservoir capacity to the median annual volume transiting through a given river reach was defined this ratio called degree of regulation dor initially proposed by lehner et al 2011 is conceptually similar to the iri used by singer 2007 it is based on the idea that the potential influence of dam operation will likely be more important when the upstream reservoir capacity stocks a large fraction of the median annual flow transiting in the downstream river reach estimation of the dor values for all stations periods with one or more upstream dams showed that station period influenced by dam operation according to the unimodality test have dor values larger than 8 a threshold value for dor values could therefore be define as a proxy for the potential influence of dam operation on flows note that dor values were designed to identify the potential influence of dam operation that is an influence that could be detected if the dam is operated a river reach with a large dor value may not in fact be influenced by dam operation for instance if the dam is not actually operated small dor values are as well interpreted as indicative that possible dam operations will not influence river reach flows many factors may determine the magnitude of the impacts of dam operation on downstream flows such as the dam s function hydroelectricity production water supply flood protection etc operation rules operation frequency daily weekly seasonal annual reservoir capacity dam outlets gates spillway etc etc unimodality test measures one specific type of influence modality of daily flow distribution other indices e g iha indices may therefore be needed to detect other possible impacts of dam operation on flows using standard indices such as iha indices however imply that some reference range of index values be defined for non influenced or natural configurations and that some metric be defined to measure possible departure from these values unimodality test in contrast provides interesting ways to assess the potential influence of dam operation on daily flow and is easy to implement and interpret furthermore this index is more directly linked to dam operation note that non unimodal daily flow distributions can also be observed rarely according to our results for unregulated watersheds future work should extend the study to other regions in order to verify how dam operations affect the daily flow distributions as reported in this study additionally results based on unimodality test should be compared with those produced from approaches based on indicators of hydrologic alteration peñas et al 2016 conflict of
