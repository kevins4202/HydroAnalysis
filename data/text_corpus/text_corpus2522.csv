12610,despite the high reactivity of birnessite for the oxidative removal of phenolic compounds its radicals are persistent and they adversely affect water systems alginate beads are widely used for secondary contaminant adsorption however they exhibit limited adsorption performance to improve the efficiencies of birnessite and alginate for phenolic compound removal humin was successfully immobilized in the sodium alginate beads to form birnessite humin alginate mn hu ag beads with various initial humin mass ratios e g 1 0 25 1 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 1 after the reaction between the mn hu ag beads and 1 naphthol the products were analyzed using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry high performance liquid chromatography hplc and infrared spectroscopy to evaluate the 1 naphthol removal efficiency the mn hu ag beads exhibited pseudo second order reaction kinetics and the mn ag beads pseudo first order reaction kinetics this indicates that both birnessite and humin are involved in the oxidative polymerization reaction between 1 naphthol and manganese oxide the half life of the mn hu ag beads second order reaction rate was 3 7 times lower than that of the mn ag beads first order reaction rate the mn hu ag beads exhibited a higher 1 naphthol removal rate than the mn ag beads including further removal of the reaction products and mn2 elution from the reaction in addition the post reaction hplc results of the supernatant and the mn ag hu bead extracts confirmed that humin immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products via irreversible adsorption onto the mn ag hu bead surface via birnessite mediated cross coupling because humin is eco friendly and insoluble its successful application in mn hu ag beads can be useful in developing effective materials for

humin alginate birnessite 1 naphthol irreversible sorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phenolic compounds are recalcitrant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that cause serious problems in soil and water environments owing to their toxicity 1 moreover phenolic compounds have adverse effects on humans such as toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity and teratogenicity 2 therefore these compounds must be eliminated from wastewater and or solid waste before they are discharged into the environment 3 among phenolic compounds 1 naphthol is considered a priority contaminant owing to its high discharge in soil and water systems 4 it is widely used in several industries such as pesticides synthetic dyes plastics pharmaceuticals rubbers and perfumes 5 6 in addition as a toxic metabolite of naphthalene 1 naphthol is more soluble in aqueous solutions than naphthalene making its removal from soil sediment and water systems difficult 7 8 many efforts have been made to remove 1 naphthol from water biological methods commonly applied to purify soil and groundwater contaminated with recalcitrant organic substance have shown limited results for 1 naphthol owing to its poor bioavailability 1 9 in addition techniques such as ozonation 10 11 and fenton oxidation 12 and physical treatment processes such as membrane technology 13 14 and sorption using activated carbon carbon nanotubes and biochar 15 17 have also been used for years however these methods have been reported to have high operational costs and limited effectiveness particularly for removing 1 naphthol in field sites 1 3 9 for instance these methods require post treatment processes for radical products and strong water soluble oxidizing agents that can adversely affect the ecosystem as secondary contaminants recently advanced adsorptive materials such as resorcinol melamine formaldehyde based mesoporous magnetic resins and magnetic resin g chitosan beads were successfully applied to the removal of phenol and 4 chlorophenol in simulated aqueous solutions 18 19 however the adsorptive removal of 1 naphthol using these materials and their hydrophilic reaction products has not been clearly reported thus identifying low cost and eco friendly materials for the effective removal of 1 naphthol and its hydrophilic reaction products is important for managing soil and water contaminants birnessite a naturally occurring manganese oxide has also been reported for its low cost and high reactivity for the removal of phenolic compounds as well as 1 naphthol 20 however a higher removal rate of 1 naphthol using birnessite can result in a higher concentration of manganese oxide mn2 eluted from the reaction thus introducing a secondary contaminant in the water system 21 22 several studies have reported that the radicals released from redox reactions between phenolic compounds and manganese can polymerize and or bind with natural organic substances to form polymer radical products 23 although these polymer radical products are less toxic than 1 naphthol they persist in aqueous environments and are difficult to remove 7 thus there have been many efforts to remove these polymer radical products the application of humic acids for the adsorptive removal of the secondary products of the reaction between phenolic compounds and birnessite has been reported 23 24 however the binding of the secondary products and humic acids results in hydrolysis because of the solubility of humic acids especially at ph 7 25 27 in addition sodium alginate ag beads natural biopolymer insoluble gels have been widely used for adsorption owing to their unique physicochemical properties 28 as a hydrophilic adsorbent sodium ag rapidly forms an insoluble gel in an aqueous solution by combining ca2 ions with the carboxyl groups in ag 29 30 however sodium ag beads also exhibit limited adsorption performance for phenolic compounds because of the repulsive forces between ag and the phenolic compounds in addition pure sodium ag has low mechanical power and can be interfered with by other ions in the solution 31 moreover sodium ag can easily liquefy in aqueous solutions making its removal difficult 32 these limitations of birnessite and ag can be overcome by immobilizing birnessite on ag eom et al 33 reported the successful application of compact birnessite ag beads for the removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions with better results than pure birnessite powder hong et al 31 applied birnessite ag beads for an enhanced removal efficiency for sr ions from seawater however the removal of 1 naphthol using birnessite ag beads still exhibited a low reaction rate because the electrostatic repulsion of the alginic acid molecules inhibited the adsorptive reaction 33 moreover radical products and mn2 were still present in the solution as secondary contaminants therefore it is necessary to improve the removal efficiency of the birnessite ag beads by immobilizing a hydrophobic compound on them for the adsorption of secondary contaminants humin a hydrophobic material may be immobilized on birnessite ag beads because it is highly resistant to decomposition and insoluble under all ph conditions 34 35 in natural soils and or sediments humin accounts for over 50 70 of the total organic carbon 36 it has a high molecular weight and cation exchange capacity 35 and contains various functional groups 34 furthermore as the final product of the humification process of soil organic matter humin binds more stably with organic contaminants than other humic substances e g humic and fulvic acids 37 therefore the immobilization of humin on birnessite ag beads promises to be an effective method for enhancing their efficiency for the removal of 1 naphthol from aqueous solutions however the immobilization of humin into ag beads for an enhanced adsorptive removal of secondary products has not been reported in this study humin and birnessite were immobilized in ag to form birnessite humin ag mn hu ag beads the 1 naphthol removal efficiency of the mn hu ag beads was determined via a kinetic reaction and compared with that of birnessite ag mn ag beads this study reports for the first time the application of humin a low cost natural material in birnessite ag beads to enhance their efficiency for 1 naphthol removal the binding stability of secondary products into the mn hu ag beads was also confirmed via extraction experiments this is the first study on the immobilization of humin in ag beads for water treatment processes the findings of this study may serve as the basis for further research on the applications of humin in environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials 1 naphthol 99 0 was purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification 1 naphthol stock solution 100 mg l was prepared by adding 10 mg of the standard material to 100 ml of distilled water and stirring it under a n2 atmosphere for 24 h and it was subsequently filtered through a membrane filter 0 45 μm pall co ny sodium ag cas no 1923 1350 was purchased as a powder from showa tokyo japan birnessite was prepared according to the method reported by shin et al 7 after filtration the synthesized manganese oxide particles were washed using deionized water to remove residual reagents freeze dried and used as fine powders humin was extracted from canadian peat moss humin sphagnum peat moss using the method reported by nguyen et al 40 mn hu ag beads were fabricated using the following procedure for mn hu ag beads with an initial weight ratio of 1 0 25 1 1 5 and 6 g of humin and sodium ag respectively were added to 300 ml of distilled water and stirred subsequently 6 g of the prepared birnessite were added to the humin ag solution and stirred to disperse the birnessite power the mixture was added to a 150 mm cacl2 aqueous solution using a 1 milliliter pipet to form the insoluble beads mn hu ag beads with initial weight ratios of 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 1 were prepared using 3 and 6 g of humin respectively similarly prepared mn ag mn ag 1 1 humin hu ag 1 1 and ag beads were used as controls in a previous study mn ag beads mn ag 1 1 had been credited with the optimum removal rate for 1 naphthol in an aqueous solution 33 after 12 h of hardening the beads were washed several times using distilled water to remove impurities the water content for 20 beads was obtained via ignition loss at 110 c for 2 h 31 the weight of birnessite in 20 dry beads was obtained via ignition loss at 550 c for 4 h 31 33 sodium ag was dissolved in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 41 42 and the composition in weight of ag in the beads was determined using the weight difference before and after dissolving the beads in edta 50 mm details of this experiment have been reported elsewhere 41 the microstructure of the fabricated beads was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6400 as per the report by eom et al 33 2 2 batch experiments and instrumentation analysis in this study to evaluate the removal characteristics of the mn hu ag beads with different mass ratios for phenol based organic pollutants an optimal ratio was selected by performing a batch test for the reaction time the removal characteristics of the mn ag hu ag and ag beads were evaluated and the removal rates for various 1 naphthol concentrations were determined for each bead type 20 dry beads 110 c 2 h were added to a serum bottle containing 20 ml of 1 naphthol 40 mg l the highest reactivities of birnessite and 1 naphthol were measured at an adjusted ph and temperature of 5 0 and 20 c respectively 33 the serum bottle was completely sealed using a teflon diaphragm and aluminum cap and rotated at 30 rpm in a rotary stirrer finepcrr ag the effect of 1 naphthol concentration on the removal process was also studied using various concentrations of 1 naphthol 20 40 and 80 mg l the samples collected periodically throughout the reaction were filtered using a 0 45 micrometer membrane filter pall co ltd and the filtrate was immediately analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc young lin uv730d a c18 4 6 mm 150 mm particle size 5 μm reversed phase column of waters supelcosil lc 18db was used for the analysis the mobile phase was 50 50 deionized purified water and acetonitrile hplc grade j t baker used in the isoelution mode at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the injection volume of the sample and the wavelength of the uv detector were set to 20 μl and 254 nm respectively fig s1 shows the calibration curve of area vs 1 naphthol concentration 2 3 reaction product analysis the 1 naphthol reaction products were analyzed using uv vis and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopies for the uv vis spectroscopy absorbance analysis was performed in the wavelength range of 200 700 nm using a shimadzu uv 1601 spectrometer ft ir spectroscopy was performed using a jasco ft ir 620 spectrometer to characterize the functional groups of the molecules on the precipitate after the reaction with 1 naphthol after removing the beads from the reaction sample the precipitate obtained via centrifugation was sufficiently dried mixed with kbr ft ir grade aldrich co in a weight ratio of approximately 1 100 filtrate kbr and pelleted the ft ir analysis was performed over five scans in a wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 2 4 analysis of the mn ion elution concentration in the reaction solution after the oxidation conversion reaction of 1 naphthol the concentration of manganese mn2 eluted from the reduction of the mn hu ag and mn ag beads was measured using aas varian 200 fs the reaction supernatant was separated over a 15 minute long centrifugation at 3000 rpm hanil supra 25 k and the reaction solution was filtered using a 0 45 micrometer syringe filter 3 results and discussion 3 1 compositions of the beads the fabricated ag beads were an exchange of porous core materials and had the characteristics of a semi permeable membrane on the outside and they were used for contaminant removal in various reaction media in addition the outer surfaces of the ag beads which formed the crossover were strongly bound to each other and prevented the leakage of the added reaction medium 29 30 38 39 the semipermeable membrane primarily served to maintain the reaction between the reaction medium immobilized in ag and the target material by freely permeating oxygen and other materials from the outside of the beads fig 1 shows the sem images of each component and the prepared mn hu ag beads the surface structures of the mn hu ag beads as seen in the sem images indicate that the birnessite particles and humin were entrapped on the surface of and inside the alginic acid particles water content is an important factor for determining the adsorption efficiency of beads the water contents of all the bead types prepared in this study are presented in table 1 the ag hu ag mn ag and mn hu ag beads had diameters of approximately 2 mm each the ag beads had the highest water content at 96 13 whereas the water contents of the hu ag and mn ag beads were 95 62 and 91 99 respectively the water content of the mn hu ag beads ranged from 90 15 to 92 48 and that of the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 was the lowest therefore a higher mass ratio of humin in the mn hu ag beads was associated with a lower water content low water content beads have been reported to have higher sorption capacities per unit mass 43 however a humin weight higher than those of mn and ag during the preparation process can increase the viscosity of the mn hu ag aqueous solution and make the formation of uniformly sized 2 mm beads difficult thus the maximum mass ratio of the mn hu ag beads in this study was 1 1 1 as shown in table 1 the birnessite percentages in the mn hu ag beads at various humin ratios were nearly equal ranging from 30 97 to 31 96 which were also close to those in the mn ag beads 31 37 for the mn hu ag beads at various humin ratios of 1 0 25 1 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 1 humin accounted for 22 8 25 3 and 31 4 respectively indicating a positive correlation between the humin ratio during bead preparation and the humin content in the manufactured beads for the mn hu ag beads the ag content decreased while the mn content remained constant 31 32 with increasing humin content table 1 confirms that the composition ratios of the dry manufactured mn hu ag beads were different from the ratios with which they had been manufactured for instance mn hu ag 1 0 25 1 mn hu ag 1 0 5 1 and mn hu ag 1 1 1 exhibited the composition ratios of dry manufactured mn hu ag beads as 0 7 0 5 1 0 7 0 6 1 and 0 8 0 8 1 respectively the higher humin ratios of the dry manufactured mn hu ag beads compared to the initial ratios can be explained by the following reasons first humin has a highly compact structure and can be easily immobilized into the porous structure of alginate 44 45 second alginate is a hydrophilic polymer that can easily dissolve in water whereas humin is hydrophobic therefore the contribution of humin was higher than that of alginate in dry weight 31 finally the lower ratio of ag in dry manufactured mn hu ag beads may have been affected by the electrostatic repulsive forces from the functional groups of ag and humin 46 in addition the humin and birnessite ratios in the dry manufactured mn hu ag beads simultaneously increased with the initial humin weight confirming that humin enhanced the immobilization of birnessite in ag beads 3 2 efficiency of humin in mn hu ag beads for the removal of 1 naphthol 3 2 1 1 naphthol removal rate the removal rates of the ag hu mn and mn hu ag beads for 20 ml of 1 naphthol 40 mg l over 120 min are shown in fig 2 the ag and hu ag beads exhibited extremely low removal rates for 1 naphthol and the maximum removal rates in these cases after 120 min were 1 17 and 7 67 respectively in contrast the mn ag beads exhibited a removal rate of 79 68 after 120 min moreover for the mn hu ag beads with various weight ratios of humin the removal rates ranged from 84 15 to 90 99 for the mn hu ag beads a higher mass ratio of humin resulted in a higher removal rate of 1 naphthol fig 2 the ag beads could not remove 1 naphthol from the aqueous solution for the following reasons the ph of the solution ph 5 and the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent primarily affect the adsorptive reaction at ph 5 the ag beads exhibited a positive surface charge due to a phpzc of 6 2 47 whereas 1 naphthol existed as a neutral molecule and was possibly protonated because of a pka of 9 34 21 the positive surface charges on both the ag beads and 1 naphthol prevented their interaction furthermore ag is a biopolymer containing various functional groups such as carboxylate amine phosphate sulfate and hydroxyl which have low mechanical powers and are easily liquefied in water these functional groups also repel hydrophilic compounds such as 1 naphthol 28 48 however for strongly positive sorbates such as metal ions e g mn2 pb2 cd2 and cu2 ag has a high adsorption capacity owing to the attractive electrostatic interactions between ag and the metal ions 49 51 for the hu ag beads the removal efficiency of 1 naphthol was slightly higher than that of the ag beads fig 2 because humin is a hydrophobic material that can absorb small amounts of 1 naphthol however insufficient removal of 1 naphthol was observed in the hu ag beads 1 naphthol penetrated the beads but could not be adsorbed due to repulsion from the binding sites of ag hence it was re eluted into the aqueous phase however the mn ag beads 1 1 exhibited a high 1 naphthol removal rate indicating that the intrinsic reactivity of manganese oxide was maintained even after the manganese oxide particles had been immobilized in the beads because of the oxidative transformation reaction mediated by the birnessite immobilized in alginic acid 33 notably the mn hu ag beads showed a higher 1 naphthol removal rate than the mn ag beads 1 1 indicating a positive correlation between the removal rate and humin content table 1 and confirming that humin provided a synergistic effect for the removal of 1 naphthol during the birnessite mediated oxidative coupling reaction 3 2 2 1 naphthol removal kinetics kinetic experiments were performed using 1 naphthol 40 mg l for approximately 180 min using mn hu ag beads at various ratios 1 1 1 1 0 5 1 and 1 0 25 1 to understand the significance of the humin content in the manufactured beads the adsorption kinetics results are presented in table 2 and fig s2 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant k1 min 1 gradually increased with the humin content in the beads which ranged from 0 0205 to 0 0228 in contrast the correlation coefficient r2 steadily decreased from 0 999 to 0 949 with increasing humin content in the mn hu ag beads the gradual decrease of r2 revealed that with increasing humin content in the mn hu ag beads the removal of 1 naphthol via the oxidation binding reaction did not follow the pseudo first order rate equation owing to the presence of both birnessite and humin therefore the pseudo second order reaction rate constant k2 was analyzed which increased gradually 0 001 0 0013 g mg 1 min 1 with the humin content in the mn hu ag beads the correlation coefficients of the pseudo second order reaction also exhibited an increasing trend with the humin content in the mn hu ag beads 0 993 0 999 reaching the highest value for the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 the results showed that the second order reaction was more suitable than the first order reaction because of the effect of the two materials birnessite and humin immobilized on ag and that humin in the mn hu ag beads facilitated the oxidative polymerization of 1 naphthol via manganese oxide which is a rapid electron transfer reaction after the adsorption of 1 naphthol onto the manganese oxide surface 52 the half lives of the mn hu ag beads at various humin ratios measured using k2 showed that the half life of the mn hu ag 1 1 1 beads was the lowest at 19 2 min and those of the mn hu ag 1 0 5 1 and mn hu ag 1 0 25 1 beads were 22 7 and 25 0 min respectively table 2 the higher humin content in the mn hu ag beads was associated with a higher removal rate of 1 naphthol the humin content in the mn hu ag beads also showed a positive relationship with k1 and k2 in the pseudo first order and pseudo second order reactions respectively fig 3 fig 3 indicates that the correlation between the humin content and k2 exhibited a higher r2 than that between the humin content and k1 thus for a similar birnessite content the kinetics of the removal of 1 naphthol via the mn hu ag beads followed the pseudo second order reaction and were positively related to the humin content in the mn hu ag beads because the oxidation conversion reaction of 1 naphthol occurred on the surface of the birnessite particles the removal rate constant k2 of 1 naphthol also confirmed that humin in the mn hu ag beads favorably enhanced the surface reaction between 1 naphthol and birnessite these results were also supported by the pseudo first order reaction constant k1 of the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 that was more than twice that of the mn ag beads 1 1 i e k 0 0097 under similar experimental conditions as shown in a previous study 33 furthermore the half life of the mn ag beads measured via k1 was 3 7 times 71 4 min that of the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 measured via k2 thus the mn hu ag beads proved that an increase in the humin ratio by weight enhanced the 1 naphthol removal efficiency via oxidative transformation and adsorption 3 2 3 effect of the initial 1 naphthol concentration to identify the effect of the initial 1 naphthol concentration on the reaction between 1 naphthol and the mn hu ag beads the removal reactions were conducted using 20 mn hu ag beads for various 1 naphthol concentrations 20 40 and 80 mg l the 1 naphthol removal rate and reaction kinetics results are shown in figs s3 and s4 and table 3 an increase in the 1 naphthol concentration resulted in a decrease in the 1 naphthol removal rate for the mn hu ag beads fig s3 for the pseudo first order reaction the k1 values decreased from 0 252 to 0 0137 and the r2 values increased from 0 945 to 0 960 with increasing 1 naphthol concentration for the pseudo second order reaction the k2 and r2 values decreased from 0 0033 to 0 003 and 0 998 to 0 991 respectively with increasing initial 1 naphthol concentration table 3 these results further confirmed that the reaction between 1 naphthol and the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 followed the pseudo second order reaction kinetics for all initial 1 naphthol concentrations the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant k2 and the concentration of the initial 1 naphthol were well fitted via an exponential curve r2 0 995 fig s5 the k2 values of the reaction employing the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 were predicted from the initial concentration of 1 naphthol c0 using the equation k2 0 0069 e 0 039 c0 3 3 removal of the 1 naphthol reaction products the uv vis spectra of the supernatant produced after the reaction with 1 naphthol are shown in fig 4 a high absorbance peak was observed at 295 nm corresponding to the aromatic ring of 1 naphthol 8 the high peak at 295 nm corresponding to 1 naphthol and several other high peaks below 250 nm also appeared after its reaction with the hu ag beads confirming that the hu ag beads could not remove 1 naphthol from the aqueous solution however the uv vis spectra of the 1 naphthol solution after its reaction with the mn hu ag containing various humin ratios and mn ag 1 1 beads exhibited shapes similar to those of typical humic materials and the characteristic peak of 1 naphthol disappeared and its absorbance monotonically decreased with increasing wavelength these results suggest that the oxidative polymerization of 1 naphthol via birnessite was maintained even with the mn hu ag and mn ag 1 1 beads 7 22 the ft ir spectra of the 1 naphthol solution before and after its reaction with the mn ag and mn hu ag beads are shown in fig 5 the spectra of the mn ag and mn hu ag beads were obtained by recovering and drying the precipitated product after the reaction with 1 naphthol compared to 1 naphthol the other samples employing various bead types exhibited fewer less intense peaks below 1650 cm 1 for instance the ft ir spectrum of 1 naphthol ranged from 710 to 960 cm 1 exhibiting the out of plane ch bending vibrations of a naphthalene ring with one two and four adjacent hydrogen atoms 53 which were not observed in the samples of the mn ag and mn hu ag beads although the 710 960 cm 1 bands lie in the fingerprint region their disappearance for the samples of the mn ag and mn hu ag beads confirmed structural changes in the 1 naphthol solution after the reaction in addition hydroxyl oh 3450 cm 1 polymethylenic ch2 2925 cm 1 aromatic c c 1600 cm 1 co 1250 cm 1 and co 1020 cm 1 absorption bands were exhibited by all samples with intensities higher than those for 1 naphthol also because of the effective adsorption of humin in the mn hu ag beads the spectra of the samples employing these beads exhibited significantly lower peaks than those of the mn ag beads the ft ir spectrum of the mn hu ag beads was similar to that of humic substances indicating that a typical natural polymeric organic acid was produced after the 1 naphthol removal reaction 7 52 the ft ir and uv vis results confirmed that the polymerized precipitation products of the birnessite mediated oxidative coupling reaction of 1 naphthol had been produced and precipitated a higher removal rate of the mn hu ag beads compared to the mn ag beads had been predicted first via ft ir spectra fig 6a shows the hplc results of the 1 naphthol solution after its reaction with the birnessite powder and the mn ag 1 1 and mn hu ag beads at various humin contents which afforded various products via oxidative coupling these products were hydrophilic polymers with molecular weights of 400 1000 da and retention times rts of 1 1 oligomers 3 02 and 14 1 1 4 naphthoquinone min as reported previously 7 33 previous studies have demonstrated that the reaction between 1 naphthol and birnessite produces high molecular weight hydrophilic oligomers containing 4 or 5 molecules of 1 naphthol via partial ring cleavage and the removal of the substituent 7 8 the peak of 1 4 naphthoquinone reportedly corresponds to the intermediate of the reaction between 1 naphthol and manganese oxide 7 54 1 naphthol was transformed to 1 4 dihydroxynaphthalene via the oxidation reaction with manganese oxide which was further oxidized to 1 4 naphthoquinone 7 55 coupling products such as the oligomers naphthoquinone and naphthol naphthoquinone were also produced via the photolytic transformation of 1 naphthol 8 as shown in fig 6a the peaks corresponding to the hydrophilic polymers and 1 4 naphthoquinone were very high for the reaction involving the birnessite power and decreased gradually and sharply for the mn ag 1 1 and mn hu ag beads respectively the presence of the peaks corresponding to 1 4 naphthoquinone and the weakly hydrophilic reaction product rt 3 02 min in the mn ag beads 1 1 indicated that the alginate in the beads attributed low sorption affinity to the reaction product only the polymeric products were further removed during the birnessite mediated oxidative transformation for the mn hu ag beads with various humin contents the disappearance of the peaks corresponding to 1 4 naphthoquinone and other hydrophilic polymers could be explained by the presence of humin the hplc chromatograms did not vary with the humin contents of the mn hu ag beads however a slightly lower peak at an rt of 1 1 min was observed for mn hu ag 1 1 1 demonstrating that the humin in the beads effectively absorbed the polymeric products generated from the oxidative coupling reaction of 1 naphthol via the birnessite in the aqueous solution and that the increase in humin content resulted in a decrease in the polymeric products to confirm this the absorbed birnessite powder and mn ag 1 1 and mn hu ag 1 1 1 beads were removed from the solution and extracted using methanol each aqueous solution was evaluated after filtration to determine the irreversible sorption capacity the hplc chromatograms of the extracted solutions are shown in fig 6b the solution extracted from birnessite powder exhibited clear hydrophilic polymer rt 1 1 min and 1 4 naphthoquinone peaks however the solution extracted from the mn ag beads 1 1 exhibited only hydrophilic polymer product peaks 1 1 6 min no clear peak was observed for the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 the results showed that the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products on the humin surface via irreversible adsorption after birnessite mediated cross coupling 56 most of the polymerized reaction products were recovered from the birnessite powder and mn ag beads but not the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 ag beads immobilized using activated carbon exhibit effective removal rates only for positively charged compounds as reported in a recent study 57 in contrast the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 exhibited high removal rates for both negatively and positively charged contaminants and immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products via irreversible adsorption onto the humin surface after the birnessite mediated oxidative conversion in this study the oxidation using manganese oxide was a non stoichiometric reaction hence the concentration of mn2 oxide in the aqueous solution was not calculated stoichiometrically the mn2 concentration in the supernatant after analysis has been presented in fig s6 in the case of the mn ag beads the concentration of mn2 was 0 46 mg l in contrast the mn2 concentrations sharply reduced to 0 08 0 052 and 0 029 mg l for the mn hu ag 1 0 25 1 mn hu ag 1 0 5 1 and mn hu ag 1 1 1 beads respectively fig s6 the soluble mn2 produced by the reduction of the mn3 mn4 immobilized on ag was re adsorbed onto the ag by the mn ag beads for the mn hu ag beads both ag and humin which exhibit strong affinity for divalent metals re adsorbed the mn2 produced during the reaction between birnessite and 1 naphthol humin immobilized on the mn hu ag beads is believed to have exhibited a higher sorption capacity than ag as confirmed by the lower concentration of mn2 in the 1 naphthol solution supernatant mn2 concentration was the lowest 0 029 mg l for the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 lower than the limitation standard of mn2 in drinking water 0 05 mg l usepa 58 thus the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 were more effective at removing 1 naphthol than mn ag beads and or only birnessite with a lower half life and enhanced removal capacity in addition the concentrations of polymerized products and mn2 elution after the reaction were efficiently reduced owing to the presence of humin 4 conclusion upon immobilization of humin and birnessite in ag to fabricate mn hu ag beads humin had a synergistic effect on the reaction between 1 naphthol and birnessite without directly reacting with 1 naphthol the mn hu ag beads with an initial weight ratio of 1 1 1 exhibited a higher removal rate and capacity and a lower half life for 1 naphthol than mn ag beads and pure birnessite and the highest sorption capacity for various reaction products and the mn2 eluted from the reaction unlike the mn ag beads the mn hu ag beads exhibited a second order kinetic reaction suggesting immobilization of birnessite and humin in ag and the involvement of humin in the oxidative polymerization of 1 naphthol via birnessite ft ir analysis of the precipitates and uv vis analysis of the supernatant after the reaction employing the mn hu ag beads revealed the presence of humic materials and the reduction of radical products compared to the powder form the bead form of birnessite facilitated further analysis e g ft ir of the reaction products for the first time the post reaction hplc chromatogram of the extracted mn ag hu beads also revealed that humin immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products via irreversible adsorption on the humin surface after birnessite mediated cross coupling the application of mn hu ag beads can overcome the need for secondary contaminant sorption and they could be used as eco friendly reactive filter materials for removing phenolic compounds in the field credit authorship contribution

12610,despite the high reactivity of birnessite for the oxidative removal of phenolic compounds its radicals are persistent and they adversely affect water systems alginate beads are widely used for secondary contaminant adsorption however they exhibit limited adsorption performance to improve the efficiencies of birnessite and alginate for phenolic compound removal humin was successfully immobilized in the sodium alginate beads to form birnessite humin alginate mn hu ag beads with various initial humin mass ratios e g 1 0 25 1 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 1 after the reaction between the mn hu ag beads and 1 naphthol the products were analyzed using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry high performance liquid chromatography hplc and infrared spectroscopy to evaluate the 1 naphthol removal efficiency the mn hu ag beads exhibited pseudo second order reaction kinetics and the mn ag beads pseudo first order reaction kinetics this indicates that both birnessite and humin are involved in the oxidative polymerization reaction between 1 naphthol and manganese oxide the half life of the mn hu ag beads second order reaction rate was 3 7 times lower than that of the mn ag beads first order reaction rate the mn hu ag beads exhibited a higher 1 naphthol removal rate than the mn ag beads including further removal of the reaction products and mn2 elution from the reaction in addition the post reaction hplc results of the supernatant and the mn ag hu bead extracts confirmed that humin immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products via irreversible adsorption onto the mn ag hu bead surface via birnessite mediated cross coupling because humin is eco friendly and insoluble its successful application in mn hu ag beads can be useful in developing effective materials for

humin alginate birnessite 1 naphthol irreversible sorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phenolic compounds are recalcitrant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that cause serious problems in soil and water environments owing to their toxicity 1 moreover phenolic compounds have adverse effects on humans such as toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity and teratogenicity 2 therefore these compounds must be eliminated from wastewater and or solid waste before they are discharged into the environment 3 among phenolic compounds 1 naphthol is considered a priority contaminant owing to its high discharge in soil and water systems 4 it is widely used in several industries such as pesticides synthetic dyes plastics pharmaceuticals rubbers and perfumes 5 6 in addition as a toxic metabolite of naphthalene 1 naphthol is more soluble in aqueous solutions than naphthalene making its removal from soil sediment and water systems difficult 7 8 many efforts have been made to remove 1 naphthol from water biological methods commonly applied to purify soil and groundwater contaminated with recalcitrant organic substance have shown limited results for 1 naphthol owing to its poor bioavailability 1 9 in addition techniques such as ozonation 10 11 and fenton oxidation 12 and physical treatment processes such as membrane technology 13 14 and sorption using activated carbon carbon nanotubes and biochar 15 17 have also been used for years however these methods have been reported to have high operational costs and limited effectiveness particularly for removing 1 naphthol in field sites 1 3 9 for instance these methods require post treatment processes for radical products and strong water soluble oxidizing agents that can adversely affect the ecosystem as secondary contaminants recently advanced adsorptive materials such as resorcinol melamine formaldehyde based mesoporous magnetic resins and magnetic resin g chitosan beads were successfully applied to the removal of phenol and 4 chlorophenol in simulated aqueous solutions 18 19 however the adsorptive removal of 1 naphthol using these materials and their hydrophilic reaction products has not been clearly reported thus identifying low cost and eco friendly materials for the effective removal of 1 naphthol and its hydrophilic reaction products is important for managing soil and water contaminants birnessite a naturally occurring manganese oxide has also been reported for its low cost and high reactivity for the removal of phenolic compounds as well as 1 naphthol 20 however a higher removal rate of 1 naphthol using birnessite can result in a higher concentration of manganese oxide mn2 eluted from the reaction thus introducing a secondary contaminant in the water system 21 22 several studies have reported that the radicals released from redox reactions between phenolic compounds and manganese can polymerize and or bind with natural organic substances to form polymer radical products 23 although these polymer radical products are less toxic than 1 naphthol they persist in aqueous environments and are difficult to remove 7 thus there have been many efforts to remove these polymer radical products the application of humic acids for the adsorptive removal of the secondary products of the reaction between phenolic compounds and birnessite has been reported 23 24 however the binding of the secondary products and humic acids results in hydrolysis because of the solubility of humic acids especially at ph 7 25 27 in addition sodium alginate ag beads natural biopolymer insoluble gels have been widely used for adsorption owing to their unique physicochemical properties 28 as a hydrophilic adsorbent sodium ag rapidly forms an insoluble gel in an aqueous solution by combining ca2 ions with the carboxyl groups in ag 29 30 however sodium ag beads also exhibit limited adsorption performance for phenolic compounds because of the repulsive forces between ag and the phenolic compounds in addition pure sodium ag has low mechanical power and can be interfered with by other ions in the solution 31 moreover sodium ag can easily liquefy in aqueous solutions making its removal difficult 32 these limitations of birnessite and ag can be overcome by immobilizing birnessite on ag eom et al 33 reported the successful application of compact birnessite ag beads for the removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions with better results than pure birnessite powder hong et al 31 applied birnessite ag beads for an enhanced removal efficiency for sr ions from seawater however the removal of 1 naphthol using birnessite ag beads still exhibited a low reaction rate because the electrostatic repulsion of the alginic acid molecules inhibited the adsorptive reaction 33 moreover radical products and mn2 were still present in the solution as secondary contaminants therefore it is necessary to improve the removal efficiency of the birnessite ag beads by immobilizing a hydrophobic compound on them for the adsorption of secondary contaminants humin a hydrophobic material may be immobilized on birnessite ag beads because it is highly resistant to decomposition and insoluble under all ph conditions 34 35 in natural soils and or sediments humin accounts for over 50 70 of the total organic carbon 36 it has a high molecular weight and cation exchange capacity 35 and contains various functional groups 34 furthermore as the final product of the humification process of soil organic matter humin binds more stably with organic contaminants than other humic substances e g humic and fulvic acids 37 therefore the immobilization of humin on birnessite ag beads promises to be an effective method for enhancing their efficiency for the removal of 1 naphthol from aqueous solutions however the immobilization of humin into ag beads for an enhanced adsorptive removal of secondary products has not been reported in this study humin and birnessite were immobilized in ag to form birnessite humin ag mn hu ag beads the 1 naphthol removal efficiency of the mn hu ag beads was determined via a kinetic reaction and compared with that of birnessite ag mn ag beads this study reports for the first time the application of humin a low cost natural material in birnessite ag beads to enhance their efficiency for 1 naphthol removal the binding stability of secondary products into the mn hu ag beads was also confirmed via extraction experiments this is the first study on the immobilization of humin in ag beads for water treatment processes the findings of this study may serve as the basis for further research on the applications of humin in environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials 1 naphthol 99 0 was purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification 1 naphthol stock solution 100 mg l was prepared by adding 10 mg of the standard material to 100 ml of distilled water and stirring it under a n2 atmosphere for 24 h and it was subsequently filtered through a membrane filter 0 45 μm pall co ny sodium ag cas no 1923 1350 was purchased as a powder from showa tokyo japan birnessite was prepared according to the method reported by shin et al 7 after filtration the synthesized manganese oxide particles were washed using deionized water to remove residual reagents freeze dried and used as fine powders humin was extracted from canadian peat moss humin sphagnum peat moss using the method reported by nguyen et al 40 mn hu ag beads were fabricated using the following procedure for mn hu ag beads with an initial weight ratio of 1 0 25 1 1 5 and 6 g of humin and sodium ag respectively were added to 300 ml of distilled water and stirred subsequently 6 g of the prepared birnessite were added to the humin ag solution and stirred to disperse the birnessite power the mixture was added to a 150 mm cacl2 aqueous solution using a 1 milliliter pipet to form the insoluble beads mn hu ag beads with initial weight ratios of 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 1 were prepared using 3 and 6 g of humin respectively similarly prepared mn ag mn ag 1 1 humin hu ag 1 1 and ag beads were used as controls in a previous study mn ag beads mn ag 1 1 had been credited with the optimum removal rate for 1 naphthol in an aqueous solution 33 after 12 h of hardening the beads were washed several times using distilled water to remove impurities the water content for 20 beads was obtained via ignition loss at 110 c for 2 h 31 the weight of birnessite in 20 dry beads was obtained via ignition loss at 550 c for 4 h 31 33 sodium ag was dissolved in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 41 42 and the composition in weight of ag in the beads was determined using the weight difference before and after dissolving the beads in edta 50 mm details of this experiment have been reported elsewhere 41 the microstructure of the fabricated beads was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6400 as per the report by eom et al 33 2 2 batch experiments and instrumentation analysis in this study to evaluate the removal characteristics of the mn hu ag beads with different mass ratios for phenol based organic pollutants an optimal ratio was selected by performing a batch test for the reaction time the removal characteristics of the mn ag hu ag and ag beads were evaluated and the removal rates for various 1 naphthol concentrations were determined for each bead type 20 dry beads 110 c 2 h were added to a serum bottle containing 20 ml of 1 naphthol 40 mg l the highest reactivities of birnessite and 1 naphthol were measured at an adjusted ph and temperature of 5 0 and 20 c respectively 33 the serum bottle was completely sealed using a teflon diaphragm and aluminum cap and rotated at 30 rpm in a rotary stirrer finepcrr ag the effect of 1 naphthol concentration on the removal process was also studied using various concentrations of 1 naphthol 20 40 and 80 mg l the samples collected periodically throughout the reaction were filtered using a 0 45 micrometer membrane filter pall co ltd and the filtrate was immediately analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc young lin uv730d a c18 4 6 mm 150 mm particle size 5 μm reversed phase column of waters supelcosil lc 18db was used for the analysis the mobile phase was 50 50 deionized purified water and acetonitrile hplc grade j t baker used in the isoelution mode at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the injection volume of the sample and the wavelength of the uv detector were set to 20 μl and 254 nm respectively fig s1 shows the calibration curve of area vs 1 naphthol concentration 2 3 reaction product analysis the 1 naphthol reaction products were analyzed using uv vis and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopies for the uv vis spectroscopy absorbance analysis was performed in the wavelength range of 200 700 nm using a shimadzu uv 1601 spectrometer ft ir spectroscopy was performed using a jasco ft ir 620 spectrometer to characterize the functional groups of the molecules on the precipitate after the reaction with 1 naphthol after removing the beads from the reaction sample the precipitate obtained via centrifugation was sufficiently dried mixed with kbr ft ir grade aldrich co in a weight ratio of approximately 1 100 filtrate kbr and pelleted the ft ir analysis was performed over five scans in a wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 2 4 analysis of the mn ion elution concentration in the reaction solution after the oxidation conversion reaction of 1 naphthol the concentration of manganese mn2 eluted from the reduction of the mn hu ag and mn ag beads was measured using aas varian 200 fs the reaction supernatant was separated over a 15 minute long centrifugation at 3000 rpm hanil supra 25 k and the reaction solution was filtered using a 0 45 micrometer syringe filter 3 results and discussion 3 1 compositions of the beads the fabricated ag beads were an exchange of porous core materials and had the characteristics of a semi permeable membrane on the outside and they were used for contaminant removal in various reaction media in addition the outer surfaces of the ag beads which formed the crossover were strongly bound to each other and prevented the leakage of the added reaction medium 29 30 38 39 the semipermeable membrane primarily served to maintain the reaction between the reaction medium immobilized in ag and the target material by freely permeating oxygen and other materials from the outside of the beads fig 1 shows the sem images of each component and the prepared mn hu ag beads the surface structures of the mn hu ag beads as seen in the sem images indicate that the birnessite particles and humin were entrapped on the surface of and inside the alginic acid particles water content is an important factor for determining the adsorption efficiency of beads the water contents of all the bead types prepared in this study are presented in table 1 the ag hu ag mn ag and mn hu ag beads had diameters of approximately 2 mm each the ag beads had the highest water content at 96 13 whereas the water contents of the hu ag and mn ag beads were 95 62 and 91 99 respectively the water content of the mn hu ag beads ranged from 90 15 to 92 48 and that of the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 was the lowest therefore a higher mass ratio of humin in the mn hu ag beads was associated with a lower water content low water content beads have been reported to have higher sorption capacities per unit mass 43 however a humin weight higher than those of mn and ag during the preparation process can increase the viscosity of the mn hu ag aqueous solution and make the formation of uniformly sized 2 mm beads difficult thus the maximum mass ratio of the mn hu ag beads in this study was 1 1 1 as shown in table 1 the birnessite percentages in the mn hu ag beads at various humin ratios were nearly equal ranging from 30 97 to 31 96 which were also close to those in the mn ag beads 31 37 for the mn hu ag beads at various humin ratios of 1 0 25 1 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 1 humin accounted for 22 8 25 3 and 31 4 respectively indicating a positive correlation between the humin ratio during bead preparation and the humin content in the manufactured beads for the mn hu ag beads the ag content decreased while the mn content remained constant 31 32 with increasing humin content table 1 confirms that the composition ratios of the dry manufactured mn hu ag beads were different from the ratios with which they had been manufactured for instance mn hu ag 1 0 25 1 mn hu ag 1 0 5 1 and mn hu ag 1 1 1 exhibited the composition ratios of dry manufactured mn hu ag beads as 0 7 0 5 1 0 7 0 6 1 and 0 8 0 8 1 respectively the higher humin ratios of the dry manufactured mn hu ag beads compared to the initial ratios can be explained by the following reasons first humin has a highly compact structure and can be easily immobilized into the porous structure of alginate 44 45 second alginate is a hydrophilic polymer that can easily dissolve in water whereas humin is hydrophobic therefore the contribution of humin was higher than that of alginate in dry weight 31 finally the lower ratio of ag in dry manufactured mn hu ag beads may have been affected by the electrostatic repulsive forces from the functional groups of ag and humin 46 in addition the humin and birnessite ratios in the dry manufactured mn hu ag beads simultaneously increased with the initial humin weight confirming that humin enhanced the immobilization of birnessite in ag beads 3 2 efficiency of humin in mn hu ag beads for the removal of 1 naphthol 3 2 1 1 naphthol removal rate the removal rates of the ag hu mn and mn hu ag beads for 20 ml of 1 naphthol 40 mg l over 120 min are shown in fig 2 the ag and hu ag beads exhibited extremely low removal rates for 1 naphthol and the maximum removal rates in these cases after 120 min were 1 17 and 7 67 respectively in contrast the mn ag beads exhibited a removal rate of 79 68 after 120 min moreover for the mn hu ag beads with various weight ratios of humin the removal rates ranged from 84 15 to 90 99 for the mn hu ag beads a higher mass ratio of humin resulted in a higher removal rate of 1 naphthol fig 2 the ag beads could not remove 1 naphthol from the aqueous solution for the following reasons the ph of the solution ph 5 and the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent primarily affect the adsorptive reaction at ph 5 the ag beads exhibited a positive surface charge due to a phpzc of 6 2 47 whereas 1 naphthol existed as a neutral molecule and was possibly protonated because of a pka of 9 34 21 the positive surface charges on both the ag beads and 1 naphthol prevented their interaction furthermore ag is a biopolymer containing various functional groups such as carboxylate amine phosphate sulfate and hydroxyl which have low mechanical powers and are easily liquefied in water these functional groups also repel hydrophilic compounds such as 1 naphthol 28 48 however for strongly positive sorbates such as metal ions e g mn2 pb2 cd2 and cu2 ag has a high adsorption capacity owing to the attractive electrostatic interactions between ag and the metal ions 49 51 for the hu ag beads the removal efficiency of 1 naphthol was slightly higher than that of the ag beads fig 2 because humin is a hydrophobic material that can absorb small amounts of 1 naphthol however insufficient removal of 1 naphthol was observed in the hu ag beads 1 naphthol penetrated the beads but could not be adsorbed due to repulsion from the binding sites of ag hence it was re eluted into the aqueous phase however the mn ag beads 1 1 exhibited a high 1 naphthol removal rate indicating that the intrinsic reactivity of manganese oxide was maintained even after the manganese oxide particles had been immobilized in the beads because of the oxidative transformation reaction mediated by the birnessite immobilized in alginic acid 33 notably the mn hu ag beads showed a higher 1 naphthol removal rate than the mn ag beads 1 1 indicating a positive correlation between the removal rate and humin content table 1 and confirming that humin provided a synergistic effect for the removal of 1 naphthol during the birnessite mediated oxidative coupling reaction 3 2 2 1 naphthol removal kinetics kinetic experiments were performed using 1 naphthol 40 mg l for approximately 180 min using mn hu ag beads at various ratios 1 1 1 1 0 5 1 and 1 0 25 1 to understand the significance of the humin content in the manufactured beads the adsorption kinetics results are presented in table 2 and fig s2 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant k1 min 1 gradually increased with the humin content in the beads which ranged from 0 0205 to 0 0228 in contrast the correlation coefficient r2 steadily decreased from 0 999 to 0 949 with increasing humin content in the mn hu ag beads the gradual decrease of r2 revealed that with increasing humin content in the mn hu ag beads the removal of 1 naphthol via the oxidation binding reaction did not follow the pseudo first order rate equation owing to the presence of both birnessite and humin therefore the pseudo second order reaction rate constant k2 was analyzed which increased gradually 0 001 0 0013 g mg 1 min 1 with the humin content in the mn hu ag beads the correlation coefficients of the pseudo second order reaction also exhibited an increasing trend with the humin content in the mn hu ag beads 0 993 0 999 reaching the highest value for the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 the results showed that the second order reaction was more suitable than the first order reaction because of the effect of the two materials birnessite and humin immobilized on ag and that humin in the mn hu ag beads facilitated the oxidative polymerization of 1 naphthol via manganese oxide which is a rapid electron transfer reaction after the adsorption of 1 naphthol onto the manganese oxide surface 52 the half lives of the mn hu ag beads at various humin ratios measured using k2 showed that the half life of the mn hu ag 1 1 1 beads was the lowest at 19 2 min and those of the mn hu ag 1 0 5 1 and mn hu ag 1 0 25 1 beads were 22 7 and 25 0 min respectively table 2 the higher humin content in the mn hu ag beads was associated with a higher removal rate of 1 naphthol the humin content in the mn hu ag beads also showed a positive relationship with k1 and k2 in the pseudo first order and pseudo second order reactions respectively fig 3 fig 3 indicates that the correlation between the humin content and k2 exhibited a higher r2 than that between the humin content and k1 thus for a similar birnessite content the kinetics of the removal of 1 naphthol via the mn hu ag beads followed the pseudo second order reaction and were positively related to the humin content in the mn hu ag beads because the oxidation conversion reaction of 1 naphthol occurred on the surface of the birnessite particles the removal rate constant k2 of 1 naphthol also confirmed that humin in the mn hu ag beads favorably enhanced the surface reaction between 1 naphthol and birnessite these results were also supported by the pseudo first order reaction constant k1 of the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 that was more than twice that of the mn ag beads 1 1 i e k 0 0097 under similar experimental conditions as shown in a previous study 33 furthermore the half life of the mn ag beads measured via k1 was 3 7 times 71 4 min that of the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 measured via k2 thus the mn hu ag beads proved that an increase in the humin ratio by weight enhanced the 1 naphthol removal efficiency via oxidative transformation and adsorption 3 2 3 effect of the initial 1 naphthol concentration to identify the effect of the initial 1 naphthol concentration on the reaction between 1 naphthol and the mn hu ag beads the removal reactions were conducted using 20 mn hu ag beads for various 1 naphthol concentrations 20 40 and 80 mg l the 1 naphthol removal rate and reaction kinetics results are shown in figs s3 and s4 and table 3 an increase in the 1 naphthol concentration resulted in a decrease in the 1 naphthol removal rate for the mn hu ag beads fig s3 for the pseudo first order reaction the k1 values decreased from 0 252 to 0 0137 and the r2 values increased from 0 945 to 0 960 with increasing 1 naphthol concentration for the pseudo second order reaction the k2 and r2 values decreased from 0 0033 to 0 003 and 0 998 to 0 991 respectively with increasing initial 1 naphthol concentration table 3 these results further confirmed that the reaction between 1 naphthol and the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 followed the pseudo second order reaction kinetics for all initial 1 naphthol concentrations the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant k2 and the concentration of the initial 1 naphthol were well fitted via an exponential curve r2 0 995 fig s5 the k2 values of the reaction employing the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 were predicted from the initial concentration of 1 naphthol c0 using the equation k2 0 0069 e 0 039 c0 3 3 removal of the 1 naphthol reaction products the uv vis spectra of the supernatant produced after the reaction with 1 naphthol are shown in fig 4 a high absorbance peak was observed at 295 nm corresponding to the aromatic ring of 1 naphthol 8 the high peak at 295 nm corresponding to 1 naphthol and several other high peaks below 250 nm also appeared after its reaction with the hu ag beads confirming that the hu ag beads could not remove 1 naphthol from the aqueous solution however the uv vis spectra of the 1 naphthol solution after its reaction with the mn hu ag containing various humin ratios and mn ag 1 1 beads exhibited shapes similar to those of typical humic materials and the characteristic peak of 1 naphthol disappeared and its absorbance monotonically decreased with increasing wavelength these results suggest that the oxidative polymerization of 1 naphthol via birnessite was maintained even with the mn hu ag and mn ag 1 1 beads 7 22 the ft ir spectra of the 1 naphthol solution before and after its reaction with the mn ag and mn hu ag beads are shown in fig 5 the spectra of the mn ag and mn hu ag beads were obtained by recovering and drying the precipitated product after the reaction with 1 naphthol compared to 1 naphthol the other samples employing various bead types exhibited fewer less intense peaks below 1650 cm 1 for instance the ft ir spectrum of 1 naphthol ranged from 710 to 960 cm 1 exhibiting the out of plane ch bending vibrations of a naphthalene ring with one two and four adjacent hydrogen atoms 53 which were not observed in the samples of the mn ag and mn hu ag beads although the 710 960 cm 1 bands lie in the fingerprint region their disappearance for the samples of the mn ag and mn hu ag beads confirmed structural changes in the 1 naphthol solution after the reaction in addition hydroxyl oh 3450 cm 1 polymethylenic ch2 2925 cm 1 aromatic c c 1600 cm 1 co 1250 cm 1 and co 1020 cm 1 absorption bands were exhibited by all samples with intensities higher than those for 1 naphthol also because of the effective adsorption of humin in the mn hu ag beads the spectra of the samples employing these beads exhibited significantly lower peaks than those of the mn ag beads the ft ir spectrum of the mn hu ag beads was similar to that of humic substances indicating that a typical natural polymeric organic acid was produced after the 1 naphthol removal reaction 7 52 the ft ir and uv vis results confirmed that the polymerized precipitation products of the birnessite mediated oxidative coupling reaction of 1 naphthol had been produced and precipitated a higher removal rate of the mn hu ag beads compared to the mn ag beads had been predicted first via ft ir spectra fig 6a shows the hplc results of the 1 naphthol solution after its reaction with the birnessite powder and the mn ag 1 1 and mn hu ag beads at various humin contents which afforded various products via oxidative coupling these products were hydrophilic polymers with molecular weights of 400 1000 da and retention times rts of 1 1 oligomers 3 02 and 14 1 1 4 naphthoquinone min as reported previously 7 33 previous studies have demonstrated that the reaction between 1 naphthol and birnessite produces high molecular weight hydrophilic oligomers containing 4 or 5 molecules of 1 naphthol via partial ring cleavage and the removal of the substituent 7 8 the peak of 1 4 naphthoquinone reportedly corresponds to the intermediate of the reaction between 1 naphthol and manganese oxide 7 54 1 naphthol was transformed to 1 4 dihydroxynaphthalene via the oxidation reaction with manganese oxide which was further oxidized to 1 4 naphthoquinone 7 55 coupling products such as the oligomers naphthoquinone and naphthol naphthoquinone were also produced via the photolytic transformation of 1 naphthol 8 as shown in fig 6a the peaks corresponding to the hydrophilic polymers and 1 4 naphthoquinone were very high for the reaction involving the birnessite power and decreased gradually and sharply for the mn ag 1 1 and mn hu ag beads respectively the presence of the peaks corresponding to 1 4 naphthoquinone and the weakly hydrophilic reaction product rt 3 02 min in the mn ag beads 1 1 indicated that the alginate in the beads attributed low sorption affinity to the reaction product only the polymeric products were further removed during the birnessite mediated oxidative transformation for the mn hu ag beads with various humin contents the disappearance of the peaks corresponding to 1 4 naphthoquinone and other hydrophilic polymers could be explained by the presence of humin the hplc chromatograms did not vary with the humin contents of the mn hu ag beads however a slightly lower peak at an rt of 1 1 min was observed for mn hu ag 1 1 1 demonstrating that the humin in the beads effectively absorbed the polymeric products generated from the oxidative coupling reaction of 1 naphthol via the birnessite in the aqueous solution and that the increase in humin content resulted in a decrease in the polymeric products to confirm this the absorbed birnessite powder and mn ag 1 1 and mn hu ag 1 1 1 beads were removed from the solution and extracted using methanol each aqueous solution was evaluated after filtration to determine the irreversible sorption capacity the hplc chromatograms of the extracted solutions are shown in fig 6b the solution extracted from birnessite powder exhibited clear hydrophilic polymer rt 1 1 min and 1 4 naphthoquinone peaks however the solution extracted from the mn ag beads 1 1 exhibited only hydrophilic polymer product peaks 1 1 6 min no clear peak was observed for the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 the results showed that the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products on the humin surface via irreversible adsorption after birnessite mediated cross coupling 56 most of the polymerized reaction products were recovered from the birnessite powder and mn ag beads but not the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 ag beads immobilized using activated carbon exhibit effective removal rates only for positively charged compounds as reported in a recent study 57 in contrast the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 exhibited high removal rates for both negatively and positively charged contaminants and immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products via irreversible adsorption onto the humin surface after the birnessite mediated oxidative conversion in this study the oxidation using manganese oxide was a non stoichiometric reaction hence the concentration of mn2 oxide in the aqueous solution was not calculated stoichiometrically the mn2 concentration in the supernatant after analysis has been presented in fig s6 in the case of the mn ag beads the concentration of mn2 was 0 46 mg l in contrast the mn2 concentrations sharply reduced to 0 08 0 052 and 0 029 mg l for the mn hu ag 1 0 25 1 mn hu ag 1 0 5 1 and mn hu ag 1 1 1 beads respectively fig s6 the soluble mn2 produced by the reduction of the mn3 mn4 immobilized on ag was re adsorbed onto the ag by the mn ag beads for the mn hu ag beads both ag and humin which exhibit strong affinity for divalent metals re adsorbed the mn2 produced during the reaction between birnessite and 1 naphthol humin immobilized on the mn hu ag beads is believed to have exhibited a higher sorption capacity than ag as confirmed by the lower concentration of mn2 in the 1 naphthol solution supernatant mn2 concentration was the lowest 0 029 mg l for the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 lower than the limitation standard of mn2 in drinking water 0 05 mg l usepa 58 thus the mn hu ag beads 1 1 1 were more effective at removing 1 naphthol than mn ag beads and or only birnessite with a lower half life and enhanced removal capacity in addition the concentrations of polymerized products and mn2 elution after the reaction were efficiently reduced owing to the presence of humin 4 conclusion upon immobilization of humin and birnessite in ag to fabricate mn hu ag beads humin had a synergistic effect on the reaction between 1 naphthol and birnessite without directly reacting with 1 naphthol the mn hu ag beads with an initial weight ratio of 1 1 1 exhibited a higher removal rate and capacity and a lower half life for 1 naphthol than mn ag beads and pure birnessite and the highest sorption capacity for various reaction products and the mn2 eluted from the reaction unlike the mn ag beads the mn hu ag beads exhibited a second order kinetic reaction suggesting immobilization of birnessite and humin in ag and the involvement of humin in the oxidative polymerization of 1 naphthol via birnessite ft ir analysis of the precipitates and uv vis analysis of the supernatant after the reaction employing the mn hu ag beads revealed the presence of humic materials and the reduction of radical products compared to the powder form the bead form of birnessite facilitated further analysis e g ft ir of the reaction products for the first time the post reaction hplc chromatogram of the extracted mn ag hu beads also revealed that humin immobilized the 1 naphthol reaction products via irreversible adsorption on the humin surface after birnessite mediated cross coupling the application of mn hu ag beads can overcome the need for secondary contaminant sorption and they could be used as eco friendly reactive filter materials for removing phenolic compounds in the field credit authorship contribution

surface to provide the degradation ability to the formed c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres characterization results such as ftir analysis confirmed the coating of pdda on fe3o4 nps while the tga analysis proved the excellent thermal stability of microspheres after the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps bet specific surface area of microspheres was measured at 13 90 m2 g besides the ph drift method confirmed the presence of positive charge on microspheres surface which is important for the removal of anionic pollutants moreover porous structure of microspheres was also observed under sem formulation study was also carried out to investigate the suitable concentration for the synthesis of microspheres including the concentration of pes polymer 1 20 wt the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps 1 5 wt and the concentration of polyethylene glycol peg 1 20 wt the microspheres synthesized from different formulations were subjected to the batch removal of methyl orange mo results showed that a 72 53

demonstrated an excellent reusability as compared to pure pes microspheres the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres could be reused up to 5 cycles without the need of regeneration while still maintaining high mo removal efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords trifunctional magnetic responsive adsorptive properties catalytic activities high reusability anionic pollutants removal polyethersulfones data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution caused by the release of various organic pollutants from industrialization and urbanization has become a persistent global problem to date various treatment methods had been developed to remove pollutants from wastewater such as oxidation 1 coagulation and flocculation 2 photocatalysis 3 membrane separation 4 and adsorption 5 however most of these methods possess major drawbacks such as high operating costs low efficiency and generation of waste sludge among them adsorption is the most prominent technique used due to ease of operation low cost high efficiency and better adsorbents recovery 6 7 the major disadvantage of adsorption treatment method is mainly due to the adsorbents regeneration usually via solvent extraction that would result in the generation of secondary wastes besides the non extractable residue pollutants would reduce the reusability and life span of the adsorbents recently advanced oxidation processes such as fenton like degradation had emerged to be a promising pathway to overcome such problem 8 fenton like degradation is a low cost oxidation process that utilizes the reaction between hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and iron oxide fe3o4 to generate a highly oxidizing species that is capable to degrade the organic pollutants into water and carbon dioxide 9 fe3o4 nps with magnetic properties can be magnetized under magnetic field thereby achieving easy recovery from the water medium 10 moreover fe3o4 nps possess high particle magnetic moment due to their high magnetic saturation value and excellent magnetic susceptibility thus even though the fe3o4 nps were loaded with the contaminant after treatment their magnetic properties will still be preserved and will not affect the subsequent separation process through externally applied magnetic field and gradient 11 12 surface modification is usually carried out to improve the surface activity including to control the dispersibility enhance the physiochemical and mechanical properties and improve the biocompatibility of fe3o4 nps surface modification can prevent rapid agglomeration and oxidation of fe3o4 nps that would result in loss of magnetism 13 14 therefore the ability of fe3o4 nps to be decorated with various functional groups via surface modification can provide specific affinity towards different target contaminants 15 17 however the main problem of fe3o4 nps is their extremely small size which may lead to poor colloidal stability ferrous nps tend to flocculate due to van der waals interactions resulting in agglomeration 18 the agglomeration of fe3o4 nps caused the deterioration of the specific surface area and catalytic activity of nps 19 therefore microencapsulation of fe3o4 nps into polymer matrix is one of the methods to stabilize the fe3o4 nps 20 microencapsulation offers several advantages such as i protect the sensitive core material from the harsh external environment 21 ii mask the colour taste and odor of the core material and iii safe handling of hazardous or toxic materials 22 on the other hand the problem of poor response to external magnetic field due to nano sized particles that could not overcome the brownian motion for efficient separation could also be solved through the microencapsulation technique 23 24 hence the main novelty of this study is to synthesize the trifunctional pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres which possess superior adsorptive catalytic and magnetic responsive properties for the removal of anionic water pollutant fe3o4 nps play three significant roles in this study besides being magnetic responsive in nature fe3o4 nps can serve as catalyst that triggers the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh in the presence of h2o2 25 furthermore the surface functionalization with poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdda a highly hydrophilic cationic polymer can transform fe3o4 nps into an excellent adsorbent the polyethersulfones pes encapsulated pdda functionalized fe3o4 microspheres were synthesized through phase inversion process to further enhance the fenton like degradation the surface of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was coated with a layer of naked fe3o4 without pdda coating to form surface coated pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres c pdda fe3o4 pes to the best of knowledge no studies had reported on the removal of pollutants via simultaneous adsorption and degradation process the microspheres synthesis formulations which included the concentration of pes polymer 1 20 wt the loading of pdda fe3o4 nanoparticles 1 5 wt and the concentration of polyethylene glycol peg 1 20 wt were investigated in details the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were then characterized using fourier transform infrared ftir analysis thermogravimetric tga analysis brunauer emmett teller bet analysis ph drift and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray sem edx next methyl orange mo was chosen as the target of anionic water pollutant to examine the simultaneous adsorption and degradation performance of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres in addition the reusability of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was also examined in this study mo was chosen as the adsorbate due to its consumption in various industries which included textile printing cosmetic and pharmaceutical it is a type of azo dye that possesses functional group r n n r r and r are usually aryl the presence of this mono azo group results in complex and stable molecular structure of mo which made it resistant to biodegradation and photochemical degradation 26 hence the removal of mo from water has becoming an issue of concern due to its low biodegradability as well as potential environmental and public health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials iron ii chloride tetrahydrate fecl2 4h2o mw 126 8 g mol purity 99 3 iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o mw 270 3 g mol purity 98 4 and poly diallyldimethyl ammonia chloride mw 100 000 35 wt in h2o were supplied by sigma aldrich malaysia ammonia solution nh4oh 30 wt in h2o and methyl orange mo were obtained from r m chemical malaysia polyethersulfones pes purity 99 with density of 1 37 g cm3 was purchased from basf malaysia polyethylene glycol peg mw 6000 g mol purity 99 5 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 wt in h2o were provided by chemicals solutions sdn bhd malaysia n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp mw 99 13 g mol purity 99 9 solvent was purchased from merck malaysia all the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis of pdda functionalized fe3o4 nps a beaker containing 20 ml of deionized water 0 8 g of fecl2 4h2o and 2 16 g of fecl3 6h2o was first prepared next 1 v t of pdda was added into the beaker and the mixture was heated to 80 c subsequently 10ml of nh4oh solution was introduced to the heated mixture for the precipitation of pdda fe3o4 nps the mixture was left to stir for 1 h at 200rpm upon completion the mixture was immediately cooled to room temperature and the pdda fe3o4 nps were harvested by using a permanent magnet the nps were rinsed several times with deionized water and air dried for further use 27 2 3 preparation of prepolymer solution pes polymer solution was prepared by dissolving the desired amount 1 20 wt of pes flakes and peg 1 20 wt in nmp solvent pes was a constituent material for microspheres shell wall while peg served as a pore forming agent the mixture was subjected to heating at 70 c for 1 h under constant stirring speed of 180 rpm next the solution was cooled to room temperature and left to stir overnight to ensure the homogeneity of the solution 2 4 preparation of microsphere forming solution pdda fe3o4 pes solution was prepared by adding pdda fe3o4 nps 1 5 wt into 20 ml of prepolymer solution first the nps were added into 10 ml of prepolymer solution under sonication until a uniform solution was formed next the remaining 10 ml of prepolymer solution was introduced and the mixture was sonicated for another 30 min the two steps addition of prepolymer solution promoted better dispersion of nps within the prepolymer solution 2 5 synthesis of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres the experiment setup to synthesis the pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres is illustrated in fig 1 the microsphere forming solution was agitated throughout the microspheres synthesis process to prevent settling of nps the solution was channelled through a syringe needle size 26 g with the help of a peristaltic pump pumping rate of 0 1 ml min followed by dropwise addition of this polymer solution into a coagulation bath that contained deionized water the microspheres were then formed as precipitates through the phase inversion process lastly the formed microspheres were collected and rinsed thrice with deionized water 2 6 surface coating of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres first a solution containing 0 5 g l of fe3o4 nps in deionized water was prepared the ph of the solution was then adjusted to ph 8 next the surface coating of microspheres was carried out by adding the microspheres into the fe3o4 nps solution under sonication and agitation for 1 h the attachment of fe3o4 nps negative surface charge on the microspheres positive surface charge was achieved through electrostatic interaction the fe3o4 coated microspheres c pdda fe3o4 pes were harvested and rinsed with deionized water the functionalized microspheres were stirred in deionized water overnight to remove the loosely bounded fe3o4 nps lastly the microspheres were oven dried at 37 c for 24 h and stored 2 7 samples characterizations characterizations were carried out on three samples which were naked fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres ftir spectra of the three samples were accessed using an ftir spectrophotometer nicolet is10 performed in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 the thermal stability of the samples was analyzed by using tga thermo scientific sorptometic so1990 at temperature range of 25 to 800 c with temperature ramp rate of 10 c min to determine the specific surface area of the samples brunauer emmet teller bet surface analysis micromerities 3flex employed to calculate the specific surface area with bet theory furthermore the surface charge of the samples was measured through ph drift method sodium chloride solutions 0 1 m with different ph were prepared and the change in ph after addition of microspheres was measured a graph of final ph versus initial ph was plotted to identify the surface charge of sample at different ph the surface morphology and elemental composition of the microspheres were examined by using sem edx hitachi s 3400 n at 15 0 kv accelerating voltage the electron beam will scan on the sample and produce a magnified image for the analysis at different magnifications 2 8 removal of mo using c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres the performance of the microspheres synthesized from different formulation was evaluated through the mo removal efficiency the batch removal of mo was carried out in triplicate with the model system of 30 ml solution composed of 10 ppm of mo and 20 mmol l of h2o2 next 3 g of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were added into the mo solution under vigorous stirring the removal of mo was allowed to proceed for 4 h pure pes microspheres without fe3o4 nps were used as blank control in the mo removal the remaining mo concentration in the solution was determined through uv vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength of 464 nm the dye removal efficiency was calculated by using eq 1 1 efficiency c i c f c i 100 where c i and c f are the initial and final concentration mg l of mo dye in the solution respectively 2 9 reusability study the reusability of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was examined for five consecutive cycles the experiment conditions were same as the previous section upon completion of each cycle the spent microspheres were collected using a permanent magnet and rinsed multiple times with deionized water next the microspheres were air dried before subjected to the successive cycles of mo removal the reusability study of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was compared to pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres to investigate the effect of surface coating on the reusability of microspheres 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pdda polymer on the removal of mo the mo removal efficiencies for pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and fe3o4 pes microspheres are shown in fig 2 it could be observed that the microspheres synthesized with pdda coated fe3o4 nps showed an excellent removal 80 65 as compared to the microspheres synthesized with naked fe3o4 45 97 as a cationic polyelectrolyte pdda polymer provided the microspheres with positive surface charge that is important for the removal of anionic mo dye through electrostatic interaction the positive charge on the pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres would attract the negatively charged mo due to charge difference and realized the removal through adsorption in contrary the removal of mo by fe3o4 pes microspheres was limited due to the weak positive charge of the microspheres the surface charge of fe3o4 nps was generally negative and weak positive charge was only present at ph below 4 5 28 the weak positive charge coupled with the negative surface charge nature of pes polymer had resulted in poor removal of mo 29 hence the comparison between these two microspheres had proven the role of pdda polymer in improving the removal of anionic pollutants in addition fig 3 a and b show the color of mo solution before and after respectively treatment by the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres the results proved that c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were capable to remove anionic water pollutants efficiently 3 2 magnetic performance of fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were dispersed in 20 ml deionized water and an external magnetic field was applied to determine the magnetic responsive behavior of the samples fig 4 a to d show the response of fe3o4 nps and pdda fe3o4 nps towards external magnetic field over the time of 30 min it could be observed that clearer solution was obtained for fe3o4 nps as compared to pdda fe3o4 nps this implied that pdda fe3o4 nps showed slower response towards the magnetic field which could be explained by the introduction of pdda polymer that had improve the stability and dispersion of nps in water this is due to the electrostatic or steric repulsion of the positively charged pdda fe3o4 nps both the nps required longer time to be complete collected by the magnetic field due to their small size that would experience stronger effect of brownian motion in contrast fig 4 e shows the immediate response of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres to the magnetic field as their larger size had minimized the effect of brownian motion as compared to nps in short the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps in the microspheres allowed the recovery of spent microspheres through external magnetic field within seconds 3 3 characterization of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres 3 3 1 ftir fig 5 a b and c represent the ftir spectra of naked fe3o4 pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres respectively as shown in fig 5 a the broad characteristic bands centred at around 3200cm 1 was due to the presence of free or adsorbed water molecules that ascribed to oh bending of hydroxyl group 30 meanwhile the wavelength of 549 cm 1 was attributed to the metal oxygen feo vibration stretching in the crystalline lattice of fe3o4 31 the subsequent splitting up peak at 623 cm 1 was corresponded to the symmetry degeneration on octahedral b sites 32 this indicated that fe3o4 nps were successfully synthesized via the co precipitation method the successful functionalization of pdda polymer on fe3o4 nps was proven by the appearance of new peaks at 1508 cm 1 and 954 cm 1 fig 5 b which were assigned to the cn stretch and ch2 n ch3 2 ch2 vibration in aliphatic pdda respectively 33 34 the presence of pes polymer was confirmed by the significant absorption peaks of benzene ring 1577 cm 1 sulfonyl group 1458 cm 1 1238 cm 1 1150 cm 1 and co bond stretching as shown in fig 5 c 35 furthermore the presence of fe3o4 nps in the microspheres was further supported by the magnetic response behavior of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres it could be observed in fig 6 a that the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were attracted by the ndfeb magnet while the pure pes microspheres in fig 6 b showed no response to the magnet and remained at the bottom of the vial glass hence this proved the strong magnetic properties of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres after the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps subsequently this displayed the potential recovery of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres through magnetic separation 3 3 2 tga tga curves in fig 7 depict the variation of weight loss for naked fe3o4 pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres at different temperatures basically all the three samples experienced slight weight loss at temperature below 200 c stage i which was due to the loss of residual moisture physically adsorbed species and other contaminants 36 naked fe3o4 only exhibited weight loss 6 45 at stage i and the weight was found to remain constant after 200 c meanwhile the weights of pdda fe3o4 nps and microspheres were further reduced in stage ii that was accounted for the thermal decomposition of pdda polymer that occurred between 200 and 700 c 37 this finding further supported the successful functionalization of fe3o4 nps with pdda polymer after the pdda decomposition occurred at stage ii the weight of pdda fe3o4 nps remained almost constant next c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres encountered additional two stages of weight loss the weight loss at temperature range of approximately 350 to 430 c stage iii revealed the thermal degradation of remaining nmp solvent that trapped inside the microspheres this result was in agreement with the literature which reported the decomposition of nmp solvent at 370 c and above 38 apart from that the weight loss at stage iv was attributed to the decomposition of pes polymer in microspheres according to the literature report the decomposition temperature of pure pes polymer occurred between 450 and 500 c 39 however the temperature was slightly extended to 490 c in this study with the highest weight loss observed at 555 c this indicated that the thermal stability of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres increased with the introduction of pdda fe3o4 nps into the pes polymer matrix 3 3 3 bet the bet results of naked fe3o4 pdda fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 pes and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres are shown in table 1 from the results all the four samples possessed significant mesopores 2 50 nm however the samples exhibited different specific surface area where the surface area of fe3o4 nps increased by more than threefold from 34 05 to 110 75 m2 g after the surface functionalization with pdda polymer the pore diameter of pdda fe3o4 nps was slightly smaller compared to naked fe3o4 due to the coverage of pores by pdda in short the surface functionalization of fe3o4 with pdda molecules was crucial as it increased the specific surface area for the reaction to take place in addition of imparting positive charge to the nps for adsorption of mo next the specific surface area of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was found to be significantly decreased after encapsulated in pes polymer however the average pores diameter increased significantly to 35 53 nm the large pore diameter was due to the channels created during the phase inversion process 40 on the other hand the specific surface area of microspheres increased to 13 90 m2 g after surface coating with fe3o4 nps the application of ultrasonication during surface coating process might promote the formation of pores in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres 41 which enhanced the specific surface area at the same time the average pore diameter of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was reduced by half as compared to pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres due to the attachment of fe3o4 nps in the pores after surface coating despite the reduction of pore diameter after the surface coating the pore diameter of microspheres still remained in mesoporous size which was sufficient for the diffusion of mo with average molecular size of 1 2 nm to reach the active sites for the adsorption process 3 4 microspheres surface charge the surface charge of pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were evaluated through the ph drift method and the results are shown in fig 8 the dotted line in fig 8 represents the tie line that separates the negative zone above tie line and positive zone below tie line by taking the point of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres at ph 9 8 fifth point as example the initial ph of 9 8 was reduced to a final ph of 6 81 implying that the microspheres possessed positive charge which they attracted and removed the negative hydroxide ions in the solution and reduced the ph from 9 8 to 6 81 conversely c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres with initial ph of 6 third point that rose slightly to ph 6 23 suggested that the microspheres were removing positively charged hydronium ions from the solution in other words the microspheres were slightly negatively charged it should be noted that an overall slightly negative charge usually means that the negative surface charges are slightly predominant however positive charge may still present on the microspheres surface in short the ph drift characterization had proven the presence of positive charges on the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres which further explained the capability of the microspheres in the removal of anionic pollutants such as mo 3 5 sem edx the surface morphology of pure pes microspheres and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was studied by sem and the results are shown in fig 9 from fig 9 a and b the surface of pure pes microspheres was rather smooth with just tiny pores on it the distribution of pores was relatively scattered as compared to c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres finger like cavities and networks of pores were uniformly formed from the interior of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and extended to the surface as illustrated in fig 9 c d g and h this phenomenon was attributed to the exchange of solvent and non solvent across the boundary layer before the complete solidification of pes polymer during the phase inversion process the highly porous structure of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres over pure pes microspheres might be attributed to the application of ultrasonication during surface coating process the high shearing impact exerted by the intense ultrasound can disrupt the microspheres surface and lead to more pores formation 41 on the other hand the formation of pores in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were in all direction due to the high phase separation after addition of peg polymer and pdda fe3o4 nps which altered the chemical compositions and physical characteristics of the microsphere forming solution 42 besides clusters of fe3o4 nps were found to deposit on the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres as depicted in fig 9 e and f hence the surface coating of fe3o4 nps on the microspheres surface was successful and the sonication step during the coating process could promote more pores formation edx analysis was performed to confirm the existence of fe3o4 nps in the microspheres fig 10 a and b illustrate the edx results of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres respectively the weight percentage of iron fe and oxygen o in pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were found to be 1 91 and 32 95 respectively after the surface coating with fe3o4 nps the weight percentage of fe and o in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres increased to 4 52 and 37 70 respectively indicated the successful coating of fe3o4 nps on the surface of the microspheres the edx results proved the successful encapsulation of pdda fe3o4 nps and surface coating of fe3o4 nps to provide the microspheres with adsorption degradation and magnetic responsive ability 3 6 removal of mo using c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres 3 6 1 effect of pes polymer concentration microsphere forming solutions that contained 1 and 5 wt of pes polymer were found not feasible to produce microspheres due to the low viscosity the microspheres were discovered to be lacking of physical integrity and precipitated as flakes as shown in fig 11 a on the other hand microsphere forming solution with 20 wt of pes polymer was also not suitable because of the high viscosity that exceeded the pumping range of the peristaltic pump which impeded the microspheres formation therefore only microspheres synthesized from 10 and 15 wt of pes polymer were found suitable to form rigid spherical microspheres as illustrates in fig 11 b hence only microspheres synthesized from 10 and 15 wt of pes polymer were subjected to the removal of mo and the removal efficiency of both microspheres are depicted in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the removal of mo was almost similar merely 4 increment for the microspheres synthesized from 10 wt 71 75 of mo removal and 15 wt 75 64 of mo removal pes polymer such removal efficiency could be justified by the bet surface area as shown in table 2 microspheres with 15 wt pes polymer possessed just slightly higher specific surface area 18 24 m2 g as compared to microspheres with 10 wt pes polymer 15 56 m2 g however the average pore diameter for both microspheres was very similar to each other therefore there was negligible difference in the removal of mo between microspheres synthesized with 10 and 15 wt pes polymer higher pes polymer concentration is usually not recommended for the synthesis of microspheres 43 besides being difficult to handle due to high viscosity high concentration of pes polymer might also lead to the dissipation of positive surface charge on pdda fe3o4 nps through charge migration 44 this is due to the negative surface charge in nature of pes polymer 29 hence 10 wt was selected as the suitable concentration for the formulation of microspheres 3 6 2 effect of pdda fe3o4 nps concentration fig 13 depicts the mo removal by microspheres synthesized with various loadings of pdda fe3o4 nps from the results the removal of mo increased significantly from 51 51 to 75 64 when the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps in the microspheres was increased from 1 to 2 wt pdda fe3o4 nps played two important roles in the removal of mo to provide positive surface charge to the microspheres for the adsorption process and acted as catalyst in the fenton like reaction to generate oh for the degradation of mo hence the increase in the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps would provide positive effect to the removal of mo next no increment in the removal of mo was observed when the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps was increased from 2 to 4 wt as the only source to provide the microspheres with positive charge the increase in pdda fe3o4 nps loading would enhance the positive charge intensity of the microspheres meanwhile greater amount of fe3o4 nps could be coated on the microspheres during surface coating through opposite charge attraction consequently the overall positive charge intensity of the microspheres was neutralized due to the presence of more fe3o4 nps moreover large amount of fe3o4 nps could lead to excess generation of oh in this situation oh would start to react with h2o2 in the valence bond and recombination of oh occurred 45 ultimately the number of free oh available for degradation of mo was diminished and the removal of mo became stagnant as illustrates in fig 13 it was interesting to observe that the removal of mo was slightly boosted up to 82 40 at pdda fe3o4 nps loading of 5 wt this was probably due to the stronger positive charge caused by high loading of nps at this loading of pdda fe3o4 nps the removal of mo was expected to be dominant by adsorption while the degradation remained however pdda fe3o4 nps of 5 wt would cause difficulty in microspheres synthesis process which required longer synthesis time due to blockage high concentration of core material is not preferable as it increases the viscosity of the internal phase which results in difficult dispersion of core material 46 consequently more agglomerations of microspheres would occur and microspheres with large and irregular size would be formed 47 hence 2 wt of pdda fe3o4 nps was selected as the suitable formulation for microspheres because of the acceptable specific surface area with the highest average pore diameter as compared to the microspheres synthesized from 3 and 4 wt of pdda fe3o4 nps 3 6 3 effect of peg polymer concentration fig 14 shows the mo removal by microspheres synthesized with different concentrations of peg polymer the removal of mo marked a significant 22 73 increment from 49 80 to 72 53 when the concentration of peg was increased from 0 to 5 wt the mo removal remained almost constant at peg concentration above 5 wt the increase in the removal of mo at low concentration of peg could be explained by the formation of pores that led to the increase in specific surface area for mo removal process according to the bet results shown in table 3 it could be observed that the microspheres prepared from 0 and 5 wt of peg were having similar specific surface area around 14 m2 g the factor that contributed to the higher mo removal 72 53 by the microspheres with 5 wt of peg was due to the larger pore diameter of 17 81 nm which provided lesser resistance for the diffusion of h2o2 and mo from table 3 the specific surface area of microspheres show an increasing trend as the peg concentration was increased from 0 to 20 wt as a pore forming agent the hydrophilic peg enhanced the mixing rates between solvent and non solvent which promoted the formation of pores 48 at high concentration of peg greater concentration gradient was present in the system to drive the diffusion of peg across the microspheres shell layer consequently there was an increase in the number of pores that enhanced the specific surface area as shown in fig 14 further increase in the peg concentrations from 5 to 20 wt did not cause significant improvement in the removal of mo such observation could be explained via two perspectives degradation and adsorption in the perspective of mo degradation via fenton like reaction greater specific surface area provided vast active sites for the h2o2 to react with fe3o4 nps which induced greater generation of oh as a result recombination of oh occurred and led to poor degradation of mo 45 on the other hand the removal of mo via adsorption depended heavily on the positive charge intensity of the microspheres hence the fixed loading of pdda fe3o4 nps 2 wt became the limiting factor for the adsorption of mo therefore the increase in the specific surface area caused by peg actually did not improve the adsorption of mo this phenomenon explained the stagnant removal of mo when peg concentration was increased from 5 to 20 wt to conclude peg concentration of 5 wt was selected for the formulation as it enhanced the specific surface area of the microspheres and achieved the highest mo removal efficiency 3 7 reusability study the reusability results on c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres are presented in table 4 it could be observed that the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were able to maintain the mo removal efficiency in the range of 75 80 even after five cycles in contrast the mo removal efficiency of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres decreased 30 over the cycles and eventually dropped from 80 65 first cycle to 51 48 fifth cycle the surface coated fe3o4 in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres played a vital role as catalyst in the fenton like degradation to remove the mo in the presence of h2o2 the ferric iron on the surface of microspheres reacts with h2o2 and transforms it into a highly oxidizing species oh the oh generated during the fenton like reaction not only could degrade the free mo in the solution but also the adsorbed mo in the microspheres on the other hand the effect of fenton like degradation of mo in pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was limited without the surface coated fe3o4 nps as the h2o2 was needed to diffuse into the pores to compete with mo for pdda fe3o4 nps moreover after each removal cycles the surface of the pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was saturated with mo molecules which might eventually create higher diffusion resistance to h2o2 in reaching the pdda fe3o4 nps for oh generation therefore the presence of surface coated fe3o4 realized the simultaneous adsorption and degradation of mo which could extend the life span of the microspheres most importantly the microspheres could be reused without regeneration via solvent extraction the mo saturated adsorbents can usually be regenerated through naoh extraction by using 0 1 1 m of naoh solution 49 in addition around 600 ml of naoh solution is required for the regeneration of each gram of catalysts 50 hence the application of highly reusable c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres further eliminated the generation of secondary waste making the removal of mo a truly green process 3 8 comparison study table 5 shows the comparison of different microspheres on the maximum dye removal efficiency and reusability study it can be observed that the dye removal efficiency of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres in this study was comparable to other adsorbents such as chitosan cellulose and grapheme based microspheres on top of that the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres showed a superior reusability unlike other adsorbents c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres require no regeneration process and were able to maintain the removal efficiency up to five cycles of dye removal in contrast other adsorbents required regeneration process such as solvent extraction and heat treatment in addition they also experienced different reductions in removal efficiency after several cycles of dye removal the comparison proved the aptitude of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres as a green and highly reusable adsorbent for the removal of anionic pollutants 4 conclusion this study revealed the successful synthesis of trifunctional c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres with adsorption degradation and magnetic responsive properties the microspheres were effective in the removal of mo from aqueous solution through simultaneous adsorption and degradation process the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps was found not only providing the microspheres with positive surface charge for adsorption but also enhancing the thermal stability of the microspheres besides the highly porous structure of microspheres was an advantage to increase the specific surface area for the removal of mo the formulation parameters such as concentration of pes polymer pdda fe3o4 nps and peg affected significantly the removal of mo the best formulation for the microspheres synthesis was found to be in 10 wt of pes polymer 2 wt of pdda fe3o4 nps and 5 wt of peg polymer the microspheres synthesized from this formulation were capable to achieve 72 53 of mo removal experiment conditions mo 10 mg l h2o2 25 mmol l ph 4 contact time 4 h lastly the surface coated fe3o4 nps allowed the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres to be highly reusable with a minimum five consecutive cycles without significant drop in the removal efficiency in addition process optimization isotherm and kinetic models study are potential scopes for further study as they are fundamental studies to identify the suitable operating condition and understand the removal or degradation mechanisms of the pollutants by the microspheres as a conclusion the application of trifunctional c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres in the removal of anionic

12611,this study focused on the synthesis of trifunctional microspheres with adsorption degradation and magnetic responsive properties firstly polyethersulfones pes encapsulated poly diallyldimethyl ammonia chloride pdda functionalized iron oxide fe3o4 microspheres were produced via phase inversion method the pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were further coated with fe3o4 nanoparticles nps on the surface to provide the degradation ability to the formed c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres characterization results such as ftir analysis confirmed the coating of pdda on fe3o4 nps while the tga analysis proved the excellent thermal stability of microspheres after the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps bet specific surface area of microspheres was measured at 13 90 m2 g besides the ph drift method confirmed the presence of positive charge on microspheres surface which is important for the removal of anionic pollutants moreover porous structure of microspheres was also observed under sem formulation study was also carried out to investigate the suitable concentration for the synthesis of microspheres including the concentration of pes polymer 1 20 wt the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps 1 5 wt and the concentration of polyethylene glycol peg 1 20 wt the microspheres synthesized from different formulations were subjected to the batch removal of methyl orange mo results showed that a 72 53 removal of mo can be obtained under the following microspheres synthesis formulations 10wt of pes polymer 2 wt of pdda fe3o4 nps and 5 wt of peg polymer lastly the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres also demonstrated an excellent reusability as compared to pure pes microspheres the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres could be reused up to 5 cycles without the need of regeneration while still maintaining high mo removal efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords trifunctional magnetic responsive adsorptive properties catalytic activities high reusability anionic pollutants removal polyethersulfones data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution caused by the release of various organic pollutants from industrialization and urbanization has become a persistent global problem to date various treatment methods had been developed to remove pollutants from wastewater such as oxidation 1 coagulation and flocculation 2 photocatalysis 3 membrane separation 4 and adsorption 5 however most of these methods possess major drawbacks such as high operating costs low efficiency and generation of waste sludge among them adsorption is the most prominent technique used due to ease of operation low cost high efficiency and better adsorbents recovery 6 7 the major disadvantage of adsorption treatment method is mainly due to the adsorbents regeneration usually via solvent extraction that would result in the generation of secondary wastes besides the non extractable residue pollutants would reduce the reusability and life span of the adsorbents recently advanced oxidation processes such as fenton like degradation had emerged to be a promising pathway to overcome such problem 8 fenton like degradation is a low cost oxidation process that utilizes the reaction between hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and iron oxide fe3o4 to generate a highly oxidizing species that is capable to degrade the organic pollutants into water and carbon dioxide 9 fe3o4 nps with magnetic properties can be magnetized under magnetic field thereby achieving easy recovery from the water medium 10 moreover fe3o4 nps possess high particle magnetic moment due to their high magnetic saturation value and excellent magnetic susceptibility thus even though the fe3o4 nps were loaded with the contaminant after treatment their magnetic properties will still be preserved and will not affect the subsequent separation process through externally applied magnetic field and gradient 11 12 surface modification is usually carried out to improve the surface activity including to control the dispersibility enhance the physiochemical and mechanical properties and improve the biocompatibility of fe3o4 nps surface modification can prevent rapid agglomeration and oxidation of fe3o4 nps that would result in loss of magnetism 13 14 therefore the ability of fe3o4 nps to be decorated with various functional groups via surface modification can provide specific affinity towards different target contaminants 15 17 however the main problem of fe3o4 nps is their extremely small size which may lead to poor colloidal stability ferrous nps tend to flocculate due to van der waals interactions resulting in agglomeration 18 the agglomeration of fe3o4 nps caused the deterioration of the specific surface area and catalytic activity of nps 19 therefore microencapsulation of fe3o4 nps into polymer matrix is one of the methods to stabilize the fe3o4 nps 20 microencapsulation offers several advantages such as i protect the sensitive core material from the harsh external environment 21 ii mask the colour taste and odor of the core material and iii safe handling of hazardous or toxic materials 22 on the other hand the problem of poor response to external magnetic field due to nano sized particles that could not overcome the brownian motion for efficient separation could also be solved through the microencapsulation technique 23 24 hence the main novelty of this study is to synthesize the trifunctional pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres which possess superior adsorptive catalytic and magnetic responsive properties for the removal of anionic water pollutant fe3o4 nps play three significant roles in this study besides being magnetic responsive in nature fe3o4 nps can serve as catalyst that triggers the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh in the presence of h2o2 25 furthermore the surface functionalization with poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride pdda a highly hydrophilic cationic polymer can transform fe3o4 nps into an excellent adsorbent the polyethersulfones pes encapsulated pdda functionalized fe3o4 microspheres were synthesized through phase inversion process to further enhance the fenton like degradation the surface of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was coated with a layer of naked fe3o4 without pdda coating to form surface coated pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres c pdda fe3o4 pes to the best of knowledge no studies had reported on the removal of pollutants via simultaneous adsorption and degradation process the microspheres synthesis formulations which included the concentration of pes polymer 1 20 wt the loading of pdda fe3o4 nanoparticles 1 5 wt and the concentration of polyethylene glycol peg 1 20 wt were investigated in details the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were then characterized using fourier transform infrared ftir analysis thermogravimetric tga analysis brunauer emmett teller bet analysis ph drift and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray sem edx next methyl orange mo was chosen as the target of anionic water pollutant to examine the simultaneous adsorption and degradation performance of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres in addition the reusability of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was also examined in this study mo was chosen as the adsorbate due to its consumption in various industries which included textile printing cosmetic and pharmaceutical it is a type of azo dye that possesses functional group r n n r r and r are usually aryl the presence of this mono azo group results in complex and stable molecular structure of mo which made it resistant to biodegradation and photochemical degradation 26 hence the removal of mo from water has becoming an issue of concern due to its low biodegradability as well as potential environmental and public health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials iron ii chloride tetrahydrate fecl2 4h2o mw 126 8 g mol purity 99 3 iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o mw 270 3 g mol purity 98 4 and poly diallyldimethyl ammonia chloride mw 100 000 35 wt in h2o were supplied by sigma aldrich malaysia ammonia solution nh4oh 30 wt in h2o and methyl orange mo were obtained from r m chemical malaysia polyethersulfones pes purity 99 with density of 1 37 g cm3 was purchased from basf malaysia polyethylene glycol peg mw 6000 g mol purity 99 5 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 wt in h2o were provided by chemicals solutions sdn bhd malaysia n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp mw 99 13 g mol purity 99 9 solvent was purchased from merck malaysia all the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis of pdda functionalized fe3o4 nps a beaker containing 20 ml of deionized water 0 8 g of fecl2 4h2o and 2 16 g of fecl3 6h2o was first prepared next 1 v t of pdda was added into the beaker and the mixture was heated to 80 c subsequently 10ml of nh4oh solution was introduced to the heated mixture for the precipitation of pdda fe3o4 nps the mixture was left to stir for 1 h at 200rpm upon completion the mixture was immediately cooled to room temperature and the pdda fe3o4 nps were harvested by using a permanent magnet the nps were rinsed several times with deionized water and air dried for further use 27 2 3 preparation of prepolymer solution pes polymer solution was prepared by dissolving the desired amount 1 20 wt of pes flakes and peg 1 20 wt in nmp solvent pes was a constituent material for microspheres shell wall while peg served as a pore forming agent the mixture was subjected to heating at 70 c for 1 h under constant stirring speed of 180 rpm next the solution was cooled to room temperature and left to stir overnight to ensure the homogeneity of the solution 2 4 preparation of microsphere forming solution pdda fe3o4 pes solution was prepared by adding pdda fe3o4 nps 1 5 wt into 20 ml of prepolymer solution first the nps were added into 10 ml of prepolymer solution under sonication until a uniform solution was formed next the remaining 10 ml of prepolymer solution was introduced and the mixture was sonicated for another 30 min the two steps addition of prepolymer solution promoted better dispersion of nps within the prepolymer solution 2 5 synthesis of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres the experiment setup to synthesis the pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres is illustrated in fig 1 the microsphere forming solution was agitated throughout the microspheres synthesis process to prevent settling of nps the solution was channelled through a syringe needle size 26 g with the help of a peristaltic pump pumping rate of 0 1 ml min followed by dropwise addition of this polymer solution into a coagulation bath that contained deionized water the microspheres were then formed as precipitates through the phase inversion process lastly the formed microspheres were collected and rinsed thrice with deionized water 2 6 surface coating of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres first a solution containing 0 5 g l of fe3o4 nps in deionized water was prepared the ph of the solution was then adjusted to ph 8 next the surface coating of microspheres was carried out by adding the microspheres into the fe3o4 nps solution under sonication and agitation for 1 h the attachment of fe3o4 nps negative surface charge on the microspheres positive surface charge was achieved through electrostatic interaction the fe3o4 coated microspheres c pdda fe3o4 pes were harvested and rinsed with deionized water the functionalized microspheres were stirred in deionized water overnight to remove the loosely bounded fe3o4 nps lastly the microspheres were oven dried at 37 c for 24 h and stored 2 7 samples characterizations characterizations were carried out on three samples which were naked fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres ftir spectra of the three samples were accessed using an ftir spectrophotometer nicolet is10 performed in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 the thermal stability of the samples was analyzed by using tga thermo scientific sorptometic so1990 at temperature range of 25 to 800 c with temperature ramp rate of 10 c min to determine the specific surface area of the samples brunauer emmet teller bet surface analysis micromerities 3flex employed to calculate the specific surface area with bet theory furthermore the surface charge of the samples was measured through ph drift method sodium chloride solutions 0 1 m with different ph were prepared and the change in ph after addition of microspheres was measured a graph of final ph versus initial ph was plotted to identify the surface charge of sample at different ph the surface morphology and elemental composition of the microspheres were examined by using sem edx hitachi s 3400 n at 15 0 kv accelerating voltage the electron beam will scan on the sample and produce a magnified image for the analysis at different magnifications 2 8 removal of mo using c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres the performance of the microspheres synthesized from different formulation was evaluated through the mo removal efficiency the batch removal of mo was carried out in triplicate with the model system of 30 ml solution composed of 10 ppm of mo and 20 mmol l of h2o2 next 3 g of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were added into the mo solution under vigorous stirring the removal of mo was allowed to proceed for 4 h pure pes microspheres without fe3o4 nps were used as blank control in the mo removal the remaining mo concentration in the solution was determined through uv vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength of 464 nm the dye removal efficiency was calculated by using eq 1 1 efficiency c i c f c i 100 where c i and c f are the initial and final concentration mg l of mo dye in the solution respectively 2 9 reusability study the reusability of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was examined for five consecutive cycles the experiment conditions were same as the previous section upon completion of each cycle the spent microspheres were collected using a permanent magnet and rinsed multiple times with deionized water next the microspheres were air dried before subjected to the successive cycles of mo removal the reusability study of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was compared to pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres to investigate the effect of surface coating on the reusability of microspheres 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pdda polymer on the removal of mo the mo removal efficiencies for pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and fe3o4 pes microspheres are shown in fig 2 it could be observed that the microspheres synthesized with pdda coated fe3o4 nps showed an excellent removal 80 65 as compared to the microspheres synthesized with naked fe3o4 45 97 as a cationic polyelectrolyte pdda polymer provided the microspheres with positive surface charge that is important for the removal of anionic mo dye through electrostatic interaction the positive charge on the pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres would attract the negatively charged mo due to charge difference and realized the removal through adsorption in contrary the removal of mo by fe3o4 pes microspheres was limited due to the weak positive charge of the microspheres the surface charge of fe3o4 nps was generally negative and weak positive charge was only present at ph below 4 5 28 the weak positive charge coupled with the negative surface charge nature of pes polymer had resulted in poor removal of mo 29 hence the comparison between these two microspheres had proven the role of pdda polymer in improving the removal of anionic pollutants in addition fig 3 a and b show the color of mo solution before and after respectively treatment by the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres the results proved that c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were capable to remove anionic water pollutants efficiently 3 2 magnetic performance of fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were dispersed in 20 ml deionized water and an external magnetic field was applied to determine the magnetic responsive behavior of the samples fig 4 a to d show the response of fe3o4 nps and pdda fe3o4 nps towards external magnetic field over the time of 30 min it could be observed that clearer solution was obtained for fe3o4 nps as compared to pdda fe3o4 nps this implied that pdda fe3o4 nps showed slower response towards the magnetic field which could be explained by the introduction of pdda polymer that had improve the stability and dispersion of nps in water this is due to the electrostatic or steric repulsion of the positively charged pdda fe3o4 nps both the nps required longer time to be complete collected by the magnetic field due to their small size that would experience stronger effect of brownian motion in contrast fig 4 e shows the immediate response of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres to the magnetic field as their larger size had minimized the effect of brownian motion as compared to nps in short the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps in the microspheres allowed the recovery of spent microspheres through external magnetic field within seconds 3 3 characterization of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres 3 3 1 ftir fig 5 a b and c represent the ftir spectra of naked fe3o4 pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres respectively as shown in fig 5 a the broad characteristic bands centred at around 3200cm 1 was due to the presence of free or adsorbed water molecules that ascribed to oh bending of hydroxyl group 30 meanwhile the wavelength of 549 cm 1 was attributed to the metal oxygen feo vibration stretching in the crystalline lattice of fe3o4 31 the subsequent splitting up peak at 623 cm 1 was corresponded to the symmetry degeneration on octahedral b sites 32 this indicated that fe3o4 nps were successfully synthesized via the co precipitation method the successful functionalization of pdda polymer on fe3o4 nps was proven by the appearance of new peaks at 1508 cm 1 and 954 cm 1 fig 5 b which were assigned to the cn stretch and ch2 n ch3 2 ch2 vibration in aliphatic pdda respectively 33 34 the presence of pes polymer was confirmed by the significant absorption peaks of benzene ring 1577 cm 1 sulfonyl group 1458 cm 1 1238 cm 1 1150 cm 1 and co bond stretching as shown in fig 5 c 35 furthermore the presence of fe3o4 nps in the microspheres was further supported by the magnetic response behavior of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres it could be observed in fig 6 a that the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were attracted by the ndfeb magnet while the pure pes microspheres in fig 6 b showed no response to the magnet and remained at the bottom of the vial glass hence this proved the strong magnetic properties of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres after the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps subsequently this displayed the potential recovery of the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres through magnetic separation 3 3 2 tga tga curves in fig 7 depict the variation of weight loss for naked fe3o4 pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres at different temperatures basically all the three samples experienced slight weight loss at temperature below 200 c stage i which was due to the loss of residual moisture physically adsorbed species and other contaminants 36 naked fe3o4 only exhibited weight loss 6 45 at stage i and the weight was found to remain constant after 200 c meanwhile the weights of pdda fe3o4 nps and microspheres were further reduced in stage ii that was accounted for the thermal decomposition of pdda polymer that occurred between 200 and 700 c 37 this finding further supported the successful functionalization of fe3o4 nps with pdda polymer after the pdda decomposition occurred at stage ii the weight of pdda fe3o4 nps remained almost constant next c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres encountered additional two stages of weight loss the weight loss at temperature range of approximately 350 to 430 c stage iii revealed the thermal degradation of remaining nmp solvent that trapped inside the microspheres this result was in agreement with the literature which reported the decomposition of nmp solvent at 370 c and above 38 apart from that the weight loss at stage iv was attributed to the decomposition of pes polymer in microspheres according to the literature report the decomposition temperature of pure pes polymer occurred between 450 and 500 c 39 however the temperature was slightly extended to 490 c in this study with the highest weight loss observed at 555 c this indicated that the thermal stability of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres increased with the introduction of pdda fe3o4 nps into the pes polymer matrix 3 3 3 bet the bet results of naked fe3o4 pdda fe3o4 nps pdda fe3o4 pes and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres are shown in table 1 from the results all the four samples possessed significant mesopores 2 50 nm however the samples exhibited different specific surface area where the surface area of fe3o4 nps increased by more than threefold from 34 05 to 110 75 m2 g after the surface functionalization with pdda polymer the pore diameter of pdda fe3o4 nps was slightly smaller compared to naked fe3o4 due to the coverage of pores by pdda in short the surface functionalization of fe3o4 with pdda molecules was crucial as it increased the specific surface area for the reaction to take place in addition of imparting positive charge to the nps for adsorption of mo next the specific surface area of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was found to be significantly decreased after encapsulated in pes polymer however the average pores diameter increased significantly to 35 53 nm the large pore diameter was due to the channels created during the phase inversion process 40 on the other hand the specific surface area of microspheres increased to 13 90 m2 g after surface coating with fe3o4 nps the application of ultrasonication during surface coating process might promote the formation of pores in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres 41 which enhanced the specific surface area at the same time the average pore diameter of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was reduced by half as compared to pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres due to the attachment of fe3o4 nps in the pores after surface coating despite the reduction of pore diameter after the surface coating the pore diameter of microspheres still remained in mesoporous size which was sufficient for the diffusion of mo with average molecular size of 1 2 nm to reach the active sites for the adsorption process 3 4 microspheres surface charge the surface charge of pdda fe3o4 nps and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were evaluated through the ph drift method and the results are shown in fig 8 the dotted line in fig 8 represents the tie line that separates the negative zone above tie line and positive zone below tie line by taking the point of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres at ph 9 8 fifth point as example the initial ph of 9 8 was reduced to a final ph of 6 81 implying that the microspheres possessed positive charge which they attracted and removed the negative hydroxide ions in the solution and reduced the ph from 9 8 to 6 81 conversely c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres with initial ph of 6 third point that rose slightly to ph 6 23 suggested that the microspheres were removing positively charged hydronium ions from the solution in other words the microspheres were slightly negatively charged it should be noted that an overall slightly negative charge usually means that the negative surface charges are slightly predominant however positive charge may still present on the microspheres surface in short the ph drift characterization had proven the presence of positive charges on the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres which further explained the capability of the microspheres in the removal of anionic pollutants such as mo 3 5 sem edx the surface morphology of pure pes microspheres and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was studied by sem and the results are shown in fig 9 from fig 9 a and b the surface of pure pes microspheres was rather smooth with just tiny pores on it the distribution of pores was relatively scattered as compared to c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres finger like cavities and networks of pores were uniformly formed from the interior of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and extended to the surface as illustrated in fig 9 c d g and h this phenomenon was attributed to the exchange of solvent and non solvent across the boundary layer before the complete solidification of pes polymer during the phase inversion process the highly porous structure of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres over pure pes microspheres might be attributed to the application of ultrasonication during surface coating process the high shearing impact exerted by the intense ultrasound can disrupt the microspheres surface and lead to more pores formation 41 on the other hand the formation of pores in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were in all direction due to the high phase separation after addition of peg polymer and pdda fe3o4 nps which altered the chemical compositions and physical characteristics of the microsphere forming solution 42 besides clusters of fe3o4 nps were found to deposit on the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres as depicted in fig 9 e and f hence the surface coating of fe3o4 nps on the microspheres surface was successful and the sonication step during the coating process could promote more pores formation edx analysis was performed to confirm the existence of fe3o4 nps in the microspheres fig 10 a and b illustrate the edx results of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres respectively the weight percentage of iron fe and oxygen o in pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were found to be 1 91 and 32 95 respectively after the surface coating with fe3o4 nps the weight percentage of fe and o in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres increased to 4 52 and 37 70 respectively indicated the successful coating of fe3o4 nps on the surface of the microspheres the edx results proved the successful encapsulation of pdda fe3o4 nps and surface coating of fe3o4 nps to provide the microspheres with adsorption degradation and magnetic responsive ability 3 6 removal of mo using c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres 3 6 1 effect of pes polymer concentration microsphere forming solutions that contained 1 and 5 wt of pes polymer were found not feasible to produce microspheres due to the low viscosity the microspheres were discovered to be lacking of physical integrity and precipitated as flakes as shown in fig 11 a on the other hand microsphere forming solution with 20 wt of pes polymer was also not suitable because of the high viscosity that exceeded the pumping range of the peristaltic pump which impeded the microspheres formation therefore only microspheres synthesized from 10 and 15 wt of pes polymer were found suitable to form rigid spherical microspheres as illustrates in fig 11 b hence only microspheres synthesized from 10 and 15 wt of pes polymer were subjected to the removal of mo and the removal efficiency of both microspheres are depicted in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the removal of mo was almost similar merely 4 increment for the microspheres synthesized from 10 wt 71 75 of mo removal and 15 wt 75 64 of mo removal pes polymer such removal efficiency could be justified by the bet surface area as shown in table 2 microspheres with 15 wt pes polymer possessed just slightly higher specific surface area 18 24 m2 g as compared to microspheres with 10 wt pes polymer 15 56 m2 g however the average pore diameter for both microspheres was very similar to each other therefore there was negligible difference in the removal of mo between microspheres synthesized with 10 and 15 wt pes polymer higher pes polymer concentration is usually not recommended for the synthesis of microspheres 43 besides being difficult to handle due to high viscosity high concentration of pes polymer might also lead to the dissipation of positive surface charge on pdda fe3o4 nps through charge migration 44 this is due to the negative surface charge in nature of pes polymer 29 hence 10 wt was selected as the suitable concentration for the formulation of microspheres 3 6 2 effect of pdda fe3o4 nps concentration fig 13 depicts the mo removal by microspheres synthesized with various loadings of pdda fe3o4 nps from the results the removal of mo increased significantly from 51 51 to 75 64 when the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps in the microspheres was increased from 1 to 2 wt pdda fe3o4 nps played two important roles in the removal of mo to provide positive surface charge to the microspheres for the adsorption process and acted as catalyst in the fenton like reaction to generate oh for the degradation of mo hence the increase in the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps would provide positive effect to the removal of mo next no increment in the removal of mo was observed when the loading of pdda fe3o4 nps was increased from 2 to 4 wt as the only source to provide the microspheres with positive charge the increase in pdda fe3o4 nps loading would enhance the positive charge intensity of the microspheres meanwhile greater amount of fe3o4 nps could be coated on the microspheres during surface coating through opposite charge attraction consequently the overall positive charge intensity of the microspheres was neutralized due to the presence of more fe3o4 nps moreover large amount of fe3o4 nps could lead to excess generation of oh in this situation oh would start to react with h2o2 in the valence bond and recombination of oh occurred 45 ultimately the number of free oh available for degradation of mo was diminished and the removal of mo became stagnant as illustrates in fig 13 it was interesting to observe that the removal of mo was slightly boosted up to 82 40 at pdda fe3o4 nps loading of 5 wt this was probably due to the stronger positive charge caused by high loading of nps at this loading of pdda fe3o4 nps the removal of mo was expected to be dominant by adsorption while the degradation remained however pdda fe3o4 nps of 5 wt would cause difficulty in microspheres synthesis process which required longer synthesis time due to blockage high concentration of core material is not preferable as it increases the viscosity of the internal phase which results in difficult dispersion of core material 46 consequently more agglomerations of microspheres would occur and microspheres with large and irregular size would be formed 47 hence 2 wt of pdda fe3o4 nps was selected as the suitable formulation for microspheres because of the acceptable specific surface area with the highest average pore diameter as compared to the microspheres synthesized from 3 and 4 wt of pdda fe3o4 nps 3 6 3 effect of peg polymer concentration fig 14 shows the mo removal by microspheres synthesized with different concentrations of peg polymer the removal of mo marked a significant 22 73 increment from 49 80 to 72 53 when the concentration of peg was increased from 0 to 5 wt the mo removal remained almost constant at peg concentration above 5 wt the increase in the removal of mo at low concentration of peg could be explained by the formation of pores that led to the increase in specific surface area for mo removal process according to the bet results shown in table 3 it could be observed that the microspheres prepared from 0 and 5 wt of peg were having similar specific surface area around 14 m2 g the factor that contributed to the higher mo removal 72 53 by the microspheres with 5 wt of peg was due to the larger pore diameter of 17 81 nm which provided lesser resistance for the diffusion of h2o2 and mo from table 3 the specific surface area of microspheres show an increasing trend as the peg concentration was increased from 0 to 20 wt as a pore forming agent the hydrophilic peg enhanced the mixing rates between solvent and non solvent which promoted the formation of pores 48 at high concentration of peg greater concentration gradient was present in the system to drive the diffusion of peg across the microspheres shell layer consequently there was an increase in the number of pores that enhanced the specific surface area as shown in fig 14 further increase in the peg concentrations from 5 to 20 wt did not cause significant improvement in the removal of mo such observation could be explained via two perspectives degradation and adsorption in the perspective of mo degradation via fenton like reaction greater specific surface area provided vast active sites for the h2o2 to react with fe3o4 nps which induced greater generation of oh as a result recombination of oh occurred and led to poor degradation of mo 45 on the other hand the removal of mo via adsorption depended heavily on the positive charge intensity of the microspheres hence the fixed loading of pdda fe3o4 nps 2 wt became the limiting factor for the adsorption of mo therefore the increase in the specific surface area caused by peg actually did not improve the adsorption of mo this phenomenon explained the stagnant removal of mo when peg concentration was increased from 5 to 20 wt to conclude peg concentration of 5 wt was selected for the formulation as it enhanced the specific surface area of the microspheres and achieved the highest mo removal efficiency 3 7 reusability study the reusability results on c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres and pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres are presented in table 4 it could be observed that the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres were able to maintain the mo removal efficiency in the range of 75 80 even after five cycles in contrast the mo removal efficiency of pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres decreased 30 over the cycles and eventually dropped from 80 65 first cycle to 51 48 fifth cycle the surface coated fe3o4 in c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres played a vital role as catalyst in the fenton like degradation to remove the mo in the presence of h2o2 the ferric iron on the surface of microspheres reacts with h2o2 and transforms it into a highly oxidizing species oh the oh generated during the fenton like reaction not only could degrade the free mo in the solution but also the adsorbed mo in the microspheres on the other hand the effect of fenton like degradation of mo in pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was limited without the surface coated fe3o4 nps as the h2o2 was needed to diffuse into the pores to compete with mo for pdda fe3o4 nps moreover after each removal cycles the surface of the pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres was saturated with mo molecules which might eventually create higher diffusion resistance to h2o2 in reaching the pdda fe3o4 nps for oh generation therefore the presence of surface coated fe3o4 realized the simultaneous adsorption and degradation of mo which could extend the life span of the microspheres most importantly the microspheres could be reused without regeneration via solvent extraction the mo saturated adsorbents can usually be regenerated through naoh extraction by using 0 1 1 m of naoh solution 49 in addition around 600 ml of naoh solution is required for the regeneration of each gram of catalysts 50 hence the application of highly reusable c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres further eliminated the generation of secondary waste making the removal of mo a truly green process 3 8 comparison study table 5 shows the comparison of different microspheres on the maximum dye removal efficiency and reusability study it can be observed that the dye removal efficiency of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres in this study was comparable to other adsorbents such as chitosan cellulose and grapheme based microspheres on top of that the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres showed a superior reusability unlike other adsorbents c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres require no regeneration process and were able to maintain the removal efficiency up to five cycles of dye removal in contrast other adsorbents required regeneration process such as solvent extraction and heat treatment in addition they also experienced different reductions in removal efficiency after several cycles of dye removal the comparison proved the aptitude of c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres as a green and highly reusable adsorbent for the removal of anionic pollutants 4 conclusion this study revealed the successful synthesis of trifunctional c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres with adsorption degradation and magnetic responsive properties the microspheres were effective in the removal of mo from aqueous solution through simultaneous adsorption and degradation process the incorporation of pdda fe3o4 nps was found not only providing the microspheres with positive surface charge for adsorption but also enhancing the thermal stability of the microspheres besides the highly porous structure of microspheres was an advantage to increase the specific surface area for the removal of mo the formulation parameters such as concentration of pes polymer pdda fe3o4 nps and peg affected significantly the removal of mo the best formulation for the microspheres synthesis was found to be in 10 wt of pes polymer 2 wt of pdda fe3o4 nps and 5 wt of peg polymer the microspheres synthesized from this formulation were capable to achieve 72 53 of mo removal experiment conditions mo 10 mg l h2o2 25 mmol l ph 4 contact time 4 h lastly the surface coated fe3o4 nps allowed the c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres to be highly reusable with a minimum five consecutive cycles without significant drop in the removal efficiency in addition process optimization isotherm and kinetic models study are potential scopes for further study as they are fundamental studies to identify the suitable operating condition and understand the removal or degradation mechanisms of the pollutants by the microspheres as a conclusion the application of trifunctional c pdda fe3o4 pes microspheres in the removal of anionic pollutants is a potential breakthrough technology for water remediation which warrants more extensive studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

carlos university school of experimental sciences and technology mostoles madrid madrid spain corresponding author refinery wastewater rww treatment is outdated since new wastewater management and reuse challenges require more environmental friendly and cheap alternatives conventional biological treatments focused on activated sludge are highly energy intensive and resource dissipating processes however anaerobic treatments are an excellent alternative to reduce costs derived from aeration and carbon footprint this work proposes a novel strategy for the treatment of rww involving a photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr with a mixed culture of purple phototrophic bacteria ppb ppb upcycles the organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus in an assimilative way leading to a much higher biomass yield and nutrient removal than aerobic cultures the enriched ppb culture was generated from the rww as the sole substrate without specific ppb inoculation the rww exempted from sufficient nutrients was successfully treated with additional ammonium and phosphates provided by domestic wastewater dww preliminary batch tests determined the best dww rww volumetric mixing ratio at

treatment plant y x s apparent biomass yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction proper industrial wastewater management is enforced in most developed countries due to its environmentally hazardous nature 1 traditional wastewater treatment facilities are high energy demanding inefficient and solely focused on depuration because of this industries are slowly shifting towards more sustainable and less energy intensive alternatives 2 nevertheless it has long since most industries relied on conventional old fashioned technologies such as activated sludge this is the case for instance of the refinery and petrochemistry industries conventional refinery wastewater rww treatment plants are based on the removal of high organic fractions and partially recovering non soluble oils by several physicochemical units consisting of a dissolved air flotation daf process and gravity american petroleum institute api oil water separators then the rww flows to aerobic activated sludge processes with efficiencies in organics removal above 90 and ternary treatments that enable the production of reusable water for the oil petroleum plant the sludge from primary and secondary treatments is usually managed by external disposal due to its hazardous substances composition 3 4 however the treatment of rww through conventional activated sludge has several limitations firstly the activated sludge is an energy intensive process due to its need for aeration the average energetic demand of this process is 1 02 kwh m3 as compared to the 0 43 kwh m3 reported for anaerobic biological processes 5 thus anaerobic technologies are considered potential alternatives for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions 2 6 however anaerobic microorganisms in general cannot efficiently treat effluents with low organic concentrations a minimum of 750 mgcod l is recommended 7 8 purple phototrophic bacteria ppb are a kind of phototrophic facultative microorganisms gaining significant interest in the last years as a feasible alternative to conventional technologies ppb have shown promising results high carbon elimination up to over 90 of chemical oxygen demand cod for the treatment of different industrial wastewaters such as rubber sheet production 9 pharmaceutical 10 saline 11 sugar refinery 12 agro industrial 13 and domestic wastewaters in the latter case ammonium and phosphates were also removed up to 92 2 and 97 5 respectively reaching values below the regulated discharge limits of nutrients and cod 14 16 to the authors knowledge only a few works can be found in the literature concerning the treatment of refinery wastewater those works evidenced the growth and activity of ppb in the treatment of oil refinery wastewater however they studied the treatment of an oil refinery wastewater before the primary treatment under batch mode operation and using a culture enriched in a mixture of pseudomonas a genus of aerobic bacteria and rhodopseudomonas a genus of ppb 17 another work also demonstrated the bioremediation of oil polluted wastewater with pure cultures of rhodopseudomonas sp on seawater 18 according to previous works ppb could replace conventional aerobic biological treatments 19 moreover as other phototrophic microorganisms cyanobacteria and microalgae ppb upcycles the organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus in an assimilative way leading to a much higher biomass yield than aerobic cultures nearly 1 mgcodbiomass mgcodsubstrate compared to 0 5 mgcodbiomass mgcodsubstrate as well as a faster and higher nutrient assimilation rate 20 moreover these phototrophic facultative microorganisms do not require a high organic loading and have shown a higher resistance to inhibition caused by potentially toxic compounds in the rww than conventional aerobic and anaerobic technologies even at peak concentrations 21 however the rww is limited by the low nutrient content in the wastewater and ammonia nitrogen and phosphates are needed for the assimilative growth based microorganisms like ppb requiring higher amounts than the non photosynthetic microorganisms meanwhile the addition of synthetic compounds to the medium is deprecated since wastewater treatment techniques tend to reduce chemicals spent under the circular economy paradigm 22 a novel way of solving this issue is using a co substrate as domestic wastewater dww to provide the nutrients for the rww treatment as well as the treatment of the two effluents taking into account the well demonstrated ability of ppb to treat dww a synergy between both substrates may be expected this work proposes the co treatment of rww and dww in a photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr at lab scale producing high quality water for an oil refinery plant the start up of the bioreactor was performed using the refinery wastewater as the only substrate without pre inoculation the study of the specific loading rate on the performance of the co treatment of rww and dww followed a rational approach varying the hydraulic and the solid retention times the development of the microbial communities during the start up and the subsequent co treatment of the rww was also studied the outcomes of this work will serve as a basis to further scale up the process in an industrial scene 2 materials and methods 2 1 refinery and domestic wastewaters the rww was obtained from a refinery and petrochemistry complex in spain samples were taken directly from the daf unit before the biological treatment and preserved at 4 c the dww was obtained after primary treatment from the estiviel wastewater treatment plant wwtp in toledo spain these samples were also taken before the biological treatment and preserved at 4 c two different wastewater samples from effluents of rww and dww were used in this work due to the long operation time of the experimental work and the insufficient wastewater volume taken in the first collection campaign table 1 shows the physicochemical characterization of the two wastewater samples of both effluents the characterization results were in the typical range of rww and dww characterization data 3 4 23 as expected a higher nutrients content of nh4 and po4 3 was detected in the dww however a relevant decrease of scod and nh4 concentrations was noted in the second sample of dww these alterations can take place in the characterization parameters of real effluents since both refinery and domestic wastewaters are subject to variations over the time by operational production periods or seasonal fluctuations respectively 2 2 batch tests the dww is proposed as a feedstock to provide nutrients to allow the ppb growth on the rww batch tests were performed to find the best mixing ratio of the two rww and dww wastewaters regarding wastewater biodegradability and biomass growth five mixing ratios of dww rww were tested 0 100 25 75 50 50 75 25 and 100 0 three control experiments were carried out by using only rww 0 100 dww 100 0 or ultrapure miliq water upw in all the control experiments the medium was supplemented with acetic acid as a biodegradable carbon source and macro micronutrients as previously described in literature for optimal growth of the purple phototrophic culture further details in the supplementary information si 1 table s1 each control experiment was used as a reference for ppb growth under each of the studied water matrices rww dww and upw to assess the effect of the water matrix on the ppb growth the tests were performed in 160 ml glass serum bottles inoculated with a ppb biomass previously enriched in rww during the start up of the photoanaerobic mbr described below the bottles were filled to a working volume of 100 ml closed with rubber caps and sealed with aluminum crimps the headspace was flushed with argon for 10 min to assure an anaerobic and inert atmosphere since other gases like nitrogen or carbon dioxide could be fixed as additional nitrogen and carbon sources by ppb in this way all the biological activity can be related to the water phase composition the ph naturally evolved during the experiment bottles remained at 25 c in a temperature controlled incubator shaker for 3 d and illumination was provided by three 150 w infrared lamps philips br125 ir spain to an average effective near infrared nir radiance around 20 w m2 the bottles were covered with a vis uv filter to prevent the growth of other photosynthetic organisms nd 1 2299 transformation tubes banstead uk sampling was performed at the beginning and the end of each experiment to measure total cod tcod soluble cod scod ammonium orthophosphates vss tss and optical density od scod ammonium orthophosphates and od were also monitored three times a day during the experiments the duration of the experiments lasted 71 h until the biomass growth stopped 2 3 continuous operation of photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr the co treatment of rww and dww was performed in continuous mode in the panmbr previously described by de las heras et al 24 further details and experimental set up of the panmbr can be found in the supplementary information si 2 and fig s1 initially the panmbr was started up with only the rww after that it was operated following several stages at different specific loading rates slr table 2 summarizes the duration operation conditions and average concentration of the inlet wastewater in terms of scod nh4 and po4 3 of each stage the panmbr reactor was maintained at rt 25 7 0 5 c and the feedstocks at 4 c to prevent substrate degradation there was no ph control since it was not expected to reach inhibitory values ph 9 25 the presence of ppb on the panmbr biomass was checked daily by vis nir absorbance spectra 400 950 nm the macroscopic parameters such as scod tcod nh4 po4 3 tss and vss were daily measured to check the system s performance microbiological analysis was performed to analyze the microbial community through 16s rrna amplification described below of dna extracted from the biomass of the panmbr this analysis was performed for single samples of selected operational days 0 1 5 7 11 13 19 and 21 of the start up phase and 25 60 96 116 and 144 of the continuous co treatment of rww and dww the analysis of the inoculum used when starting the co treatment was also performed 2 3 1 start up with rww the start up of the continuous treatment was performed for 21 days feeding the rww as the sole substrate without ppb pre inoculation this stage served to develop an enriched ppb culture acclimatized to the rww the biomass developed after this stage was initially used as inoculum for the batch tests and thereafter for the continuous co treatment of rww and dww prior to the continuous treatment the inoculum was stored at 4 c initial operational conditions of the start up stage were selected following the recommendation of a previous work where the ppb enrichment was developed in a similar experimental setup treating dww 14 2 3 2 co treatment of the rww and dww the continuous co treatment of rww and dww was focused on increasing the slr this fact was performed by modification of the hydraulic and solid retention times hrt and srt to achieve a stable performance of the panmbr that assure values of cod nh4 and po4 3 below the legal discharge limits the rww dww mixing ratio was selected according to the results obtained from the batch tests table 2 shows the operating conditions of the panmbr including the inlet cod nh4 and po4 3 concentrations during the first acclimatization phase stage i the organic loading rate olr was initially varied between 77 and 145 mg cod l 1 d 1 with hrts in the range of 75 40 h initially the biomass was not purged so the srt was not controlled for 40 d to achieve a stable biomass concentration in the bioreactor after this acclimation period the slr was increased following two different strategies firstly the slr was increased from stages ii to vi by decreasing the hrt from 60 to 30 h setting the srt at 30 d by purging the biomass then from stages vii to ix the hrt was set at 25 h and the srt was gradually decreased from 25 to 16 d to assess the limitation of the treatment when increasing the amount of purged biomass finally the hrt and srt were set to 25 h and 20 d to stabilize the treatment at the maximum slr in stage x 2 4 analytical methods the optical density od was measured at 665 nm with a jasco v 630 uv vis madrid spain spectrophotometer along with vis nir absorbance spectra 450 950 nm to check the typical peaks of carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll of ppb od was also directly related to the vss by linear calibration od vss calibration was performed for every trial to avoid differences in biomass composition that might affect the od vss ratio the ph was analyzed with a crison glp 22 phmeter barcelona spain tcod scod nh4 po4 3 vss and tss were measured according to apha awwa wef standard methods 26 scod nh4 po4 3 were measured after filtration of the mixed liquor sample of the bioreactor with 0 45 μm glass fiber syringe filters the inlet wastewaters and effluent after treatment samples was also analyzed by gc ms gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using a stalbiwax ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm column to identify potential toxic compounds and byproducts the light intensity was measured at the surface of the bottles and the panmbr with a stellarnet blue wave spectrometer tampa fl usa with a fiber optic cable and a cosine receptor with a 10 aperture biomass samples for dna extraction of the panmbr reactor were concentrated by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min dna extraction prior to microbiological analysis was made through higherpurity bacterial genomic dna isolation kit by canvax biotech córdoba spain the extracted dna samples were sent to fisabio sequencing and bioinformatics valencia spain for 16 s rrna gene amplificon sequencing following the 16s rdna gene metagenomic sequencing library preparation illumina protocol cod 15 044 223 rev a further details of the microbiological analysis method are summarized in supplementary information si 3 2 5 data handling and statistical treatment apparent biomass yield y x s in gvss gcod was calculated as the ratio between the total biomass growth measured as vss and the total cod consumed anova was performed to check possible differences among the means of the yx s values all provided errors corresponded to the 95 confidence intervals slr was calculated as the ratio between olr and the biomass concentration in the liquor mixture expressed in terms of cod specific consumption rate scr was calculated as the ratio between consumed cod per day and the biomass concentration in the liquor mixture expressed in terms of cod regarding the analysis of the microbiological communities in the phototrophic biomass during the bioreactor operation taxonomic data obtained from 16 s rrna gene amplificon sequencing were analyzed at the genus level genera with relative abundances below 1 in all the samples were gathered in the same group as others genera composition of microbial communities for biomass of different periods of the continuous operation of panmbr were compared using the principal component analysis pca method two principal components pc1 and pc2 were used considering results within 50 of the variance 27 genera composition of those samples was also compared with environmental and response variables of the process cod nh4 and po4 3 consumptions and slr by redundancy analysis rda the genera data used for both analyses was compared by relative abundance pca and rda were performed in rstudio version 2021 09 0 with the functions prcomp and rda of the vegan package version 2 5 7 28 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of volumetric rww and dww ratio the dww was used to provide and compensate for the scarce nutrients of the rww fig 1 shows the biomass yields of the batch experiments performed at different mixtures of dww and rww including the initial 100cod p n ratio of each experiment remaining concentrations of scod nh4 and po4 3 at the end of the batch tests after 71 h can be found in supplementary information si 4 table s2 there was a significant increase in the biomass yield when the original cod n p ratio of the rww mixture dww rww of 0 100 raised from 100 3 2 0 2 to 100 6 7 0 5 mixture dww rww of 25 75 statistical significance of this increase was determined by analysis of variance anova with a p value 0 05 however no significant differences were observed in the batch tests performed with different dww rww ratios from 25 75 to 100 0 only the dww with p value of anova 0 05 likewise the control experiments using only rww dww and upw with additional carbon and nutrient sources for the ppb growth showed similar values these results evidenced that the nutrient scarcity of the rww as the sole substrate is responsible for the lower biomass yield on the other hand the biomass yields obtained near 1 in terms of cod when dww was added to rww are typical of non inhibited ppb cultures 19 therefore according to the biomass yield the dww rww ratio of 25 75 is enough for the ppb culture development the addition of the dww as co substrate to the rww also allowed a higher reduction of the scod from the dww rww of 25 75 keeping quite similar when the dww rww was increased to 50 50 and 75 25 the dww rww ratios above 25 75 up to 100 0 showed final scod values well below discharge limit si 4 table s2 125 mgtcod l according to the current eu legislation 29 whereas the experiment with only the rww achieved a closer value 123 9 mg l nevertheless note that this tcod discharge limit is referred to final effluents after the biomass water separation and scod in this work is representative of the soluble fraction of cod in the liquid phase after separation with 0 45 μm syringe filters regarding the nh4 and po4 3 nutrients all experiments with a dww rww ratio above 25 75 showed both nh4 and po4 3 values far above the discharge limits 12 9 and 3 1 mg l respectively see supplementary information si 4 table s2 however it is noteworthy to mention that the higher dww rww ratio from 50 50 to 100 0 the more excess nutrients in the initial feedstock initial 100cod n p ratios far above the reported average consumption for the ppb growth 100 5 1 19 consequently microorganisms cannot uptake the nutrients excess upon carbon source depletion there was little difference in the culture performance between 25 75 and 100 0 mix ratios so the 25 75 mix ratio was selected as the best one since the nh4 and po4 3 final values were closer and below the discharge limits we also argued that some phosphorus fed from dww must be ensured to properly develop and maintain the ppb mixed culture although this study is based on the influence of the volumetric rww dww ratio it is important to point out that the organic and nutrients loadings of rww and dww can change over time and vary widely depending on their origin different oil refinery plants and domestic wastewaters because of this volumetric ratio could change depending on rww and dww compositions to aim for a specific 100cod n p ratio in this work a 100cod n p ratio of 100 6 5 0 5 dww rww of 25 75 obtained the best results in terms of biomass yield and cod and nutrients removal 3 2 continuous co treatment of rww and dww fig 2 shows the monitoring of the main variables scod nh4 po4 3 and solid concentrations as well as the slr of the photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr during the start up using only the rww as the sole substrate and the following co treatment of rww and dww through different slr likewise the microbial community dynamics of the reactor was studied along the different operative stages and the performance of the biological process was assessed 3 2 1 start up of photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor as shown in fig 2 the cod consumption was stabilized on day 14 with an average of 139 mg l representing 44 of the initial soluble cod regarding nutrients nh4 was fully consumed after 10 d while the po4 3 remained below 0 15 mg l from the beginning as its concentration in the raw rww was at a trace level the low p concentration hindered the cod assimilation as cod consumptions above 80 are typically achieved 19 the concentration of vss was stabilized at day 18 with an average concentration of 312 mg l evidencing a stable microbial community despite the scarcity of po4 3 vis nir absorbance spectra of mixed culture samples taken from the photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor showed typical peaks of carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll from day 4 to the end of the start up stage see vis nir absorbance spectra in supplementary information si 5 fig s2 confirming the presence of ppb in the mixed culture 30 indeed the mixed culture acquired a characteristic reddish brown colour of ppb cultures within the first week the microbial community composition was also studied at selected samples taken on days 0 1 5 7 11 13 19 and 21 relative abundance of the different taxa at the genus level during the start up phase is shown in the supplementary information si 5 fig s3 results on day 0 displayed a small community of ppb in the raw rww mainly photoorganoheterophs thus acting as the initial seed for the subsequent ppb enrichment among the numerous ppb taxa the most relevant genera or families for non identified genera found in raw rww correspond to rhodobacter sp thiobaca sp rhodoferax sp thiophaeococcus sp comamonadaceae gen xantobacteraceae gen bradyrhizobium sp and rhodopseudomonas sp with a notable prevalence of the last three the ppb presence in the rww may be due to the sunlight exposure of the raw rww in certain phases before the biological treatment the combined relative abundance of these ppb genera families went from ca 9 on day 0 to 45 on day 21 which unequivocally indicates the ppb enrichment in the mixed culture at the end of the start up phase rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp were the most representative genera despite most of the mentioned microorganisms found in oil polluted environments rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp seem to have a better adaptation in the refinery wastewater matrix these results agree with previous studies that use these two genera in oil polluted wastewater bioremediation for their enhanced oil degrading capability 31 34 most of the other microorganisms found in the samples are typical in wastewater due to their hydrolytic and fermentative nature strict aerobic bacteria such as sphingomonas sp quickly decayed due to the lack of oxygen in the culture medium interestingly acidovorax sp shows a significant and continuous presence during the start up stage this genus has been reported as a prominent actor in oil polluted wastewater 35 and rww 36 it is known for its capability to degrade polymers and complex molecules 37 39 therefore the competition between acidovorax sp and ppb species is not undesired since both are facultative bacteria capable of degrading complex hydrocarbons in addition anaerobic fermentative bacteria like proteinoclasticum sp youngiibacter sp and acetobacterium sp were also found especially during the first days of the experiment according to the cod and ammonium removal data fig 2 there is a close relationship between their increase and the rise of most representative genera of ppb suggesting that these microorganisms lead to the consumption of ammonium and organic matter however the ppb growth is hindered by phosphorus scarcity so higher enrichment and removal percentages might even be expected without this limitation as has been previously demonstrated with other types of wastewaters 40 3 2 2 continuous co treatment of rww and dww a performance of panmbr during the first stage of the continuous co treatment the panmbr was operated to increase the concentration of vss using the inoculum generated during the previous start up phase the srt was not controlled for 40 d in this stage whereas the hrt varied from 75 h to 40 h under these operation conditions the vss increased up to 700 mg l and the slr varied from 1 3 to ca 0 11 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d at the end of this stage i the panmbr achieved a stable cod 60 70 and nh4 and po4 3 removals ca 40 once the bioreactor was stabilized the increase of the slr from 0 11 0 02 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d at stage ii to 0 21 0 07 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d at stage vi by the reduction of the hrt from 60 to 30 h at constant srt 30 d allowed to remain scod and nh4 and po4 3 under the discharge limits in this sequence of stages ii vi a sudden drop of the nutrients and scod in the inlet stream was observed stage iii likely due to the renewal of rww and dww batches used as feedstock for the bioreactor this fact derived in a significant vss drop to ca 400 mg l at the end of stage vi despite the increase of the olr the increase of the slr from 0 24 0 02 to 0 50 0 08 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d during the stages vii to ix keeping constant the hrt at 25 h and reducing srt from 30 to 16 d produced a loss of vss with a consequent decrease of the bioreactor performance leading to values of scod in the outlet stream above the discharge limits stage ix thus a clear destabilization of the bioreactor was evident with the increase of the slr finally during stage x the system could be stabilized by increasing the srt to 20 d maintaining the concentration of vss around 170 mg l and a moderate performance in terms of scod and nutrients removals maximum cod removal was 75 of the initial scod at stage vii which is in the average range reported for an urban wastewater treatment 19 at operation conditions of stage vii 25 h hrt and 25 d srt slr of 0 24 0 02 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d concentrations of cod nh4 and po4 3 were consistently below the regulated discharge limits 125 mg l 12 9 mg l and 3 1 mg l respectively b nature of organic pollutants the nature of the organic compounds involved in the cod consumption was also studied for a better understanding of the performance of panmbr soluble organic compounds were detected by gc ms ms in the inlet and outlet streams for samples taken at the end of stage x see supplementary information si 5 fig s4 typical short chain carboxylic acids of domestic wastewater such as acetic acid were identified in the influent stream additionally other characteristic compounds of refinery wastewaters like long chain carboxylic acid derivatives undecanoates and dodecanoates alcohols butanediol aromatics pyrroles and nitrogen containing compounds amines and amides were also identified 41 interestingly the majority of the identified compounds formamide n n dimethyl acetic acid 1 3 butanediol undecanoic acid methyl ester cyclohexanamine n cyclohexyl 2 pirrolidinone 1 methyl and 7 dodecanoic acid methyl ester were removed during the treatment due to the high metabolic versatility of the ppb the fate of these compounds seems to be related to microbial assimilation and degradation however a soluble recalcitrant compound methoxy phenyl oxime codified as 8 remained in the outlet effluent after the treatment which was likely affecting the decrease of the cod removal the presence of this pollutant was confirmed by the urban wastewater treatment plant that provided the dww as a recurrent pollutant used as a fungicide in nearby croplands in any case it is noteworthy that the mixed culture of the panmbr could deal with the aromatics and amines compounds that represent a potential hazard for conventional biological treatments 21 microbial degradation pathways are discussed more insightfully when describing the microbial communities dynamics below c specific loading rate assessment in order to assess the maximum capacity of the photoanaerobic treatment the specific loading rate slr was compared to the specific consumption rate scr both in terms of the inlet and consumed cod fig 3 for slr values below ca 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d there was a clear positive and stable linear trend between scr and slr note that this value is comparable to the typical slr of conventional activated sludge treatments 23 for example the wwtp of a medium size refinery in portugal based on activated sludge has a slr of 0 35 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d 4 additionally ten case scenarios from different domestic wwtp based on activated sludge systems in europe showed slr values between 0 1 and 0 25 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d 42 on the other hand the process became unstable for slr above ca 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d evidencing that the biomass reached maximum values of the specific assimilation rate of the organic carbon this fact is consistent with the lower consumption of cod and nutrients started at stage viii and confirmed at stage ix with slr values of 0 36 0 03 and 0 5 0 08 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d respectively d analysis of dynamic microbiological populations fig 4 displays the results of the microbiological analysis corresponding to the samples of the beginning of the continuous phase inoculum the end of the acclimatization phase stage i day 25 and relevant operation periods stages iii vii viii and x days 60 96 116 and 144 respectively the most abundant ppb genera at the beginning of the continuous co treatment of rww and dww were rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp which is consistent with the final microbial characterization of the inoculum from the previous start up phase see supplementary information si 5 fig s3 the relative abundance of ppb genera during the different stages of the co treatment ranged from 30 to 60 evidencing an enriched ppb mixed culture during the whole operation treatment likewise rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp seemed to be the best adapted genera for treating the rww dww mixture for the different operational conditions other works involving the treatment of domestic and agro industrial wastewaters also showed these genera as predominant in ppb enriched cultures 13 14 moreover it was also observed that rhodobacter sp generally prevailed over rhodopseudomonas sp in this study which has also been previously pointed out in other works 43 44 this fact responds to the low olr of the treatment that favors a k strategist like rhodobacter sp instead of a r strategist like rhodopseudomonas sp that is able to grow better at higher olrs 45 rhodocista sp and rhodoferax sp also proliferated among other ppb genera during the acclimation stage i that was operated under longer srt and hrt which promotes slowly growing bacteria like those ppb genera 43 46 47 other microorganisms that take advantage of these conditions were sulfate reducing bacteria such as arcobacter sp which also have low growth rates 48 additionally fermentative bacteria commonly found in anaerobic wastewater treatments such as acetobacterium sp lentimicrobium sp paludibacter sp and bacteria from the family rikenellaceae were also identified in the microbial community lentimicrobium sp were found at stages iii and viii corresponding to lower values of the ppb abundance although it is known for its low growth rates 49 lentimicrobium sp has been reported as a majoritarian taxon during the anaerobic digestion with a much higher olr 1000 mgcod l d than the values used in this work 50 thus the lentimicrobium sp presence is probably more related to ppb decay on the other hand the highest relative abundance of ppb was observed at stage vii corresponding to the beginning of the slr rise average slr of 0 24 0 02 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d the system achieved the highest cod consumption in this stage thus as in the start up phase the ppb seems to be the primary consumers of organic matter however the abundance of ppb was strongly reduced at the following stage viii when the slr was increased favoring the appearance of other microorganisms like the abovementioned lentimicrobium sp and strict aerobes like acinetobacter this stage viii also included extended maintenance and cleaning activities in which the mbr was exposed to air this fact may explain the presence of these microorganisms even more members of the patescibacteria class candidatus falkowbacteria sp and kryptoniales gen proliferated in these periods revealing an association between them and lentimicrobium sp acidovorax sp also appeared in high proportion but its proliferation only increased during the last stabilization phase contrasting with the start up phase acidovorax sp has a fast growth rate which benefits from high olr values like those obtained at stage x 51 52 in terms of the compounds found in the inlet wastewater stream and the presence of the analyzed microorganisms some links can be established formamide a known protein denaturing agent can be degraded to formic acid and ammonium by the action of enzymes as amidases 53 both formic acid and ammonium are beneficial chemicals for ppb metabolism so formamide degradation is likely to occur regarding n cyclohexyl cyclohexanamine there are no reports of microbial degradation of this compound to the authors knowledge nevertheless several ppb species 54 and most sulfur reducing bacteria 55 can assimilate cyclic compounds such as benzene and cyclohexane the same is valid for 1 methyl 2 pyrrolydine however another cyclic compound such as methoxy phenyl oxime seems to be resistant to the metabolic activity of the mixed ppb culture although there is no information about its specific toxicity mechanism this chemical has been reported as an antibacterial agent 58 additionally other oximes were found as inhibitors of bacterial metabolism 56 57 thus its potentially toxic nature may explain why the culture cannot degrade it pca results shown in fig 5 a combined microorganisms abundance tendencies of biomass samples in two principal components strongly influenced by the variance of the data of the most abundant ppb genera members of the phylum patescibacteria and fermentative bacteria principal component 1 pc1 is mainly swayed by the presence of most ppb genera rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp and acidovorax sp on the other hand principal component 2 pc2 is influenced by gracilibacteria acidovorax sp and fermentative bacteria such as acetobacterium sp and lentimicrobium sp the points shown in fig 5 a correspond to the samples of the study of microbial community dynamics the initial acclimatization stage i significantly affected the community structure of the initial inoculum an antagonism between ppb and acidovorax sp also appeared suggesting acidovorax sp as a potential opportunistic competitor of ppb however since this observation is only based on statistical correlation the relationship should be carefully addressed pca analysis also confirms that the destabilization of the system stage ix is related to the ppb community s decay the relationship between lentimicrobium sp and candidatus falkowbacteria sp and kryptoniales sp is also evident and opposed to the presence of gracilibacteria this finding may suggest a competitive behaviour between different patescibacteria which is not unlikely due to their common parasitic nature the rda results in fig 5 b combined microorganisms abundance tendencies of the biomass and response variables of the panmbr in two axes rda1 is mainly related to scod and phosphate consumptions as well as the slr x axis and rda2 to the ammonium consumption y axis these results show a strong relationship between cod consumption and the presence of rhodobacter sp strongly supporting the assumption that ppb are the primary microorganisms responsible for the cod consumption however the increase of the slr seems to harm this genus probably due to a better adaptation of rhodopseudomonas sp to higher organic loadings and the increase of acidovorax sp the ammonium consumption seems to be related to lentimicrobium sp and their associated parasites suggesting that these microorganisms could be the primary ammonium consumers in the absence of ppb however these results should be addressed carefully as rda 2 only explains 16 6 of the variance 58 3 3 implications and prospects of the photoanaerobic treatment for rww the specific loading rate is a specific and critical parameter of each type of wastewater treatment which is tightly related to the specific consumption rate and biodegradability of the wastewater in this sense operational parameters of the photoanaerobic treatment in this work have been compared with ppb based treatments for different wastewaters and conventional activated sludge as the current biological process for refinery wastewater treatment generally ppb can cope with low srt 1 3 d when the wastewater is easily biodegradable 19 43 the continuous treatment of dww by ppb accomplished removal yields over 90 for both cod and nutrients using a similar panmbr under hrts between 11 and 22 h and srts between 2 and 3 d 14 in that study the specific loading and consumption rates remained very closely 1 22 2 78 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d and 1 18 2 67 mgcodconsumed mgcodbiomass d respectively due to the highly biodegradable nature of dww which enhances the performance of the process by an increased phototrophic biomass yield 19 however low biodegradable wastewaters require higher srts to ensure a stable active biomass concentration for example the treatment of a high saline alimentary industry wastewater achieved 80 of scod removal with a hrt of 48 h and srt of 30 d 59 the optimal specific loading rate for this wastewater was around 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d which is quite similar the value determined in this work for the rww the specific consumption rate of high saline alimentary wastewater was near 0 24 mgcodconsumed mgcodbiomass d revealing that this effluent is slightly more biodegradable than the rww by ppb but way less than the dww regarding the conventional activated sludge the treatment of rww requires hrts of 24 48 h and srts of 30 40 d 60 61 with specific loading and consumption rates of 0 56 0 71 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d and 0 42 0 60 mgcodconsumed mgcodbiomass d thereby even far from the typical values for the photoanaerobic treatment the final operational parameters of this work stage x 25 h hrt 20 d srt slr of 0 49 0 06 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d can compete with the conventional technology of activated sludge for the treatment of rww with the benefit of reducing co2 emissions additionally the water stream collected in the final operational conditions complied with regulated concentration limits of cod ammonium and phosphates moreover the separation of the suspended solids by the ultrafiltration type membrane implemented in the photoanaerobic reactor allows fulfilling parameters regulated for reclaimed water such as pathogens and specific macroscopic parameters 62 63 the outlet stream falls into the highest quality category of residential use 1 intestinal nematode egg l 0 cfu of e coli l 2 ntu 100 ufc of legionella sp l 10 mg l of tss and 10 mgbod5 l characterization results of inlet and outlet streams of panmbr are summarized in supplementary information si 5 table s3 water reuse has an undeniable positive impact on every industry but usually comes with a high cost in the form of expensive tertiary treatments there is no need for such tertiary treatment with the proposed technology since a high quality effluent is achieved at the biomass water separation stage reclaimed water of this quality may be used as process water including boiling and refrigeration activities for any refinery unit additionally it can be used for non process related issues such as cleaning activities irrigation of green areas and fire fighting systems depending on the regulations of each country besides the already commented economic benefits reclaimed wastewater obtained in this way means a vast environmental improvement by saving water and avoiding the by products obtained when using conventional tertiary treatments such as tetrachloromethanes coming from water chlorination 64 regarding prospects the present work is key in the potential implementation of the proposed strategy at pilot or full scale apart from the high quality final effluent the treatment showed the maximum cod and nutrient elimination with a biomass concentration near 300 mg l additionally even with low vss concentrations the system remained highly stable until the final periods and performed accordingly with discharge regulations interestingly the treatment of a synthetic wastewater with a similar reactor setup sustained a proper treatment with a similar vss concentration 40 thereby this behaviour is not inherent to the mixture of rww and dww and promising results can be expected for other kinds of wastewaters finally although rww has been treated before with ppb 17 the present work answers different questions the continuous mode was assessed including the influence of slr which provides an early approach for the scaling up of the technology the effluent treated in this work is the wastewater produced after primary treatment so the treatment does not need to deal with the excess oils solids and other immiscible materials the mixed ppb culture developed in this work from the own rww is much more diverse and realistic making the process more feasible for potential implementation in summary the present work successfully stretched the gap between the use of ppb to treat rww and its implementation at an industrial scale 4 conclusions the rww can be successfully treated with ppb based cultures in a photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor however due to the low nutrient content of rww the process can be improved by adding a 25 volume of dww as an additional nitrogen and phosphorus source reaching a cod n p ratio of 100 6 5 0 5 the mixed culture enriched in ppb for this treatment can be obtained from the rww without previous inoculation regarding the operational performance of the process this work reports an optimum specific loading rate of 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d to avoid the system destabilization within those conditions rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp were the most abundant bacteria and they seem responsible for the highest eliminations of carbon and nutrients the effluent obtained under such conditions complies with discharging regulations and falls under the maximum quality grade for its reuse as process water or domestic uses this could make oil refinery industries and others benefit since the proposed technology can achieve reclaimed water without a tertiary treatment

carlos university school of experimental sciences and technology mostoles madrid madrid spain corresponding author refinery wastewater rww treatment is outdated since new wastewater management and reuse challenges require more environmental friendly and cheap alternatives conventional biological treatments focused on activated sludge are highly energy intensive and resource dissipating processes however anaerobic treatments are an excellent alternative to reduce costs derived from aeration and carbon footprint this work proposes a novel strategy for the treatment of rww involving a photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr with a mixed culture of purple phototrophic bacteria ppb ppb upcycles the organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus in an assimilative way leading to a much higher biomass yield and nutrient removal than aerobic cultures the enriched ppb culture was generated from the rww as the sole substrate without specific ppb inoculation the rww exempted from sufficient nutrients was successfully treated with additional ammonium and phosphates provided by domestic wastewater dww preliminary batch tests determined the best dww rww volumetric mixing ratio at

treatment plant y x s apparent biomass yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction proper industrial wastewater management is enforced in most developed countries due to its environmentally hazardous nature 1 traditional wastewater treatment facilities are high energy demanding inefficient and solely focused on depuration because of this industries are slowly shifting towards more sustainable and less energy intensive alternatives 2 nevertheless it has long since most industries relied on conventional old fashioned technologies such as activated sludge this is the case for instance of the refinery and petrochemistry industries conventional refinery wastewater rww treatment plants are based on the removal of high organic fractions and partially recovering non soluble oils by several physicochemical units consisting of a dissolved air flotation daf process and gravity american petroleum institute api oil water separators then the rww flows to aerobic activated sludge processes with efficiencies in organics removal above 90 and ternary treatments that enable the production of reusable water for the oil petroleum plant the sludge from primary and secondary treatments is usually managed by external disposal due to its hazardous substances composition 3 4 however the treatment of rww through conventional activated sludge has several limitations firstly the activated sludge is an energy intensive process due to its need for aeration the average energetic demand of this process is 1 02 kwh m3 as compared to the 0 43 kwh m3 reported for anaerobic biological processes 5 thus anaerobic technologies are considered potential alternatives for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions 2 6 however anaerobic microorganisms in general cannot efficiently treat effluents with low organic concentrations a minimum of 750 mgcod l is recommended 7 8 purple phototrophic bacteria ppb are a kind of phototrophic facultative microorganisms gaining significant interest in the last years as a feasible alternative to conventional technologies ppb have shown promising results high carbon elimination up to over 90 of chemical oxygen demand cod for the treatment of different industrial wastewaters such as rubber sheet production 9 pharmaceutical 10 saline 11 sugar refinery 12 agro industrial 13 and domestic wastewaters in the latter case ammonium and phosphates were also removed up to 92 2 and 97 5 respectively reaching values below the regulated discharge limits of nutrients and cod 14 16 to the authors knowledge only a few works can be found in the literature concerning the treatment of refinery wastewater those works evidenced the growth and activity of ppb in the treatment of oil refinery wastewater however they studied the treatment of an oil refinery wastewater before the primary treatment under batch mode operation and using a culture enriched in a mixture of pseudomonas a genus of aerobic bacteria and rhodopseudomonas a genus of ppb 17 another work also demonstrated the bioremediation of oil polluted wastewater with pure cultures of rhodopseudomonas sp on seawater 18 according to previous works ppb could replace conventional aerobic biological treatments 19 moreover as other phototrophic microorganisms cyanobacteria and microalgae ppb upcycles the organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus in an assimilative way leading to a much higher biomass yield than aerobic cultures nearly 1 mgcodbiomass mgcodsubstrate compared to 0 5 mgcodbiomass mgcodsubstrate as well as a faster and higher nutrient assimilation rate 20 moreover these phototrophic facultative microorganisms do not require a high organic loading and have shown a higher resistance to inhibition caused by potentially toxic compounds in the rww than conventional aerobic and anaerobic technologies even at peak concentrations 21 however the rww is limited by the low nutrient content in the wastewater and ammonia nitrogen and phosphates are needed for the assimilative growth based microorganisms like ppb requiring higher amounts than the non photosynthetic microorganisms meanwhile the addition of synthetic compounds to the medium is deprecated since wastewater treatment techniques tend to reduce chemicals spent under the circular economy paradigm 22 a novel way of solving this issue is using a co substrate as domestic wastewater dww to provide the nutrients for the rww treatment as well as the treatment of the two effluents taking into account the well demonstrated ability of ppb to treat dww a synergy between both substrates may be expected this work proposes the co treatment of rww and dww in a photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr at lab scale producing high quality water for an oil refinery plant the start up of the bioreactor was performed using the refinery wastewater as the only substrate without pre inoculation the study of the specific loading rate on the performance of the co treatment of rww and dww followed a rational approach varying the hydraulic and the solid retention times the development of the microbial communities during the start up and the subsequent co treatment of the rww was also studied the outcomes of this work will serve as a basis to further scale up the process in an industrial scene 2 materials and methods 2 1 refinery and domestic wastewaters the rww was obtained from a refinery and petrochemistry complex in spain samples were taken directly from the daf unit before the biological treatment and preserved at 4 c the dww was obtained after primary treatment from the estiviel wastewater treatment plant wwtp in toledo spain these samples were also taken before the biological treatment and preserved at 4 c two different wastewater samples from effluents of rww and dww were used in this work due to the long operation time of the experimental work and the insufficient wastewater volume taken in the first collection campaign table 1 shows the physicochemical characterization of the two wastewater samples of both effluents the characterization results were in the typical range of rww and dww characterization data 3 4 23 as expected a higher nutrients content of nh4 and po4 3 was detected in the dww however a relevant decrease of scod and nh4 concentrations was noted in the second sample of dww these alterations can take place in the characterization parameters of real effluents since both refinery and domestic wastewaters are subject to variations over the time by operational production periods or seasonal fluctuations respectively 2 2 batch tests the dww is proposed as a feedstock to provide nutrients to allow the ppb growth on the rww batch tests were performed to find the best mixing ratio of the two rww and dww wastewaters regarding wastewater biodegradability and biomass growth five mixing ratios of dww rww were tested 0 100 25 75 50 50 75 25 and 100 0 three control experiments were carried out by using only rww 0 100 dww 100 0 or ultrapure miliq water upw in all the control experiments the medium was supplemented with acetic acid as a biodegradable carbon source and macro micronutrients as previously described in literature for optimal growth of the purple phototrophic culture further details in the supplementary information si 1 table s1 each control experiment was used as a reference for ppb growth under each of the studied water matrices rww dww and upw to assess the effect of the water matrix on the ppb growth the tests were performed in 160 ml glass serum bottles inoculated with a ppb biomass previously enriched in rww during the start up of the photoanaerobic mbr described below the bottles were filled to a working volume of 100 ml closed with rubber caps and sealed with aluminum crimps the headspace was flushed with argon for 10 min to assure an anaerobic and inert atmosphere since other gases like nitrogen or carbon dioxide could be fixed as additional nitrogen and carbon sources by ppb in this way all the biological activity can be related to the water phase composition the ph naturally evolved during the experiment bottles remained at 25 c in a temperature controlled incubator shaker for 3 d and illumination was provided by three 150 w infrared lamps philips br125 ir spain to an average effective near infrared nir radiance around 20 w m2 the bottles were covered with a vis uv filter to prevent the growth of other photosynthetic organisms nd 1 2299 transformation tubes banstead uk sampling was performed at the beginning and the end of each experiment to measure total cod tcod soluble cod scod ammonium orthophosphates vss tss and optical density od scod ammonium orthophosphates and od were also monitored three times a day during the experiments the duration of the experiments lasted 71 h until the biomass growth stopped 2 3 continuous operation of photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr the co treatment of rww and dww was performed in continuous mode in the panmbr previously described by de las heras et al 24 further details and experimental set up of the panmbr can be found in the supplementary information si 2 and fig s1 initially the panmbr was started up with only the rww after that it was operated following several stages at different specific loading rates slr table 2 summarizes the duration operation conditions and average concentration of the inlet wastewater in terms of scod nh4 and po4 3 of each stage the panmbr reactor was maintained at rt 25 7 0 5 c and the feedstocks at 4 c to prevent substrate degradation there was no ph control since it was not expected to reach inhibitory values ph 9 25 the presence of ppb on the panmbr biomass was checked daily by vis nir absorbance spectra 400 950 nm the macroscopic parameters such as scod tcod nh4 po4 3 tss and vss were daily measured to check the system s performance microbiological analysis was performed to analyze the microbial community through 16s rrna amplification described below of dna extracted from the biomass of the panmbr this analysis was performed for single samples of selected operational days 0 1 5 7 11 13 19 and 21 of the start up phase and 25 60 96 116 and 144 of the continuous co treatment of rww and dww the analysis of the inoculum used when starting the co treatment was also performed 2 3 1 start up with rww the start up of the continuous treatment was performed for 21 days feeding the rww as the sole substrate without ppb pre inoculation this stage served to develop an enriched ppb culture acclimatized to the rww the biomass developed after this stage was initially used as inoculum for the batch tests and thereafter for the continuous co treatment of rww and dww prior to the continuous treatment the inoculum was stored at 4 c initial operational conditions of the start up stage were selected following the recommendation of a previous work where the ppb enrichment was developed in a similar experimental setup treating dww 14 2 3 2 co treatment of the rww and dww the continuous co treatment of rww and dww was focused on increasing the slr this fact was performed by modification of the hydraulic and solid retention times hrt and srt to achieve a stable performance of the panmbr that assure values of cod nh4 and po4 3 below the legal discharge limits the rww dww mixing ratio was selected according to the results obtained from the batch tests table 2 shows the operating conditions of the panmbr including the inlet cod nh4 and po4 3 concentrations during the first acclimatization phase stage i the organic loading rate olr was initially varied between 77 and 145 mg cod l 1 d 1 with hrts in the range of 75 40 h initially the biomass was not purged so the srt was not controlled for 40 d to achieve a stable biomass concentration in the bioreactor after this acclimation period the slr was increased following two different strategies firstly the slr was increased from stages ii to vi by decreasing the hrt from 60 to 30 h setting the srt at 30 d by purging the biomass then from stages vii to ix the hrt was set at 25 h and the srt was gradually decreased from 25 to 16 d to assess the limitation of the treatment when increasing the amount of purged biomass finally the hrt and srt were set to 25 h and 20 d to stabilize the treatment at the maximum slr in stage x 2 4 analytical methods the optical density od was measured at 665 nm with a jasco v 630 uv vis madrid spain spectrophotometer along with vis nir absorbance spectra 450 950 nm to check the typical peaks of carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll of ppb od was also directly related to the vss by linear calibration od vss calibration was performed for every trial to avoid differences in biomass composition that might affect the od vss ratio the ph was analyzed with a crison glp 22 phmeter barcelona spain tcod scod nh4 po4 3 vss and tss were measured according to apha awwa wef standard methods 26 scod nh4 po4 3 were measured after filtration of the mixed liquor sample of the bioreactor with 0 45 μm glass fiber syringe filters the inlet wastewaters and effluent after treatment samples was also analyzed by gc ms gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using a stalbiwax ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm column to identify potential toxic compounds and byproducts the light intensity was measured at the surface of the bottles and the panmbr with a stellarnet blue wave spectrometer tampa fl usa with a fiber optic cable and a cosine receptor with a 10 aperture biomass samples for dna extraction of the panmbr reactor were concentrated by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min dna extraction prior to microbiological analysis was made through higherpurity bacterial genomic dna isolation kit by canvax biotech córdoba spain the extracted dna samples were sent to fisabio sequencing and bioinformatics valencia spain for 16 s rrna gene amplificon sequencing following the 16s rdna gene metagenomic sequencing library preparation illumina protocol cod 15 044 223 rev a further details of the microbiological analysis method are summarized in supplementary information si 3 2 5 data handling and statistical treatment apparent biomass yield y x s in gvss gcod was calculated as the ratio between the total biomass growth measured as vss and the total cod consumed anova was performed to check possible differences among the means of the yx s values all provided errors corresponded to the 95 confidence intervals slr was calculated as the ratio between olr and the biomass concentration in the liquor mixture expressed in terms of cod specific consumption rate scr was calculated as the ratio between consumed cod per day and the biomass concentration in the liquor mixture expressed in terms of cod regarding the analysis of the microbiological communities in the phototrophic biomass during the bioreactor operation taxonomic data obtained from 16 s rrna gene amplificon sequencing were analyzed at the genus level genera with relative abundances below 1 in all the samples were gathered in the same group as others genera composition of microbial communities for biomass of different periods of the continuous operation of panmbr were compared using the principal component analysis pca method two principal components pc1 and pc2 were used considering results within 50 of the variance 27 genera composition of those samples was also compared with environmental and response variables of the process cod nh4 and po4 3 consumptions and slr by redundancy analysis rda the genera data used for both analyses was compared by relative abundance pca and rda were performed in rstudio version 2021 09 0 with the functions prcomp and rda of the vegan package version 2 5 7 28 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of volumetric rww and dww ratio the dww was used to provide and compensate for the scarce nutrients of the rww fig 1 shows the biomass yields of the batch experiments performed at different mixtures of dww and rww including the initial 100cod p n ratio of each experiment remaining concentrations of scod nh4 and po4 3 at the end of the batch tests after 71 h can be found in supplementary information si 4 table s2 there was a significant increase in the biomass yield when the original cod n p ratio of the rww mixture dww rww of 0 100 raised from 100 3 2 0 2 to 100 6 7 0 5 mixture dww rww of 25 75 statistical significance of this increase was determined by analysis of variance anova with a p value 0 05 however no significant differences were observed in the batch tests performed with different dww rww ratios from 25 75 to 100 0 only the dww with p value of anova 0 05 likewise the control experiments using only rww dww and upw with additional carbon and nutrient sources for the ppb growth showed similar values these results evidenced that the nutrient scarcity of the rww as the sole substrate is responsible for the lower biomass yield on the other hand the biomass yields obtained near 1 in terms of cod when dww was added to rww are typical of non inhibited ppb cultures 19 therefore according to the biomass yield the dww rww ratio of 25 75 is enough for the ppb culture development the addition of the dww as co substrate to the rww also allowed a higher reduction of the scod from the dww rww of 25 75 keeping quite similar when the dww rww was increased to 50 50 and 75 25 the dww rww ratios above 25 75 up to 100 0 showed final scod values well below discharge limit si 4 table s2 125 mgtcod l according to the current eu legislation 29 whereas the experiment with only the rww achieved a closer value 123 9 mg l nevertheless note that this tcod discharge limit is referred to final effluents after the biomass water separation and scod in this work is representative of the soluble fraction of cod in the liquid phase after separation with 0 45 μm syringe filters regarding the nh4 and po4 3 nutrients all experiments with a dww rww ratio above 25 75 showed both nh4 and po4 3 values far above the discharge limits 12 9 and 3 1 mg l respectively see supplementary information si 4 table s2 however it is noteworthy to mention that the higher dww rww ratio from 50 50 to 100 0 the more excess nutrients in the initial feedstock initial 100cod n p ratios far above the reported average consumption for the ppb growth 100 5 1 19 consequently microorganisms cannot uptake the nutrients excess upon carbon source depletion there was little difference in the culture performance between 25 75 and 100 0 mix ratios so the 25 75 mix ratio was selected as the best one since the nh4 and po4 3 final values were closer and below the discharge limits we also argued that some phosphorus fed from dww must be ensured to properly develop and maintain the ppb mixed culture although this study is based on the influence of the volumetric rww dww ratio it is important to point out that the organic and nutrients loadings of rww and dww can change over time and vary widely depending on their origin different oil refinery plants and domestic wastewaters because of this volumetric ratio could change depending on rww and dww compositions to aim for a specific 100cod n p ratio in this work a 100cod n p ratio of 100 6 5 0 5 dww rww of 25 75 obtained the best results in terms of biomass yield and cod and nutrients removal 3 2 continuous co treatment of rww and dww fig 2 shows the monitoring of the main variables scod nh4 po4 3 and solid concentrations as well as the slr of the photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr during the start up using only the rww as the sole substrate and the following co treatment of rww and dww through different slr likewise the microbial community dynamics of the reactor was studied along the different operative stages and the performance of the biological process was assessed 3 2 1 start up of photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor as shown in fig 2 the cod consumption was stabilized on day 14 with an average of 139 mg l representing 44 of the initial soluble cod regarding nutrients nh4 was fully consumed after 10 d while the po4 3 remained below 0 15 mg l from the beginning as its concentration in the raw rww was at a trace level the low p concentration hindered the cod assimilation as cod consumptions above 80 are typically achieved 19 the concentration of vss was stabilized at day 18 with an average concentration of 312 mg l evidencing a stable microbial community despite the scarcity of po4 3 vis nir absorbance spectra of mixed culture samples taken from the photoanaerobic membrane bioreactor showed typical peaks of carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll from day 4 to the end of the start up stage see vis nir absorbance spectra in supplementary information si 5 fig s2 confirming the presence of ppb in the mixed culture 30 indeed the mixed culture acquired a characteristic reddish brown colour of ppb cultures within the first week the microbial community composition was also studied at selected samples taken on days 0 1 5 7 11 13 19 and 21 relative abundance of the different taxa at the genus level during the start up phase is shown in the supplementary information si 5 fig s3 results on day 0 displayed a small community of ppb in the raw rww mainly photoorganoheterophs thus acting as the initial seed for the subsequent ppb enrichment among the numerous ppb taxa the most relevant genera or families for non identified genera found in raw rww correspond to rhodobacter sp thiobaca sp rhodoferax sp thiophaeococcus sp comamonadaceae gen xantobacteraceae gen bradyrhizobium sp and rhodopseudomonas sp with a notable prevalence of the last three the ppb presence in the rww may be due to the sunlight exposure of the raw rww in certain phases before the biological treatment the combined relative abundance of these ppb genera families went from ca 9 on day 0 to 45 on day 21 which unequivocally indicates the ppb enrichment in the mixed culture at the end of the start up phase rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp were the most representative genera despite most of the mentioned microorganisms found in oil polluted environments rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp seem to have a better adaptation in the refinery wastewater matrix these results agree with previous studies that use these two genera in oil polluted wastewater bioremediation for their enhanced oil degrading capability 31 34 most of the other microorganisms found in the samples are typical in wastewater due to their hydrolytic and fermentative nature strict aerobic bacteria such as sphingomonas sp quickly decayed due to the lack of oxygen in the culture medium interestingly acidovorax sp shows a significant and continuous presence during the start up stage this genus has been reported as a prominent actor in oil polluted wastewater 35 and rww 36 it is known for its capability to degrade polymers and complex molecules 37 39 therefore the competition between acidovorax sp and ppb species is not undesired since both are facultative bacteria capable of degrading complex hydrocarbons in addition anaerobic fermentative bacteria like proteinoclasticum sp youngiibacter sp and acetobacterium sp were also found especially during the first days of the experiment according to the cod and ammonium removal data fig 2 there is a close relationship between their increase and the rise of most representative genera of ppb suggesting that these microorganisms lead to the consumption of ammonium and organic matter however the ppb growth is hindered by phosphorus scarcity so higher enrichment and removal percentages might even be expected without this limitation as has been previously demonstrated with other types of wastewaters 40 3 2 2 continuous co treatment of rww and dww a performance of panmbr during the first stage of the continuous co treatment the panmbr was operated to increase the concentration of vss using the inoculum generated during the previous start up phase the srt was not controlled for 40 d in this stage whereas the hrt varied from 75 h to 40 h under these operation conditions the vss increased up to 700 mg l and the slr varied from 1 3 to ca 0 11 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d at the end of this stage i the panmbr achieved a stable cod 60 70 and nh4 and po4 3 removals ca 40 once the bioreactor was stabilized the increase of the slr from 0 11 0 02 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d at stage ii to 0 21 0 07 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d at stage vi by the reduction of the hrt from 60 to 30 h at constant srt 30 d allowed to remain scod and nh4 and po4 3 under the discharge limits in this sequence of stages ii vi a sudden drop of the nutrients and scod in the inlet stream was observed stage iii likely due to the renewal of rww and dww batches used as feedstock for the bioreactor this fact derived in a significant vss drop to ca 400 mg l at the end of stage vi despite the increase of the olr the increase of the slr from 0 24 0 02 to 0 50 0 08 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d during the stages vii to ix keeping constant the hrt at 25 h and reducing srt from 30 to 16 d produced a loss of vss with a consequent decrease of the bioreactor performance leading to values of scod in the outlet stream above the discharge limits stage ix thus a clear destabilization of the bioreactor was evident with the increase of the slr finally during stage x the system could be stabilized by increasing the srt to 20 d maintaining the concentration of vss around 170 mg l and a moderate performance in terms of scod and nutrients removals maximum cod removal was 75 of the initial scod at stage vii which is in the average range reported for an urban wastewater treatment 19 at operation conditions of stage vii 25 h hrt and 25 d srt slr of 0 24 0 02 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d concentrations of cod nh4 and po4 3 were consistently below the regulated discharge limits 125 mg l 12 9 mg l and 3 1 mg l respectively b nature of organic pollutants the nature of the organic compounds involved in the cod consumption was also studied for a better understanding of the performance of panmbr soluble organic compounds were detected by gc ms ms in the inlet and outlet streams for samples taken at the end of stage x see supplementary information si 5 fig s4 typical short chain carboxylic acids of domestic wastewater such as acetic acid were identified in the influent stream additionally other characteristic compounds of refinery wastewaters like long chain carboxylic acid derivatives undecanoates and dodecanoates alcohols butanediol aromatics pyrroles and nitrogen containing compounds amines and amides were also identified 41 interestingly the majority of the identified compounds formamide n n dimethyl acetic acid 1 3 butanediol undecanoic acid methyl ester cyclohexanamine n cyclohexyl 2 pirrolidinone 1 methyl and 7 dodecanoic acid methyl ester were removed during the treatment due to the high metabolic versatility of the ppb the fate of these compounds seems to be related to microbial assimilation and degradation however a soluble recalcitrant compound methoxy phenyl oxime codified as 8 remained in the outlet effluent after the treatment which was likely affecting the decrease of the cod removal the presence of this pollutant was confirmed by the urban wastewater treatment plant that provided the dww as a recurrent pollutant used as a fungicide in nearby croplands in any case it is noteworthy that the mixed culture of the panmbr could deal with the aromatics and amines compounds that represent a potential hazard for conventional biological treatments 21 microbial degradation pathways are discussed more insightfully when describing the microbial communities dynamics below c specific loading rate assessment in order to assess the maximum capacity of the photoanaerobic treatment the specific loading rate slr was compared to the specific consumption rate scr both in terms of the inlet and consumed cod fig 3 for slr values below ca 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d there was a clear positive and stable linear trend between scr and slr note that this value is comparable to the typical slr of conventional activated sludge treatments 23 for example the wwtp of a medium size refinery in portugal based on activated sludge has a slr of 0 35 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d 4 additionally ten case scenarios from different domestic wwtp based on activated sludge systems in europe showed slr values between 0 1 and 0 25 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d 42 on the other hand the process became unstable for slr above ca 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d evidencing that the biomass reached maximum values of the specific assimilation rate of the organic carbon this fact is consistent with the lower consumption of cod and nutrients started at stage viii and confirmed at stage ix with slr values of 0 36 0 03 and 0 5 0 08 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d respectively d analysis of dynamic microbiological populations fig 4 displays the results of the microbiological analysis corresponding to the samples of the beginning of the continuous phase inoculum the end of the acclimatization phase stage i day 25 and relevant operation periods stages iii vii viii and x days 60 96 116 and 144 respectively the most abundant ppb genera at the beginning of the continuous co treatment of rww and dww were rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp which is consistent with the final microbial characterization of the inoculum from the previous start up phase see supplementary information si 5 fig s3 the relative abundance of ppb genera during the different stages of the co treatment ranged from 30 to 60 evidencing an enriched ppb mixed culture during the whole operation treatment likewise rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp seemed to be the best adapted genera for treating the rww dww mixture for the different operational conditions other works involving the treatment of domestic and agro industrial wastewaters also showed these genera as predominant in ppb enriched cultures 13 14 moreover it was also observed that rhodobacter sp generally prevailed over rhodopseudomonas sp in this study which has also been previously pointed out in other works 43 44 this fact responds to the low olr of the treatment that favors a k strategist like rhodobacter sp instead of a r strategist like rhodopseudomonas sp that is able to grow better at higher olrs 45 rhodocista sp and rhodoferax sp also proliferated among other ppb genera during the acclimation stage i that was operated under longer srt and hrt which promotes slowly growing bacteria like those ppb genera 43 46 47 other microorganisms that take advantage of these conditions were sulfate reducing bacteria such as arcobacter sp which also have low growth rates 48 additionally fermentative bacteria commonly found in anaerobic wastewater treatments such as acetobacterium sp lentimicrobium sp paludibacter sp and bacteria from the family rikenellaceae were also identified in the microbial community lentimicrobium sp were found at stages iii and viii corresponding to lower values of the ppb abundance although it is known for its low growth rates 49 lentimicrobium sp has been reported as a majoritarian taxon during the anaerobic digestion with a much higher olr 1000 mgcod l d than the values used in this work 50 thus the lentimicrobium sp presence is probably more related to ppb decay on the other hand the highest relative abundance of ppb was observed at stage vii corresponding to the beginning of the slr rise average slr of 0 24 0 02 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d the system achieved the highest cod consumption in this stage thus as in the start up phase the ppb seems to be the primary consumers of organic matter however the abundance of ppb was strongly reduced at the following stage viii when the slr was increased favoring the appearance of other microorganisms like the abovementioned lentimicrobium sp and strict aerobes like acinetobacter this stage viii also included extended maintenance and cleaning activities in which the mbr was exposed to air this fact may explain the presence of these microorganisms even more members of the patescibacteria class candidatus falkowbacteria sp and kryptoniales gen proliferated in these periods revealing an association between them and lentimicrobium sp acidovorax sp also appeared in high proportion but its proliferation only increased during the last stabilization phase contrasting with the start up phase acidovorax sp has a fast growth rate which benefits from high olr values like those obtained at stage x 51 52 in terms of the compounds found in the inlet wastewater stream and the presence of the analyzed microorganisms some links can be established formamide a known protein denaturing agent can be degraded to formic acid and ammonium by the action of enzymes as amidases 53 both formic acid and ammonium are beneficial chemicals for ppb metabolism so formamide degradation is likely to occur regarding n cyclohexyl cyclohexanamine there are no reports of microbial degradation of this compound to the authors knowledge nevertheless several ppb species 54 and most sulfur reducing bacteria 55 can assimilate cyclic compounds such as benzene and cyclohexane the same is valid for 1 methyl 2 pyrrolydine however another cyclic compound such as methoxy phenyl oxime seems to be resistant to the metabolic activity of the mixed ppb culture although there is no information about its specific toxicity mechanism this chemical has been reported as an antibacterial agent 58 additionally other oximes were found as inhibitors of bacterial metabolism 56 57 thus its potentially toxic nature may explain why the culture cannot degrade it pca results shown in fig 5 a combined microorganisms abundance tendencies of biomass samples in two principal components strongly influenced by the variance of the data of the most abundant ppb genera members of the phylum patescibacteria and fermentative bacteria principal component 1 pc1 is mainly swayed by the presence of most ppb genera rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp and acidovorax sp on the other hand principal component 2 pc2 is influenced by gracilibacteria acidovorax sp and fermentative bacteria such as acetobacterium sp and lentimicrobium sp the points shown in fig 5 a correspond to the samples of the study of microbial community dynamics the initial acclimatization stage i significantly affected the community structure of the initial inoculum an antagonism between ppb and acidovorax sp also appeared suggesting acidovorax sp as a potential opportunistic competitor of ppb however since this observation is only based on statistical correlation the relationship should be carefully addressed pca analysis also confirms that the destabilization of the system stage ix is related to the ppb community s decay the relationship between lentimicrobium sp and candidatus falkowbacteria sp and kryptoniales sp is also evident and opposed to the presence of gracilibacteria this finding may suggest a competitive behaviour between different patescibacteria which is not unlikely due to their common parasitic nature the rda results in fig 5 b combined microorganisms abundance tendencies of the biomass and response variables of the panmbr in two axes rda1 is mainly related to scod and phosphate consumptions as well as the slr x axis and rda2 to the ammonium consumption y axis these results show a strong relationship between cod consumption and the presence of rhodobacter sp strongly supporting the assumption that ppb are the primary microorganisms responsible for the cod consumption however the increase of the slr seems to harm this genus probably due to a better adaptation of rhodopseudomonas sp to higher organic loadings and the increase of acidovorax sp the ammonium consumption seems to be related to lentimicrobium sp and their associated parasites suggesting that these microorganisms could be the primary ammonium consumers in the absence of ppb however these results should be addressed carefully as rda 2 only explains 16 6 of the variance 58 3 3 implications and prospects of the photoanaerobic treatment for rww the specific loading rate is a specific and critical parameter of each type of wastewater treatment which is tightly related to the specific consumption rate and biodegradability of the wastewater in this sense operational parameters of the photoanaerobic treatment in this work have been compared with ppb based treatments for different wastewaters and conventional activated sludge as the current biological process for refinery wastewater treatment generally ppb can cope with low srt 1 3 d when the wastewater is easily biodegradable 19 43 the continuous treatment of dww by ppb accomplished removal yields over 90 for both cod and nutrients using a similar panmbr under hrts between 11 and 22 h and srts between 2 and 3 d 14 in that study the specific loading and consumption rates remained very closely 1 22 2 78 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d and 1 18 2 67 mgcodconsumed mgcodbiomass d respectively due to the highly biodegradable nature of dww which enhances the performance of the process by an increased phototrophic biomass yield 19 however low biodegradable wastewaters require higher srts to ensure a stable active biomass concentration for example the treatment of a high saline alimentary industry wastewater achieved 80 of scod removal with a hrt of 48 h and srt of 30 d 59 the optimal specific loading rate for this wastewater was around 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d which is quite similar the value determined in this work for the rww the specific consumption rate of high saline alimentary wastewater was near 0 24 mgcodconsumed mgcodbiomass d revealing that this effluent is slightly more biodegradable than the rww by ppb but way less than the dww regarding the conventional activated sludge the treatment of rww requires hrts of 24 48 h and srts of 30 40 d 60 61 with specific loading and consumption rates of 0 56 0 71 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d and 0 42 0 60 mgcodconsumed mgcodbiomass d thereby even far from the typical values for the photoanaerobic treatment the final operational parameters of this work stage x 25 h hrt 20 d srt slr of 0 49 0 06 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d can compete with the conventional technology of activated sludge for the treatment of rww with the benefit of reducing co2 emissions additionally the water stream collected in the final operational conditions complied with regulated concentration limits of cod ammonium and phosphates moreover the separation of the suspended solids by the ultrafiltration type membrane implemented in the photoanaerobic reactor allows fulfilling parameters regulated for reclaimed water such as pathogens and specific macroscopic parameters 62 63 the outlet stream falls into the highest quality category of residential use 1 intestinal nematode egg l 0 cfu of e coli l 2 ntu 100 ufc of legionella sp l 10 mg l of tss and 10 mgbod5 l characterization results of inlet and outlet streams of panmbr are summarized in supplementary information si 5 table s3 water reuse has an undeniable positive impact on every industry but usually comes with a high cost in the form of expensive tertiary treatments there is no need for such tertiary treatment with the proposed technology since a high quality effluent is achieved at the biomass water separation stage reclaimed water of this quality may be used as process water including boiling and refrigeration activities for any refinery unit additionally it can be used for non process related issues such as cleaning activities irrigation of green areas and fire fighting systems depending on the regulations of each country besides the already commented economic benefits reclaimed wastewater obtained in this way means a vast environmental improvement by saving water and avoiding the by products obtained when using conventional tertiary treatments such as tetrachloromethanes coming from water chlorination 64 regarding prospects the present work is key in the potential implementation of the proposed strategy at pilot or full scale apart from the high quality final effluent the treatment showed the maximum cod and nutrient elimination with a biomass concentration near 300 mg l additionally even with low vss concentrations the system remained highly stable until the final periods and performed accordingly with discharge regulations interestingly the treatment of a synthetic wastewater with a similar reactor setup sustained a proper treatment with a similar vss concentration 40 thereby this behaviour is not inherent to the mixture of rww and dww and promising results can be expected for other kinds of wastewaters finally although rww has been treated before with ppb 17 the present work answers different questions the continuous mode was assessed including the influence of slr which provides an early approach for the scaling up of the technology the effluent treated in this work is the wastewater produced after primary treatment so the treatment does not need to deal with the excess oils solids and other immiscible materials the mixed ppb culture developed in this work from the own rww is much more diverse and realistic making the process more feasible for potential implementation in summary the present work successfully stretched the gap between the use of ppb to treat rww and its implementation at an industrial scale 4 conclusions the rww can be successfully treated with ppb based cultures in a photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor however due to the low nutrient content of rww the process can be improved by adding a 25 volume of dww as an additional nitrogen and phosphorus source reaching a cod n p ratio of 100 6 5 0 5 the mixed culture enriched in ppb for this treatment can be obtained from the rww without previous inoculation regarding the operational performance of the process this work reports an optimum specific loading rate of 0 3 mgcodinlet mgcodbiomass d to avoid the system destabilization within those conditions rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp were the most abundant bacteria and they seem responsible for the highest eliminations of carbon and nutrients the effluent obtained under such conditions complies with discharging regulations and falls under the maximum quality grade for its reuse as process water or domestic uses this could make oil refinery industries and others benefit since the proposed technology can achieve reclaimed water without a tertiary treatment

12613,the performance evaluation metagenomic analysis and microbial activity of a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr were performed in treating mariculture wastewater at different carbon nitrogen c n ratios the nitrification rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities gradually increased with the decrease of c n ratio from 6 to 3 whereas the denitrifying process showed the opposite results owing to the insufficiency of the carbon source the metagenomic analysis demonstrated that the abundance of functional genes and enzymes in the denitrification pathway decreased with the c n ratio from 6 to 3 the decrease in the abundance of key enzymes and genes in the denitrification process had adverse impacts on the nitrogen removal at low c n ratio the microbial diversity and richness were affected by the changes of c n ratios additionally the network analysis indicated that some denitrifying bacteria were considered to be the keystone taxa in the mbbr the correlation analysis illustrated that the abundant nitrate reductase promoted the nitrate transformation and the positive associations existed in some denitrification enzymes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbon nitrogen ratio mariculture wastewater metagenomic analysis functional gene enzymatic activity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the continuous demand for seafood and overfishing of marine fishery resources mariculture has become a fast growing industry in the past two decades 1 many closed and semi closed mariculture systems in coastal areas have been used for seafood farming in china owing to the water exchange in aquaculture systems lots of mariculture wastewater discharge into offshore waters feed residues and excreta of mariculture organisms cause rich suspended solids dissolved organic matter and nitrogenous compounds nh4 no2 and no3 in mariculture wastewater 2 mariculture wastewater without proper disposal can cause the eutrophication and biodiversity changes in offshore waters 3 4 consequently it is imperative to exploit an environmentally friendly and economical approach for treating mariculture wastewater physical methods can remove suspended solids from mariculture wastewater 5 such as filtration precipitation and foam fractionation but they do not effectively remove dissolved organic matter or nitrogenous compounds advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively oxidize organic substance and ammonia nitrogen such as ozone and uv irradiation 2 uv electro chlorine processes 6 and uv h2o2 oxidation 7 however aops cannot reduce nitrite and nitrate to nitrogen gas and their higher operation costs limit their application in practical engineering biological methods can effectively convert nitrogenous compounds into nitrogen gas through the nitrification and denitrification compared with physical and chemical methods biological methods such as biofilters 8 microbial fuel cells 9 and rotating biological contactors 2 have been recognized as cost effective and environmentally friendly technologies for the treatment of mariculture wastewater mariculture wastewater has higher salinity and lower carbon nitrogen c n ratio which has challenged conventional biological treatment methods moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr combines the advantages of activated sludge and biofilm through freely mobile suspended carriers in a bioreactor 10 in recent years mbbr has attracted widespread attention for the treatment of mariculture wastewater 11 mbbr can efficiently remove organic substances and nitrogenous compounds from mariculutre wastewater 12 13 mbbr performance during the treatment of mariculture wastewater can be affected by operational parameters and influent composition tada et al 14 evaluated the effects of nh4 n concentration hydraulic retention time hrt and filling ratio on the nitrogen removal performance of mbbr treating mariculture wastewater a previous research evaluated the effect of diverse biocarriers on the mbbr performance during treating mariculture wastewater 15 owing to different breeding modes and feed consumption the c n ratio in mariculture wastewater has some discrepancies in different aquaculture plants the nitrogen removal in biological wastewater treatment mainly includes nitrifying and denitrifying processes which is performed through the corresponding microbial genes and enzymes 16 17 based on the analysis of the relationships among the functional genes key microorganisms and enzymatic activities it can comprehensively understand the effects of the c n ratio on nitrification and denitrification in an mbbr treating mariculture wastewater in the current study the cod n ratio was replaced with the c n ratio due to the convenient measurement the present study aimed to i compare the performance and nitrogen conversion rate of an mbbr under different c n ratios ii evaluate key enzymatic activities at each c n ratio and iii reveal the nitrogen transformation mechanism from microbial communities metabolic pathways and functional genes by metagenomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbbr operation a lab scale mbbr with 7 7 l effective volume was 14 cm inner diameter and 50 cm effective height fig s1 which was filled with cylindrical polyethylene biological fillers at a 25 volume filling rate the diameter height and specific surface area of the biological filler were 25 mm 10 mm and 500 m2 m3 respectively the initial sludge was acquired from a municipal wwtp in qingdao china the operating procedure was as follows filling 5 min anoxic phase 0 5 h oxic phase 2 h anoxic phase 3 h settling 20 min and drainage 5 min the treated water was discharged by a solenoid valve and the volume exchange ratio of mbbr was 50 the hrt of mbbr was 12 h the influent ph was between 7 and 8 dissolved oxygen do was provided through an aeration pump at aerobic phase do was over 2 mg l at the oxic process and below 0 5 mg l at the anoxic process prior to treating the synthetic mariculture wastewater cylindrical polyethylene biological fillers were seeded using activated sludge the formed biofilms were acclimatized to sea salinity after biofilm acclimation the mbbr was used to treat the mariculture wastewater according to previous research 8 18 the concentrations of carbon source and nitrogen compounds were amended in this research the components of the synthetic mariculture wastewater was as follows mg l ch3coona 92 31 76 92 61 54 and 46 15 nh4cl 13 37 nano3 45 53 nano2 4 93 nahco3 50 kh2po4 8 75 and seawater

nitrite reducing rate snirr of the biofilm were determined based on the report of gao et al 20 which were summarized in text s1 the activities of ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir were analyzed as described by previous research 21 and the specific measurement procedures were showed in text s2 2 3 metagenomic analysis total genomic

dna were assessed using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa genomic dna was fragmented by sonication to a size of approximately 350 bp using a covaris s2 system massachusetts usa for library construction paired end libraries were generated using a neb next ultra dna library preparation kit neb usa illumina hiseq platform 150 bp paired end was adopted for libraries sequences in novogene beijing china readfq v8 was used to quality check for raw sequence reads and low quality reads were filtered quality value 38 presence of n bases or overlap of adapter a total of 350 183 933 clean reads were obtained and every sample got 87 545 983 reads equally detailed information on the quality of the raw data is provided in table s2 these clean sequences per sample were assembled using the megahit software and the assembled scaftigs with a length 500 bp were used for subsequent gene prediction the assembly information is listed in table s3 the open reading frames orfs were predicted by these assembled scaftigs using metagenemark v2 10 based on the results of the orfs prediction all the sequences were clustered as non redundant gene catalogs by cd hit v4 5 8 95 identity 90 coverage after quality control the clean reads were mapped to initial gene catalogs by bowtie 2 2 4 software these gene catalogs were blasted to the nr database of ncbi and kegg database using diamond v0 9 9 blastp e value cutoff of 1e 5 for taxonomic and key enzyme annotation ncycdb was used as a curated integrative database to annotate functional genes of the nitrogen removal pathway 22 the abundance of nitrogen removal genes was determined by dividing the sequences assigned to the function per sample count by the total effective sequences 23 2 4 statistical analysis some data were displayed as the mean standard deviation from triplicate in bacterial community analysis the changes of top 50 genera were showed as a heatmap using hemi 1 0 the correlation between functional genes and bacteria was revealed by network analysis which was based on the change of genes and bacteria abundances a correlation plot origin 2021b was used to explore the relationship between key enzymes and nitrogen compounds p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbbr performance under different c n ratios during the entire operational process the total nitrogen concentration in the synthetic mariculture wastewater was stabilized at approximately 12 mg l and the c n ratios declined from 6 to 3 along with average cod concentration from 73 03 to 37 01 mg l the cod removal efficiencies were 94 43 4 11 under c n ratios between 6 and 3 demonstrating that different c n ratios hardly affected the cod removal owing to low cod concentration fig 1a the effluent nh4 n concentration was lowered to 0 6 mg l except for the first 5 day suggesting that the change of c n ratios had no impact on the ammonia oxidation fig 1b at an average influent no3 n concentration of 7 48 mg l the effluent no3 n was 0 19 0 06 1 24 0 19 3 33 0 23 7 16 0 25 mg l under the c n ratios at 6 5 4 and 3 respectively fig 1c it s obvious that the effluent no3 n concentration rose as the decline of c n ratio which indicated that the content of organic matter at lower c n ratio could not meet the requirement of nitrate reduction during the denitrification process the average effluent no2 n concentrations were 0 13 1 12 1 31 and 0 mg l at c n ratios of 6 5 4 and 3 respectively fig 1d as no2 n mainly originated from the influent nitrification and nitrate reduction the variation of the effluent no2 n concentration under different c n ratios could be explained as follows 1 nitrite was almost entirely reduced to nitrogen gas at c n ratio of 6 because of the sufficient carbon source for nitrite reduction 2 the carbon source at c n ratios of 5 and 4 caused most of the no2 n to be reduced as nitrogen gas and 3 considering the influent and effluent nitrate only very few nitrate could be reduced as nitrite owing to the serious insufficiency of the carbon source under the c n ratio of 3 and led to lower effluent no2 n concentration at an average influent tn concentration of 12 01 mg l the effluent tn was 0 78 0 12 2 89 0 17 4 73 0 19 7 57 0 23 mg l under c n ratios at 6 5 4 and 3 respectively fig s3 the effluent tn concentration increased as the c n ratio declined this phenomenon could be explained that low c n ratio inhibited the denitrifying bacteria which led to the accumulation of no3 n and no2 n in the reactor 24 25 3 2 nitrogen removal rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities under different c n ratios the nitrogen conversion rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities were evaluated under different c n ratios fig 2 the saor and snor showed the increasing trends as the c n ratio decreased fig 2a the snor displayed a higher increase than the saor with the c n ratios from 6 to 3 as ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria are autotrophic microorganism low c n ratio may promote the nitrification process conversely the denitrification rates decreased when the c n ratio reduced fig 2b the snirr and snrr decreased as the c n ratio decreased as most denitrifying bacteria utilize organic matter as an electron donor to reduce nitrite and nitrate organic carbon source plays an essential role during the denitrification process lower c n ratio inhibited the snirr and snrr of the biofilm owing to the insufficiency of carbon source the activities of amo and nor increased as the c n ratio from 6 to 3 fig 2c the lower c n ratio in mariculture wastewater could heighten the nitrifying enzymatic activity and then promoted the nitrifying rate which was beneficial to the nitrification process conversely the nir and nr activities decreased with the c n ratio from 6 to 3 fig 2d lower c n ratio in mariculture wastewater inhibited the denitrifying enzymatic activity and then decreased the denitrifying rate owing to the deficiency of organic substances which was unfavorable for the denitrification process compared with c n ratio at 6 the activities of nr and nir reduced by 33 93 and 29 81 58 82 and 54 43 and 73 06 and 65 56 under c n ratio at 5 4 and 3 respectively the decrease of c n ratio generated more inhibitory effect on the nr activity than the nir activity the amo nor nr and nir activities had the similar varying tendencies to the saor snor snrr and snirr respectively the present results illustrated that the variation of enzymatic activities could vary the nitrification and denitrification rates and then further affected the nitrogen removal process 3 3 nitrogen metabolic pathways and functional genes under different c n ratios the metagenomes included complete functional genes encoding key enzymes related to nitrogen removal including nitrification m00528 and denitrification m00529 metagenomic analysis can qualify the abundance of the functional enzymes and describe them by their enzyme commission ec number fig 3a the seven major nitrogen transformation enzymes were ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 compared with the c n ratio of 6 the abundance of ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 increased by 41 85 and 236 44 121 78 and 163 16 and 104 18 and 110 22 under c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 respectively indicating that low c n ratios promoted positive impacts on ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase however the abundance of nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 decreased by 40 03 48 26 and 22 15 under c n ratios at 5 4 and 3 respectively nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 included nitrate reductase nitrite oxidase alpha beta and gamma subunits 26 which could determine enzyme abundance in the denitrification process compared with the c n ratio of 6 the nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 abundance reduced by 46 00 59 19 and 49 75 under c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 respectively likewise the abundance of nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 declined by 43 42 and 28 86 61 64 and 58 34 and 39 94 and 48 52 corresponding to c n ratio at 5 4 and 3 respectively the insufficiency of organic substances at low c n ratios decreased the abundance of denitrifying enzymes which led to nitrite accumulation at c n ratios of 5 and 4 compared with c n ratio of 4 the increase of these denitrifying enzyme abundances caused a decrease in no2 n concentration under c n ratio of 3 including nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 nevertheless the increase in denitrifying enzyme abundance caused a decrease in no2 n concentration under a c n ratio of 3 this demonstrated a low c n ratio affected adversely enzymes during the denitrification process additionly thenitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 abundance fluctuated within a certain range the changes of enzymes revealed the impacts of the c n ratios on nitrogen transformation at protein level but many nitrogen functional genes coded a corresponding enzyme in common the analysis of nitrogen functional genes based on ncycdb database can provide further understanding of nitrogen transformation at dna level 27 28 the genes abundance for nitrogen removal were determined using the ncycdb database in this study fig 3b including nitrification amoabc hao and nxrab and denitrification narghijvwyz napabc nirks norbc and nosz the sequences of each gene under different c n ratios are also shown in table s4 among the total annotated sequences at 82 284 062 the sequence numbers related to nitrification and denitrification were 8380 and 267 727 respectively in general the completion of the nitrification process follows three phases 1 ammonia monooxygenase genes amoabc catalyze the oxidation of nh4 n to nh2oh 2 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase gene hao catalyzes the oxidation of nh2oh to no2 n and 3 nitrite oxidoreductase genes nxrab catalyze the oxidation reduction of nitrite the abundance of amoabc was the highest under c n ratio at 3 and the sequences of amoabc were 216 283 247 and 478 corresponding to c n ratio at 6 5 4 and 3 respectively suggesting that low c n ratio promoted the ammonia oxidation process the abundance of hao and nxrab displayed similar trends to those of hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 and nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 respectively the increased abundance of nitrification genes at low c n ratios leads to nitrate accumulation similarly pan et al 29 illustrated that the abundance of amoabc and hao genes in an mbbr elevated as the c n ratio decline in the denitrification pathway membrane binding nar and periplasm nap nitrate reductase can catalyze the reduction of no3 to no2 compared to the c n ratio at 6 the total abundance of nitrate reduction genes narghijvwyz and napabc decreased by 38 64 43 05 and 23 26 under c n ratios at 5 4 and 3 respectively the abundance of nitrite reduction genes nirks and nitric oxide reduction genes norbc declined by 38 73 and 39 78 52 07 and 46 36 and 41 83 and 29 12 under c n ratios at 5 4 and 3 respectively the abundance changes for the nitrous oxide reduction gene nosz were similar to those of the nitrite and nitric oxide reduction genes nirks and norbc overall the decrease in the key enzymes and genes abundance of the denitrification process had a detrimental effect on nitrogen removal at low c n ratios 3 4 microbial shift under different c n ratios by searching the ncbi nr database 812 019 reads were classified as bacteria 99 39 archaea 0 31 and eukaryota 0 12 principal co ordinates analysis displayed that it explained 94 35 of the changes in the bacterial community fig s2 the samples of the c n ratios at 6 5 4 and 3 did not cluster together which indicated that the changes of c n ratios could result in a microbial shift the impact of the c n ratio on the microbial community was analyzed at phylum class and genus levels fig 4 five main phyla under different c n ratios were proteobacteria 38 67 55 55 bacteroidetes 12 51 20 04 chloroflexi 5 10 8 16 planctomycetes 3 56 4 21 and cyanobacteria 0 87 2 10 fig 4a since many heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria 30 the decrease of proteobacteria abundance at low c n ratio affected the denitrifying process the relative abundance of bacteroidetes chloroflexi and planctomycetes showed slight fluctuations under different c n ratios chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are capable of degrading organic substances 31 planctomycetes are capable of degrading organics and their genomes encode nitrogen removal 32 the relative abundance of cyanobacteria gradually increased as the c n ratio decreased which might be due to their greater adaptability to extreme environments 33 the abundance of nitrospirae increased gradually as the c n ratio decreased four dominant classes of the phylum proteobacteria were betaproteobacteria 3 57 28 37 gammaproteobacteria 10 78 14 06 alphaproteobacteria 8 30 13 09 and deltaproteobacteria 2 52 4 34 fig 4b compared to c n ratio of 6 the betaproteobacteria abundance of decreased by 15 14 24 80 and 16 60 under c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 respectively the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria fluctuated within a certain range under different c n ratios saprospiria flavobacteriia and cytophagia formed the major classes in bacteroidetes and the phylum chloroflexi was dominated by anaerolineae and ardenticatenia zhai et al 34 reported that anaerolineae plays an important role in nitrogen removal as displayed in fig 4c the total top 50 genera abundance decreased as the c n ratio decreased the top 10 genera in each sample are underlined in red and more detailed information is shown in table s5 thauera lewinella and promineofilum were the top 10 genera thauera was the richest at a c n ratio of 6 but lewinella became the richest at c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 thauera is the dominant denitrifying bacteria 35 36 the relative abundance of nitrosomonas were 0 25 0 25 0 20 and 0 32 at c n ratios of 6 5 4 and 3 respectively the relative abundance of nitrospira species rose as the c n ratio decreased nitrosomonas and nitrosospira are capable of oxidizing nh4 n to no2 n 37 nitrospira can oxidize no2 n to no3 n 38 the relative abundance for some genera gently reduced as c n ratio decreased including pseudomonas hyphomonas marinicella pseudoruegeria aequorivita psychroserpens fuerstia flavobacterium altibacter and ulvibacter pseudomonas produces extracellular lipases and converts organic compounds into available substances 39 marinicella can convert no3 n into n2 in high salinity wastewater 40 3 5 microbial contributions to nitrogen removal the correlation between the nitrogen removal genes and microbial genera was revealed by the network analysis fig 5a the relevance degree reflects the contribution of host genera to nitrogen removal genes in the nitrification and denitrification processes 41 42 the network included 50 genera and 22 nitrogen functional genes with 371 connections among which 31 genera were potential hosts and were associated with nitrogen metabolic genes by 175 linkages it is clear that a modular structure was presented in this network analysis especially in the nitrification and denitrification genes and the host bacteria in the nitrification process the functional genes and their hosts were clearly distributed in three modules the amoabc and nxra genes and their hosts belonged to one module and the hao and nxrb genes were present in the other two modules nitrosomonas was related to the amoa and nxra genes suggesting that they play a crucial role in the nitrification process nitrospira was closely related to the nxrb narg and narh genes which is in line with a previous report 42 in addition the nitrification genes were linked with some denitrifying bacteria such as roseovarius sedimentitalea and marinobacter the functional metabolism of nitrification genes causes the accumulation of intermediate products nitrite and nitrate and enhances the activity of denitrifying bacteria compared to the nitrification process a more complex network occurred during the denitrification process some functional bacteria were assigned seven genes including litorilinea caldilinea dechloromonas sorangium woeseia candidatus accumulibacter zoogloea azoarcus and thauera which were considered as hubs in the mbbr system notably strong associations existed between these denitrifying bacteria and their co occurrence reflected the impacts of c n on the denitrification the modular structure of network analysis showed the different impacts of c n ratio on nitrification and denitrification some nitrification genes and bacteria belonged to two simple structure modules however most of denitrification genes and bacteria coexistence a common module and network relations were more complex in this module thauera and azoarcus often coexist as dominant denitrifying genera in various wastewater treatment systems 43 in addition thauera carried the nirs and nosz genes with relevance degrees of 42 47 and 50 94 respectively azoarcus carried the nirk gene with a relevance degree of 49 74 these results illustrate that the decrease in c n ratios inhibited denitrification by decreasing the abundance of key functional genes and their hosts enzymes as the translation products of functional genes can accomplish important metabolic activities of nitrogen compounds the correlation analysis was performed between the functional enzymatic abundance and nitrogen compound concentrations under different c n ratios fig 5b there was a positive correlation between ammonium and nitrite oxidase ec 1 7 99 p 0 01 nitrate is closely related to nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 the decreasing abundance and increasing activity of nitrite oxidoreductase led to nitrate accumulation whereas the rising abundance and decreasing activity of nitrate reductase reduced the consumption of no3 n it is assumed that the role of the key enzymatic activity is greater than its abundance in nitrogen removal and this hypothesis needs to be proven in future research additionly there was a positive correlation between nitrate and ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 nitrite was positively correlated with hydroxylamine reductase ec 1 7 2 6 but negatively correlated with nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 strong linkages were observed in denitrification enzymes such as nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 and their positive associations promoted nitrogen removal however a negative relationship was observed between ammonia monooxygenase and nitrous oxide reductase activity p 0 01 4 conclusions the cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies of mbbr treating mariculture wastewater kept at 94 43 4 11 and 87 15 2 64 under different c n ratios respectively the effluent no3 n concentration increased from 0 19 to 7 16 mg l with the c n ratio from 6 to 3 lower c n ratios promoted the nitrification rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities whereas the denitrification process displayed the opposite results the changes of functional gene and enzyme abundance could explain the decrease of the denitrification rate and their corresponding enzymatic activity the decrease of c n ratios caused the change of microbial diversity and abundance especially for denitrifying bacteria the correlation analysis illustrated that the abundant nitrate reductase promoted nitrate transformation and the positive associations existed in some denitrification enzymes these results comprehensively revealed the influence mechanism of c n ratio on nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work acknowledgements the work was supported by the national natural

12613,the performance evaluation metagenomic analysis and microbial activity of a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr were performed in treating mariculture wastewater at different carbon nitrogen c n ratios the nitrification rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities gradually increased with the decrease of c n ratio from 6 to 3 whereas the denitrifying process showed the opposite results owing to the insufficiency of the carbon source the metagenomic analysis demonstrated that the abundance of functional genes and enzymes in the denitrification pathway decreased with the c n ratio from 6 to 3 the decrease in the abundance of key enzymes and genes in the denitrification process had adverse impacts on the nitrogen removal at low c n ratio the microbial diversity and richness were affected by the changes of c n ratios additionally the network analysis indicated that some denitrifying bacteria were considered to be the keystone taxa in the mbbr the correlation analysis illustrated that the abundant nitrate reductase promoted the nitrate transformation and the positive associations existed in some denitrification enzymes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbon nitrogen ratio mariculture wastewater metagenomic analysis functional gene enzymatic activity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the continuous demand for seafood and overfishing of marine fishery resources mariculture has become a fast growing industry in the past two decades 1 many closed and semi closed mariculture systems in coastal areas have been used for seafood farming in china owing to the water exchange in aquaculture systems lots of mariculture wastewater discharge into offshore waters feed residues and excreta of mariculture organisms cause rich suspended solids dissolved organic matter and nitrogenous compounds nh4 no2 and no3 in mariculture wastewater 2 mariculture wastewater without proper disposal can cause the eutrophication and biodiversity changes in offshore waters 3 4 consequently it is imperative to exploit an environmentally friendly and economical approach for treating mariculture wastewater physical methods can remove suspended solids from mariculture wastewater 5 such as filtration precipitation and foam fractionation but they do not effectively remove dissolved organic matter or nitrogenous compounds advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively oxidize organic substance and ammonia nitrogen such as ozone and uv irradiation 2 uv electro chlorine processes 6 and uv h2o2 oxidation 7 however aops cannot reduce nitrite and nitrate to nitrogen gas and their higher operation costs limit their application in practical engineering biological methods can effectively convert nitrogenous compounds into nitrogen gas through the nitrification and denitrification compared with physical and chemical methods biological methods such as biofilters 8 microbial fuel cells 9 and rotating biological contactors 2 have been recognized as cost effective and environmentally friendly technologies for the treatment of mariculture wastewater mariculture wastewater has higher salinity and lower carbon nitrogen c n ratio which has challenged conventional biological treatment methods moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr combines the advantages of activated sludge and biofilm through freely mobile suspended carriers in a bioreactor 10 in recent years mbbr has attracted widespread attention for the treatment of mariculture wastewater 11 mbbr can efficiently remove organic substances and nitrogenous compounds from mariculutre wastewater 12 13 mbbr performance during the treatment of mariculture wastewater can be affected by operational parameters and influent composition tada et al 14 evaluated the effects of nh4 n concentration hydraulic retention time hrt and filling ratio on the nitrogen removal performance of mbbr treating mariculture wastewater a previous research evaluated the effect of diverse biocarriers on the mbbr performance during treating mariculture wastewater 15 owing to different breeding modes and feed consumption the c n ratio in mariculture wastewater has some discrepancies in different aquaculture plants the nitrogen removal in biological wastewater treatment mainly includes nitrifying and denitrifying processes which is performed through the corresponding microbial genes and enzymes 16 17 based on the analysis of the relationships among the functional genes key microorganisms and enzymatic activities it can comprehensively understand the effects of the c n ratio on nitrification and denitrification in an mbbr treating mariculture wastewater in the current study the cod n ratio was replaced with the c n ratio due to the convenient measurement the present study aimed to i compare the performance and nitrogen conversion rate of an mbbr under different c n ratios ii evaluate key enzymatic activities at each c n ratio and iii reveal the nitrogen transformation mechanism from microbial communities metabolic pathways and functional genes by metagenomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbbr operation a lab scale mbbr with 7 7 l effective volume was 14 cm inner diameter and 50 cm effective height fig s1 which was filled with cylindrical polyethylene biological fillers at a 25 volume filling rate the diameter height and specific surface area of the biological filler were 25 mm 10 mm and 500 m2 m3 respectively the initial sludge was acquired from a municipal wwtp in qingdao china the operating procedure was as follows filling 5 min anoxic phase 0 5 h oxic phase 2 h anoxic phase 3 h settling 20 min and drainage 5 min the treated water was discharged by a solenoid valve and the volume exchange ratio of mbbr was 50 the hrt of mbbr was 12 h the influent ph was between 7 and 8 dissolved oxygen do was provided through an aeration pump at aerobic phase do was over 2 mg l at the oxic process and below 0 5 mg l at the anoxic process prior to treating the synthetic mariculture wastewater cylindrical polyethylene biological fillers were seeded using activated sludge the formed biofilms were acclimatized to sea salinity after biofilm acclimation the mbbr was used to treat the mariculture wastewater according to previous research 8 18 the concentrations of carbon source and nitrogen compounds were amended in this research the components of the synthetic mariculture wastewater was as follows mg l ch3coona 92 31 76 92 61 54 and 46 15 nh4cl 13 37 nano3 45 53 nano2 4 93 nahco3 50 kh2po4 8 75 and seawater

nitrite reducing rate snirr of the biofilm were determined based on the report of gao et al 20 which were summarized in text s1 the activities of ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir were analyzed as described by previous research 21 and the specific measurement procedures were showed in text s2 2 3 metagenomic analysis total genomic

the relationship between key enzymes and nitrogen compounds p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbbr performance under different c n ratios during the entire operational process the total nitrogen concentration in the synthetic mariculture wastewater was stabilized at approximately 12 mg l and the c n ratios declined from 6 to 3 along with average cod concentration from 73 03 to 37 01 mg l the cod removal efficiencies were 94 43 4 11 under c n ratios between 6 and 3 demonstrating that different c n ratios hardly affected the cod removal owing to low cod concentration fig 1a the effluent nh4 n concentration was lowered to 0 6 mg l except for the first 5 day suggesting that the change of c n ratios had no impact on the ammonia oxidation fig 1b at an average influent no3 n concentration of 7 48 mg l the effluent no3 n was 0 19 0 06 1 24 0 19 3 33 0 23 7 16 0 25 mg l under the c n ratios at 6 5 4 and 3 respectively fig 1c it s obvious that the effluent no3 n concentration rose as the decline of c n ratio which indicated that the content of organic matter at lower c n ratio could not meet the requirement of nitrate reduction during the denitrification process the average effluent no2 n concentrations were 0 13 1 12 1 31 and 0 mg l at c n ratios of 6 5 4 and 3 respectively fig 1d as no2 n mainly originated from the influent nitrification and nitrate reduction the variation of the effluent no2 n concentration under different c n ratios could be explained as follows 1 nitrite was almost entirely reduced to nitrogen gas at c n ratio of 6 because of the sufficient carbon source for nitrite reduction 2 the carbon source at c n ratios of 5 and 4 caused most of the no2 n to be reduced as nitrogen gas and 3 considering the influent and effluent nitrate only very few nitrate could be reduced as nitrite owing to the serious insufficiency of the carbon source under the c n ratio of 3 and led to lower effluent no2 n concentration at an average influent tn concentration of 12 01 mg l the effluent tn was 0 78 0 12 2 89 0 17 4 73 0 19 7 57 0 23 mg l under c n ratios at 6 5 4 and 3 respectively fig s3 the effluent tn concentration increased as the c n ratio declined this phenomenon could be explained that low c n ratio inhibited the denitrifying bacteria which led to the accumulation of no3 n and no2 n in the reactor 24 25 3 2 nitrogen removal rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities under different c n ratios the nitrogen conversion rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities were evaluated under different c n ratios fig 2 the saor and snor showed the increasing trends as the c n ratio decreased fig 2a the snor displayed a higher increase than the saor with the c n ratios from 6 to 3 as ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria are autotrophic microorganism low c n ratio may promote the nitrification process conversely the denitrification rates decreased when the c n ratio reduced fig 2b the snirr and snrr decreased as the c n ratio decreased as most denitrifying bacteria utilize organic matter as an electron donor to reduce nitrite and nitrate organic carbon source plays an essential role during the denitrification process lower c n ratio inhibited the snirr and snrr of the biofilm owing to the insufficiency of carbon source the activities of amo and nor increased as the c n ratio from 6 to 3 fig 2c the lower c n ratio in mariculture wastewater could heighten the nitrifying enzymatic activity and then promoted the nitrifying rate which was beneficial to the nitrification process conversely the nir and nr activities decreased with the c n ratio from 6 to 3 fig 2d lower c n ratio in mariculture wastewater inhibited the denitrifying enzymatic activity and then decreased the denitrifying rate owing to the deficiency of organic substances which was unfavorable for the denitrification process compared with c n ratio at 6 the activities of nr and nir reduced by 33 93 and 29 81 58 82 and 54 43 and 73 06 and 65 56 under c n ratio at 5 4 and 3 respectively the decrease of c n ratio generated more inhibitory effect on the nr activity than the nir activity the amo nor nr and nir activities had the similar varying tendencies to the saor snor snrr and snirr respectively the present results illustrated that the variation of enzymatic activities could vary the nitrification and denitrification rates and then further affected the nitrogen removal process 3 3 nitrogen metabolic pathways and functional genes under different c n ratios the metagenomes included complete functional genes encoding key enzymes related to nitrogen removal including nitrification m00528 and denitrification m00529 metagenomic analysis can qualify the abundance of the functional enzymes and describe them by their enzyme commission ec number fig 3a the seven major nitrogen transformation enzymes were ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 compared with the c n ratio of 6 the abundance of ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 increased by 41 85 and 236 44 121 78 and 163 16 and 104 18 and 110 22 under c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 respectively indicating that low c n ratios promoted positive impacts on ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase however the abundance of nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 decreased by 40 03 48 26 and 22 15 under c n ratios at 5 4 and 3 respectively nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 included nitrate reductase nitrite oxidase alpha beta and gamma subunits 26 which could determine enzyme abundance in the denitrification process compared with the c n ratio of 6 the nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 abundance reduced by 46 00 59 19 and 49 75 under c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 respectively likewise the abundance of nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 declined by 43 42 and 28 86 61 64 and 58 34 and 39 94 and 48 52 corresponding to c n ratio at 5 4 and 3 respectively the insufficiency of organic substances at low c n ratios decreased the abundance of denitrifying enzymes which led to nitrite accumulation at c n ratios of 5 and 4 compared with c n ratio of 4 the increase of these denitrifying enzyme abundances caused a decrease in no2 n concentration under c n ratio of 3 including nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 nevertheless the increase in denitrifying enzyme abundance caused a decrease in no2 n concentration under a c n ratio of 3 this demonstrated a low c n ratio affected adversely enzymes during the denitrification process additionly thenitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 abundance fluctuated within a certain range the changes of enzymes revealed the impacts of the c n ratios on nitrogen transformation at protein level but many nitrogen functional genes coded a corresponding enzyme in common the analysis of nitrogen functional genes based on ncycdb database can provide further understanding of nitrogen transformation at dna level 27 28 the genes abundance for nitrogen removal were determined using the ncycdb database in this study fig 3b including nitrification amoabc hao and nxrab and denitrification narghijvwyz napabc nirks norbc and nosz the sequences of each gene under different c n ratios are also shown in table s4 among the total annotated sequences at 82 284 062 the sequence numbers related to nitrification and denitrification were 8380 and 267 727 respectively in general the completion of the nitrification process follows three phases 1 ammonia monooxygenase genes amoabc catalyze the oxidation of nh4 n to nh2oh 2 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase gene hao catalyzes the oxidation of nh2oh to no2 n and 3 nitrite oxidoreductase genes nxrab catalyze the oxidation reduction of nitrite the abundance of amoabc was the highest under c n ratio at 3 and the sequences of amoabc were 216 283 247 and 478 corresponding to c n ratio at 6 5 4 and 3 respectively suggesting that low c n ratio promoted the ammonia oxidation process the abundance of hao and nxrab displayed similar trends to those of hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 and nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 respectively the increased abundance of nitrification genes at low c n ratios leads to nitrate accumulation similarly pan et al 29 illustrated that the abundance of amoabc and hao genes in an mbbr elevated as the c n ratio decline in the denitrification pathway membrane binding nar and periplasm nap nitrate reductase can catalyze the reduction of no3 to no2 compared to the c n ratio at 6 the total abundance of nitrate reduction genes narghijvwyz and napabc decreased by 38 64 43 05 and 23 26 under c n ratios at 5 4 and 3 respectively the abundance of nitrite reduction genes nirks and nitric oxide reduction genes norbc declined by 38 73 and 39 78 52 07 and 46 36 and 41 83 and 29 12 under c n ratios at 5 4 and 3 respectively the abundance changes for the nitrous oxide reduction gene nosz were similar to those of the nitrite and nitric oxide reduction genes nirks and norbc overall the decrease in the key enzymes and genes abundance of the denitrification process had a detrimental effect on nitrogen removal at low c n ratios 3 4 microbial shift under different c n ratios by searching the ncbi nr database 812 019 reads were classified as bacteria 99 39 archaea 0 31 and eukaryota 0 12 principal co ordinates analysis displayed that it explained 94 35 of the changes in the bacterial community fig s2 the samples of the c n ratios at 6 5 4 and 3 did not cluster together which indicated that the changes of c n ratios could result in a microbial shift the impact of the c n ratio on the microbial community was analyzed at phylum class and genus levels fig 4 five main phyla under different c n ratios were proteobacteria 38 67 55 55 bacteroidetes 12 51 20 04 chloroflexi 5 10 8 16 planctomycetes 3 56 4 21 and cyanobacteria 0 87 2 10 fig 4a since many heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria 30 the decrease of proteobacteria abundance at low c n ratio affected the denitrifying process the relative abundance of bacteroidetes chloroflexi and planctomycetes showed slight fluctuations under different c n ratios chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are capable of degrading organic substances 31 planctomycetes are capable of degrading organics and their genomes encode nitrogen removal 32 the relative abundance of cyanobacteria gradually increased as the c n ratio decreased which might be due to their greater adaptability to extreme environments 33 the abundance of nitrospirae increased gradually as the c n ratio decreased four dominant classes of the phylum proteobacteria were betaproteobacteria 3 57 28 37 gammaproteobacteria 10 78 14 06 alphaproteobacteria 8 30 13 09 and deltaproteobacteria 2 52 4 34 fig 4b compared to c n ratio of 6 the betaproteobacteria abundance of decreased by 15 14 24 80 and 16 60 under c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 respectively the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria fluctuated within a certain range under different c n ratios saprospiria flavobacteriia and cytophagia formed the major classes in bacteroidetes and the phylum chloroflexi was dominated by anaerolineae and ardenticatenia zhai et al 34 reported that anaerolineae plays an important role in nitrogen removal as displayed in fig 4c the total top 50 genera abundance decreased as the c n ratio decreased the top 10 genera in each sample are underlined in red and more detailed information is shown in table s5 thauera lewinella and promineofilum were the top 10 genera thauera was the richest at a c n ratio of 6 but lewinella became the richest at c n ratios of 5 4 and 3 thauera is the dominant denitrifying bacteria 35 36 the relative abundance of nitrosomonas were 0 25 0 25 0 20 and 0 32 at c n ratios of 6 5 4 and 3 respectively the relative abundance of nitrospira species rose as the c n ratio decreased nitrosomonas and nitrosospira are capable of oxidizing nh4 n to no2 n 37 nitrospira can oxidize no2 n to no3 n 38 the relative abundance for some genera gently reduced as c n ratio decreased including pseudomonas hyphomonas marinicella pseudoruegeria aequorivita psychroserpens fuerstia flavobacterium altibacter and ulvibacter pseudomonas produces extracellular lipases and converts organic compounds into available substances 39 marinicella can convert no3 n into n2 in high salinity wastewater 40 3 5 microbial contributions to nitrogen removal the correlation between the nitrogen removal genes and microbial genera was revealed by the network analysis fig 5a the relevance degree reflects the contribution of host genera to nitrogen removal genes in the nitrification and denitrification processes 41 42 the network included 50 genera and 22 nitrogen functional genes with 371 connections among which 31 genera were potential hosts and were associated with nitrogen metabolic genes by 175 linkages it is clear that a modular structure was presented in this network analysis especially in the nitrification and denitrification genes and the host bacteria in the nitrification process the functional genes and their hosts were clearly distributed in three modules the amoabc and nxra genes and their hosts belonged to one module and the hao and nxrb genes were present in the other two modules nitrosomonas was related to the amoa and nxra genes suggesting that they play a crucial role in the nitrification process nitrospira was closely related to the nxrb narg and narh genes which is in line with a previous report 42 in addition the nitrification genes were linked with some denitrifying bacteria such as roseovarius sedimentitalea and marinobacter the functional metabolism of nitrification genes causes the accumulation of intermediate products nitrite and nitrate and enhances the activity of denitrifying bacteria compared to the nitrification process a more complex network occurred during the denitrification process some functional bacteria were assigned seven genes including litorilinea caldilinea dechloromonas sorangium woeseia candidatus accumulibacter zoogloea azoarcus and thauera which were considered as hubs in the mbbr system notably strong associations existed between these denitrifying bacteria and their co occurrence reflected the impacts of c n on the denitrification the modular structure of network analysis showed the different impacts of c n ratio on nitrification and denitrification some nitrification genes and bacteria belonged to two simple structure modules however most of denitrification genes and bacteria coexistence a common module and network relations were more complex in this module thauera and azoarcus often coexist as dominant denitrifying genera in various wastewater treatment systems 43 in addition thauera carried the nirs and nosz genes with relevance degrees of 42 47 and 50 94 respectively azoarcus carried the nirk gene with a relevance degree of 49 74 these results illustrate that the decrease in c n ratios inhibited denitrification by decreasing the abundance of key functional genes and their hosts enzymes as the translation products of functional genes can accomplish important metabolic activities of nitrogen compounds the correlation analysis was performed between the functional enzymatic abundance and nitrogen compound concentrations under different c n ratios fig 5b there was a positive correlation between ammonium and nitrite oxidase ec 1 7 99 p 0 01 nitrate is closely related to nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 the decreasing abundance and increasing activity of nitrite oxidoreductase led to nitrate accumulation whereas the rising abundance and decreasing activity of nitrate reductase reduced the consumption of no3 n it is assumed that the role of the key enzymatic activity is greater than its abundance in nitrogen removal and this hypothesis needs to be proven in future research additionly there was a positive correlation between nitrate and ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 nitrite was positively correlated with hydroxylamine reductase ec 1 7 2 6 but negatively correlated with nitrite oxidoreductase ec 1 7 99 strong linkages were observed in denitrification enzymes such as nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 and their positive associations promoted nitrogen removal however a negative relationship was observed between ammonia monooxygenase and nitrous oxide reductase activity p 0 01 4 conclusions the cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies of mbbr treating mariculture wastewater kept at 94 43 4 11 and 87 15 2 64 under different c n ratios respectively the effluent no3 n concentration increased from 0 19 to 7 16 mg l with the c n ratio from 6 to 3 lower c n ratios promoted the nitrification rates and their corresponding enzymatic activities whereas the denitrification process displayed the opposite results the changes of functional gene and enzyme abundance could explain the decrease of the denitrification rate and their corresponding enzymatic activity the decrease of c n ratios caused the change of microbial diversity and abundance especially for denitrifying bacteria the correlation analysis illustrated that the abundant nitrate reductase promoted nitrate transformation and the positive associations existed in some denitrification enzymes these results comprehensively revealed the influence mechanism of c n ratio on nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work acknowledgements the work was supported by the national natural

12614,anaerobic digestion is a promising sustainable method for treating highly concentrated organic wastewater from the point of energy recovery in this study a pilot scale internal circulation ic reactor was constructed to investigate the key regulative parameters that guaranteed the stable and efficient treatment of incineration leachate the ic reactor was operated for 77 d by feeding real incineration leachate with an organic load rate olr of 30 kg m3 d and an influent ph value of 7 5 the reactor achieved its highest organic removal loading rate orlr and biogas yield of 21 kg m3 d and 6 3 m3 d respectively the kinetic analysis confirmed that the two key parameters that significantly correlated p 0 05 with the methane yield and r max of sludge were olr and influent ph value key enzyme activity of f420 increased 33 2 when olr was raised but decreased by 5 6 when influent ph was lowered to 6 8 further demonstrating the need for control over these two operational parameters of ic reactor high throughput sequencing results indicated that acetotrophic methanogen methanosaeta had an overwhelming relative abundance of over 47 2 in the entire community of all sludge samples nevertheless the enrichment of unclassified bacteroidales and methanobacterium strengthened hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm with step raise of olr to 30 kg m3 d then increased the methane production potential and f420 activity of sludge this study proposed a referable regulation method for the treatment of the actual landfill leachate via ic reactor graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords incineration landfill leachate anaerobic digestion key operational parameters organic load rate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction waste incineration technology has many advantages such as recycling energy and rapid reduction of waste volume so it is deemed optimal for municipal solid waste msw management and has been widely and rapidly deployed in china 1 by 2018 msw incineration accounted for a higher proportion of 50 of total msw treatment in china 2 however short term storage of msw could generate large quantities of leachate which contained high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen volatile fatty acids vfas and heavy metals 3 the leachate should be properly treated before being discharged to declining its environmental risks anaerobic digestion ad is always used for the primary treatment of raw incineration leachate to remove high concentration organic matter due to its efficient energy recovery and lower energy consumption nowadays various ad processes had been used for the disposal of leachate for instance up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor 4 and expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor 5 had been used in treating food leachate and msw leachate respectively anaerobic biofilm process was also used in leachate treatment such as anaerobic membrane bioreactor ambr 6 and anaerobic filter reactor abr 7 nevertheless raw incineration leachate not only had a high concentration of pollutants but also had a great change in water quality and quantity with the seasons this fact required that the ad reactors had excellent impact resistance and internal circulation ic reactor had a two stage anaerobic reaction zone that maximizes the retention of the anaerobic bacterial species thus having a higher organic loading rate olr greater stress resistance and operation stability 8 to achieve a fast start as well as efficient and stable operation of ic reactor operation parameter regulation was indispensible notably high levels of free ammonia nitrogen fan and vfas were the most sensitive variables in raw incineration leachate treatment that could inhibit methanogens 9 these negative factors might cause an imbalance in vfas production and consumption resulting in reactor acidification and reduction of methane production therefore the main purpose of the reactor parameter regulation was to improve the organic matter removal rate meantime reduce the vfas and fan concentrations for enhancing the reactor stability using incineration leachate as the substrate of ad lei et al found that the methane production was positively related to the olr 4 4 28 6 kg m3 d 10 but further raising olr to 36 7 kg m3 d could led to the accumulation of vfas 11 the result revealed that appropriate olr enabled the reactor to maintain a high methane production yield meantime ensuring the stable operation of the reactor a common essential strategy to reduce fan inhibition was ph regulation 12 the concentration of fan decreased from 100 8 mg l to 37 0 mg l with a ph drop from 7 6 to 7 2 which might significantly lessen the inhibition of fan on methanogens and speed up the consumption of vfas further lowering the risk of reactor acidification 13 besides ic reactor provided an up flow velocity via internal circulation but the external circulation was quite needed when the reactor was started up or the gas production of reactor was insufficient and the up flow velocity of 2 5 m h seemed to provide a better mixed state in ad reactor 14 thereby optimizing the up flow velocity provided by external circulation was quite important to improve mixing uniformity and reduce energy consumption based on the above analyses the most crucial operating parameters of the ic reactor that needed to be controlled for treating raw incinerator leachate were olr up flow velocity and influent ph value however it is uncertain the effect of operational parameters on the anaerobic digestion performance of the ic reactor while and how they affect microbial function has also rarely been studied in this study raw incineration leachate was treated by a pilot ic reactor and the key parameters that could strengthen reactor performance were specifically explored clearly the primary objectives of this study were 1 to demonstrate cod removal performance and methane production yield under different operation parameters 2 to identify the key parameters that affect the methane yield and methane production rate via kinetic analysis 3 to reveal how the key operational parameters influence the sludge methanogenic activity by analyzing key enzymatic activity of sludge and functional microbial structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 seeded sludge and raw incineration leachate the seeded sludge was obtained from a full scale up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor treating sugars and starches wastewater henan china the anaerobic granular sludge angs particle size ranged from 1 to 2 5 mm with a volatile solid vs to total solid ts ratio of 0 67 raw incineration leachate was drawn straight from the regulating tank of the leachate treatment station in the incineration plant henan china and its characteristics are as follows cod 28891 8646 mg l ammonia nh4 n 1416 310 mg l phosphate po4 3 p 12 3 mg l ph 7 27 0 21 vfas 168 56 mmol l alkalinity alk 126 21 mmol l ts 11730 2310 mg l 2 2 reactor set up and operation conditions a pilot scale ic reactor was established with a schematic diagram shown in fig s1 from bottom to top ic reactor was composed of an influent distribution system primary gas liquid solid separator second gas liquid solid separator and gas liquid separator while the pipe system included influent and effluent pipes internal and external circulation pipelines and a gas recovery pipeline thereinto when the internal circulation could not provide a sufficient up flow velocity the up flow velocity in the reactor would be provided by the external circulation for wastewater and sludge sampling five sampling valves were installed at 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 6 and 2 0 m respectively the working volume of ic reactor was 0 25 m3 with an internal diameter of 0 4 m and a height of 2 0 m raw incineration leachate was continuously treated in ic reactor under a constant temperature of 33 2 c and the operational process was divided into 3 stages in the whole operation period of 77 d table 1 2 3 analytical methods the collected water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane for measurement of cod vfas alk nh4 n po4 3 p the above indexes as well as ts vs were analyzed according to standard methods 15 and ph value was measured by a digital ph mv meter phb 4 leici the biogas was collected using a gas collecting bag and its yield and composition were then determined using a drainage method supplementary materials in addition samples of sludge from each stage were taken to determine the activity of coenzyme f420 16 2 4 kinetics modeling furthermore the obtained data of batch tests details in supporting information were fitted by the modified gompertz model eq 1 17 1 m t p 0 exp exp r max e p 0 λ t 1 where m t is the cumulative ch4 production at time t ml ch4 g cod added p 0 is the maximum methane potential ml ch4 g cod added r max is the maximum ch4 production rate ml ch4 d g cod added λ is the lag phase time d and e is 2 71828 2 5 high throughput sequencing sludge sample was collected at 0 4 1 2 and 2 0 m thereafter was mixed evenly for microbial community analysis table 1 dna was extracted by the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit and then the universal primer 314f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify the v3 v4 region of bacterial while 340f ccctayggggygcascag and 1000r ggccatgcacywcytctc were used to amplify and the v3 v4 region of archaeal 16s rdna genes respectively dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were conducted by following previous studies 18 after miseq sequencing chimeras and low quality sequences were eliminated with uchime and mothur to obtain effective sequences operational taxonomic units otus were got by clustering similar sequences of 97 similarity principal analysis pca based on the bray curtis distance matrix was drawn on http www ehbio com imagegp the sequences obtained in this investigation can be found with the accession number prjna871085 in the ncbi sequence read archive 2 6 statistical analysis statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism 9 the data of bmp test were analyzed by two way anvoa while the f420 activities of sludges were compared via one way anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance under different operational parameters 3 1 1 effects of organic loading rate ic reactor continuously fed raw incineration leachate was operated for 55 d fig 1 in fact the quality of raw incinerator leachate varied widely because the wastewater was injected from the actual leachate treatment station and influent cod of ic reactor ranged from 30 000 to 45 000 mg l the organic loading rates olrs of ic reactor increased from 10 kg m3 d to 30 kg m3 d by gradually reducing the hydraulic retention time hrt table 1 with an enhanced olr from 10 kg m3 d to 15 kg m3 d effluent cod was kept at roughly 5000 mg l during the start up phase of the ic reactor 0 15 d and biogas yield and organic removal loading rate orlr increased to over 0 9 m3 d and 12 5 kg m3 d respectively the result meant that the seeded sludge in the reactor was able to swiftly adapt to the landfill leachate with a cod removal efficiency of over 85 in addition the vfas concentration was consistently 50 mmol l whereas the alk concentration rose to around 180 mmol l anaerobic digestion ad stability is typically evaluated using the vfas alk value with the optimum value thought to be below 0 3 0 4 19 even though the influent ph decreased to 7 0 on the 15th day the vfas alk value remained below 0 35 and the effluent ph remained at 7 8 demonstrating the reactor s good stability additionally during this stage the tfan concentration exceeded 100 mg l and even reached 162 mg l which could be harmful to microorganisms 13 effluent cod increased to 7500 mg l with a 10 reduction in removal efficiency when the olr grew to 20 kg m3 d over 15 30 d despite this the orlr and methane production increased by 18 8 and 55 5 at 30th d demonstrating the overall anaerobic digestion ad capacity of ic reactor was enhanced however the anaerobic digestion performance of the reactor was unstable at 22 5 25 5 d especially the proportion of methane in biogas declined by 18 with an accumulation of vfas to 72 5 mmol l at 24th d indicating the methanogenesis process was hindered by high vfas concentrations 13 meanwhile the effluent ph value dropped by 0 4 while the vfas alk ratio increased to 0 4 demonstrating that the ic reactor was in an acidification crisis 19 the reason for the fluctuations in reactor performance at 22 5 25 5 d might be that henan province in china experienced a once in a lifetime flood and the temperature in the reactor plummeted to 28 c despite the presence of a heater negatively impacting methanogens 20 during 30 55 d the cod and vfas concentrations in effluent fluctuated greatly as the olr climbed to 25 and 30 kg m3 d vfas were rapidly accumulated following each increment in olr reaching 100 mmol l on the 45th d at the same time the effluent ph decreased to 7 4 and the vfas alk value increased to 0 7 suggesting that the reactor was in danger of becoming acidified despite this the overall gas yield continued to rise eventually reaching 6 3 m3 d with a constant proportion of methane of 72 75 demonstrating that the ic reactor s methanogenesis ability was constantly increased acetoclastic methanogens would be inhibited under high vfas while hydrogen formate utilizing methanogens had higher tolerance 21 as a result the accumulated vfas were constantly consumed and the final concentration dropped to 50 mmol l demonstrating the steady anaerobic digestion of ic reactor might be related to the shift of methanogenesis microorganisms but the ultimate orlr of 21 kg m3 d at 55th d had no obvious improvement compared to it at 41th d showing the extreme ad capacity of the reactor this orlr was quite similar to the value in another study which also used ic reactor for treating raw incineration leachate 8 an additional increase in olr might cause the collapse of ic reactor 3 1 2 effects of up flow velocity external circulation was set up to provide part of up flow velocity to compensate for the uneven reactor mixing caused by insufficient power of the internal circulation a reasonable setting of external circulation flow could provide better reaction conditions for ic reactor with reducing external circulation flow the up flow velocity decreased stepwise from 8 4 m3 h to 4 0 m3 h and 1 6 m3 h respectively table 1 when the up flow velocity reduced to 4 m h during 55 61 d ic reactor got orlr of 20 7 kg m3 d and total gas production of 6 1 m3 d fig 2 which was like the ad performance at 55th d in addition the effluent vfas were kept below 50 mmol l while the ph value was maintained at around 7 8 showing the high stability of ic reactor under high olr with the up flow velocity further reduced to 1 6 m h the reactor remained stable with vfas concentrations below 50 mmol l and vfas alk values below 0 3 despite this the reactor s orlr of 19 5 kg m3 d and gas generation of 5 7 m3 d suggested that its performance was negatively affected the main explanation could be that insufficient up flow velocity caused angs cumuli which then caused an uneven mass transfer and directly affected the reactor s ad performance in conclusion when compared to up flow velocity of 8 4 m h and 1 6 m h the up flow velocity of 4 m h could not only match the reactor s present mixing state but also lower the ic reactor s energy consumption which was relatively close to the previous study 22 3 1 3 effects of influent ph value fan a toxic substance created by a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen in raw landfill leachate could inhibit methanogens reduced influent ph would lead to significantly lower fan concentrations but the ad system ran the risk of becoming acidic when the influent ph was adjusted to 7 2 the fan concentration in the reactor was reduced by 56 with an effluent ph of around 7 6 fig 3e even the effluent alk concentration reduced to 180 mmol l fig 3c unchanged orlr of 20 kg m3 d fig 3a and biogas production of 6 m3 d fig 3b confirmed the stability of the ad system with vfas alk value of 0 2 the fan concentration fell to 10 mg l when the influent ph further fell to 6 8 however the effluent alk concentration and ph fell to 110 mmol l and 6 8 respectively resulting in a higher vfas alk value of 0 5 on the 77th d the acidic environment of the reactor which could hinder the methanogenesis activity led to the reduction of orlr and biogas yield to 11 kg m3 d and 3 6 m3 d respectively lowering influent ph value reduced fan concentration alleviating the inhibition of fan on methanogens whereas a lower ph value of 6 8 would destroy the buffer environment resulting in deterioration of the reactor 19 3 2 methane producing potential bio methane potential assays bmp assays were used to measure the methane producing potentials of s0 s8 in order to further demonstrate the impact of operational factors on the performance of the ic reactor and the data obtained were fitted using the gompertz model fig s2 the most important kinetic parameters were gathered and fitted into a linear kinetic model for direct comparison 22 fig 4 the results of the fitting showed a substantial p 0 05 connection between olr influent ph and methane yield r max respectively indicating that these two parameters were the most important ones that needed to be regulated when the ic reactor was operating thereinto methane yield and r max grew concurrently with rising olr reaching their highest values at 508 5 ml ch4 g cod added and 208 4 ml ch4 g cod added respectively when the olr was 30 kg m3 d fig 4a the methanogenesis capacity of sludge was significantly enhanced with the continuous raising of olr exhibiting the angs were domesticated success in contrast methane yield declined from 506 4 ml ch4 g cod added to 496 8 ml ch4 g cod added when influent ph dropped to 6 8 while r max considerably decreased to 167 9 ml ch4 g cod added fig 4c the results indicated that despite the concentration of the hazardous component tfan might be decreased a lower influent ph value would result in an acidic environment that could inhibit the methanogenic activity of the sludge additionally compared to s4 neither the p0 nor r max values of s5 nor s6 showed any clear differences p 0 05 fig 4b meaning that the methanogenesis performance of the sludge was unaffected lowering up flow velocity might just hinder the mass transfer of ic reactor but had no inhibition on methanogens activity based on the above data it could be confirmed that olr and influent ph value were the key parameters that influence methanogenesis performance instead of up flow velocity 3 3 enzyme activity of f420 coenzyme f420 was the key enzyme for demonstrating the methane synthesis potential to some extent could reflect the capacity of methane production 23 to deeply demonstrate the crucial factors influencing the methanogens activity of sludge nine sludge enzyme activities were detected fig 5 therein the f420 activity of s4 increased by 33 2 to s1 p 0 05 which is consistent with s4 having the highest methanogenic potential and rate in 3 2 the result showed that raising olr could enhance the activity of essential enzymes hence improving the methanogenic efficiency of anaerobic systems the influent ph on the other hand had a clear inhibition on the methanogenesis process p 0 05 f420 enzyme was reduced by 5 6 at low ph of 6 8 demonstrating that the acidic environment inhibited the methanogenic activity of the sludge and decreased methane synthesis 24 which in turn led to the accumulation of vfas in the reactor and reactor deterioration moreover a decrease in up flow velocity had no discernible effect on the f420 activities of s4 s6 p 0 05 therefore the little decrease in methane production in the ic reactor that occurred when the up flow velocity dropped to 1 6 m h might have been caused by reduced mass transfer rather than impaired sludge methanogenic activity the changes in f420 activities supported the hypotheses in 3 2 which proposed that olr and influent ph were the key operational parameters that needed to be controlled 3 4 overview of microbial diversity and taxonomic identification to further explore how key operational parameters affect the anaerobic digestion performance of ic reactors eight sludge samples obtained from the ic reactor at various stages were analyzed using high throughput sequencing based on the bray curtis analysis of samples the β diversity of bacteria was illustrated in fig s3a and fig s3b s1 s3 migrated away from s4 showing that increased influent olr could substantially alter the microbial population furthermore samples s4 s6 were gathered but separated from s7 and s8 showing that the influent ph was the more important operational parameter influencing the microbial population under high influent olr the β diversity of archaea in eight samples on the other hand was considerably different except for s3 s1 s8 congregated near pcoa2 axis indicating that the change in reactor operation had no significant influence on the archaeal population at the phylum level fig s4 chloroflexi bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria were the major phyla in all samples which account for over 73 of whole community thereinto the abundances of chloroflexi and bacteroidetes raised along with the increase of olr demonstrating that the improvement in the acidogenesis capacity of sludge 25 while the enrichment of euryarchaeota in archaea community in s4 s6 revealed that the methanogenesis ability of sludge were also enhanced 26 the microbial community structure of bacteria and archaea was characterized at the genus level to further exhibit the relationship between functional bacteria and reactor operational parameters bacteria in sludge were classified according to their potential function hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria fig 6a acetogenic bacteria fig 6b syntrophic vfa oxidizing bacteria fig 6c acetoclastic methanogens fig 6d and hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig 6e some microorganisms were enriched in all sludge samples during reactor operation including unclassified anaerolineaceae unclassified bacteria unclassified firmicutes unclassified clostridiales unclassified ruminococcaceae aminivibrio etc they made up a large proportion of 55 4 61 6 51 9 55 1 53 3 57 44 1 and 51 of total in s1 s8 respectively all of them were common fermenting bacteria in anaerobic digesters playing a role in the conversion of organic materials like protein and amino acids to short chain fatty acids and h2 27 31 unclassified anaerolineaceae most enriched in s4 s5 while unclassified clostridiales had higher proportion in s1 s3 and s7 s8 their enrichment enhanced the performance of hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes of ic reactor with different operational parameters and ensured the conversion of organic compounds in raw incineration leachate into vfas the bacteria that converted organic matters into acetate h2 and co2 were quite different in s1 s3 s4 s5 and s7 s8 unclassified bacteroidales which was said to contribute to the breakdown of macromolecular organic matter with acetate serving as the primary fermentation product 32 showed increased proportions of over 20 of s4 s6 with increasing olr its enrichment might provide methanogens additional reaction substrate unlike this unclassified syntrophobacteraceae occupied higher percentages of the total in s1 s3 and s8 at 12 3 6 8 3 and 3 4 respectively unclassified syntrophobacteraceae might help in the removal of accumulated acids with a lower olr and influent ph value since the family syntrophobacteraceae phylum proteobacteria was found to have syntrophic propionate oxidizers 33 syntrophic bacteria might generate h2 and acetate from non acetic vfas but they could also develop a syntrophic metabolism with methanogens particularly syntrophomonas and desulfovibrio both had highly expressed genes for e pili or flagella which might improve hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis by extracellular electron transfer eet 34 35 however a higher proportion of desulfovibrio and syntrophomonas over 2 0 in s1 s3 and 6 5 in s7 s8 revealed how the functioning syntrophic bacteria behaved when exposed to high tfan concentrations about 150 mg l or acidic conditions the conversion of the key acetogenic bacteria from syntrophic bacteria to unclassified bacteroidales might be related to the vfas concentrations within ic reactor with an olr of 30 kg m3 d the vfas concentration reached about 100 mmol l which was sufficient to inhibit syntrophic bacteria 24 additionally the acetogenic bacteria did not alter when the up flow velocity of the ic reactor was reduced indicating that it was not a crucial operational factor that affected the microbial population the archaeal community exhibited that methanothrix methanosarcina methanobacterium methanolinea and methanoculleus were the dominant methanogens and occupied over 75 of total archaea in s4 the proportion of methanobacterium grew by 17 6 while the abundance of methanothrix decreased by 15 4 compared to s1 methanothrix was said to be a purely acetoclastic methanogen and to have a higher affinity for acetate 36 but a high concentration of vfas might clearly hinder it 24 whereas methanobacterium the hydrogen formate using methanogens was more resistant to a high vfas concentration 1 and could therefore be enhanced in s4 with roughly 100 mmol l vfas the changes in their abundance in s1 s4 exhibited that the methane generation capacity of sludge notably the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm was enhanced via sludge acclimation with raising olr furthermore methanolinea methanosarcina and methanoculleus had higher proportions of 1 4 1 6 and 1 4 respectively which made up for the depletion of methanobacterium in s7 in addition methanothrix accounted for 65 6 whereas the proportion of methanobacterium reduced to 11 6 in s8 syntrophomonas could provide more acetate for methanothrix thus these two microorganisms guaranteed the methanogenic capacity of ic reactors at low ph through a syntrophic system 34 consistently compared to s4 methanothrix and methanobacterium were still major archaea in s5 and s6 and accounted for 91 8 and 91 7 respectively implying that the decline of up flow velocity of ic reactor had no obvious impact on methanogens community 3 5 mechanism of ad under operational parameters controlling based on the above findings and conclusions a mechanism of strengthening the methanogenic capacity of the ic reactor by regulating the key parameters was proposed fig 7 during the operation of ic reactor unclassified anaerolineaceae unclassified bacteria unclassified firmicutes unclassified ruminococcaceae aminivibrio always were the dominant hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria and contributed to vfas production and the shift of functional microorganisms in ad system began with acetogens and methanogens in stage i with the lower olr of 15 25 kg m3 d the main inhibition factor was 150 mg l tfan brought by high concentrations of ammonia and a ph value of around 7 8 in the ic reactor in this situation unclassified syntrophobacteraceae and desulfovibrio played a key role in the oxidation of vfas and provided acetate for methanothrix exhibiting a weak pathway of syntrophic methanogenesis in ic reactor however when the olr grew to 30 kg m3 d the accumulation of vfas and high concentration fan produced a dual inhibition on the activities of syntrophic bacteria and methanothrix meantime unclassified bacteroidales and methanobacterium which could tolerate the inhibitory environments enriched in s4 and formed a strong pathway of methanogenesis the highest methane producing potential and activity of f420 also proved that the shift of the core functional microorganisms enhanced the methanogenesis capacity of ic reactor besides the fact that the microbial communities in s4 s6 during stage ii were largely similar further suggests that mass transfer between microorganisms rather than microbiological function was affected by the change in up flow velocity which led to a decrease in methane generation on the 66th d in addition regulation of influent ph value in stage iii indeed reduced the fan concentration to below 50 mg l which declined the toxicity of the fan however the acidic environment caused by lowest influent ph value of 6 8 could inhibit unclassified bacteroidales and methanobacterium even though syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanosarcina were enriched the reduction of f420 activity and accumulation of vfas revealed that this syntrophic methanogenesis system was a weak methanogenesis pathway in order to ensure maximum efficacy and minimal energy consumption during the treatment of landfill leachate in an ic reactor it was noticeable from the methanogenic pathway under various conditions that controlling the olr and influent ph was a vital operation 4 conclusion pilot scale internal circulation ic reactor were successfully set up to treat raw incineration leachate and the key regulative parameters were identified two most important ic reactor operational parameters that required to be controlled for were olr and influent ph value with the optimal olr of 30 kg m3 d and influent ph value of 7 5 the orlr and biogas yield raised to 21 kg m3 d and 6 3 m3 d respectively and the f420 activity got the highest value of 0 9113 0 0358 u mol g ss when olr raising from 10 to 30 kg m3 d the methane yield and r max grew to the highest values at 508 5 ml ch4 g cod added and 208 4 ml ch4 g cod added respectively thereinto the enrichment of unclassified bacteroidales 24 4 and methanobacterium 37 8 which enhanced hm contributed to the improvement of methane production potential decreasing influent ph value to 6 8 resulted in an acid environment which inhibited microbial activity and decreased orlr and biogas production to 11 kg m3 d and 3 6 m3 d respectively and the syntrophic system consisting of syntrophomonas 6 5 and methanosaeta 65 6 became the predominant methanogenesis pathway declaration of competing interest the authors

12614,anaerobic digestion is a promising sustainable method for treating highly concentrated organic wastewater from the point of energy recovery in this study a pilot scale internal circulation ic reactor was constructed to investigate the key regulative parameters that guaranteed the stable and efficient treatment of incineration leachate the ic reactor was operated for 77 d by feeding real incineration leachate with an organic load rate olr of 30 kg m3 d and an influent ph value of 7 5 the reactor achieved its highest organic removal loading rate orlr and biogas yield of 21 kg m3 d and 6 3 m3 d respectively the kinetic analysis confirmed that the two key parameters that significantly correlated p 0 05 with the methane yield and r max of sludge were olr and influent ph value key enzyme activity of f420 increased 33 2 when olr was raised but decreased by 5 6 when influent ph was lowered to 6 8 further demonstrating the need for control over these two operational parameters of ic reactor high throughput sequencing results indicated that acetotrophic methanogen methanosaeta had an overwhelming relative abundance of over 47 2 in the entire community of all sludge samples nevertheless the enrichment of unclassified bacteroidales and methanobacterium strengthened hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm with step raise of olr to 30 kg m3 d then increased the methane production potential and f420 activity of sludge this study proposed a referable regulation method for the treatment of the actual landfill leachate via ic reactor graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords incineration landfill leachate anaerobic digestion key operational parameters organic load rate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction waste incineration technology has many advantages such as recycling energy and rapid reduction of waste volume so it is deemed optimal for municipal solid waste msw management and has been widely and rapidly deployed in china 1 by 2018 msw incineration accounted for a higher proportion of 50 of total msw treatment in china 2 however short term storage of msw could generate large quantities of leachate which contained high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen volatile fatty acids vfas and heavy metals 3 the leachate should be properly treated before being discharged to declining its environmental risks anaerobic digestion ad is always used for the primary treatment of raw incineration leachate to remove high concentration organic matter due to its efficient energy recovery and lower energy consumption nowadays various ad processes had been used for the disposal of leachate for instance up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor 4 and expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor 5 had been used in treating food leachate and msw leachate respectively anaerobic biofilm process was also used in leachate treatment such as anaerobic membrane bioreactor ambr 6 and anaerobic filter reactor abr 7 nevertheless raw incineration leachate not only had a high concentration of pollutants but also had a great change in water quality and quantity with the seasons this fact required that the ad reactors had excellent impact resistance and internal circulation ic reactor had a two stage anaerobic reaction zone that maximizes the retention of the anaerobic bacterial species thus having a higher organic loading rate olr greater stress resistance and operation stability 8 to achieve a fast start as well as efficient and stable operation of ic reactor operation parameter regulation was indispensible notably high levels of free ammonia nitrogen fan and vfas were the most sensitive variables in raw incineration leachate treatment that could inhibit methanogens 9 these negative factors might cause an imbalance in vfas production and consumption resulting in reactor acidification and reduction of methane production therefore the main purpose of the reactor parameter regulation was to improve the organic matter removal rate meantime reduce the vfas and fan concentrations for enhancing the reactor stability using incineration leachate as the substrate of ad lei et al found that the methane production was positively related to the olr 4 4 28 6 kg m3 d 10 but further raising olr to 36 7 kg m3 d could led to the accumulation of vfas 11 the result revealed that appropriate olr enabled the reactor to maintain a high methane production yield meantime ensuring the stable operation of the reactor a common essential strategy to reduce fan inhibition was ph regulation 12 the concentration of fan decreased from 100 8 mg l to 37 0 mg l with a ph drop from 7 6 to 7 2 which might significantly lessen the inhibition of fan on methanogens and speed up the consumption of vfas further lowering the risk of reactor acidification 13 besides ic reactor provided an up flow velocity via internal circulation but the external circulation was quite needed when the reactor was started up or the gas production of reactor was insufficient and the up flow velocity of 2 5 m h seemed to provide a better mixed state in ad reactor 14 thereby optimizing the up flow velocity provided by external circulation was quite important to improve mixing uniformity and reduce energy consumption based on the above analyses the most crucial operating parameters of the ic reactor that needed to be controlled for treating raw incinerator leachate were olr up flow velocity and influent ph value however it is uncertain the effect of operational parameters on the anaerobic digestion performance of the ic reactor while and how they affect microbial function has also rarely been studied in this study raw incineration leachate was treated by a pilot ic reactor and the key parameters that could strengthen reactor performance were specifically explored clearly the primary objectives of this study were 1 to demonstrate cod removal performance and methane production yield under different operation parameters 2 to identify the key parameters that affect the methane yield and methane production rate via kinetic analysis 3 to reveal how the key operational parameters influence the sludge methanogenic activity by analyzing key enzymatic activity of sludge and functional microbial structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 seeded sludge and raw incineration leachate the seeded sludge was obtained from a full scale up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor treating sugars and starches wastewater henan china the anaerobic granular sludge angs particle size ranged from 1 to 2 5 mm with a volatile solid vs to total solid ts ratio of 0 67 raw incineration leachate was drawn straight from the regulating tank of the leachate treatment station in the incineration plant henan china and its characteristics are as follows cod 28891 8646 mg l ammonia nh4 n 1416 310 mg l phosphate po4 3 p 12 3 mg l ph 7 27 0 21 vfas 168 56 mmol l alkalinity alk 126 21 mmol l ts 11730 2310 mg l 2 2 reactor set up and operation conditions a pilot scale ic reactor was established with a schematic diagram shown in fig s1 from bottom to top ic reactor was composed of an influent distribution system primary gas liquid solid separator second gas liquid solid separator and gas liquid separator while the pipe system included influent and effluent pipes internal and external circulation pipelines and a gas recovery pipeline thereinto when the internal circulation could not provide a sufficient up flow velocity the up flow velocity in the reactor would be provided by the external circulation for wastewater and sludge sampling five sampling valves were installed at 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 6 and 2 0 m respectively the working volume of ic reactor was 0 25 m3 with an internal diameter of 0 4 m and a height of 2 0 m raw incineration leachate was continuously treated in ic reactor under a constant temperature of 33 2 c and the operational process was divided into 3 stages in the whole operation period of 77 d table 1 2 3 analytical methods the collected water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane for measurement of cod vfas alk nh4 n po4 3 p the above indexes as well as ts vs were analyzed according to standard methods 15 and ph value was measured by a digital ph mv meter phb 4 leici the biogas was collected using a gas collecting bag and its yield and composition were then determined using a drainage method supplementary materials in addition samples of sludge from each stage were taken to determine the activity of coenzyme f420 16 2 4 kinetics modeling furthermore the obtained data of batch tests details in supporting information were fitted by the modified gompertz model eq 1 17 1 m t

analysis table 1 dna was extracted by the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit and then the universal primer 314f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify the v3 v4 region of bacterial while 340f ccctayggggygcascag and 1000r ggccatgcacywcytctc were used to amplify and the v3 v4 region of archaeal 16s rdna genes respectively dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were conducted by following previous studies 18 after miseq sequencing chimeras and low quality sequences were eliminated with uchime and mothur to obtain effective sequences operational taxonomic units otus were got by clustering similar sequences of 97 similarity principal analysis pca based on the bray curtis distance matrix was drawn on http www ehbio com imagegp the sequences obtained in this investigation can be found with the accession number prjna871085 in the ncbi sequence read archive 2 6 statistical analysis statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism 9 the data of bmp test were analyzed by two way anvoa while the f420 activities of sludges were compared via one way anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance under different operational parameters 3 1 1 effects of organic loading rate ic reactor continuously fed raw incineration leachate was operated for 55 d fig 1 in fact the quality of raw incinerator leachate varied widely because the wastewater was injected from the actual leachate treatment station and influent cod of ic reactor ranged from 30 000 to 45 000 mg l the organic loading rates olrs of ic reactor increased from 10 kg m3 d to 30 kg m3 d by gradually reducing the hydraulic retention time hrt table 1 with an enhanced olr from 10 kg m3 d to 15 kg m3 d effluent cod was kept at roughly 5000 mg l during the start up phase of the ic reactor 0 15 d and biogas yield and organic removal loading rate orlr increased to over 0 9 m3 d and 12 5 kg m3 d respectively the result meant that the seeded sludge in the reactor was able to swiftly adapt to the landfill leachate with a cod removal efficiency of over 85 in addition the vfas concentration was consistently 50 mmol l whereas the alk concentration rose to around 180 mmol l anaerobic digestion ad stability is typically evaluated using the vfas alk value with the optimum value thought to be below 0 3 0 4 19 even though the influent ph decreased to 7 0 on the 15th day the vfas alk value remained below 0 35 and the effluent ph remained at 7 8 demonstrating the reactor s good stability additionally during this stage the tfan concentration exceeded 100 mg l and even reached 162 mg l which could be harmful to microorganisms 13 effluent cod increased to 7500 mg l with a 10 reduction in removal efficiency when the olr grew to 20 kg m3 d over 15 30 d despite this the orlr and methane production increased by 18 8 and 55 5 at 30th d demonstrating the overall anaerobic digestion ad capacity of ic reactor was enhanced however the anaerobic digestion performance of the reactor was unstable at 22 5 25 5 d especially the proportion of methane in biogas declined by 18 with an accumulation of vfas to 72 5 mmol l at 24th d indicating the methanogenesis process was hindered by high vfas concentrations 13 meanwhile the effluent ph value dropped by 0 4 while the vfas alk ratio increased to 0 4 demonstrating that the ic reactor was in an acidification crisis 19 the reason for the fluctuations in reactor performance at 22 5 25 5 d might be that henan province in china experienced a once in a lifetime flood and the temperature in the reactor plummeted to 28 c despite the presence of a heater negatively impacting methanogens 20 during 30 55 d the cod and vfas concentrations in effluent fluctuated greatly as the olr climbed to 25 and 30 kg m3 d vfas were rapidly accumulated following each increment in olr reaching 100 mmol l on the 45th d at the same time the effluent ph decreased to 7 4 and the vfas alk value increased to 0 7 suggesting that the reactor was in danger of becoming acidified despite this the overall gas yield continued to rise eventually reaching 6 3 m3 d with a constant proportion of methane of 72 75 demonstrating that the ic reactor s methanogenesis ability was constantly increased acetoclastic methanogens would be inhibited under high vfas while hydrogen formate utilizing methanogens had higher tolerance 21 as a result the accumulated vfas were constantly consumed and the final concentration dropped to 50 mmol l demonstrating the steady anaerobic digestion of ic reactor might be related to the shift of methanogenesis microorganisms but the ultimate orlr of 21 kg m3 d at 55th d had no obvious improvement compared to it at 41th d showing the extreme ad capacity of the reactor this orlr was quite similar to the value in another study which also used ic reactor for treating raw incineration leachate 8 an additional increase in olr might cause the collapse of ic reactor 3 1 2 effects of up flow velocity external circulation was set up to provide part of up flow velocity to compensate for the uneven reactor mixing caused by insufficient power of the internal circulation a reasonable setting of external circulation flow could provide better reaction conditions for ic reactor with reducing external circulation flow the up flow velocity decreased stepwise from 8 4 m3 h to 4 0 m3 h and 1 6 m3 h respectively table 1 when the up flow velocity reduced to 4 m h during 55 61 d ic reactor got orlr of 20 7 kg m3 d and total gas production of 6 1 m3 d fig 2 which was like the ad performance at 55th d in addition the effluent vfas were kept below 50 mmol l while the ph value was maintained at around 7 8 showing the high stability of ic reactor under high olr with the up flow velocity further reduced to 1 6 m h the reactor remained stable with vfas concentrations below 50 mmol l and vfas alk values below 0 3 despite this the reactor s orlr of 19 5 kg m3 d and gas generation of 5 7 m3 d suggested that its performance was negatively affected the main explanation could be that insufficient up flow velocity caused angs cumuli which then caused an uneven mass transfer and directly affected the reactor s ad performance in conclusion when compared to up flow velocity of 8 4 m h and 1 6 m h the up flow velocity of 4 m h could not only match the reactor s present mixing state but also lower the ic reactor s energy consumption which was relatively close to the previous study 22 3 1 3 effects of influent ph value fan a toxic substance created by a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen in raw landfill leachate could inhibit methanogens reduced influent ph would lead to significantly lower fan concentrations but the ad system ran the risk of becoming acidic when the influent ph was adjusted to 7 2 the fan concentration in the reactor was reduced by 56 with an effluent ph of around 7 6 fig 3e even the effluent alk concentration reduced to 180 mmol l fig 3c unchanged orlr of 20 kg m3 d fig 3a and biogas production of 6 m3 d fig 3b confirmed the stability of the ad system with vfas alk value of 0 2 the fan concentration fell to 10 mg l when the influent ph further fell to 6 8 however the effluent alk concentration and ph fell to 110 mmol l and 6 8 respectively resulting in a higher vfas alk value of 0 5 on the 77th d the acidic environment of the reactor which could hinder the methanogenesis activity led to the reduction of orlr and biogas yield to 11 kg m3 d and 3 6 m3 d respectively lowering influent ph value reduced fan concentration alleviating the inhibition of fan on methanogens whereas a lower ph value of 6 8 would destroy the buffer environment resulting in deterioration of the reactor 19 3 2 methane producing potential bio methane potential assays bmp assays were used to measure the methane producing potentials of s0 s8 in order to further demonstrate the impact of operational factors on the performance of the ic reactor and the data obtained were fitted using the gompertz model fig s2 the most important kinetic parameters were gathered and fitted into a linear kinetic model for direct comparison 22 fig 4 the results of the fitting showed a substantial p 0 05 connection between olr influent ph and methane yield r max respectively indicating that these two parameters were the most important ones that needed to be regulated when the ic reactor was operating thereinto methane yield and r max grew concurrently with rising olr reaching their highest values at 508 5 ml ch4 g cod added and 208 4 ml ch4 g cod added respectively when the olr was 30 kg m3 d fig 4a the methanogenesis capacity of sludge was significantly enhanced with the continuous raising of olr exhibiting the angs were domesticated success in contrast methane yield declined from 506 4 ml ch4 g cod added to 496 8 ml ch4 g cod added when influent ph dropped to 6 8 while r max considerably decreased to 167 9 ml ch4 g cod added fig 4c the results indicated that despite the concentration of the hazardous component tfan might be decreased a lower influent ph value would result in an acidic environment that could inhibit the methanogenic activity of the sludge additionally compared to s4 neither the p0 nor r max values of s5 nor s6 showed any clear differences p 0 05 fig 4b meaning that the methanogenesis performance of the sludge was unaffected lowering up flow velocity might just hinder the mass transfer of ic reactor but had no inhibition on methanogens activity based on the above data it could be confirmed that olr and influent ph value were the key parameters that influence methanogenesis performance instead of up flow velocity 3 3 enzyme activity of f420 coenzyme f420 was the key enzyme for demonstrating the methane synthesis potential to some extent could reflect the capacity of methane production 23 to deeply demonstrate the crucial factors influencing the methanogens activity of sludge nine sludge enzyme activities were detected fig 5 therein the f420 activity of s4 increased by 33 2 to s1 p 0 05 which is consistent with s4 having the highest methanogenic potential and rate in 3 2 the result showed that raising olr could enhance the activity of essential enzymes hence improving the methanogenic efficiency of anaerobic systems the influent ph on the other hand had a clear inhibition on the methanogenesis process p 0 05 f420 enzyme was reduced by 5 6 at low ph of 6 8 demonstrating that the acidic environment inhibited the methanogenic activity of the sludge and decreased methane synthesis 24 which in turn led to the accumulation of vfas in the reactor and reactor deterioration moreover a decrease in up flow velocity had no discernible effect on the f420 activities of s4 s6 p 0 05 therefore the little decrease in methane production in the ic reactor that occurred when the up flow velocity dropped to 1 6 m h might have been caused by reduced mass transfer rather than impaired sludge methanogenic activity the changes in f420 activities supported the hypotheses in 3 2 which proposed that olr and influent ph were the key operational parameters that needed to be controlled 3 4 overview of microbial diversity and taxonomic identification to further explore how key operational parameters affect the anaerobic digestion performance of ic reactors eight sludge samples obtained from the ic reactor at various stages were analyzed using high throughput sequencing based on the bray curtis analysis of samples the β diversity of bacteria was illustrated in fig s3a and fig s3b s1 s3 migrated away from s4 showing that increased influent olr could substantially alter the microbial population furthermore samples s4 s6 were gathered but separated from s7 and s8 showing that the influent ph was the more important operational parameter influencing the microbial population under high influent olr the β diversity of archaea in eight samples on the other hand was considerably different except for s3 s1 s8 congregated near pcoa2 axis indicating that the change in reactor operation had no significant influence on the archaeal population at the phylum level fig s4 chloroflexi bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria were the major phyla in all samples which account for over 73 of whole community thereinto the abundances of chloroflexi and bacteroidetes raised along with the increase of olr demonstrating that the improvement in the acidogenesis capacity of sludge 25 while the enrichment of euryarchaeota in archaea community in s4 s6 revealed that the methanogenesis ability of sludge were also enhanced 26 the microbial community structure of bacteria and archaea was characterized at the genus level to further exhibit the relationship between functional bacteria and reactor operational parameters bacteria in sludge were classified according to their potential function hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria fig 6a acetogenic bacteria fig 6b syntrophic vfa oxidizing bacteria fig 6c acetoclastic methanogens fig 6d and hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig 6e some microorganisms were enriched in all sludge samples during reactor operation including unclassified anaerolineaceae unclassified bacteria unclassified firmicutes unclassified clostridiales unclassified ruminococcaceae aminivibrio etc they made up a large proportion of 55 4 61 6 51 9 55 1 53 3 57 44 1 and 51 of total in s1 s8 respectively all of them were common fermenting bacteria in anaerobic digesters playing a role in the conversion of organic materials like protein and amino acids to short chain fatty acids and h2 27 31 unclassified anaerolineaceae most enriched in s4 s5 while unclassified clostridiales had higher proportion in s1 s3 and s7 s8 their enrichment enhanced the performance of hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes of ic reactor with different operational parameters and ensured the conversion of organic compounds in raw incineration leachate into vfas the bacteria that converted organic matters into acetate h2 and co2 were quite different in s1 s3 s4 s5 and s7 s8 unclassified bacteroidales which was said to contribute to the breakdown of macromolecular organic matter with acetate serving as the primary fermentation product 32 showed increased proportions of over 20 of s4 s6 with increasing olr its enrichment might provide methanogens additional reaction substrate unlike this unclassified syntrophobacteraceae occupied higher percentages of the total in s1 s3 and s8 at 12 3 6 8 3 and 3 4 respectively unclassified syntrophobacteraceae might help in the removal of accumulated acids with a lower olr and influent ph value since the family syntrophobacteraceae phylum proteobacteria was found to have syntrophic propionate oxidizers 33 syntrophic bacteria might generate h2 and acetate from non acetic vfas but they could also develop a syntrophic metabolism with methanogens particularly syntrophomonas and desulfovibrio both had highly expressed genes for e pili or flagella which might improve hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis by extracellular electron transfer eet 34 35 however a higher proportion of desulfovibrio and syntrophomonas over 2 0 in s1 s3 and 6 5 in s7 s8 revealed how the functioning syntrophic bacteria behaved when exposed to high tfan concentrations about 150 mg l or acidic conditions the conversion of the key acetogenic bacteria from syntrophic bacteria to unclassified bacteroidales might be related to the vfas concentrations within ic reactor with an olr of 30 kg m3 d the vfas concentration reached about 100 mmol l which was sufficient to inhibit syntrophic bacteria 24 additionally the acetogenic bacteria did not alter when the up flow velocity of the ic reactor was reduced indicating that it was not a crucial operational factor that affected the microbial population the archaeal community exhibited that methanothrix methanosarcina methanobacterium methanolinea and methanoculleus were the dominant methanogens and occupied over 75 of total archaea in s4 the proportion of methanobacterium grew by 17 6 while the abundance of methanothrix decreased by 15 4 compared to s1 methanothrix was said to be a purely acetoclastic methanogen and to have a higher affinity for acetate 36 but a high concentration of vfas might clearly hinder it 24 whereas methanobacterium the hydrogen formate using methanogens was more resistant to a high vfas concentration 1 and could therefore be enhanced in s4 with roughly 100 mmol l vfas the changes in their abundance in s1 s4 exhibited that the methane generation capacity of sludge notably the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm was enhanced via sludge acclimation with raising olr furthermore methanolinea methanosarcina and methanoculleus had higher proportions of 1 4 1 6 and 1 4 respectively which made up for the depletion of methanobacterium in s7 in addition methanothrix accounted for 65 6 whereas the proportion of methanobacterium reduced to 11 6 in s8 syntrophomonas could provide more acetate for methanothrix thus these two microorganisms guaranteed the methanogenic capacity of ic reactors at low ph through a syntrophic system 34 consistently compared to s4 methanothrix and methanobacterium were still major archaea in s5 and s6 and accounted for 91 8 and 91 7 respectively implying that the decline of up flow velocity of ic reactor had no obvious impact on methanogens community 3 5 mechanism of ad under operational parameters controlling based on the above findings and conclusions a mechanism of strengthening the methanogenic capacity of the ic reactor by regulating the key parameters was proposed fig 7 during the operation of ic reactor unclassified anaerolineaceae unclassified bacteria unclassified firmicutes unclassified ruminococcaceae aminivibrio always were the dominant hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria and contributed to vfas production and the shift of functional microorganisms in ad system began with acetogens and methanogens in stage i with the lower olr of 15 25 kg m3 d the main inhibition factor was 150 mg l tfan brought by high concentrations of ammonia and a ph value of around 7 8 in the ic reactor in this situation unclassified syntrophobacteraceae and desulfovibrio played a key role in the oxidation of vfas and provided acetate for methanothrix exhibiting a weak pathway of syntrophic methanogenesis in ic reactor however when the olr grew to 30 kg m3 d the accumulation of vfas and high concentration fan produced a dual inhibition on the activities of syntrophic bacteria and methanothrix meantime unclassified bacteroidales and methanobacterium which could tolerate the inhibitory environments enriched in s4 and formed a strong pathway of methanogenesis the highest methane producing potential and activity of f420 also proved that the shift of the core functional microorganisms enhanced the methanogenesis capacity of ic reactor besides the fact that the microbial communities in s4 s6 during stage ii were largely similar further suggests that mass transfer between microorganisms rather than microbiological function was affected by the change in up flow velocity which led to a decrease in methane generation on the 66th d in addition regulation of influent ph value in stage iii indeed reduced the fan concentration to below 50 mg l which declined the toxicity of the fan however the acidic environment caused by lowest influent ph value of 6 8 could inhibit unclassified bacteroidales and methanobacterium even though syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanosarcina were enriched the reduction of f420 activity and accumulation of vfas revealed that this syntrophic methanogenesis system was a weak methanogenesis pathway in order to ensure maximum efficacy and minimal energy consumption during the treatment of landfill leachate in an ic reactor it was noticeable from the methanogenic pathway under various conditions that controlling the olr and influent ph was a vital operation 4 conclusion pilot scale internal circulation ic reactor were successfully set up to treat raw incineration leachate and the key regulative parameters were identified two most important ic reactor operational parameters that required to be controlled for were olr and influent ph value with the optimal olr of 30 kg m3 d and influent ph value of 7 5 the orlr and biogas yield raised to 21 kg m3 d and 6 3 m3 d respectively and the f420 activity got the highest value of 0 9113 0 0358 u mol g ss when olr raising from 10 to 30 kg m3 d the methane yield and r max grew to the highest values at 508 5 ml ch4 g cod added and 208 4 ml ch4 g cod added respectively thereinto the enrichment of unclassified bacteroidales 24 4 and methanobacterium 37 8 which enhanced hm contributed to the improvement of methane production potential decreasing influent ph value to 6 8 resulted in an acid environment which inhibited microbial activity and decreased orlr and biogas production to 11 kg m3 d and 3 6 m3 d respectively and the syntrophic system consisting of syntrophomonas 6 5 and methanosaeta 65 6 became the predominant methanogenesis pathway declaration of competing interest the authors
