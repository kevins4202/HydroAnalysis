8305,study region abu dhabi united arab emirates uae study focus water demand in the emirate of abu dhabi ead has increased significantly over the last few decades hence a main challenge for the ead water policy makers is to develop long term resilient water resources strategies this study evaluates future water supply demand condition in the ead and identifies water management strategies that support a sustainable future a dynamic water budget modelling framework is used to evaluate future water demand as affected by population growth economic growth proposed water related policies consumption patterns and climate change the abu dhabi dynamic water budget model adwbm is used to construct future water scenarios and assess the status of the ead water system until 2050 in terms of water supply demand balance this study presents four suites of water scenarios namely business as usual bau policy first pf sustainability by conservation sc and rainfall enhanced sustainability res scenarios new hydrological insights simulation results indicate that both sc and res scenarios achieved balanced water budget without any shortage throughout the entire period until 2050 the res scenario is recommended for adoption because of the reasonable and achievable proposed consumption reductions needed in the different demand sectors the obtained results should be valuable for devising appropriate strategies to prevent potential future water shortages in the emirate keywords scenario analysis sustainability water policy water conservation water resources management 1 introduction one of the major problems for policy makers in water management is the need to deal with uncertainties about the future this is because water policies guide actions for decades and therefore one should be able to forecast the future and provide solutions accordingly water infrastructure planning is a long term activity and the lifetime of the infrastructures exceed 50 100 years future water conditions are dependent on a number of factors like environmental economic social and political drivers that include demographic changes water resources availability water consumption patterns land use patterns governmental policies and so forth proskuryakova et al 2018 hence one of the main challenges for water managers is to foresee the future accurately and design appropriate infrastructure plans and policies based on the future requirements in such instances scenarios can be useful for evaluating the future conditions of water resources for management and infrastructure planning purposes many countries already face the problem of maintaining reliable water supplies to meet the growing demands and this will continue to worsen due to urbanization and industrialization the united arab emirates is not different with remarkably rapid changes in the population lifestyle and economy mohamed and almualla 2010a b several public policies may influence water demand for example policies supporting the expansion of agriculture with the aim of protecting the national heritage and decreas dependency on imported food could increase the demand for irrigation water likewise desert greening policies aiming to provide habitat for wild animals and stabilize sand around roads could also increase the demand for irrigation water other relevant policies include the development of public parks residential and commercial megaprojects implemented to support local population and tourism and industrialization driven by the government s diversification into non petroleum related industries furthermore climate change could be an important factorfor sustainable development as it may cause rising of sea levels drying up of surface water and groundwater and intense droughts national center of meteorology 2020 due to its arid climatic condition the ead has very limited renewable resources of groundwater and negligible surface water the key conventional sources of water environment agency abu dhabi 2009a water deficit in uae is generally managed by providing desalinated water and reusing treated wastewater statistics centre abu dhabi 2015 2018 the environmental impacts of desalination plants on the arabian gulf is well acknowledged in several studies al zubari 2009 ministry of water and environment 2010 alghafli 2016 thus integration of both supply and demand side management is essential for a sustainable water resources development in the region it is crucial to determine how the current and proposed policies will impact the long term objectives of water resources management and sustainability in the ead mathematical simulation models could enhance our understanding of the socio economic political and environmental factors and help us to evaluate the current and future water supply demand systems scenarios represent expositions of possible futures and are advantageous for examining the changing factors in shaping the future judging possible diversions from the current trends and preparing strategically for uncertainties and complexities in the long term scenarios can be used to assess future uncertainties and aid development of water management strategies carter et al 2007 thus scenarios analysis sa can help in choosing a reliable water policy for a state or nation by highlighting the best options among those predicted the development of scenarios has become popular topic ever since scenarios were first used by the u s in military planning van der heijden 2005 scenario development as a strategic planning tool became popular in different applications like social forecasting public policy analysis and decision making environmental management business development and water resources management hulse and gregory 2001 many studies of scenario analysis for water resource management exist for example zhuo et al 2016 deployed sa with a focus on crop production by assessing the water footprints and virtual water trades for time horizons between 2030 and 2050 proskuryakova et al 2018 developed water scenarios for russia by using sa data mining for a time horizon of 2030 these scenarios focused on sustainability water demands of households and industry and other basic needs in india amarasinghe et al 2007 developed scenarios for food and water futures for 2025 2050 and addressed various issues related to the business as usual scenario saraswat et al 2017 conducted a study in nepal that focused on urban water management and used sa to develop strategies for achieving sustainable water management practices for 2030 cetinkaya and gunacti 2018 developed scenarios for turkey and used a multi criteria analysis to measure the performance of these scenarios dong et al 2013 carried out a detailed review on the status of scenarios methodology in water resources management and indicated that the scenario approach was widely popular in exploring future water resource conditions and developing strategic plans amer et al 2013 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of approaches typically applied in scenario planning this work also considered scenario selection the appropriate number of scenarios required and ways to conduct scenario validation stewart et al 2007 proposed a five step iterative scenarion constructing approach mahmoud 2008 proposed a formal scenario development method for water resources management in the south western us henriques et al 2015 used sa for addressing water management challenges in england and wales for the years up to 2050 and four future scenarios were constructed based on stakeholder discussions and expert advices ercin and hoekstra 2014 developed scenarios for 2050 to understand changes in water footprints at both global and regional scales in a review study in the netherlands haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 concluded that scenario approaches are useful to deal with the uncertainties faced by water managers in decision making in the middle east al zubari 2009 developed four water scenarios for the gulf cooperation council gcc countries considering the different patterns of economic developments that can be implemented in the region al zubari identified four drivers that represent future scenarios as the market sustainability policies and security the literature confirms scenario development and analysis as a key tool to promote sustainable water management by planning in advance for a plausible future in this paper a dynamic simulation model developed for ead is applied to evaluate the water supply and demand for sustainable water resource management of abu dhabi the detailed description of the model development is available in mohamed et al 2016 the components and framework of the model are described here under methodology the model works on the basic time step of evaluating water balance every year each scenario is evaluated with regard to consumption reductions needed in water demand drivers as well as in water resources utilization the overall purpose of this study is to explore scenarios for water supply and demand of ead to 2050 outcomes of this study can be used by water decision makers water policymakers and stakeholders to develop long term plans and strategies for the ead water sector until 2050 this study explores four sets of plausible future scenarios along with the associated strategic steps required to achieve a sustainable future in water resources in the design process of these scenarios a number of drivers including population growth economic growth water consumption pattern and climatic change were incorporated the four future scenarios examined in this study are business as usual bau policy first pf sustainability by conservation sc and rainfall enhanced sustainability res this study could serve as the basis for future refinement in water resources planning and management using scenarios development in arid or semi arid regions the main innovative aspects of this paper are 1 conducting a detailed evaluation of abu dhabi s unique highly stressed water system with negligible surface water resources and man made water systems 2 considering several governmental policies relevant to water in developing plausible water scenarios for abu dhabi and 3 demonstrating scenarios development for a data scarce system this paper is organized as follows this section is followed by description of the study area in section 2 the methodology in section 3 describes the abu dhabi water system scenarios development and evaluation in section 4 the obtained results obtained of the four scenarios are presented section 5 discusses the results and their implications with respect to achieving a balanced water budget finally the conclusions drawn are given in section 6 2 study area abu dhabi is the largest emirate of the united arab emirates it is divided into three regions namely abu dhabi region al ain region and western region as shown in fig 1 the ead is bordered by oman in the east saudi arabia to south and west and the arabian persian gulf in the north it is characterized by an arid climate with scanty rainfall high temperatures high humidity and high evapotranspiration rates the land cover is mostly desert abu dhabi has a long coastline of more than 600 kms that is responsible for the humid climatic conditions the maximum temperature average above 40 c 104 f during the april september summer period the october march period is comparatively cool as rainfall is rare the natural recharge into groundwater is very low about 40 million cubic meters mcm yr environment agency abu dhabi 2009a mahmoud et al 2019 which adds to the water concerns of the emirate the ead has limited groundwater resources and as the abstraction rates are higher than the natural and artificial recharge rates major decline in groundwater levles and quality has been observed in many locations of the emirate elmahdy and mohamed 2013 and 2015 mohamed et al 2010a b water supply comes from different sources including groundwater seawater desalination treated sewage and surface runoff from rainfall these can be categorized into potable or non potable sources based on the type of demands they can satisfy of the seven demand sectors identified in ead four are considered potable namely residential commercial municipal and industrial these sectors require high quality fresh water desalinated water is the only source to meet potable demands of these four sectors desalination plants situated at different strategic locations within or outside the ead on the other hand groundwater is the main source for the other three non potable sectors agricultural forestry and amenities treated sewage and surface runoff provides minor support for non potable demand treated sewage ts is supplied to complement the needs in the forestry and amenities sectors only ts is a non conventional source of water produced by treating wastewater to reusable quality in ead there are wastewater treatment plants at all key population centers to produce and distribute ts the ead receives very low rainfall usually less than 100 mm per year environment agency abu dhabi 2009a consequently rainfall and runoff are not abundant water resources in the region very little data is available on abu dhabi s surface runoff most of the terrain is flat consisting of sandy soil with scattered dunes and some low elevation sabkhas flat area with salt deposits therefore little runoff is generated however in the east of the ead rainfall produces runoff that drains into the wadis creeks and flows westward crossing into abu dhabi providing about 7 6 mcm annually environment agency abu dhabi 2014 rainfall is estimated from data recorded at 24 stations across the ead water demand has increased significantly in the ead and the total water demand in 2011 was about 3416 mcm statistics centre abu dhabi 2012 the main driving forces of this increase are population growth and economic development population increase has driven much of the water consumption increase in abu dhabi emirate especially the residential commercial and municipal consumptions in 1975 the total population was 211 812 and increased to 1 399 484 by 2005 a 6 fold increase in 30 years statistics centre abu dhabi 2015 abu dhabi population has doubled in following nine years reaching 2 656 448 in mid 2014 statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 the average annual population growth rate 2005 2014 is 7 6 of the total population 507 479 people 19 1 are emirati citizens and the rest 80 9 are non citizens more than 66 5 of the population are males which is due to an influx of male migrant workers statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 the fertility rate in abu dhabi emirate is higher than most developed regions of the world and the mortality rate remains low in 2014 the crude birth and death rates were estimated to be 14 3 and 1 2 per 1000 population respectively statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 reflected in the high net growth rates of the population the population density of abu dhabi emirate in 2014 was 44 7 persons per square kilometer the population density in the three regions of the abu dhabi emirate abu dhabi region al ain region and western region are 148 9 52 6 and 8 9 persons per square kilometer respectively reflecting the varying urbanization levels statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 moreover changes in lifestyle have increased water demand for irrigation human consumption and industrial activities several public practices intensified the increase in water demand for example expansion of agriculture to protect rural heritage and reduce dependency on imported food also the expansion of desert greening to provide a habitat for wild animals stabilize the sand around roads and develope public parks to enhance outdoor activities 3 methodology the overall framework of the study is divided into three parts and is illustrated in fig 2 first the conceptual and dynamic structure of the abu dhabi water system was developed as shown in the upper part of fig 2 then the future scenario were designed and developed using control parameters and drivers to forecast future situation as shown in the middle part of fig 2 finally the developed scenarios were simulated using the abu dhabi dynamic water budget model adwbm mohamed et al 2016 to evaluate the future water balance and to identify needed interventions in the future consumption and supply patterns to achieve water balance as shown in the lower part three of fig 2 3 1 the abu dhabi water system the framework of abu dhabi water system is composed of the water supply demand elements and the external components that drive demand and supply the four supply sources groundwater gw desalinated water dw treated sewage ts and rainfall rf and seven demand sectors agriculture a forestry f amenities am residential r municipal m commercial c and industrial i conceptualize the structure of water system in abu dhabi the external drivers are categorized as environmental demographic and socioeconomic factors the adwbm was developed by establishing a holistic mass balance for the entire system during the process all the required data were collected and analyzed to identify key parameters that are essential for establishing the water balance these key parameters formed the basis for forecasting future water conditions adwbm is designed to evaluate the annual water balance the model also comprises external parameters that drive the water consumption and supply in the study area environmental and climatic components include rainfall humidity evaporation temperature and other climatic parameters that affect water demand and supply in abu dhabi additionally the different policies visions and strategies could impose impacts on the water resources therefore adwbm incorporates all these drivers to develop future water scenarios 3 2 scenario development scenarios refer to a series of assumptions or storylines depicting how the future of abu dhabi water system might unfold they can also be treated as a form of sensitivity analysis of the relationship between the changing forces and their outcomes the possible futures parsons et al 2007 the future water demand of the ead is dependent on many factors such as population growth urbanization environmental factors and policies the weights of these factors are diverse according to the scenario configuration and different assumptions are needed to test the effects of these factors hence scenario analysis is used to explore the balance of water supply and demand to achieve the goal of a sustainable abu dhabi as proposed in the ead environment vision 2030 environment agency abu dhabi 2012 in order to identify the key driving forces that determine the future of water system in abu dhabi stakeholders workshops were organized to discuss the current situation and to explore the focal objectives relevant to achieving sustainability in abu dhabi population growth and water demand data as well as other adwbm parameters serve as the foundation of this scenario development tables 1 3 represent the baseline values of all model input parameters water demand especially the potable water demand sectors is directly linked to population therefore population is incorporated as one of the key demand drivers for all potable sectors four population growth rates are considered in this study they are very high p1 high p2 medium p3 and low p4 growth rates table 1 these growth rates p1 p2 p3 and p4 are aligned with population trends described in the abu dhabi environment vision 2030 environment agency abu dhabi 2012 and lutz et al 2014 the high growth rates p1 and p2 represent the worst case and the market first mf growths respectively as described in environment agency abu dhabi 2012 the mf growth represents high immigration rates into the uae reflecting the rapid economic growth in the region the medium population growth p3 represents a balanced environment and gradual economic growth in abu dhabi whereas the low population growth p4 represents a green economy the later could be also used during extreme cases such as the current covid 19 pandemic reflecting low immigration rates into uae the availability of renewable water resources depends on climate factors like rainfall and temperature and may adversely be affected by future climate change in the region the ead is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its extreme arid climate and low lying coastal areas the ead has developed a climate change strategy that was incorporated into abu dhabi plan environment agency abu dhabi 2012 the change in climate is determined by past greenhouse gas emissions and for abu dhabi the impact of climate change is unlikely to make a severe change on water resources by 2050 dougherty et al 2009 environment agency abu dhabi 2014 this study designed four suites of water scenarios namely business as usual policy first sustainability by conservation and rainfall enhanced sustainability the first two scenarios focus on predicting the future of abu dhabi water under a continuing pattern of economic growth whereas the latter two are designed to achieve a balanced water budget until 2050 each scenario with a different set of assumptions and constraints for water use and supply was tested using several population growth models 3 2 1 business as usual bau scenarios the bau is a base scenario which represents a continuation of current trends of water demand and supply all the key parameter values are assumed to remain unchanged as in the baseline year 2015 except the population two population growth models medium p3 and very high p1 were used to develop two sub scenarios of the bau scenario the bau scenario with p3 medium population growth represents a balanced and gradual economic growth this is termed here as bau status quo sub scenario bau sq the bau worst case bau wc sub scenario considers a very high population growth rate p1 without a balanced environmental and economic growth rates these two reference sub scenarios illustrate a situation where there is no improvement in water supply and demand infrastructures with respect to the baseline year 2015 furthermore the bau sub scenarios assume no restriction on groundwater extraction therefore under these bau sub scenarios water consumption will continuously increase in the population dependent sectors e g residential while other sectors e g agricultural and forestry would maintain the baseline consumption throughout the bau water consumption values for the baseline year 2015 are summarized in table 3 3 2 2 policy first pf scenarios the pf scenario considers the currently approved policies to reduce water consumption in different demand sectors the abu dhabi water strategy environment agency abu dhabi 2014 specifies these policies as follows i desalination water demand is set to increase by 20 from the 2020 level in commercial municipal megaprojects ii annual groundwater extraction limit to 1980 mcm 10 reduction and 1430 mcm 35 reduction for 2020 and 2030 respectively iii 20 reduction of water use in public parks and gardens amenities by 2020 relative to 2010 consumption iv 10 and 20 reduction of water use in forestry sector by 2020 and 2030 respectively relative to 2010 water consumption and v 20 reduction of indoor and outdoor water consumption in residential sector by 2020 relative to 2010 water consumption based on population growth models the pf scenario is divided into three sub scenarios the first is called policy first market first pf mf assuming future high economic growth rates which will result in higher immigration rates of workers into the ead therefore this sub scenario uses the high population growth model p2 as discussed earlier the second sub scenario promotes environmental sustainability using low population growth model p4 and is called policy first environment first pf ef in this sub scenario lower immigration rates of expatriates into the ead are expected the environment first ef sub scenario used in this study represents a green economy environment agency abu dhabi 2012 a balance between these two sub scenarios is assumed in a third one called policy first balanced growth pf bg sub scenario which uses medium population growth model p3 3 2 3 sustainability by conservation sc scenarios this scenario represents a sustainable future as explained in the abu dhabi environment vision 2030 under such future there is a growing interest on sustainability across economic social and environmental sectors the current water consumptions rates in the ead are not considered to be sustainable over exploitation of scarce groundwater resources for agriculture should be constrained therefore this scenario is a target based scenario in which reductions in water consumption rates demand management in different sectors are sought through an iterative process to achieve a balanced water budget bwb until 2050 the sc sub scenarios are developed considering three population growth models sustainability by conservation balanced growth sc bg using p3 sustainability by conservation market first sc mf using p2 and sustainability by conservation environment first sc ef using p4 3 2 4 rainfall enhanced sustainability res scenarios the res scenario is another target based scenario which is developed to achieve a balanced water budget until 2050 taking into account key assumptions on rainfall and other water resources utilization factors rain enhancement technologies through cloud seeding is a promising solution offering a cost effective tool towards supplementing water supplies in the uae in this technology harmless natural salts such as potassium chloride and sodium chloride are used for cloud seeding therefore in this suite of sub scenarios it is assumed that abu dhabi will have an increased rainfall by 20 in addition strict sustainable use of available water sources desalination water groundwater and treated sewage is also assumed the desalination capacity can only be increased by 20 while remaining sustainable sustainable use of gw requires recharge rates to exceed abstraction rates for ts the sustainability condition is achieved by maximum utilization of generated ts in non potable demand sectors accordingly 95 utilization of generated ts is assumed in this scenario therefore an iterative simulation process was followed to find the optimized reductions needed for major potable and non potable sectors the main objective of this scenario is to determine an optimal solution for achieving water security in the ead like previous scenarios three sub scenarios are developed for three population growth rates which are res balanced growth res bg using p3 res market first res mf using p2 and res environment first res ef using p4 3 3 evaluation and analysis of scenarios all scenarios should be analyzed using a suitable mathematical simulation model to assess the consistency and coherence of the resulting data gallopin and rijsberman 2000 in this study the adwbm was used to evaluate the impacts of the developed scenarios all scenarios are evaluated with regard to water balance surplus or deficit compatibility with environmental and sustainability targets and sensitivity to key variables a schematic representation of the steps involved in scenarios simulations using adwbm is given in part three of fig 2 detailed description of the simulated results obtained from adwbm for all scenarios is presented in the next section 4 results 4 1 bau scenarios two sub scenarios were simulated under this scenario in the first one bau sq water demand is assumed to be driven by moderate population growth p3 total annual water demand of abu dhabi will increase from 3518 mcm in 2015 to 6107 mcm in 2050 with a 74 increase the key simulation results of bau sq scenario are given in fig 3 the bar graphs show the annual sector wise demands the trend of gw decline and annual supply by each source are represented by trend lines the results showed that the ead will face a deficit in both potable and non potable water requirements unless interventions are implemented the water deficit forecast under this sub scenario for the years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 are presented in the table 4 for bau sq the model predicts a shortage of 1675 mcm and 555 mcm in potable and non potable water supply respectively by the year 2050 the overall shortage will reach 2230 mcm the gw reserves under this scenario continue to decline steadily and will be reduced to half of the current gw reserve by 2050 fig 3 these increases in water demand and water shortages along with the steady decline in gw in the ead are alarming this therefore calls for achievable strategies to prevent water crisis in the future if the current consumption trends are continued it is evident that bau sq is not a balanced water budget scenario and thus cannot be adopted in the suite of bau scenarios a worst case future business as usual worst case bau wc is simulated as the second sub scenario it reflects potentially large increases in population identified by p1 in table 1 generally bau takes current trends forward in the case of abu dhabi however population and economic growths have been increasing dramaticaly and it is this continuation of this dramatic growth that provides one extreme of the bau envelope although this worst case is unlikely to happen it was included to show the huge impacts of such high population growth rates on water demands in the future in bau wc total water demand will reach 8389 mcm in 2050 nearly double that of the bau sq scenario fig 4 shows the sectoral demand over time the most consuming sectors if a bau wc scenario is adopted are those driven directly by population namely residential municipal commercial and amenities the huge annual demand increase in the residential sector approaches 3000 mcm in 2050 although the results show that there are significant differences in water deficit between bau sq and bau wc both show an alarming increase of water deficit requiring practical strategies and policies to avoid water crisis in the future 4 2 policy first scenarios the key results sector wise water demands water supply and decline of gw reserves for the pf bg scenario are shown in fig 5 the results demonstrate the positive impacts of approved policies against the bau scenarios the impacts on reducing water demands in all sectors are clear especially for the potable sectors based on pf bg results these polices if implemented will be effective in achieving a water balance until 2027 this is as expected as these policies were originally designed to help address water demands through 2030 however the results predict that some shortages will appear in 2028 and 2029 fig 6 for both non potable and potable demands which might require another set of policies such as an additional increase in the desalination capacity the model presented estimates of these shortages in both the potable and non potable sectors and these data could help to shape these new polices if needed within the pf scenarios another two cases simulated the impact of high mf and low ef population growth rates on the policies from the results pf mf scenario with high population growth showed a water deficit as early as 2026 fig 6 earlier than pf bg scenario and will require an earlier change in policies however in the case of pf ef scenario the low population growth would maintain a positive water balance until 2033 fig 6 thereafter deficiencies appear in the potable supply demand balance which must be addressed there is no non potable deficit forecast in this case 4 3 sustainability by conservation scenarios sc scenarios are target based iterative simulations carried out to achieve no water deficit until 2050 the corresponding conservations to be implemented in each demand sector are estmated during this iterative process the demand and supply details for the sc bg scenario are shown in fig 7 this figure shows that less than 15 of the strategic groundwater reserves are utilized until 2050 fig 7 it is clear that huge induced reductions in all sectors are needed to achieve the goals of this scenario the most notable are in the residential commercial agricultural and amenities sectors two additional cases associated with different population levels namely sc mf and sc ef were also simulated in order to achieve a bwb a second level of simulations were carried out to identify the demand drivers or demand sub sectors responsible for controlling majority of the water consumptions it is important to identify these drivers to implement the required demand reductions breakdown of these reductions at drivers level to achieve a bwb in the four major demand sectors is presented in table 5 residential sector uses eight drivers which control residential demand table 5 summarizes the values of these drivers required to achieve the sought bwb for all three sc sub scenarios it is worth noting that extreme reductions are needed in outdoor consumption especially by the year 2050 commercial sector consumption is driven by five main drivers 1 office employees 2 retail employees 3 restaurants 4 hotel rooms and 5 carwashes the target consumption rates to be achieved for these drivers are also shown in table 5 reducing the water consumptions in agriculture without affecting the production could be feasible by increasing irrigation efficiency so this efficiency was iteratively increased to reach the sought reductions in consumptions at different years to achieve a bwb scenario for the year 2020 and afterward it was not feasible to achieve bwb by just improving the irrigation efficiency because of the large required reductions in consumptions the only solution to achieve this was to reduce crop area after assigning a 60 increase in efficiency at these years the minimum reduction in crop area to achieve bwb was found to be 50 in 2030 and 86 in 2050 for all the sc scenario cases table 5 the selected 60 irrigation efficiency is perceived to be practical and feasible however irrigation efficiency improvements for vegetable crops and field crops are expected to be more achievable because of the likely increase in the use of drones for optimizing irrigation though assessments of crop health and soil moisture as this is more applicable for low lying field crops rather than orchards for forestry similar to the agricultural sector the first option considered was to increase irrigation efficiency without changing the current forestry area increasing efficiency alone will not be sufficient to achieve a bwb from 2020 and beyond which implies that reductions in the forest area will be needed reductions required are 30 in 2030 and 2050 if the irrigation efficiency can be increased to 60 table 5 although sc scenarios showed the target values needed to achieve bwb for abu dhabi until 2050 some of the conservation requirements are very challenging and need a complete change in consumption patterns in abu dhabi hence this scenario calls on policy makers to have long term strategy implementing stringent water conservation policies 4 4 rainfall enhanced sustainability scenarios the demand supply and gw conditions for the res bg scenario are shown in fig 8 two sub scenarios for the high and low population growth rates were simulated analysis of all sc scenarios indicate that with the effective implementation of different demand conservation strategies it will be possible to achieve a bwb this triggered proposing this set of res scenarios maximum utilization of ts 95 and minimum use of gw abstraction equal to recharge are assumed in this scenario similar to sc scenarios iterative simulations were conducted to find the optimized reductions needed for various demand sectors particularly residential commercial agricultural and forestry sectors table 5 summarizes the reductions needed by 2030 and 2050 for the different drivers relative to their current values to achieve a bwb in all three res sub scenarios res bg res mf res ef such reductions for residential and commercial drivers are expectedly lower in the res scenarios when compared to sc scenarios for agriculture and forestry sectors results were similar to the sc scenarios in this scenario the supply increase from rf and dw will not relax the expected future shortage in water one of the reasons is that this additions in rainfall along with the sustainable increase in dw will not be in par with the growing population however the increased rainfall can enhance the natural recharge of groundwater thus improving the sustainability of gw aquifers thus for a sustainable future large scale and sustainable increased rates of rf and dw are needed to avoid adopting strict conservation measures at the user level thus from the analyzed scenarios only strict conservation strategies can support the management of the existing water supply and demand system of the emirate and in turn can contribute to the realization of sustainable abu dhabi however res scenario may be preferred over sc scenario because comparatively lenient conservation measures may prevent water shortages in future 5 discussion 5 1 conservation based management for sustainable future the reductions in water demand that are to be achieved for each scenario require interventions to implement specific programs regulations and market interventions will be insufficient to attain such goals unless there is an acceptance of the need for change and this requires engagement programs here six interlinked categories of interventions and programs are discussed which can be applied to achieve a balanced water budget for abu dhabi 5 1 1 long term adjustment of attitude long term interventions are required to adjust the context and expectations without this interventions are likely to be unused discontinued or result in criticism two long term interventions are important namely i education and ii value promotion education concerning the importance of saving water needs to be part of the core curriculum in schools if a part of the infrastructure is to be recognized as important and valuable then some modest value has to be placed on its provision to the individual abu dhabi has already taken the important indeed vital first step in this by pricing and billing for domestic water use this needs to be expanded across all the water using sectors with the prices raised to a meaningful level the idea is not to use tariffs to control demand but to ensure that water is having a value for a long period water was free of charge to the customers but given the extreme water use per capita seen in many segments of the economy there is clearly a case for driving more forcefully recognition of its value water value enhancements and recognition through pricing and education are mutually supportive and underpin the long term success of the direct water saving interventions 5 1 2 short term technological legislative interventions external water use outdoor consumption is the major component of overall residential water use and needs to be tackled immediately both in terms of frequency and volume there are several technical and legislative options that can be adopted such as 1 allow external hose to use only on a permit and or rotational basis 2 fit all external taps with pressure reduction valves 3 fit all external taps with a period of use cut off simple or delayed restart 4 legislate to ensure that all external demands use only recycled water and 5 legislate to provide external water use permits only if full recycling is in place external use in a residential sector is for gardens primarily thus to mitigate the reduction in garden irrigation water information on the targeted irrigation of plants and the use of smart soil moisture sensors must be provided and adoption could be supported perhaps by some modest financial encouragement table 5 presents a series of reduction percentages in the residential sector needed to achieve the bwb for the sc and res scenarios this table depicts the rather elevated reduction levels needed in outdoor consumption in villas and shabiyats where reduction percentages from baseline values in some cases reached above 75 by 2050 introducing bylaws such as plumbing regulations to mandate greywater and toilet plumbing separation in construction for example will yield additional flexibility for the introduction of reuse requirements rti international 2009 and eventually lower the outdoor gardening demands many interventions to reduce indoor residential consumption exist several studies have demonstrated that high efficiency and low flow appliances can be effective regulators of residential demand ahmad and prashar 2010 grafton et al 2011 qaiser et al 2011 rockaway et al 2011 low cost devices with the highest potential savings are likely to be favored by residential consumers tap atomizers for instance are extremely low cost with high potential savings they can be installed easily and can reduce the consumption by as much as 90 this installation adaptation has specific relevance to abu dhabi since a residential end use study identified high tap use as a significant contributor to overall residential water use replacing the entirety of large appliances in existing homes may be seen as a less favorable option by the consumers because of the higher price and the installation time and thus inconvenience and disruption associated with it in a usa study showerhead and toilet replacements proved successful at producing significant water savings rti international 2009 and so prioritizing installation of efficient toilets and showers to new buildings exclusively is deemed appropriate replacement of standard efficiency toilets and showerheads with high efficiency equivalents when a property is sold could be required this equates to the requirement in the many uk areas that meters be installed on the sale of a house importantly these recommendations are supported by the environment vision 2030 which seeks to increase indoor water use efficiency of new and existing buildings by modifying current building codes environment agency abu dhabi 2014 modification of taps and showers to reduce flow is of high priority because of the low cost and immediate savings associated with these options as well as their success in existing studies ahmad and prashar 2010 rockaway et al 2011 such mandatory retrofitting could be expanded to xeriscaping in new and existing homes in the abu dhabi emirate and is likely to produce greater savings due to the high ratio of outdoor indoor usage xeriscaping is key to achieving the sc and res scenarios in particular other devices that should be considered but at a lower priority include dual flush toilets and sub metering dual flush toilets have been seen to have a statistically significant negative effect on water consumption grafton et al 2011 sub metering has been successful in some studies although voluntary installation produces bias since it is usually adopted by self selected low water users mitchell and mcdonald 2015 use of behavioral apps in promoting water conservation has been successful in the usa and europe over recent years these apps could potentially be successful in the emirate because of the relative youthfulness of the population and the experience and acceptance of rapid change and modernization behavioral campaigns have been tried over a longer time period with variable success fielding et al 2013 sustained programs are needed to assess the impact on water use but remain few in number ozkaynak et al 2012 in the ead appealing to the conscience of the people through their underlying islamic tradition and beliefs could help to achieve greater benefits from these campaigns ozkaynak et al 2012 the chartered institute of water and environmental management in the uk promotes behavioral change through faith leaders with conservation messages supported by scripture nawaz and sadek 2010 5 1 3 legislative changes in the market place in the same way as white goods are sold with a water and energy efficiency grading all housing can be subject to standards of water efficiency in the uk this has been attempted for social state housing and voluntarily for other developments clearly the same absolute target volume of water per house per day would not be realistic or indeed sensible and so requirements need to be set for each house type and incorporated into building codes there are a variety of international water standards for housing that are either based on whole house water use or set limits for each individual appliance since the most likely future for the ead is one of significant housing expansion such legal water standards will over the years significantly reduce water demand to achieve improved water standards the purchase of water inefficient goods from the abu dhabi market must be made impossible e g by implementing water market transformations this is a successful action adopted throughout europe to control parts of the energy market specifically the removal of incandescent light bulbs 5 1 4 fiscal and information interventions the use of pricing mechanisms to control water demand has many drawbacks and there are very few instances of successful examples water is not readily substituted if it becomes more expensive unlike for example potatoes which can be substituted by wheat rice etc as water is not substitutable and is vital for life it is inelastic that is when the price changes the rate of consumption shows little movement examples of price influencing demand in denmark and bulgaria required a five fold increase in price to the point where it became punitive in addition if the price of water is broadly the same for all customers the modest reduction in demand as price per unit of water is increased found among the poorer customers is not likely to be found among in more affluent customer reactions however if a rising tariff is applied it will serve three functions i first it will exercise a very modest control on water demand ii second it will provide income to the water company to fund supply and demand side initiatives thus reducing pressure on the national government and iii third it will reinforce the message that water is a precious resource further the use of smarter meters informing customers of the volume used and the direct and indirect price an estimate of the energy used to heat the water will influence conservation behavior some studies have suggested an elasticity for outdoor water use of about 0 35 double that of indoor use most literature suggests indoor water demand is relatively insensitive to price decreasing at best by 10 against a 100 increase in price a possible additional intervention therefore is to price and meter indoor and outdoor water use separately this implies that there will have to be some means of regulating between these two uses the most obvious system would be through differently threaded connected outdoor taps and water systems i e through building codes and appliances regulations discussed earlier that further implies that the building regulations and the specifications for water using systems available on the market would also have to be controlled this is congruent with limiting the availability of low water efficiency goods in the market clearly such regulatory and market interventions would only be used under particular policy climates and thus applications would only occur in some scenarios although in its infancy a water cap and trade system applied to all consumers could potentially reduce residential water consumption in the long term by levering in the technical and behavioral innovations discussed here such a system addresses issues with the inefficiency of water pricing as a measure to curtail demand and its potential is reflected in the success of cap and trade systems for other common pool resources mitchell and mcdonald 2015 5 1 5 market interventions the various approaches discussed earlier will reduce water demand but are relatively inflexible tools unlikely to be able alone to reach the targets needed and unable to respond to changing conditions in a progressive and controlled manner cap and trade offers in the longer term a means by which control can be exercised in the water market cap and trade at its simplest establish a ceiling on the amount of water to be used and requires customers to trade water use certificates that control the amount of water they are permitted to use it has been explained in detail in mitchell and mcdonald 2015 who effectively demonstrated that the cap and trade system typically used in the energy and pollution control sectors can be applied to water cap and trade need not cover all water sectors at first it could be implemented on a trial basis on industry the limitation perhaps for abu dhabi is the modest size of the various water sectors but this is offset by the sustainability commitment and the ready acceptance of cutting edge approaches mitchell and mcdonald pers com have completed a global analysis of which countries have the sophistication to run such a system and also have the water resource deficit needed to make such a system necessary abu dhabi scores very highly on both counts in terms of having a serious water imbalance and very highly sophisticated infrastructure capable of driving a cap and trade system it also has the regulatory sophistication to control such a system 5 1 6 system interventions currently there appears to be an information deficit particularly in agriculture which lacks accurate or precise measures of the water used nor an estimation process thus it is impossible in some sectors to target interventions correctly consequently it is suggested that the water balance model be used to identify the most important information deficits and to set underway actions to reduce that deficit which could include simple modelling to estimate usage in unmetered activities several projects and initiatives have been implemented in recent years to cover this information gap also there are major opportunities to further integrate water and renewable energy management to enhance sustainability as outlined by teschner et al 2012 5 2 supply driven management for sustainable future there are opportunities to further integrate water supply and renewable energy to enhance sustainability in abu dhabi as discussed under this section 5 2 1 desalination there is debate over the best way forward for gcc countries to ensure sustainable water supplies through the desalination process al damkhi et al 2009 argues that the government should focus on existing resource use and non nuclear renewable energy technologies this follows recommendations from the masdar city project in abu dhabi and thoughts from fencl et al 2009 masdar city obtains its primary water supply from solar powered desalination owen 2011 however al mutaz 2001 advocates the use of nuclear energy for desalination despite its negative implications mcdonnell 2014 therefore there is a case to focus on existing and renewable energy resources which are likely to drive desalination costs down ghaffour et al 2013 in combination with consumer resource conservation however the validity of this recommendation will depend on the long term success of the uae s first nuclear plant mcdonnell 2014 once fully operational and future advances in desalination technology 5 2 2 wastewater reuse wastewater reuse has great potential to contribute to supply and minimize the supply demand gap chowdhury et al 2015 wastewater recycling is likely to significantly augment future water resources of the gcc countries al damkhi et al 2009 wastewater reuse is currently limited to municipal landscape irrigation el din et al 1994 further research into the feasibility of harnessing wastewater for reuse in all sectors is required commercial car washing facilities recycle their effluent for instance al damkhi et al 2009 combining reuse with a total outdoor conservation scenario in an arid region reduced demand by an additional 0 11 mcm day qaiser et al 2013 therefore for a sustainable future optimized recycle wastewater usage is recommended 5 2 3 leakage and irrigation to achieve the modeled sustainability scenarios leakage and irrigation should both be targeted qaiser et al 2011 2013 environment agency abu dhabi 2014 saif et al 2014 households lose an average of 124 l day to leaks and outdoor use is in excess of 1 200 l household day total outdoor conservation was identified as the best option among different conservation scenario options in a las vegas study qaiser et al 2013 there have been a number of successful programs in the usa for example which have resulted in water savings following an irrigation landscaping review rti international 2009 improving irrigation efficiencies and crop choices should be prioritized by changing the cropping calendar shifting to smart or drip irrigation systems reducing the area planted and altering the timing of watering gardens fencl et al 2009 qaiser et al 2011 saif et al 2014 over irrigation causes water losses through evapotranspiration and seepage to groundwater qaiser et al 2011 replacement of rhodes grass with buffelgrass a more water efficient crop should continue fencl et al 2009 5 3 strengths and limitations of the study in this study the use of scenarios revealed water management challenges for the ead up to the year 2050 a set of existing scenarios relevant to water management were elaborated through stakeholder workshops interviews and expert knowledge to identify drivers of water supply demand their interdependencies and influence on abu dhabi water system thus this study provided insights to the real context and challenges of abu dhabi in the realm of water management some values used in model are based on historical data projections and estimations some projections are based on assumptions supported by the available data 6 conclusions this study produced a forecast of the water balance in the emirate of abu dhabi to the year 2050 from which it was possible to identify actions needed to eliminate potential water shortages a series of future water scenarios were constructed to represent different future water conditions demographic conditions related to present and future water consumptions in the emirate of abu dhabi were central to the analyses the study presented a review of recommended actions to achieve a bwb all of the proposed actions were tailored to accommodate tangible conservation in water consumption the main and most important actions that should have long term and comprehensive impacts on all types of water use include public awareness programs that have already started in recent years other specific technologies and legislations targeting reductions in water consumptions for different demand sectors were also discussed while both the sc and res scenarios achieved a bwb throughout the entire period with no shortage the res scenario is recommended because the proposed interventions are expected to be more achievable and flexible given future uncertainties the study showed that new resources will be needed e g desalinated water to support the major increase in potable demands in later years if the business as usual and policy first scenarios are followed the business as usual path is not sustainable and the ead must make major changes in order to pursue the alternative sustainable pathways modelled however efforts need to be maximized at all levels from household to nationwide in order to make sustainability a reality data availability some of the data presented could be requested from

relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was funded by the environment agency of abu dhabi project 21r016 we would like to express our gratitude to all members of the agency who provided support throughout this research including assistance in collecting the needed data and communicating with different stakeholders 
8305,study region abu dhabi united arab emirates uae study focus water demand in the emirate of abu dhabi ead has increased significantly over the last few decades hence a main challenge for the ead water policy makers is to develop long term resilient water resources strategies this study evaluates future water supply demand condition in the ead and identifies water management strategies that support a sustainable future a dynamic water budget modelling framework is used to evaluate future water demand as affected by population growth economic growth proposed water related policies consumption patterns and climate change the abu dhabi dynamic water budget model adwbm is used to construct future water scenarios and assess the status of the ead water system until 2050 in terms of water supply demand balance this study presents four suites of water scenarios namely business as usual bau policy first pf sustainability by conservation sc and rainfall enhanced sustainability res scenarios new hydrological insights simulation results indicate that both sc and res scenarios achieved balanced water budget without any shortage throughout the entire period until 2050 the res scenario is recommended for adoption because of the reasonable and achievable proposed consumption reductions needed in the different demand sectors the obtained results should be valuable for devising appropriate strategies to prevent potential future water shortages in the emirate keywords scenario analysis sustainability water policy water conservation water resources management 1 introduction one of the major problems for policy makers in water management is the need to deal with uncertainties about the future this is because water policies guide actions for decades and therefore one should be able to forecast the future and provide solutions accordingly water infrastructure planning is a long term activity and the lifetime of the infrastructures exceed 50 100 years future water conditions are dependent on a number of factors like environmental economic social and political drivers that include demographic changes water resources availability water consumption patterns land use patterns governmental policies and so forth proskuryakova et al 2018 hence one of the main challenges for water managers is to foresee the future accurately and design appropriate infrastructure plans and policies based on the future requirements in such instances scenarios can be useful for evaluating the future conditions of water resources for management and infrastructure planning purposes many countries already face the problem of maintaining reliable water supplies to meet the growing demands and this will continue to worsen due to urbanization and industrialization the united arab emirates is not different with remarkably rapid changes in the population lifestyle and economy mohamed and almualla 2010a b several public policies may influence water demand for example policies supporting the expansion of agriculture with the aim of protecting the national heritage and decreas dependency on imported food could increase the demand for irrigation water likewise desert greening policies aiming to provide habitat for wild animals and stabilize sand around roads could also increase the demand for irrigation water other relevant policies include the development of public parks residential and commercial megaprojects implemented to support local population and tourism and industrialization driven by the government s diversification into non petroleum related industries furthermore climate change could be an important factorfor sustainable development as it may cause rising of sea levels drying up of surface water and groundwater and intense droughts national center of meteorology 2020 due to its arid climatic condition the ead has very limited renewable resources of groundwater and negligible surface water the key conventional sources of water environment agency abu dhabi 2009a water deficit in uae is generally managed by providing desalinated water and reusing treated wastewater statistics centre abu dhabi 2015 2018 the environmental impacts of desalination plants on the arabian gulf is well acknowledged in several studies al zubari 2009 ministry of water and environment 2010 alghafli 2016 thus integration of both supply and demand side management is essential for a sustainable water resources development in the region it is crucial to determine how the current and proposed policies will impact the long term objectives of water resources management and sustainability in the ead mathematical simulation models could enhance our understanding of the socio economic political and environmental factors and help us to evaluate the current and future water supply demand systems scenarios represent expositions of possible futures and are advantageous for examining the changing factors in shaping the future judging possible diversions from the current trends and preparing strategically for uncertainties and complexities in the long term scenarios can be used to assess future uncertainties and aid development of water management strategies carter et al 2007 thus scenarios analysis sa can help in choosing a reliable water policy for a state or nation by highlighting the best options among those predicted the development of scenarios has become popular topic ever since scenarios were first used by the u s in military planning van der heijden 2005 scenario development as a strategic planning tool became popular in different applications like social forecasting public policy analysis and decision making environmental management business development and water resources management hulse and gregory 2001 many studies of scenario analysis for water resource management exist for example zhuo et al 2016 deployed sa with a focus on crop production by assessing the water footprints and virtual water trades for time horizons between 2030 and 2050 proskuryakova et al 2018 developed water scenarios for russia by using sa data mining for a time horizon of 2030 these scenarios focused on sustainability water demands of households and industry and other basic needs in india amarasinghe et al 2007 developed scenarios for food and water futures for 2025 2050 and addressed various issues related to the business as usual scenario saraswat et al 2017 conducted a study in nepal that focused on urban water management and used sa to develop strategies for achieving sustainable water management practices for 2030 cetinkaya and gunacti 2018 developed scenarios for turkey and used a multi criteria analysis to measure the performance of these scenarios dong et al 2013 carried out a detailed review on the status of scenarios methodology in water resources management and indicated that the scenario approach was widely popular in exploring future water resource conditions and developing strategic plans amer et al 2013 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of approaches typically applied in scenario planning this work also considered scenario selection the appropriate number of scenarios required and ways to conduct scenario validation stewart et al 2007 proposed a five step iterative scenarion constructing approach mahmoud 2008 proposed a formal scenario development method for water resources management in the south western us henriques et al 2015 used sa for addressing water management challenges in england and wales for the years up to 2050 and four future scenarios were constructed based on stakeholder discussions and expert advices ercin and hoekstra 2014 developed scenarios for 2050 to understand changes in water footprints at both global and regional scales in a review study in the netherlands haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 concluded that scenario approaches are useful to deal with the uncertainties faced by water managers in decision making in the middle east al zubari 2009 developed four water scenarios for the gulf cooperation council gcc countries considering the different patterns of economic developments that can be implemented in the region al zubari identified four drivers that represent future scenarios as the market sustainability policies and security the literature confirms scenario development and analysis as a key tool to promote sustainable water management by planning in advance for a plausible future in this paper a dynamic simulation model developed for ead is applied to evaluate the water supply and demand for sustainable water resource management of abu dhabi the detailed description of the model development is available in mohamed et al 2016 the components and framework of the model are described here under methodology the model works on the basic time step of evaluating water balance every year each scenario is evaluated with regard to consumption reductions needed in water demand drivers as well as in water resources utilization the overall purpose of this study is to explore scenarios for water supply and demand of ead to 2050 outcomes of this study can be used by water decision makers water policymakers and stakeholders to develop long term plans and strategies for the ead water sector until 2050 this study explores four sets of plausible future scenarios along with the associated strategic steps required to achieve a sustainable future in water resources in the design process of these scenarios a number of drivers including population growth economic growth water consumption pattern and climatic change were incorporated the four future scenarios examined in this study are business as usual bau policy first pf sustainability by conservation sc and rainfall enhanced sustainability res this study could serve as the basis for future refinement in water resources planning and management using scenarios development in arid or semi arid regions the main innovative aspects of this paper are 1 conducting a detailed evaluation of abu dhabi s unique highly stressed water system with negligible surface water resources and man made water systems 2 considering several governmental policies relevant to water in developing plausible water scenarios for abu dhabi and 3 demonstrating scenarios development for a data scarce system this paper is organized as follows this section is followed by description of the study area in section 2 the methodology in section 3 describes the abu dhabi water system scenarios development and evaluation in section 4 the obtained results obtained of the four scenarios are presented section 5 discusses the results and their implications with respect to achieving a balanced water budget finally the conclusions drawn are given in section 6 2 study area abu dhabi is the largest emirate of the united arab emirates it is divided into three regions namely abu dhabi region al ain region and western region as shown in fig 1 the ead is bordered by oman in the east saudi arabia to south and west and the arabian persian gulf in the north it is characterized by an arid climate with scanty rainfall high temperatures high humidity and high evapotranspiration rates the land cover is mostly desert abu dhabi has a long coastline of more than 600 kms that is responsible for the humid climatic conditions the maximum temperature average above 40 c 104 f during the april september summer period the october march period is comparatively cool as rainfall is rare the natural recharge into groundwater is very low about 40 million cubic meters mcm yr environment agency abu dhabi 2009a mahmoud et al 2019 which adds to the water concerns of the emirate the ead has limited groundwater resources and as the abstraction rates are higher than the natural and artificial recharge rates major decline in groundwater levles and quality has been observed in many locations of the emirate elmahdy and mohamed 2013 and 2015 mohamed et al 2010a b water supply comes from different sources including groundwater seawater desalination treated sewage and surface runoff from rainfall these can be categorized into potable or non potable sources based on the type of demands they can satisfy of the seven demand sectors identified in ead four are considered potable namely residential commercial municipal and industrial these sectors require high quality fresh water desalinated water is the only source to meet potable demands of these four sectors desalination plants situated at different strategic locations within or outside the ead on the other hand groundwater is the main source for the other three non potable sectors agricultural forestry and amenities treated sewage and surface runoff provides minor support for non potable demand treated sewage ts is supplied to complement the needs in the forestry and amenities sectors only ts is a non conventional source of water produced by treating wastewater to reusable quality in ead there are wastewater treatment plants at all key population centers to produce and distribute ts the ead receives very low rainfall usually less than 100 mm per year environment agency abu dhabi 2009a consequently rainfall and runoff are not abundant water resources in the region very little data is available on abu dhabi s surface runoff most of the terrain is flat consisting of sandy soil with scattered dunes and some low elevation sabkhas flat area with salt deposits therefore little runoff is generated however in the east of the ead rainfall produces runoff that drains into the wadis creeks and flows westward crossing into abu dhabi providing about 7 6 mcm annually environment agency abu dhabi 2014 rainfall is estimated from data recorded at 24 stations across the ead water demand has increased significantly in the ead and the total water demand in 2011 was about 3416 mcm statistics centre abu dhabi 2012 the main driving forces of this increase are population growth and economic development population increase has driven much of the water consumption increase in abu dhabi emirate especially the residential commercial and municipal consumptions in 1975 the total population was 211 812 and increased to 1 399 484 by 2005 a 6 fold increase in 30 years statistics centre abu dhabi 2015 abu dhabi population has doubled in following nine years reaching 2 656 448 in mid 2014 statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 the average annual population growth rate 2005 2014 is 7 6 of the total population 507 479 people 19 1 are emirati citizens and the rest 80 9 are non citizens more than 66 5 of the population are males which is due to an influx of male migrant workers statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 the fertility rate in abu dhabi emirate is higher than most developed regions of the world and the mortality rate remains low in 2014 the crude birth and death rates were estimated to be 14 3 and 1 2 per 1000 population respectively statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 reflected in the high net growth rates of the population the population density of abu dhabi emirate in 2014 was 44 7 persons per square kilometer the population density in the three regions of the abu dhabi emirate abu dhabi region al ain region and western region are 148 9 52 6 and 8 9 persons per square kilometer respectively reflecting the varying urbanization levels statistics centre abu dhabi 2018 moreover changes in lifestyle have increased water demand for irrigation human consumption and industrial activities several public practices intensified the increase in water demand for example expansion of agriculture to protect rural heritage and reduce dependency on imported food also the expansion of desert greening to provide a habitat for wild animals stabilize the sand around roads and develope public parks to enhance outdoor activities 3 methodology the overall framework of the study is divided into three parts and is illustrated in fig 2 first the conceptual and dynamic structure of the abu dhabi water system was developed as shown in the upper part of fig 2 then the future scenario were designed and developed using control parameters and drivers to forecast future situation as shown in the middle part of fig 2 finally the developed scenarios were simulated using the abu dhabi dynamic water budget model adwbm mohamed et al 2016 to evaluate the future water balance and to identify needed interventions in the future consumption and supply patterns to achieve water balance as shown in the lower part three of fig 2 3 1 the abu dhabi water system the framework of abu dhabi water system is composed of the water supply demand elements and the external components that drive demand and supply the four supply sources groundwater gw desalinated water dw treated sewage ts and rainfall rf and seven demand sectors agriculture a forestry f amenities am residential r municipal m commercial c and industrial i conceptualize the structure of water system in abu dhabi the external drivers are categorized as environmental demographic and socioeconomic factors the adwbm was developed by establishing a holistic mass balance for the entire system during the process all the required data were collected and analyzed to identify key parameters that are essential for establishing the water balance these key parameters formed the basis for forecasting future water conditions adwbm is designed to evaluate the annual water balance the model also comprises external parameters that drive the water consumption and supply in the study area environmental and climatic components include rainfall humidity evaporation temperature and other climatic parameters that affect water demand and supply in abu dhabi additionally the different policies visions and strategies could impose impacts on the water resources therefore adwbm incorporates all these drivers to develop future water scenarios 3 2 scenario development scenarios refer to a series of assumptions or storylines depicting how the future of abu dhabi water system might unfold they can also be treated as a form of sensitivity analysis of the relationship between the changing forces and their outcomes the possible futures parsons et al 2007 the future water demand of the ead is dependent on many factors such as population growth urbanization environmental factors and policies the weights of these factors are diverse according to the scenario configuration and different assumptions are needed to test the effects of these factors hence scenario analysis is used to explore the balance of water supply and demand to achieve the goal of a sustainable abu dhabi as proposed in the ead environment vision 2030 environment agency abu dhabi 2012 in order to identify the key driving forces that determine the future of water system in abu dhabi stakeholders workshops were organized to discuss the current situation and to explore the focal objectives relevant to achieving sustainability in abu dhabi population growth and water demand data as well as other adwbm parameters serve as the foundation of this scenario development tables 1 3 represent the baseline values of all model input parameters water demand especially the potable water demand sectors is directly linked to population therefore population is incorporated as one of the key demand drivers for all potable sectors four population growth rates are considered in this study they are very high p1 high p2 medium p3 and low p4 growth rates table 1 these growth rates p1 p2 p3 and p4 are aligned with population trends described in the abu dhabi environment vision 2030 environment agency abu dhabi 2012 and lutz et al 2014 the high growth rates p1 and p2 represent the worst case and the market first mf growths respectively as described in environment agency abu dhabi 2012 the mf growth represents high immigration rates into the uae reflecting the rapid economic growth in the region the medium population growth p3 represents a balanced environment and gradual economic growth in abu dhabi whereas the low population growth p4 represents a green economy the later could be also used during extreme cases such as the current covid 19 pandemic reflecting low immigration rates into uae the availability of renewable water resources depends on climate factors like rainfall and temperature and may adversely be affected by future climate change in the region the ead is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its extreme arid climate and low lying coastal areas the ead has developed a climate change strategy that was incorporated into abu dhabi plan environment agency abu dhabi 2012 the change in climate is determined by past greenhouse gas emissions and for abu dhabi the impact of climate change is unlikely to make a severe change on water resources by 2050 dougherty et al 2009 environment agency abu dhabi 2014 this study designed four suites of water scenarios namely business as usual policy first sustainability by conservation and rainfall enhanced sustainability the first two scenarios focus on predicting the future of abu dhabi water under a continuing pattern of economic growth whereas the latter two are designed to achieve a balanced water budget until 2050 each scenario with a different set of assumptions and constraints for water use and supply was tested using several population growth models 3 2 1 business as usual bau scenarios the bau is a base scenario which represents a continuation of current trends of water demand and supply all the key parameter values are assumed to remain unchanged as in the baseline year 2015 except the population two population growth models medium p3 and very high p1 were used to develop two sub scenarios of the bau scenario the bau scenario with p3 medium population growth represents a balanced and gradual economic growth this is termed here as bau status quo sub scenario bau sq the bau worst case bau wc sub scenario considers a very high population growth rate p1 without a balanced environmental and economic growth rates these two reference sub scenarios illustrate a situation where there is no improvement in water supply and demand infrastructures with respect to the baseline year 2015 furthermore the bau sub scenarios assume no restriction on groundwater extraction therefore under these bau sub scenarios water consumption will continuously increase in the population dependent sectors e g residential while other sectors e g agricultural and forestry would maintain the baseline consumption throughout the bau water consumption values for the baseline year 2015 are summarized in table 3 3 2 2 policy first pf scenarios the pf scenario considers the currently approved policies to reduce water consumption in different demand sectors the abu dhabi water strategy environment agency abu dhabi 2014 specifies these policies as follows i desalination water demand is set to increase by 20 from the 2020 level in commercial municipal megaprojects ii annual groundwater extraction limit to 1980 mcm 10 reduction and 1430 mcm 35 reduction for 2020 and 2030 respectively iii 20 reduction of water use in public parks and gardens amenities by 2020 relative to 2010 consumption iv 10 and 20 reduction of water use in forestry sector by 2020 and 2030 respectively relative to 2010 water consumption and v 20 reduction of indoor and outdoor water consumption in residential sector by 2020 relative to 2010 water consumption based on population growth models the pf scenario is divided into three sub scenarios the first is called policy first market first pf mf assuming future high economic growth rates which will result in higher immigration rates of workers into the ead therefore this sub scenario uses the high population growth model p2 as discussed earlier the second sub scenario promotes environmental sustainability using low population growth model p4 and is called policy first environment first pf ef in this sub scenario lower immigration rates of expatriates into the ead are expected the environment first ef sub scenario used in this study represents a green economy environment agency abu dhabi 2012 a balance between these two sub scenarios is assumed in a third one called policy first balanced growth pf bg sub scenario which uses medium population growth model p3 3 2 3 sustainability by conservation sc scenarios this scenario represents a sustainable future as explained in the abu dhabi environment vision 2030 under such future there is a growing interest on sustainability across economic social and environmental sectors the current water consumptions rates in the ead are not considered to be sustainable over exploitation of scarce groundwater resources for agriculture should be constrained therefore this scenario is a target based scenario in which reductions in water consumption rates demand management in different sectors are sought through an iterative process to achieve a balanced water budget bwb until 2050 the sc sub scenarios are developed considering three population growth models sustainability by conservation balanced growth sc bg using p3 sustainability by conservation market first sc mf using p2 and sustainability by conservation environment first sc ef using p4 3 2 4 rainfall enhanced sustainability res scenarios the res scenario is another target based scenario which is developed to achieve a balanced water budget until 2050 taking into account key assumptions on rainfall and other water resources utilization factors rain enhancement technologies through cloud seeding is a promising solution offering a cost effective tool towards supplementing water supplies in the uae in this technology harmless natural salts such as potassium chloride and sodium chloride are used for cloud seeding therefore in this suite of sub scenarios it is assumed that abu dhabi will have an increased rainfall by 20 in addition strict sustainable use of available water sources desalination water groundwater and treated sewage is also assumed the desalination capacity can only be increased by 20 while remaining sustainable sustainable use of gw requires recharge rates to exceed abstraction rates for ts the sustainability condition is achieved by maximum utilization of generated ts in non potable demand sectors accordingly 95 utilization of generated ts is assumed in this scenario therefore an iterative simulation process was followed to find the optimized reductions needed for major potable and non potable sectors the main objective of this scenario is to determine an optimal solution for achieving water security in the ead like previous scenarios three sub scenarios are developed for three population growth rates which are res balanced growth res bg using p3 res market first res mf using p2 and res environment first res ef using p4 3 3 evaluation and analysis of scenarios all scenarios should be analyzed using a suitable mathematical simulation model to assess the consistency and coherence of the resulting data gallopin and rijsberman 2000 in this study the adwbm was used to evaluate the impacts of the developed scenarios all scenarios are evaluated with regard to water balance surplus or deficit compatibility with environmental and sustainability targets and sensitivity to key variables a schematic representation of the steps involved in scenarios simulations using adwbm is given in part three of fig 2 detailed description of the simulated results obtained from adwbm for all scenarios is presented in the next section 4 results 4 1 bau scenarios two sub scenarios were simulated under this scenario in the first one bau sq water demand is assumed to be driven by moderate population growth p3 total annual water demand of abu dhabi will increase from 3518 mcm in 2015 to 6107 mcm in 2050 with a 74 increase the key simulation results of bau sq scenario are given in fig 3 the bar graphs show the annual sector wise demands the trend of gw decline and annual supply by each source are represented by trend lines the results showed that the ead will face a deficit in both potable and non potable water requirements unless interventions are implemented the water deficit forecast under this sub scenario for the years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 are presented in the table 4 for bau sq the model predicts a shortage of 1675 mcm and 555 mcm in potable and non potable water supply respectively by the year 2050 the overall shortage will reach 2230 mcm the gw reserves under this scenario continue to decline steadily and will be reduced to half of the current gw reserve by 2050 fig 3 these increases in water demand and water shortages along with the steady decline in gw in the ead are alarming this therefore calls for achievable strategies to prevent water crisis in the future if the current consumption trends are continued it is evident that bau sq is not a balanced water budget scenario and thus cannot be adopted in the suite of bau scenarios a worst case future business as usual worst case bau wc is simulated as the second sub scenario it reflects potentially large increases in population identified by p1 in table 1 generally bau takes current trends forward in the case of abu dhabi however population and economic growths have been increasing dramaticaly and it is this continuation of this dramatic growth that provides one extreme of the bau envelope although this worst case is unlikely to happen it was included to show the huge impacts of such high population growth rates on water demands in the future in bau wc total water demand will reach 8389 mcm in 2050 nearly double that of the bau sq scenario fig 4 shows the sectoral demand over time the most consuming sectors if a bau wc scenario is adopted are those driven directly by population namely residential municipal commercial and amenities the huge annual demand increase in the residential sector approaches 3000 mcm in 2050 although the results show that there are significant differences in water deficit between bau sq and bau wc both show an alarming increase of water deficit requiring practical strategies and policies to avoid water crisis in the future 4 2 policy first scenarios the key results sector wise water demands water supply and decline of gw reserves for the pf bg scenario are shown in fig 5 the results demonstrate the positive impacts of approved policies against the bau scenarios the impacts on reducing water demands in all sectors are clear especially for the potable sectors based on pf bg results these polices if implemented will be effective in achieving a water balance until 2027 this is as expected as these policies were originally designed to help address water demands through 2030 however the results predict that some shortages will appear in 2028 and 2029 fig 6 for both non potable and potable demands which might require another set of policies such as an additional increase in the desalination capacity the model presented estimates of these shortages in both the potable and non potable sectors and these data could help to shape these new polices if needed within the pf scenarios another two cases simulated the impact of high mf and low ef population growth rates on the policies from the results pf mf scenario with high population growth showed a water deficit as early as 2026 fig 6 earlier than pf bg scenario and will require an earlier change in policies however in the case of pf ef scenario the low population growth would maintain a positive water balance until 2033 fig 6 thereafter deficiencies appear in the potable supply demand balance which must be addressed there is no non potable deficit forecast in this case 4 3 sustainability by conservation scenarios sc scenarios are target based iterative simulations carried out to achieve no water deficit until 2050 the corresponding conservations to be implemented in each demand sector are estmated during this iterative process the demand and supply details for the sc bg scenario are shown in fig 7 this figure shows that less than 15 of the strategic groundwater reserves are utilized until 2050 fig 7 it is clear that huge induced reductions in all sectors are needed to achieve the goals of this scenario the most notable are in the residential commercial agricultural and amenities sectors two additional cases associated with different population levels namely sc mf and sc ef were also simulated in order to achieve a bwb a second level of simulations were carried out to identify the demand drivers or demand sub sectors responsible for controlling majority of the water consumptions it is important to identify these drivers to implement the required demand reductions breakdown of these reductions at drivers level to achieve a bwb in the four major demand sectors is presented in table 5 residential sector uses eight drivers which control residential demand table 5 summarizes the values of these drivers required to achieve the sought bwb for all three sc sub scenarios it is worth noting that extreme reductions are needed in outdoor consumption especially by the year 2050 commercial sector consumption is driven by five main drivers 1 office employees 2 retail employees 3 restaurants 4 hotel rooms and 5 carwashes the target consumption rates to be achieved for these drivers are also shown in table 5 reducing the water consumptions in agriculture without affecting the production could be feasible by increasing irrigation efficiency so this efficiency was iteratively increased to reach the sought reductions in consumptions at different years to achieve a bwb scenario for the year 2020 and afterward it was not feasible to achieve bwb by just improving the irrigation efficiency because of the large required reductions in consumptions the only solution to achieve this was to reduce crop area after assigning a 60 increase in efficiency at these years the minimum reduction in crop area to achieve bwb was found to be 50 in 2030 and 86 in 2050 for all the sc scenario cases table 5 the selected 60 irrigation efficiency is perceived to be practical and feasible however irrigation efficiency improvements for vegetable crops and field crops are expected to be more achievable because of the likely increase in the use of drones for optimizing irrigation though assessments of crop health and soil moisture as this is more applicable for low lying field crops rather than orchards for forestry similar to the agricultural sector the first option considered was to increase irrigation efficiency without changing the current forestry area increasing efficiency alone will not be sufficient to achieve a bwb from 2020 and beyond which implies that reductions in the forest area will be needed reductions required are 30 in 2030 and 2050 if the irrigation efficiency can be increased to 60 table 5 although sc scenarios showed the target values needed to achieve bwb for abu dhabi until 2050 some of the conservation requirements are very challenging and need a complete change in consumption patterns in abu dhabi hence this scenario calls on policy makers to have long term strategy implementing stringent water conservation policies 4 4 rainfall enhanced sustainability scenarios the demand supply and gw conditions for the res bg scenario are shown in fig 8 two sub scenarios for the high and low population growth rates were simulated analysis of all sc scenarios indicate that with the effective implementation of different demand conservation strategies it will be possible to achieve a bwb this triggered proposing this set of res scenarios maximum utilization of ts 95 and minimum use of gw abstraction equal to recharge are assumed in this scenario similar to sc scenarios iterative simulations were conducted to find the optimized reductions needed for various demand sectors particularly residential commercial agricultural and forestry sectors table 5 summarizes the reductions needed by 2030 and 2050 for the different drivers relative to their current values to achieve a bwb in all three res sub scenarios res bg res mf res ef such reductions for residential and commercial drivers are expectedly lower in the res scenarios when compared to sc scenarios for agriculture and forestry sectors results were similar to the sc scenarios in this scenario the supply increase from rf and dw will not relax the expected future shortage in water one of the reasons is that this additions in rainfall along with the sustainable increase in dw will not be in par with the growing population however the increased rainfall can enhance the natural recharge of groundwater thus improving the sustainability of gw aquifers thus for a sustainable future large scale and sustainable increased rates of rf and dw are needed to avoid adopting strict conservation measures at the user level thus from the analyzed scenarios only strict conservation strategies can support the management of the existing water supply and demand system of the emirate and in turn can contribute to the realization of sustainable abu dhabi however res scenario may be preferred over sc scenario because comparatively lenient conservation measures may prevent water shortages in future 5 discussion 5 1 conservation based management for sustainable future the reductions in water demand that are to be achieved for each scenario require interventions to implement specific programs regulations and market interventions will be insufficient to attain such goals unless there is an acceptance of the need for change and this requires engagement programs here six interlinked categories of interventions and programs are discussed which can be applied to achieve a balanced water budget for abu dhabi 5 1 1 long term adjustment of attitude long term interventions are required to adjust the context and expectations without this interventions are likely to be unused discontinued or result in criticism two long term interventions are important namely i education and ii value promotion education concerning the importance of saving water needs to be part of the core curriculum in schools if a part of the infrastructure is to be recognized as important and valuable then some modest value has to be placed on its provision to the individual abu dhabi has already taken the important indeed vital first step in this by pricing and billing for domestic water use this needs to be expanded across all the water using sectors with the prices raised to a meaningful level the idea is not to use tariffs to control demand but to ensure that water is having a value for a long period water was free of charge to the customers but given the extreme water use per capita seen in many segments of the economy there is clearly a case for driving more forcefully recognition of its value water value enhancements and recognition through pricing and education are mutually supportive and underpin the long term success of the direct water saving interventions 5 1 2 short term technological legislative interventions external water use outdoor consumption is the major component of overall residential water use and needs to be tackled immediately both in terms of frequency and volume there are several technical and legislative options that can be adopted such as 1 allow external hose to use only on a permit and or rotational basis 2 fit all external taps with pressure reduction valves 3 fit all external taps with a period of use cut off simple or delayed restart 4 legislate to ensure that all external demands use only recycled water and 5 legislate to provide external water use permits only if full recycling is in place external use in a residential sector is for gardens primarily thus to mitigate the reduction in garden irrigation water information on the targeted irrigation of plants and the use of smart soil moisture sensors must be provided and adoption could be supported perhaps by some modest financial encouragement table 5 presents a series of reduction percentages in the residential sector needed to achieve the bwb for the sc and res scenarios this table depicts the rather elevated reduction levels needed in outdoor consumption in villas and shabiyats where reduction percentages from baseline values in some cases reached above 75 by 2050 introducing bylaws such as plumbing regulations to mandate greywater and toilet plumbing separation in construction for example will yield additional flexibility for the introduction of reuse requirements rti international 2009 and eventually lower the outdoor gardening demands many interventions to reduce indoor residential consumption exist several studies have demonstrated that high efficiency and low flow appliances can be effective regulators of residential demand ahmad and prashar 2010 grafton et al 2011 qaiser et al 2011 rockaway et al 2011 low cost devices with the highest potential savings are likely to be favored by residential consumers tap atomizers for instance are extremely low cost with high potential savings they can be installed easily and can reduce the consumption by as much as 90 this installation adaptation has specific relevance to abu dhabi since a residential end use study identified high tap use as a significant contributor to overall residential water use replacing the entirety of large appliances in existing homes may be seen as a less favorable option by the consumers because of the higher price and the installation time and thus inconvenience and disruption associated with it in a usa study showerhead and toilet replacements proved successful at producing significant water savings rti international 2009 and so prioritizing installation of efficient toilets and showers to new buildings exclusively is deemed appropriate replacement of standard efficiency toilets and showerheads with high efficiency equivalents when a property is sold could be required this equates to the requirement in the many uk areas that meters be installed on the sale of a house importantly these recommendations are supported by the environment vision 2030 which seeks to increase indoor water use efficiency of new and existing buildings by modifying current building codes environment agency abu dhabi 2014 modification of taps and showers to reduce flow is of high priority because of the low cost and immediate savings associated with these options as well as their success in existing studies ahmad and prashar 2010 rockaway et al 2011 such mandatory retrofitting could be expanded to xeriscaping in new and existing homes in the abu dhabi emirate and is likely to produce greater savings due to the high ratio of outdoor indoor usage xeriscaping is key to achieving the sc and res scenarios in particular other devices that should be considered but at a lower priority include dual flush toilets and sub metering dual flush toilets have been seen to have a statistically significant negative effect on water consumption grafton et al 2011 sub metering has been successful in some studies although voluntary installation produces bias since it is usually adopted by self selected low water users mitchell and mcdonald 2015 use of behavioral apps in promoting water conservation has been successful in the usa and europe over recent years these apps could potentially be successful in the emirate because of the relative youthfulness of the population and the experience and acceptance of rapid change and modernization behavioral campaigns have been tried over a longer time period with variable success fielding et al 2013 sustained programs are needed to assess the impact on water use but remain few in number ozkaynak et al 2012 in the ead appealing to the conscience of the people through their underlying islamic tradition and beliefs could help to achieve greater benefits from these campaigns ozkaynak et al 2012 the chartered institute of water and environmental management in the uk promotes behavioral change through faith leaders with conservation messages supported by scripture nawaz and sadek 2010 5 1 3 legislative changes in the market place in the same way as white goods are sold with a water and energy efficiency grading all housing can be subject to standards of water efficiency in the uk this has been attempted for social state housing and voluntarily for other developments clearly the same absolute target volume of water per house per day would not be realistic or indeed sensible and so requirements need to be set for each house type and incorporated into building codes there are a variety of international water standards for housing that are either based on whole house water use or set limits for each individual appliance since the most likely future for the ead is one of significant housing expansion such legal water standards will over the years significantly reduce water demand to achieve improved water standards the purchase of water inefficient goods from the abu dhabi market must be made impossible e g by implementing water market transformations this is a successful action adopted throughout europe to control parts of the energy market specifically the removal of incandescent light bulbs 5 1 4 fiscal and information interventions the use of pricing mechanisms to control water demand has many drawbacks and there are very few instances of successful examples water is not readily substituted if it becomes more expensive unlike for example potatoes which can be substituted by wheat rice etc as water is not substitutable and is vital for life it is inelastic that is when the price changes the rate of consumption shows little movement examples of price influencing demand in denmark and bulgaria required a five fold increase in price to the point where it became punitive in addition if the price of water is broadly the same for all customers the modest reduction in demand as price per unit of water is increased found among the poorer customers is not likely to be found among in more affluent customer reactions however if a rising tariff is applied it will serve three functions i first it will exercise a very modest control on water demand ii second it will provide income to the water company to fund supply and demand side initiatives thus reducing pressure on the national government and iii third it will reinforce the message that water is a precious resource further the use of smarter meters informing customers of the volume used and the direct and indirect price an estimate of the energy used to heat the water will influence conservation behavior some studies have suggested an elasticity for outdoor water use of about 0 35 double that of indoor use most literature suggests indoor water demand is relatively insensitive to price decreasing at best by 10 against a 100 increase in price a possible additional intervention therefore is to price and meter indoor and outdoor water use separately this implies that there will have to be some means of regulating between these two uses the most obvious system would be through differently threaded connected outdoor taps and water systems i e through building codes and appliances regulations discussed earlier that further implies that the building regulations and the specifications for water using systems available on the market would also have to be controlled this is congruent with limiting the availability of low water efficiency goods in the market clearly such regulatory and market interventions would only be used under particular policy climates and thus applications would only occur in some scenarios although in its infancy a water cap and trade system applied to all consumers could potentially reduce residential water consumption in the long term by levering in the technical and behavioral innovations discussed here such a system addresses issues with the inefficiency of water pricing as a measure to curtail demand and its potential is reflected in the success of cap and trade systems for other common pool resources mitchell and mcdonald 2015 5 1 5 market interventions the various approaches discussed earlier will reduce water demand but are relatively inflexible tools unlikely to be able alone to reach the targets needed and unable to respond to changing conditions in a progressive and controlled manner cap and trade offers in the longer term a means by which control can be exercised in the water market cap and trade at its simplest establish a ceiling on the amount of water to be used and requires customers to trade water use certificates that control the amount of water they are permitted to use it has been explained in detail in mitchell and mcdonald 2015 who effectively demonstrated that the cap and trade system typically used in the energy and pollution control sectors can be applied to water cap and trade need not cover all water sectors at first it could be implemented on a trial basis on industry the limitation perhaps for abu dhabi is the modest size of the various water sectors but this is offset by the sustainability commitment and the ready acceptance of cutting edge approaches mitchell and mcdonald pers com have completed a global analysis of which countries have the sophistication to run such a system and also have the water resource deficit needed to make such a system necessary abu dhabi scores very highly on both counts in terms of having a serious water imbalance and very highly sophisticated infrastructure capable of driving a cap and trade system it also has the regulatory sophistication to control such a system 5 1 6 system interventions currently there appears to be an information deficit particularly in agriculture which lacks accurate or precise measures of the water used nor an estimation process thus it is impossible in some sectors to target interventions correctly consequently it is suggested that the water balance model be used to identify the most important information deficits and to set underway actions to reduce that deficit which could include simple modelling to estimate usage in unmetered activities several projects and initiatives have been implemented in recent years to cover this information gap also there are major opportunities to further integrate water and renewable energy management to enhance sustainability as outlined by teschner et al 2012 5 2 supply driven management for sustainable future there are opportunities to further integrate water supply and renewable energy to enhance sustainability in abu dhabi as discussed under this section 5 2 1 desalination there is debate over the best way forward for gcc countries to ensure sustainable water supplies through the desalination process al damkhi et al 2009 argues that the government should focus on existing resource use and non nuclear renewable energy technologies this follows recommendations from the masdar city project in abu dhabi and thoughts from fencl et al 2009 masdar city obtains its primary water supply from solar powered desalination owen 2011 however al mutaz 2001 advocates the use of nuclear energy for desalination despite its negative implications mcdonnell 2014 therefore there is a case to focus on existing and renewable energy resources which are likely to drive desalination costs down ghaffour et al 2013 in combination with consumer resource conservation however the validity of this recommendation will depend on the long term success of the uae s first nuclear plant mcdonnell 2014 once fully operational and future advances in desalination technology 5 2 2 wastewater reuse wastewater reuse has great potential to contribute to supply and minimize the supply demand gap chowdhury et al 2015 wastewater recycling is likely to significantly augment future water resources of the gcc countries al damkhi et al 2009 wastewater reuse is currently limited to municipal landscape irrigation el din et al 1994 further research into the feasibility of harnessing wastewater for reuse in all sectors is required commercial car washing facilities recycle their effluent for instance al damkhi et al 2009 combining reuse with a total outdoor conservation scenario in an arid region reduced demand by an additional 0 11 mcm day qaiser et al 2013 therefore for a sustainable future optimized recycle wastewater usage is recommended 5 2 3 leakage and irrigation to achieve the modeled sustainability scenarios leakage and irrigation should both be targeted qaiser et al 2011 2013 environment agency abu dhabi 2014 saif et al 2014 households lose an average of 124 l day to leaks and outdoor use is in excess of 1 200 l household day total outdoor conservation was identified as the best option among different conservation scenario options in a las vegas study qaiser et al 2013 there have been a number of successful programs in the usa for example which have resulted in water savings following an irrigation landscaping review rti international 2009 improving irrigation efficiencies and crop choices should be prioritized by changing the cropping calendar shifting to smart or drip irrigation systems reducing the area planted and altering the timing of watering gardens fencl et al 2009 qaiser et al 2011 saif et al 2014 over irrigation causes water losses through evapotranspiration and seepage to groundwater qaiser et al 2011 replacement of rhodes grass with buffelgrass a more water efficient crop should continue fencl et al 2009 5 3 strengths and limitations of the study in this study the use of scenarios revealed water management challenges for the ead up to the year 2050 a set of existing scenarios relevant to water management were elaborated through stakeholder workshops interviews and expert knowledge to identify drivers of water supply demand their interdependencies and influence on abu dhabi water system thus this study provided insights to the real context and challenges of abu dhabi in the realm of water management some values used in model are based on historical data projections and estimations some projections are based on assumptions supported by the available data 6 conclusions this study produced a forecast of the water balance in the emirate of abu dhabi to the year 2050 from which it was possible to identify actions needed to eliminate potential water shortages a series of future water scenarios were constructed to represent different future water conditions demographic conditions related to present and future water consumptions in the emirate of abu dhabi were central to the analyses the study presented a review of recommended actions to achieve a bwb all of the proposed actions were tailored to accommodate tangible conservation in water consumption the main and most important actions that should have long term and comprehensive impacts on all types of water use include public awareness programs that have already started in recent years other specific technologies and legislations targeting reductions in water consumptions for different demand sectors were also discussed while both the sc and res scenarios achieved a bwb throughout the entire period with no shortage the res scenario is recommended because the proposed interventions are expected to be more achievable and flexible given future uncertainties the study showed that new resources will be needed e g desalinated water to support the major increase in potable demands in later years if the business as usual and policy first scenarios are followed the business as usual path is not sustainable and the ead must make major changes in order to pursue the alternative sustainable pathways modelled however efforts need to be maximized at all levels from household to nationwide in order to make sustainability a reality data availability some of the data presented could be requested from

8306,study region the study region is the amazon river basin which controls globally important water and energy fluxes study focus in the face of a changing climate and landscape it is critical that we understand how where and why surface water resources are changing specifically we must consider holistic changes to the water cycle to understand how water resources are affected by climate change and landscape alterations in this study we investigate changes to all major components of the water balance across the entire amazon basin we seek to understand 1 how changes to land cover and precipitation affect streamflow 2 how these factors affect evapotranspiration and groundwater storage water balance components and 3 how changes to the water balance partitioning may in turn alter streamflows new hydrological insights we find significant changes to streamflow of 9 5 mm yr on average across the amazon basin streamflow alterations show a spatially variable pattern with increasing discharge in the northern and western portions of the basin and decreasing discharge in the southern and eastern basin we also observe significant changes in evapotranspiration of 29 mm yr and groundwater storage increases of 7 1 mm yr together these results indicate that studies of streamflow change in the amazon should consider changes to the whole water budget including understudied aspects of groundwater storage across the basin keywords groundwater storage evapotranspiration amazon river streamflow climate change deforestation 1 introduction changes in climate and land cover including infrastructure development have been shown to alter the quality and availability of freshwater resources around the world at multiple scales vörösmarty et al 2000 pekel et al 2016 rivers are a critical component of many human and natural systems and river discharge patterns are changing globally hyndman et al 2017 hyndman 2014 the amazon river and its associated rainforest is one of the world s largest and most important freshwater ecosystems water fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere from this system affect the global water cycle coe et al 2016 river discharge is determined by the balance among precipitation surface and groundwater storage and evapotranspiration et to understand how amazon river discharge is changing we must understand each component that governs the water balance previous work has investigated changes in streamflow dynamics across the amazon basin with some studies finding opposing trends across regions e g espinoza villar et al 2009a gloor et al 2013 hayhoe et al 2011 dias et al 2015 timpe and kaplan 2017 levy et al 2018 and richey et al 1989 analysis of historical streamflow patterns at the confluence of the amazon river and rio negro at manaus by richey et al 1989 showed no significant change in long term discharge between 1903 and 1985 the discharge record analyzed in the study however predates a significant amount of the amazon basin deforestation and much of the observable changes in climate analysis of more recent discharge records have shown significant changes in amazonian streamflows for example gloor et al 2013 showed increases in streamflow and a shift toward more severe flows on the amazon s main stem at obidos from 1990 2010 they attributed this change to observed increases in precipitation which were attributed to increased sea surface temperatures and delivery of water vapor to the basin espinoza villar et al 2009a investigated the regional sub basin scale changes in streamflow in the amazon basin focusing primarily on the andean region they demonstrated increased streamflow in the northwestern basin and decreased streamflow in the western and southern basin with these observed changes attributed to changing precipitation patterns of streamflow change also vary in different locations and elevations across the basin molina carpio et al 2017 observed decreasing baseflows in lowland tributaries of the madeira river although such changes in baseflow were not observed in the andean tributaries of the madeira they also demonstrated that the andean region is influenced by changes in pacific ocean sea surface temperatures sst s while the lowland tributaries are affected by alterations to changes in the north atlantic ocean sst s the amazon river basin water balance is primarily driven by precipitation but is also affected by complex interactions between land cover land use soils temperature humidity precipitation and other landscape characteristics espinoza villar et al 2009a coe et al 2016 2017 maeda et al 2017 there are also significant feedbacks from changes in such landscape characteristics for example deforestation decreases evapotranspiration and increases land surface temperature and streamflow costa et al 2003 dias et al 2015 coe et al 2017 interactions between these systems are especially complex in the amazon where the rainforest plays an important role in regulating regional and global climate and hydrologic cycles there intense evapotranspiration in excess of 1000 mm yr provides considerable atmospheric moisture much of which is recycled within the system affecting precipitation and streamflow across the basin salati et al 1979 maeda et al 2017 regional scale modeling efforts coupled with satellite and ground based data have examined streamflow precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater storage to assess the changing water balance in the amazon basin costa and foley 1999 expanded the study of changing amazon hydrology to investigate changes in evapotranspiration and atmospheric water vapor transport between 1979 and 1996 their work demonstrated a significant decrease in water vapor transport both into and out of the amazon basin which was compensated by an increase in precipitation recycling within the basin while they observed no significant change in runoff the authors did note that future deforestation or climate change may disrupt evapotranspiration and precipitation recycling altering the other water balance components costa et al 2003 and coe et al 2011 showed that deforestation by decreasing evapotranspiration has contributed to an about 20 increase in the discharge of the tocantins araguaia river system in southeastern amazon panday et al 2015 quantified the opposing effects of deforestation 6 and climate change 14 on streamflow which led to an overall modest reduction in streamflow in the xingu basin this demonstrated how the streamflow effects of deforestation can be masked by those of climate change in the opposite direction these confounding responses are due to the complex interactions between land cover precipitation and streamflow while decreased et from deforestation can directly increase streamflows it can also decrease rainfall indirectly decreasing streamflow stickler et al 2013 levy et al 2018 analyzed observed streamflow land cover and climate data using advanced statistical modeling approaches to isolate the effects of change in individual components on observed streamflow in the southern amazon and tocantins basins they found that climate changes have reduced the deforestation driven changes in streamflows by 42 smaller site scale studies in the upper xingu basin have demonstrated through observational data hayhoe et al 2011 and models dias et al 2015 that conversion to soy agriculture decreased et and increased catchment outflow these studies estimated the contribution of baseflow to river discharge but did not quantify changes in groundwater storage large basin scale modeling efforts have also been undertaken in the amazon region to study hydrologic function and understand changing hydrologic conditions work by miguez macho and fan 2012a 2012b investigated the role of groundwater in the amazon hydrologic cycle showing groundwater to be an important component in regulating both streamflows and evapotranspiration rates in the amazon the contribution of groundwater to total water storage has also been investigated work by de paiva et al 2013 modeled the hydrologic and hydrodynamic conditions of the amazon basin using the mgb iph model to investigate which hydrologic processes control total water storage tws change in the amazon their results demonstrate that surface water accounts for 56 of total water storage change while soil water accounts for 27 and groundwater 8 conversely a similar study by pokhrel et al 2013 using the leaf hydro flood lhf model found that ground and soil water account for 71 of tws change while flood waters accounted for 24 and rivers 5 the difference in the estimated contribution of ground and soil waters between these two studies is likely due to the explicit simulation of deep groundwater in lhf this disagreement between the two simulation methods highlights the need to consider groundwater in studies of amazon hydrology while the importance of groundwater in the amazon basin has been considered in these studies the long term effects of land cover and climate change on groundwater storage is less well understood guimberteau et al 2017 used an ensemble of land surface models at the amazon basin scale to investigate the confounding effects of changing precipitation and land cover on streamflow in the region they modeled changes in streamflow and et using a range of deforestation scenarios their results corroborate those of panday et al 2015 indicating that deforestation offsets the climate change driven impacts on et and streamflow changes to streamflow patterns are also predicted to continue under projected changes to global climate and precipitation patterns sorribas et al 2016 used the same mgb iph model to investigate changes in streamflow under the ipcc s fifth assessment report cmip5 projected climate changes they found significant alteration to streamflow and inundation extent from the andean rivers to the lower amazon river changing streamflows driven by climate and landscape alterations also threaten other resources such as energy development stickler et al 2013 used land surface and climate models to demonstrate that when the land atmosphere interactions of deforestation are considered predicted energy generation at the belo monte hydropower dam on the xingu river will be drastically reduced by including the effects of deforestation on precipitation recycling they found that projected deforestation of 40 of the xingu basin would lower belo monte s energy generation capacity to 60 of the power industry s projections this failure to consider the effects of changing water resources on energy production is widespread within brazil in the tapajos basin with accounts for almost 50 of the planned potential hydropower development climate and land cover change could result in decreased energy generation up to 7 4 and increased interannual variability in power generation capacity up to 69 arias et al 2020 the studies outlined above have generally focused on changes in streamflow and precipitation driven by changes in land cover climate and sea surface temperature gloor et al 2013 espinoza villar et al 2009a few studies have investigated changes in the other major water balance comports of evapotranspiration and groundwater storage while changes in evapotranspiration have been included in some investigations of changing water resources alterations to the groundwater system have been the most understudied studies that have considered these factors used models and data at large watershed or catchment scales in particular panday et al 2015 using grace data and the ibis land surface model showed that changes in the groundwater storage associated with drought events significantly impacts interannual discharge variability in the 510 000 km2 xingu river basin niu et al 2017 using a process based hydrological model found that surface runoff variations in an upland amazon catchment were largely controlled by interannual precipitation variability evapotranspiration variability had less impact there is a need to further study the integrated changes in water resources through all major components of the water balance across the full amazon basin and to consider a broad range of factors affecting these changes this need is driven by the rapid alteration to the landscape across the amazon basin including deforestation and hydropower development to better protect the water resources of the amazon basin in the face of such landscape changes along with a changing climate a more holistic understanding of how the landscape responds to such alteration is needed this includes considering changes to the groundwater storage and evapotranspiration components of the water balance because streamflow is physically linked to the rest of the water balance any change in the amount of precipitation routed to groundwater storage or evapotranspiration is likely to affect streamflows here we seek to identify how and where streamflow characteristics change across the entire amazon basin in relation to changes in precipitation land cover groundwater storage and evapotranspiration across scales using a data driven approach we hypothesize that changes to the climate and landscape have altered all major components of the water balance and that this shift of water balance partitioning affects streamflows we first analyze over 35 years of streamflow data across the entire brazilian amazon and the neighboring tocantins araguaia basin and quantify changes in the magnitude and timing of discharge at seasonal and annual scales these discharge data are from a set of 126 gauged river basins ranging in drainage area from 12 396 km2 to 4 668 984 km2 with an average of 243 810 km2 we explore changes in streamflow patterns which manifest as changes in the magnitude timing and number of events based on summary streamflow metrics e g minimum and maximum flows we expect that the magnitude and direction of these changes will vary across the basin as has been demonstrated at coarser amazon basin and large sub basin scales gloor et al 2013 we then investigate changes in the other major components of the water balance by quantifying catchment scale precipitation groundwater storage and evapotranspiration across the basin to fully investigate changes in the storage and et components as well as their relationship to discharge dynamics we calculate the residual water budget within each streamflow basin and identify trends in these two components we then compare our calculated residual water budget to independent remotely sensed quantifications of groundwater storage and et while the data record for these products are not as long as those for our discharge and precipitation data they provide valuable insights into recent changes to groundwater and et and aid in our interpretation of the residual water budget we then discuss how changes in precipitation and land cover may be controlling the observed changes in streamflow et and groundwater storage this research furthers our understanding of how the water balance in the amazon basin is changing and highlights the important and understudied role of changes in groundwater storage and et across the basin 2 methods 2 1 site description the amazon river basin fig 1 spans 6 3 million km2 from the andes mountains in the west to the atlantic ocean in the east accounting for 17 of the world s total freshwater discharge and hosting a majority of the amazon rainforest in total about half of the world s remaining tropical forest lies within the amazon basin gloor et al 2013 the amazon rainforest ecosystem encompasses 5 4 million km2 providing 15 of global terrestrial photosynthesis 10 of global species diversity and storing 150 pg of carbon malhi et al 2008 lewinsohn and pardo 1994 annual average rainfall is between 1000 and 3000 mm across most of the basin with peak values of 4000 mm in the northwestern basin and minimum values of 100 mm in the andes along the southwestern rim of the basin haghtalab et al 2020 maeda et al 2017 the timing of rainfall also varies from early arrival in the southwestern basin december to february and later arrival in the northern basin march to may the far north and northwestern regions of the basin remain wet throughout most months of the year espinoza villar et al 2009b the rainforest also provides a massive water flux to the atmosphere with annual average et ranging from 1000 to 1500 mm yr maeda et al 2017 the water flux between the amazon and the atmosphere is so large that the ecosystem partially regulates its own climate through precipitation recycling as such the amazon region affects atmospheric circulation and energy fluxes on the global scale gloor et al 2013 coe et al 2016 costa and foley 2000 2 2 data here we used five major data sources to quantify changes in streamflow precipitation land cover groundwater storage and evapotranspiration we used daily discharge data from stream gauging stations operated by agência nacional de águas ana brazil s national water agency the length of record for stations varies but discharge data are generally available from the 1980 s to 2014 these streamflow stations are only within the brazilian amazon as we did not have access to streamflow data for any amazon streamflow stations in bolivia columbia ecuador and peru or more recent data from brazil streamflow records are affected by all hydrologic processes upstream of the sampling point so these data are affected by changing climate and land cover conditions outside the brazilian amazon as such we compare changing streamflow at these stations to climate and land cover change data across the entire amazon basin we obtained precipitation data from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps gridded daily precipitation product with 0 05 degree resolution from 1981 present funk et al 2014 haghtalab et al 2020 validated this data against the ana climate stations and found that the chirps data was more accurate than the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm product across our study region for our land cover data we used the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci land cover climate research data which is available annually from 1992 to 2014 with 300 m resolution esa 2009 we derived groundwater storage changes over the study area from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace monthly land mass grids from 2002 to 2014 with 1 degree resolution swenson 2012 landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 to quantify evapotranspiration we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2 gridded 8 day net evapotranspiration product available from 2000 to 2018 with 500 m resolution running and mu 2015 mu et al 2007 before data processing and analysis we formatted and quality checked the discharge data using python data for each station were cleaned to remove non numeric missing or duplicate values we then filtered the data by station to retain only years with greater than 95 of values present and only stations with at least 10 years of available data we further restricted this data to remove stations with drainage basins smaller than 12 321 km2 which is the approximate spatial resolution of our coarsest gridded dataset the grace total water storage estimates this resulted in a data set with 126 stations where the discharge records passed the quality assurance steps remotely sensed data were spatially and temporally resampled over the gauge basins as described below 2 3 analysis for our analysis we defined the water year as extending from december 1 to november 30 of the following year this allowed us to capture a full hydrograph cycle starting and ending at relatively low flows for most stations in each annual period we defined the wet and dry seasons as december 1 to april 30 and may 1 to november 30 respectively which provided a uniform seasonal definition across the basin based on previously established research in this region espinoza villar et al 2009a state that the wet season is december january and february in the south and march april and may in the north although peak precipitation may fall outside these bounds in the far northwestern parts of the amazon basin our use of december through april is thus logical for the scale of our analyses a different definition of the wet and dry seasons could alter results of seasonal metrics at some stations however this should not significantly alter long term trends in annual streamflow indices all data sets with monthly or finer resolution were assigned a time index identifying both the water year and a wet season dry season flag to understand how and where hydrology is changing within the study region we developed a set of hydrologic indices to quantify changes in volumetric and temporal components of the hydrograph table s1 the indices generally correspond to characteristics in the magnitude timing and patterns of hydrograph events specifically they describe average high and low flows flood and low flow occurrence hydrologic reversals and rates of water mass gain and loss in each subbasin these indices were selected as they summarize the major components of the hydrograph including important hydrologic conditions such as flood and baseflow we quantified these indices at monthly seasonal and annual timescales in addition to describing the hydrograph each defined streamflow index is also relevant to both ecological and ecosystem responses for example the timing number and magnitude of high flow events can alter habitat for fish species affecting their spawning migratory cycles and abundance e g tomasella et al 2013 castello et al 2015 2019 timpe and kaplan 2017 while a detailed discussion of the ecological impacts is beyond the scope of this study the results of change in these indices may be useful to ecological investigations in this region melack and coe 2020 to facilitate comparison with gauge basin averaged driver variables precipitation and land cover the selected indices were computed using basin yield by calculated as b y d a where d is discharge and a is the basin area we quantified all of the indices using statistical tools available in python or in the numpy oliphant 2006 scipy virtanen et al 2020 and statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 packages discharge data are available at many stations prior to 1980 however we chose to limit the temporal scope of our analysis based on the number of stations available in each year and the availability of precipitation data many of the discharge records before 1980 were incomplete as assessed by our quality control process described above to link spatially distributed drivers i e land cover precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater storage to gauged discharge we delineated watersheds upstream of each river gauging station for this we generated d8 flow direction greenlee 1987 and resultant flow accumulation rasters from the hydrosheds 3 arc second conditioned dem lehner et al 2006 using the arcmap 10 2 spatial analyst toolbox gauge stations were located according to their latitude longitude coordinates and then snapped to the raster cell with the highest flow accumulation within 1500 m the location of each gauge station was checked manually with 56 stations moved to overlie the appropriate cell identified from the flow accumulation raster once proper placement of the gauge stations was confirmed watersheds were generated from the flow direction raster using the watershed delineation routine within arcmap to understand how the spatial and temporal pattern of precipitation and land cover compare to those of the water balance components in our gauge basins we quantified changes in land cover and precipitation within each basin the area and relative proportion of each land cover class were calculated for each basin in all available years we combined all of the esa land cover classes for different natural vegetative types into summary land cover classes of natural vegetation and different agricultural classes as agriculture the natural vegetation summary class includes all naturally occurring terrestrial land cover types of the rainforest and cerrado biomes both contain significant tree cover and are the dominant biomes in the deforested regions of the amazon basin we then developed time series of forest and agriculture proportions in each basin to quantify daily gridded precipitation data we first spatially averaged over each gauge basin then temporally resampled to summarize mean annual and total annual precipitation we applied the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 to detect significant changes in our time series records for discharge and the associated driver variables implemented through a python script schramm 2016 we interpreted the results of this test using the z score metric where the sign indicates the direction and magnitude in the trend the mann kendall test was applied to annually averaged discharge precipitation and land cover change data as well as annual summaries of the discharge indices in the results section below we report results for gauges and basins that were shown to have significant change using a p value threshold of 0 1 for basins with a significant trend as identified by the mk test we used the theil sen slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 to calculate the slope of change this method which computes the median slopes of lines fit though pairs of points in the dataset is much less sensitive to outliers than simple linear regression methods lavagnini et al 2011 it has been used to identify trend magnitudes in hydrology and climate data records and is often used with the mk test li et al 2014 as with the mann kendall test the theil sen slope was applied to annual summaries of all data for which a trend was calculated the theil sen regression was implemented thought the scipy stats package in python oliphant 2006 to understand changes in observed discharge in the context of the complete hydrologic cycle we calculated the water balance for all data availabe in each gauge basin from 1983 2014 the standard water balance is shown in equation 1 where the change in total basin storage δ s mm yr is calculated by subtracting annual total basin yield b y mm yr and annual evapotranspiration e t mm yr from annual precipitation p mm yr 1 δ s p e t b y because we do not have evapotranspiration data for the entire period of the precipitation data we calculated the water balance residual wbr we define the wbr as the difference between basin averaged annual precipitation p mm yr and annual total basin yield b y mm yr for each gauge which equals the sum of the basin averaged annual evapotranspiration e t mm yr and change in total basin storage δ s mm yr as shown in equation 2 2 w b r δ s e t p b y to reduce the effects of outliers we computed a three year moving average of our calculated wbr value we assessed linear trends in this annual rolling average metric over the entire record length and over shorter periods for comparison to other products as discussed below we used the grace tellus monthly mass grids to separate the et and soil water storage values lumped within the wbr while the grace data do not cover our full discharge period they can help constrain changes to the individual components of the wbr from 2001 to 2014 we spatially averaged the grace data over each gauge basin using google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 to create time series data these data are reported in units of liquid water equivalent lwe which is the mass anomaly recorded by grace reported in terms of water depth lwe values represent the monthly total water storage tws on the landscape relative to the 2004 2010 average we calculated the mean of the three monthly tws products calculated independently by nasa jpl university of texas center for space research and gfz potsdam to use for further analyses we then computed two annual quantities from monthly tws 1 annual water year average total water storage and 2 annual change in storage δ s originally cm yr for each basin by subtracting the lwe value in december of the next water year from the december value at the beginning of the current water year taking the difference in tws values at the end of the dry season december of the water year november of the calendar year minimized the effect of surface water on the signal as this is the most hydrologically stable time of year as such the change between december tws values is assumed to be due to changes in groundwater storage we used data from 2003 to 2014 and interpolated the monthly mass values to fill in missing december values for 2011 an example of the time series data and trends for total water storage groundwater storage and delta s are shown in figure s1 for selected basins we then computed wbr estimated et for each basin as shown in eq 3 3 e t w b r δ s to estimate changes in groundwater storage we also analyzed the linear trends in the december tws values as with our analysis of δ s we used the december tws values in this analysis to minimize the effect of surface water changes on the signal to further validate this approach we quantified trends in the december streamflow values over the same period as an indication of changes to the end of dry season surface water storage to constrain our estimated changes in et we compared our et estimates with the modis evapotranspiration 8 day gridded product we prepared the modis grids for comparison with our estimated et value by spatial and temporal resampling in python first we spatially averaged the modis et composites over each gauge basin to minimize the effect of missing pixel values we then calculated the monthly average modis et value for each basin because et values are relatively stable day to day in this region monthly averages provide a robust estimate of et variation across the year here we do not assess the seasonality of missing composites or pixels which might impart biases into our calculated average modis et values analysis of the seasonality of missing modis data or its overall accuracy is beyond the scope of this study but should be investigated in subsequent research we then used monthly et values to create annual averages of et for each basin finally we compared trends and average values of these annual et estimates to our wbr estimated et calculations both the grace tws data and modis et data streams have much shorter records than precipitation and discharge in our region and as such the length of record for the wbr estimated et records were considerably shorter see figure s2 a graphical representation of our workflow for this study is presented in figure s3 due to different temporal spans of the data sources used in this analysis we were not able to independently quantify each water balance component for our full record from the early 1980 s to 2014 for which precipitation and discharge records are available instead we quantify the remotely sensed land cover et and groundwater storage estimates for their available records of 1992 2014 for esa land cover 2002 2014 for grace total water storage and 2006 2014 for modis et we then use these data sources to contextualize our results and validate our numerical water balance estimates of et a summary of the length of record for each dataset is presented in figure s2 additionally the long term average of basin yield chirps precipitation modis et and grace tws are shown in supplemental figures s4 and s5 3 results all of the hydrologic indices of the magnitude and timing of hydrograph events showed significant changes between 1980 and 2014 across most of the amazon basin here we focus on five indices to describe changes in streamflow across the available data record 1 annual average 2 wet and 3 dry season averages fig 2 as well as 4 10th and 5 90th percentile discharge fig 3 these indices have a similar spatial pattern in trend direction with the northern and western basin showing increasing discharge and the southern and eastern basin showing decreasing discharge some of the smaller gauge basins show greater trend magnitudes or opposite trends as their surrounding larger regions indicating heterogeneous hydrologic trends across the basin changes in annual wet and dry season basin yields are on average 9 5 mm yr but range up to 30 mm yr fig 2 the strongest trends of increasing flows in the north and decreasing flows in the south and east are intensified during the wet season 72 basins with significant trends especially in the northern rio negro and southeastern tocantins basins see location in fig 1 here intensification or intensified refers to an increase in the absolute magnitude of the trend or value for a given streamflow index trends in dry season streamflow are similar to trends in annual averages in both number of stations with significant change 79 for annual average 81 for dry season and magnitude of changes the 90th percentile of flow fig 3a had trends across 69 stations similar to those in annual streamflow however for this index the dichotomy between north and south is intensified changes in peak discharge and flood pulses represented by the 90th percentile of flow range from 60 to 100 mm yr in contrast the 10th percentile flow fig 3b indicator of baseflow had a different spatial pattern of change than those of annual discharge or peak flows across 107 stations baseflow which we calculated as the 10th percentile of discharge values are decreasing across most of the southern eastern and western portions of the basin the only areas experiencing increasing baseflow are in the far northern basin and select regions in the tocantins the magnitude of change in baseflow is also much smaller as might be expected given their lower absolute magnitude with a general range of 10 mm yr however increases as high as 40 mm yr were observed in the upper rio negro river basin in addition to changes in streamflow volume other hydrologic characteristics are changing across the amazon basin including the number of high low flow events figure s6 the rates of water entering and leaving the basin figure s8 and the amplitude and period of the hydrograph figure s10 as with metrics of streamflow volume changes in the number and timing of events are also spatially variable for example the northern and western basins are experiencing an increase in the number of flood events while the southern and southeastern basin are experiencing fewer flood events annually together these metrics indicated intensification of the hydrologic cycle across the northern basin with an increase in the number of flood events figure s6a the rate of water gain and loss from the basin figure s8 and the amplitude and period of the annual hydrograph figure s9 conversely the annual hydrograph of the southern and eastern basin has dampened with decreases in the number of flood events a shorter hydrograph period and a smaller hydrograph amplitude the timing of hydrologic events is also changing most notably a shift to later minimum flows in the western basin and earlier center of mass of flows in the northern and southern basin there have been significant increases in annual precipitation over most of the central and western basin fig 4 areas of significant decrease in annual precipitation occurred in a small number of watersheds in the southern basin wet season precipitation shows a wider extent of increased precipitation across the basin fig 4b dry season precipitation shows much fewer areas of significant change with increasing amounts in the western basin and decreasing amounts in the upper madeira basin fig 4c most of the forest loss in the basin from 1992 to 2015 occurred in the southern region also known as the arc of deforestation which encompasses the upper xingu tapajos and madeira basins fig 5 s11 and s12 at the basin scale the amount of forest lost is directly proportional to the increase of agricultural land in the same basin the tocantins basin had already experienced significant clearing of the natural cerrado vegetation and conversion to agriculture prior to the start of our land cover record in 1992 typical forest loss rates in the central and southern portions of the amazon range from 0 5 to 1 5 of the basin area per year much of the western and northern basin has experienced relatively little deforestation since 1992 analysis of the water balance residual for each gauge basin equation 1 shows significant changes in the sum of evapotranspiration and groundwater storage across the region fig 6 c previously discussed trends in precipitation fig 6a and basin yield fig 6b are mapped for the corresponding period from 1983 to 2014 limited by precipitation data availability trends in the three year moving average of this residual showed increases in the water balance residual over much of central and western portions of the region at the large gauge basin scale smaller basins throughout the region and most of the tapajos basin showed decreases in the water balance residual the tocantins showed a split pattern with increases in the wbr in the north and east and decreases in the southwest portion of the basin most basins have changes between 10 mm yr but they range from 20 to 39 mm yr no significant trend was detected for the xingu basin or the northwestern tocantins trends in the december tws values from grace fig 7 a indicate significantly increased groundwater storage in the xingu tapajos and upper madeira basins in the south as well as in the upper trombetas basin in the north average increases in groundwater storage across these basins were 7 1 mm yr with a maximum increase of 10 5 mm yr no significant decreases in groundwater storage were observed during this same period 2002 2014 the end of dry season discharge shown in supplemental figure 14 has not significantly changed in the xingu madeira or trombetas river basins we do not have sufficient data to assess change in the tapajos basin over this period however analysis for the full discharge record show end of dry season discharge increases in the trombetas and decreases in the tapajos basin the grace gravity anomaly data also showed significant increases in annual total water storage over most of the amazon basin but decreasing tws in the tocantins figure s12 the highest rates of tws increase are observed in basins along the main stem of the amazon river and in the northern trombetas basin basins with significant changes in estimated et equation 3 are shown in fig 7b the results of this analysis show increasing et in the western and south central amazon and decreasing et in the far northern region of the basin the trends in et are strong relative to the other water balance components with increases of 30 or more mm yr and decreases of a similar magnitude analysis of the modis et data available from 2006 to 2014 shows changes in annual average et figure s13 with slopes from 20 mm yr specifically the western and northern basins are showing decreases in et while portions of the upper madeira and tocantins show increases in et trends in our estimated et fig 7b over this period are similar to those in the modis et data figure s13 for the far southern madeira and northern portions of the basin but contrast markedly in the andean western part of the basin in addition the significant increases in et in the tocantins shown in the modis data are not observed in our estimated et the magnitude of the significant trends in both datasets were similar in addition to quantifying trends in both datasets we also compared the values for annual average et between the two datasets fig 8 c 4 discussion within the water balance streamflow is the most accurately measured quantity and commonly has the longest record figure s2 streamflow is an integrator of landscape water dynamics because it is affected by changes in all parts of the water balance as such changes in streamflow provide an important record of changes in water resources in basins like the amazon a number of previous studies demonstrate significant streamflow changes in specific regions or over restricted time spans and have generally focused on one driving factor to help explain these changes costa et al 2003 espinoza villar et al 2009a gloor et al 2013 coe et al 2011 hayhoe et al 2011 timpe and kaplan 2017 and levy et al 2018 our results demonstrate long term changes in streamflow across the entire amazon basin at multiple scales that are affected by complex interactions between climate and landscape factors in addition to changing streamflow patterns our research also demonstrates a significant and spatially variable change in precipitation patterns across the amazon basin haghtalab et al 2020 analyzed changing precipitation patterns including changes to the number of dry days and extreme events across the amazon basin their work showed a similar spatially explicit pattern of change in precipitation with increasing rainfall in the northern basin and decreasing rainfall in the southern basin in addition to changes in land cover and climate the development of physical infrastructure such as hydroelectric dams can alter hydrologic dynamics hydropower is an important energy source across the amazon basin moran et al 2018 with approximately 277 new hydroelectric dams in the early stages of planning and development across the basin castello and macedo 2016 previous work has demonstrated that hydropower infrastructure can affect the timing and magnitude of hydrologic events such as dampening the annual flood pulse timpe and kaplan 2017 while we do not explicitly quantify the effects of hydropower dams they are unlikely to affect long term annual average flows isolating the effects of dams is difficult as records of discharge both before and after installation are limited across the amazon and such changes are overprinted by climate and land cover induced hydrologic alterations furthermore our results indicate that changes in streamflow are also spatially variable with increasing flows in the western and northern basin and decreasing flows in the southern and eastern basin as shown in fig 2 these results support those of espinoza et al 2009a b which show a similar pattern of spatial variation in both precipitation and streamflow across the amazon basin work by duffy et al 2015 and sorribas et al 2016 indicates that this pattern of change in precipitation and discharge will continue with changing climate the duffy et al 2015 analysis of the outputs of 35 climate models in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip as summarized in the intergovernmental panel on climate change 5th assessment report ipcc ar5 indicates that decreased rainfall and more frequent drought will likely occur in the southern and eastern amazon while increased rainfall will likely occur in the north and west in the coming century hydrologic model discharge estimates from 2070 to 2099 by sorribas et al 2016 driven by the ipcc s fifth assessment report cmip5 indicate that the predicted changes in climate will continue to cause decreased streamflow in the eastern basin and increased flows in the western basin in addition to changes in streamflows we also observe significant changes in water balance residual wbr equation 2 shown in fig 6 which indicates that evapotranspiration and groundwater storage are also changing significantly across the basin this conclusion is supported by a first principles understanding of the water balance all of the precipitation reaching the land surface must be routed to streamflow surface water bodies subsurface storage or evapotranspiration given the relatively limited surface water storage in the basin any discrepancy in water mass between precipitation and discharge must either be stored in the subsurface or returned to the atmosphere via et together changes in streamflow data and the calculated wbr indicate that alterations to the landscape have likely affected all major components of the water balance in the amazon basin furthermore processes exerting control on et and groundwater storage including changes in climate land cover sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns have changed significantly since the 1980 s malhi et al 2008 haghtalab et al 2020 espinoza villar et al 2009a the observation that all parts of the water balance including understudied groundwater storage processes gleeson et al 2019 are changing is further supported by our analysis of modis et estimates and grace mass anomaly data these independent quantifications of et and groundwater storage show significant change in both parameters across the basin it is important to note that there are increasing trends in groundwater storage fig 7a in areas of deforestation fig 5b specifically in the xingu madeira and tapajos basins and significant precipitation increases fig 4 in the northern trombetas basin a comparison of grace data to the leaf hydroflood model indicated that changes in tws in the southeastern amazon are dominated by subsurface groundwater storage pokhrel et al 2013 which supports our results indicating groundwater storage increased in the madeira and tapajos basins the trombetas basin also shows some of the highest increases in groundwater storage while the xingu tapajos and madeira show lower rates of storage increase this further indicates that the processes driving groundwater storage increase are likely associated with precipitation increase in the northern basin and deforestation in the southern basin our approach to estimating change in groundwater storage is further supported by the analysis of changing streamflow at the end of the dry season december of the water year shown in figure s14 changes in streamflow are representative of those in surface water storage if changes in the end of dry season total water storage values were a result of changing surface water storage we would expect to observe increasing streamflows however we observe no increases in end of wet season streamflows in the xingu madeira or trombetas basins between 2002 2014 this further indicated that changes in end of dry season total water storage in these regions are a result of increased groundwater storage while we do not have a sufficient discharge record to assess trends in end of dry season discharge for the tapajos basin during the grace record 2002 2014 trends calculated over the full discharge record show no significant increase in december discharge in the tocantins because the ability to estimate water balance fluxes remotely across large areas is a recent advance due to satellite data the record lengths for the remotely sensed groundwater storage and et datasets are relativity short as such validation of our wbr calculation across its whole streamflow record is not possible observed changes in the grace groundwater storage and moids et data are of similar magnitude to those of the wbr and estimated et however our et estimates are consistently lower than those derived from modis data in the central and western portions of the basin while the absolute values of et are different in the two products both estimates show similar patterns of increased et in the southern basin and decreased et in the northern basin one notable exception is in the western andean region of the amazon which shows opposite trends in the two analysis this is likely caused by discrepancies in the chirps rainfall over the andes as discussed below although we cannot disentangle either groundwater storage or et from the wbr over its full record length this calculation suggests that changing climate and land cover have resulted in long term changes in groundwater storage and or et in the amazon basin site and regional scale studies of water dynamics in the amazon also support our conclusion of changing water balance dynamics transitions from forest to pasture or cropland results in shallow rooted land cover which cannot access deep soil moisture or groundwater coe et al 2016 von randow et al 2004 and thus decreasing et and affect groundwater storage in the system neill et al 2013 for example research in the upper xingu and tocantins basins shows that deforestation can increase both runoff to stream channels and soil moisture and decrease et coe et al 2011 hayhoe et al 2011 neill et al 2013 silvério et al 2015 arantes et al 2016 spera et al 2016 coe et al 2017 however extensive deforestation can result in reduced precipitation recycling leading to decreased streamflows stickler et al 2013 as agriculture continues to expand in conjunction with changing climate patterns brazilian agricultural systems may shift from being rainfed to the use of irrigation as evidenced by changes already occurring in the tocantins region a recent paper by latrubesse et al 2019 suggests that expansion of both agriculture and the use of irrigation could result in decreasing water storage and streamflows across the tocantins hydrologic modeling investigations have suggested groundwater plays an import role in the hydrology of the amazon basin miguez macho and fan 2012a used the leaf hydro flood model to investigate the importance of groundwater in streamflow and surface hydrology across the amazon their results indicate that groundwater buffers surface water resources during the dry season and drought conditions these results also indicate that groundwater has varying contribution to streamflow exerting the most control in headwater catchments further work by miguez macho and fan 2012b indicates that groundwater can also affect et capacity in the amazon the presence of groundwater below about 10 m depth can increase root water uptake allowing for continued evapotranspiration across the dry season and drought periods there are uncertainties in the data sets used to quantify changes in the water balance for example the et product is affected by cloud cover and land surface classifications and the chirps precipitation data product may underestimate rainfall in the western amazon basin in a similar manner as has been shown for the climatic research unit cru data coe et al 2009 this likely causes an underestimate of the water balance residual in this region which may explain some of the discrepancy between our estimated et and the modis data product second modis et underestimates et from 2000 to 2005 in the pantanal wetland of brazil and xingu penatti et al 2015 silvério et al 2015 and a similar bias was observed for the amazon basin in this study we thus restricted our modis data analysis to 2006 2014 while data availability for modis is limited in time it does provide a robust estimation of et across the entire amazon previous estimates of et have relied on mathematical estimation from incoming solar radiation or precipitation and rainfall data or the use of global climate models at the basin scale our water balance derived et estimates are lower than those from modis this indicates that either 1 our methods underestimate et due to discrepancies in one of the other water balance components such as underestimation of precipitation by chrips or 2 the modis et data overestimates et in the region further research would be necessary to investigate the cause of this mismatch specifically more direct measurements of et across the amazon are needed to compare with both statistical and remote sensing derived et estimates direct measurements of et exist from field campaigns such as the large scale biosphere atmosphere lba but have limited spatial coverage werth and avissar 2004 to better understand both natural variations in et and its responses to climate and land cover changes we will need to expand our quantifications of et across the basin these methods have been used to demonstrate the seasonality of et maeda et al 2017 and the change in et due to deforestation silvério et al 2015 but have not been used to assess long term trends in et across the amazon basin in addition limited understanding of certain physical process dynamics in the amazon also limits our analysis for example widespread measurements of depth to water or aquifer properties are not currently available in the amazon as such we do not have good constraints on the extent of storage change in these systems these processes affect the degree to which land cover and total storage change affect streamflow in a given region 5 conclusions the combined data records for discharge precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater storage suggest spatially variable changes in all components of the water balance across the amazon basin alterations to the water balance include average changes of 9 5 mm yr to discharge 7 7 mm yr to precipitation 29 mm yr to et and 7 1 mm yr to groundwater storage these observed changes are occurring in a spatially heterogeneous pattern with the northern and western basins showing different hydrologic responses than the southern and eastern basins previous research has attributed changing streamflows to 1 altered precipitation driven by natural climate variability and long term climate changes 2 increased runoff and deceased et due to land cover change 3 reduced precipitation due to reduced et and water vapor recycling in deforested regions our results support these previous findings and show that changing climate and land cover alter the major components of the water balance furthermore we suggest that that streamflows are also altered by changes to the water balance partitioning specifically due to altered groundwater storage in response to deforestation while our work demonstrates significant changes to the amazon basin s water balance we do not currently have enough data to separate changes in groundwater storage and et over the full discharge record such an analysis would require a model based investigation of alterations to the region s water balance using process based landscape hydrology and groundwater models would provide better understanding of the complex water cycle dynamics across the amazon basin such models could be used to explicitly simulate the historic effects of deforestation on groundwater storage and et rates and project changes in the amazon water balance in response to climate change scenarios though the end of this century in particular it will be important to explicitly model the role of changing groundwater storage in the basin s hydrology including how this storage is affected by landscape changes developing an understanding of this complex system through both field and modeling investigations is critical to better project the state of surface water resources within the amazon in the face of changes to both the climate and landscape changes in climate land cover and the hydrologic cycle are likely to continue in the amazon as population growth and increased resource demand continues the resulting alterations to streamflow precipitation groundwater storage and et can affect hydropower production agricultural yield fisheries nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration better understanding how the water balance changes in response to an altered climate and landscape will be important to preserve the water food energy and ecologic resources of the amazon basin author contributions

8306,study region the study region is the amazon river basin which controls globally important water and energy fluxes study focus in the face of a changing climate and landscape it is critical that we understand how where and why surface water resources are changing specifically we must consider holistic changes to the water cycle to understand how water resources are affected by climate change and landscape alterations in this study we investigate changes to all major components of the water balance across the entire amazon basin we seek to understand 1 how changes to land cover and precipitation affect streamflow 2 how these factors affect evapotranspiration and groundwater storage water balance components and 3 how changes to the water balance partitioning may in turn alter streamflows new hydrological insights we find significant changes to streamflow of 9 5 mm yr on average across the amazon basin streamflow alterations show a spatially variable pattern with increasing discharge in the northern and western portions of the basin and decreasing discharge in the southern and eastern basin we also observe significant changes in evapotranspiration of 29 mm yr and groundwater storage increases of 7 1 mm yr together these results indicate that studies of streamflow change in the amazon should consider changes to the whole water budget including understudied aspects of groundwater storage across the basin keywords groundwater storage evapotranspiration amazon river streamflow climate change deforestation 1 introduction changes in climate and land cover including infrastructure development have been shown to alter the quality and availability of freshwater resources around the world at multiple scales vörösmarty et al 2000 pekel et al 2016 rivers are a critical component of many human and natural systems and river discharge patterns are changing globally hyndman et al 2017 hyndman 2014 the amazon river and its associated rainforest is one of the world s largest and most important freshwater ecosystems water fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere from this system affect the global water cycle coe et al 2016 river discharge is determined by the balance among precipitation surface and groundwater storage and evapotranspiration et to understand how amazon river discharge is changing we must understand each component that governs the water balance previous work has investigated changes in streamflow dynamics across the amazon basin with some studies finding opposing trends across regions e g espinoza villar et al 2009a gloor et al 2013 hayhoe et al 2011 dias et al 2015 timpe and kaplan 2017 levy et al 2018 and richey et al 1989 analysis of historical streamflow patterns at the confluence of the amazon river and rio negro at manaus by richey et al 1989 showed no significant change in long term discharge between 1903 and 1985 the discharge record analyzed in the study however predates a significant amount of the amazon basin deforestation and much of the observable changes in climate analysis of more recent discharge records have shown significant changes in amazonian streamflows for example gloor et al 2013 showed increases in streamflow and a shift toward more severe flows on the amazon s main stem at obidos from 1990 2010 they attributed this change to observed increases in precipitation which were attributed to increased sea surface temperatures and delivery of water vapor to the basin espinoza villar et al 2009a investigated the regional sub basin scale changes in streamflow in the amazon basin focusing primarily on the andean region they demonstrated increased streamflow in the northwestern basin and decreased streamflow in the western and southern basin with these observed changes attributed to changing precipitation patterns of streamflow change also vary in different locations and elevations across the basin molina carpio et al 2017 observed decreasing baseflows in lowland tributaries of the madeira river although such changes in baseflow were not observed in the andean tributaries of the madeira they also demonstrated that the andean region is influenced by changes in pacific ocean sea surface temperatures sst s while the lowland tributaries are affected by alterations to changes in the north atlantic ocean sst s the amazon river basin water balance is primarily driven by precipitation but is also affected by complex interactions between land cover land use soils temperature humidity precipitation and other landscape characteristics espinoza villar et al 2009a coe et al 2016 2017 maeda et al 2017 there are also significant feedbacks from changes in such landscape characteristics for example deforestation decreases evapotranspiration and increases land surface temperature and streamflow costa et al 2003 dias et al 2015 coe et al 2017 interactions between these systems are especially complex in the amazon where the rainforest plays an important role in regulating regional and global climate and hydrologic cycles there intense evapotranspiration in excess of 1000 mm yr provides considerable atmospheric moisture much of which is recycled within the system affecting precipitation and streamflow across the basin salati et al 1979 maeda et al 2017 regional scale modeling efforts coupled with satellite and ground based data have examined streamflow precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater storage to assess the changing water balance in the amazon basin costa and foley 1999 expanded the study of changing amazon hydrology to investigate changes in evapotranspiration and atmospheric water vapor transport between 1979 and 1996 their work demonstrated a significant decrease in water vapor transport both into and out of the amazon basin which was compensated by an increase in precipitation recycling within the basin while they observed no significant change in runoff the authors did note that future deforestation or climate change may disrupt evapotranspiration and precipitation recycling altering the other water balance components costa et al 2003 and coe et al 2011 showed that deforestation by decreasing evapotranspiration has contributed to an about 20 increase in the discharge of the tocantins araguaia river system in southeastern amazon panday et al 2015 quantified the opposing effects of deforestation 6 and climate change 14 on streamflow which led to an overall modest reduction in streamflow in the xingu basin this demonstrated how the streamflow effects of deforestation can be masked by those of climate change in the opposite direction these confounding responses are due to the complex interactions between land cover precipitation and streamflow while decreased et from deforestation can directly increase streamflows it can also decrease rainfall indirectly decreasing streamflow stickler et al 2013 levy et al 2018 analyzed observed streamflow land cover and climate data using advanced statistical modeling approaches to isolate the effects of change in individual components on observed streamflow in the southern amazon and tocantins basins they found that climate changes have reduced the deforestation driven changes in streamflows by 42 smaller site scale studies in the upper xingu basin have demonstrated through observational data hayhoe et al 2011 and models dias et al 2015 that conversion to soy agriculture decreased et and increased catchment outflow these studies estimated the contribution of baseflow to river discharge but did not quantify changes in groundwater storage large basin scale modeling efforts have also been undertaken in the amazon region to study hydrologic function and understand changing hydrologic conditions work by miguez macho and fan 2012a 2012b investigated the role of groundwater in the amazon hydrologic cycle showing groundwater to be an important component in regulating both streamflows and evapotranspiration rates in the amazon the contribution of groundwater to total water storage has also been investigated work by de paiva et al 2013 modeled the hydrologic and hydrodynamic conditions of the amazon basin using the mgb iph model to investigate which hydrologic processes control total water storage tws change in the amazon their results demonstrate that surface water accounts for 56 of total water storage change while soil water accounts for 27 and groundwater 8 conversely a similar study by pokhrel et al 2013 using the leaf hydro flood lhf model found that ground and soil water account for 71 of tws change while flood waters accounted for 24 and rivers 5 the difference in the estimated contribution of ground and soil waters between these two studies is likely due to the explicit simulation of deep groundwater in lhf this disagreement between the two simulation methods highlights the need to consider groundwater in studies of amazon hydrology while the importance of groundwater in the amazon basin has been considered in these studies the long term effects of land cover and climate change on groundwater storage is less well understood guimberteau et al 2017 used an ensemble of land surface models at the amazon basin scale to investigate the confounding effects of changing precipitation and land cover on streamflow in the region they modeled changes in streamflow and et using a range of deforestation scenarios their results corroborate those of panday et al 2015 indicating that deforestation offsets the climate change driven impacts on et and streamflow changes to streamflow patterns are also predicted to continue under projected changes to global climate and precipitation patterns sorribas et al 2016 used the same mgb iph model to investigate changes in streamflow under the ipcc s fifth assessment report cmip5 projected climate changes they found significant alteration to streamflow and inundation extent from the andean rivers to the lower amazon river changing streamflows driven by climate and landscape alterations also threaten other resources such as energy development stickler et al 2013 used land surface and climate models to demonstrate that when the land atmosphere interactions of deforestation are considered predicted energy generation at the belo monte hydropower dam on the xingu river will be drastically reduced by including the effects of deforestation on precipitation recycling they found that projected deforestation of 40 of the xingu basin would lower belo monte s energy generation capacity to 60 of the power industry s projections this failure to consider the effects of changing water resources on energy production is widespread within brazil in the tapajos basin with accounts for almost 50 of the planned potential hydropower development climate and land cover change could result in decreased energy generation up to 7 4 and increased interannual variability in power generation capacity up to 69 arias et al 2020 the studies outlined above have generally focused on changes in streamflow and precipitation driven by changes in land cover climate and sea surface temperature gloor et al 2013 espinoza villar et al 2009a few studies have investigated changes in the other major water balance comports of evapotranspiration and groundwater storage while changes in evapotranspiration have been included in some investigations of changing water resources alterations to the groundwater system have been the most understudied studies that have considered these factors used models and data at large watershed or catchment scales in particular panday et al 2015 using grace data and the ibis land surface model showed that changes in the groundwater storage associated with drought events significantly impacts interannual discharge variability in the 510 000 km2 xingu river basin niu et al 2017 using a process based hydrological model found that surface runoff variations in an upland amazon catchment were largely controlled by interannual precipitation variability evapotranspiration variability had less impact there is a need to further study the integrated changes in water resources through all major components of the water balance across the full amazon basin and to consider a broad range of factors affecting these changes this need is driven by the rapid alteration to the landscape across the amazon basin including deforestation and hydropower development to better protect the water resources of the amazon basin in the face of such landscape changes along with a changing climate a more holistic understanding of how the landscape responds to such alteration is needed this includes considering changes to the groundwater storage and evapotranspiration components of the water balance because streamflow is physically linked to the rest of the water balance any change in the amount of precipitation routed to groundwater storage or evapotranspiration is likely to affect streamflows here we seek to identify how and where streamflow characteristics change across the entire amazon basin in relation to changes in precipitation land cover groundwater storage and evapotranspiration across scales using a data driven approach we hypothesize that changes to the climate and landscape have altered all major components of the water balance and that this shift of water balance partitioning affects streamflows we first analyze over 35 years of streamflow data across the entire brazilian amazon and the neighboring tocantins araguaia basin and quantify changes in the magnitude and timing of discharge at seasonal and annual scales these discharge data are from a set of 126 gauged river basins ranging in drainage area from 12 396 km2 to 4 668 984 km2 with an average of 243 810 km2 we explore changes in streamflow patterns which manifest as changes in the magnitude timing and number of events based on summary streamflow metrics e g minimum and maximum flows we expect that the magnitude and direction of these changes will vary across the basin as has been demonstrated at coarser amazon basin and large sub basin scales gloor et al 2013 we then investigate changes in the other major components of the water balance by quantifying catchment scale precipitation groundwater storage and evapotranspiration across the basin to fully investigate changes in the storage and et components as well as their relationship to discharge dynamics we calculate the residual water budget within each streamflow basin and identify trends in these two components we then compare our calculated residual water budget to independent remotely sensed quantifications of groundwater storage and et while the data record for these products are not as long as those for our discharge and precipitation data they provide valuable insights into recent changes to groundwater and et and aid in our interpretation of the residual water budget we then discuss how changes in precipitation and land cover may be controlling the observed changes in streamflow et and groundwater storage this research furthers our understanding of how the water balance in the amazon basin is changing and highlights the important and understudied role of changes in groundwater storage and et across the basin 2 methods 2 1 site description the amazon river basin fig 1 spans 6 3 million km2 from the andes mountains in the west to the atlantic ocean in the east accounting for 17 of the world s total freshwater discharge and hosting a majority of the amazon rainforest in total about half of the world s remaining tropical forest lies within the amazon basin gloor et al 2013 the amazon rainforest ecosystem encompasses 5 4 million km2 providing 15 of global terrestrial photosynthesis 10 of global species diversity and storing 150 pg of carbon malhi et al 2008 lewinsohn and pardo 1994 annual average rainfall is between 1000 and 3000 mm across most of the basin with peak values of 4000 mm in the northwestern basin and minimum values of 100 mm in the andes along the southwestern rim of the basin haghtalab et al 2020 maeda et al 2017 the timing of rainfall also varies from early arrival in the southwestern basin december to february and later arrival in the northern basin march to may the far north and northwestern regions of the basin remain wet throughout most months of the year espinoza villar et al 2009b the rainforest also provides a massive water flux to the atmosphere with annual average et ranging from 1000 to 1500 mm yr maeda et al 2017 the water flux between the amazon and the atmosphere is so large that the ecosystem partially regulates its own climate through precipitation recycling as such the amazon region affects atmospheric circulation and energy fluxes on the global scale gloor et al 2013 coe et al 2016 costa and foley 2000 2 2 data here we used five major data sources to quantify changes in streamflow precipitation land cover groundwater storage and evapotranspiration we used daily discharge data from stream gauging stations operated by agência nacional de águas ana brazil s national water agency the length of record for stations varies but discharge data are generally available from the 1980 s to 2014 these streamflow stations are only within the brazilian amazon as we did not have access to streamflow data for any amazon streamflow stations in bolivia columbia ecuador and peru or more recent data from brazil streamflow records are affected by all hydrologic processes upstream of the sampling point so these data are affected by changing climate and land cover conditions outside the brazilian amazon as such we compare changing streamflow at these stations to climate and land cover change data across the entire amazon basin we obtained precipitation data from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps gridded daily precipitation product with 0 05 degree resolution from 1981 present funk et al 2014 haghtalab et al 2020 validated this data against the ana climate stations and found that the chirps data was more accurate than the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm product across our study region for our land cover data we used the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci land cover climate research data which is available annually from 1992 to 2014 with 300 m resolution esa 2009 we derived groundwater storage changes over the study area from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace monthly land mass grids from 2002 to 2014 with 1 degree resolution swenson 2012 landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 to quantify evapotranspiration we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2 gridded 8 day net evapotranspiration product available from 2000 to 2018 with 500 m resolution running and mu 2015 mu et al 2007 before data processing and analysis we formatted and quality checked the discharge data using python data for each station were cleaned to remove non numeric missing or duplicate values we then filtered the data by station to retain only years with greater than 95 of values present and only stations with at least 10 years of available data we further restricted this data to remove stations with drainage basins smaller than 12 321 km2 which is the approximate spatial resolution of our coarsest gridded dataset the grace total water storage estimates this resulted in a data set with 126 stations where the discharge records passed the quality assurance steps remotely sensed data were spatially and temporally resampled over the gauge basins as described below 2 3 analysis for our analysis we defined the water year as extending from december 1 to november 30 of the following year this allowed us to capture a full hydrograph cycle starting and ending at relatively low flows for most stations in each annual period we defined the wet and dry seasons as december 1 to april 30 and may 1 to november 30 respectively which provided a uniform seasonal definition across the basin based on previously established research in this region espinoza villar et al 2009a state that the wet season is december january and february in the south and march april and may in the north although peak precipitation may fall outside these bounds in the far northwestern parts of the amazon basin our use of december through april is thus logical for the scale of our analyses a different definition of the wet and dry seasons could alter results of seasonal metrics at some stations however this should not significantly alter long term trends in annual streamflow indices all data sets with monthly or finer resolution were assigned a time index identifying both the water year and a wet season dry season flag to understand how and where hydrology is changing within the study region we developed a set of hydrologic indices to quantify changes in volumetric and temporal components of the hydrograph table s1 the indices generally correspond to characteristics in the magnitude timing and patterns of hydrograph events specifically they describe average high and low flows flood and low flow occurrence hydrologic reversals and rates of water mass gain and loss in each subbasin these indices were selected as they summarize the major components of the hydrograph including important hydrologic conditions such as flood and baseflow we quantified these indices at monthly seasonal and annual timescales in addition to describing the hydrograph each defined streamflow index is also relevant to both ecological and ecosystem responses for example the timing number and magnitude of high flow events can alter habitat for fish species affecting their spawning migratory cycles and abundance e g tomasella et al 2013 castello et al 2015 2019 timpe and kaplan 2017 while a detailed discussion of the ecological impacts is beyond the scope of this study the results of change in these indices may be useful to ecological investigations in this region melack and coe 2020 to facilitate comparison with gauge basin averaged driver variables precipitation and land cover the selected indices were computed using basin yield by calculated as b y d a where d is discharge and a is the basin area we quantified all of the indices using statistical tools available in python or in the numpy oliphant 2006 scipy virtanen et al 2020 and statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 packages discharge data are available at many stations prior to 1980 however we chose to limit the temporal scope of our analysis based on the number of stations available in each year and the availability of precipitation data many of the discharge records before 1980 were incomplete as assessed by our quality control process described above to link spatially distributed drivers i e land cover precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater storage to gauged discharge we delineated watersheds upstream of each river gauging station for this we generated d8 flow direction greenlee 1987 and resultant flow accumulation rasters from the hydrosheds 3 arc second conditioned dem lehner et al 2006 using the arcmap 10 2 spatial analyst toolbox gauge stations were located according to their latitude longitude coordinates and then snapped to the raster cell with the highest flow accumulation within 1500 m the location of each gauge station was checked manually with 56 stations moved to overlie the appropriate cell identified from the flow accumulation raster once proper placement of the gauge stations was confirmed watersheds were generated from the flow direction raster using the watershed delineation routine within arcmap to understand how the spatial and temporal pattern of precipitation and land cover compare to those of the water balance components in our gauge basins we quantified changes in land cover and precipitation within each basin the area and relative proportion of each land cover class were calculated for each basin in all available years we combined all of the esa land cover classes for different natural vegetative types into summary land cover classes of natural vegetation and different agricultural classes as agriculture the natural vegetation summary class includes all naturally occurring terrestrial land cover types of the rainforest and cerrado biomes both contain significant tree cover and are the dominant biomes in the deforested regions of the amazon basin we then developed time series of forest and agriculture proportions in each basin to quantify daily gridded precipitation data we first spatially averaged over each gauge basin then temporally resampled to summarize mean annual and total annual precipitation we applied the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 to detect significant changes in our time series records for discharge and the associated driver variables implemented through a python script schramm 2016 we interpreted the results of this test using the z score metric where the sign indicates the direction and magnitude in the trend the mann kendall test was applied to annually averaged discharge precipitation and land cover change data as well as annual summaries of the discharge indices in the results section below we report results for gauges and basins that were shown to have significant change using a p value threshold of 0 1 for basins with a significant trend as identified by the mk test we used the theil sen slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 to calculate the slope of change this method which computes the median slopes of lines fit though pairs of points in the dataset is much less sensitive to outliers than simple linear regression methods lavagnini et al 2011 it has been used to identify trend magnitudes in hydrology and climate data records and is often used with the mk test li et al 2014 as with the mann kendall test the theil sen slope was applied to annual summaries of all data for which a trend was calculated the theil sen regression was implemented thought the scipy stats package in python oliphant 2006 to understand changes in observed discharge in the context of the complete hydrologic cycle we calculated the water balance for all data availabe in each gauge basin from 1983 2014 the standard water balance is shown in equation 1 where the change in total basin storage δ s mm yr is calculated by subtracting annual total basin yield b y mm yr and annual evapotranspiration e t mm yr from annual precipitation p mm yr 1 δ s p e t b y because we do not have evapotranspiration data for the entire period of the precipitation data we calculated the water balance residual wbr we define the wbr as the difference between basin averaged annual precipitation p mm yr and annual total basin yield b y mm yr for each gauge which equals the sum of the basin averaged annual evapotranspiration e t mm yr and change in total basin storage δ s mm yr as shown in equation 2 2 w b r δ s e t p b y to reduce the effects of outliers we computed a three year moving average of our calculated wbr value we assessed linear trends in this annual rolling average metric over the entire record length and over shorter periods for comparison to other products as discussed below we used the grace tellus monthly mass grids to separate the et and soil water storage values lumped within the wbr while the grace data do not cover our full discharge period they can help constrain changes to the individual components of the wbr from 2001 to 2014 we spatially averaged the grace data over each gauge basin using google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 to create time series data these data are reported in units of liquid water equivalent lwe which is the mass anomaly recorded by grace reported in terms of water depth lwe values represent the monthly total water storage tws on the landscape relative to the 2004 2010 average we calculated the mean of the three monthly tws products calculated independently by nasa jpl university of texas center for space research and gfz potsdam to use for further analyses we then computed two annual quantities from monthly tws 1 annual water year average total water storage and 2 annual change in storage δ s originally cm yr for each basin by subtracting the lwe value in december of the next water year from the december value at the beginning of the current water year taking the difference in tws values at the end of the dry season december of the water year november of the calendar year minimized the effect of surface water on the signal as this is the most hydrologically stable time of year as such the change between december tws values is assumed to be due to changes in groundwater storage we used data from 2003 to 2014 and interpolated the monthly mass values to fill in missing december values for 2011 an example of the time series data and trends for total water storage groundwater storage and delta s are shown in figure s1 for selected basins we then computed wbr estimated et for each basin as shown in eq 3 3 e t w b r δ s to estimate changes in groundwater storage we also analyzed the linear trends in the december tws values as with our analysis of δ s we used the december tws values in this analysis to minimize the effect of surface water changes on the signal to further validate this approach we quantified trends in the december streamflow values over the same period as an indication of changes to the end of dry season surface water storage to constrain our estimated changes in et we compared our et estimates with the modis evapotranspiration 8 day gridded product we prepared the modis grids for comparison with our estimated et value by spatial and temporal resampling in python first we spatially averaged the modis et composites over each gauge basin to minimize the effect of missing pixel values we then calculated the monthly average modis et value for each basin because et values are relatively stable day to day in this region monthly averages provide a robust estimate of et variation across the year here we do not assess the seasonality of missing composites or pixels which might impart biases into our calculated average modis et values analysis of the seasonality of missing modis data or its overall accuracy is beyond the scope of this study but should be investigated in subsequent research we then used monthly et values to create annual averages of et for each basin finally we compared trends and average values of these annual et estimates to our wbr estimated et calculations both the grace tws data and modis et data streams have much shorter records than precipitation and discharge in our region and as such the length of record for the wbr estimated et records were considerably shorter see figure s2 a graphical representation of our workflow for this study is presented in figure s3 due to different temporal spans of the data sources used in this analysis we were not able to independently quantify each water balance component for our full record from the early 1980 s to 2014 for which precipitation and discharge records are available instead we quantify the remotely sensed land cover et and groundwater storage estimates for their available records of 1992 2014 for esa land cover 2002 2014 for grace total water storage and 2006 2014 for modis et we then use these data sources to contextualize our results and validate our numerical water balance estimates of et a summary of the length of record for each dataset is presented in figure s2 additionally the long term average of basin yield chirps precipitation modis et and grace tws are shown in supplemental figures s4 and s5 3 results all of the hydrologic indices of the magnitude and timing of hydrograph events showed significant changes between 1980 and 2014 across most of the amazon basin here we focus on five indices to describe changes in streamflow across the available data record 1 annual average 2 wet and 3 dry season averages fig 2 as well as 4 10th and 5 90th percentile discharge fig 3 these indices have a similar spatial pattern in trend direction with the northern and western basin showing increasing discharge and the southern and eastern basin showing decreasing discharge some of the smaller gauge basins show greater trend magnitudes or opposite trends as their surrounding larger regions indicating heterogeneous hydrologic trends across the basin changes in annual wet and dry season basin yields are on average 9 5 mm yr but range up to 30 mm yr fig 2 the strongest trends of increasing flows in the north and decreasing flows in the south and east are intensified during the wet season 72 basins with significant trends especially in the northern rio negro and southeastern tocantins basins see location in fig 1 here intensification or intensified refers to an increase in the absolute magnitude of the trend or value for a given streamflow index trends in dry season streamflow are similar to trends in annual averages in both number of stations with significant change 79 for annual average 81 for dry season and magnitude of changes the 90th percentile of flow fig 3a had trends across 69 stations similar to those in annual streamflow however for this index the dichotomy between north and south is intensified changes in peak discharge and flood pulses represented by the 90th percentile of flow range from 60 to 100 mm yr in contrast the 10th percentile flow fig 3b indicator of baseflow had a different spatial pattern of change than those of annual discharge or peak flows across 107 stations baseflow which we calculated as the 10th percentile of discharge values are decreasing across most of the southern eastern and western portions of the basin the only areas experiencing increasing baseflow are in the far northern basin and select regions in the tocantins the magnitude of change in baseflow is also much smaller as might be expected given their lower absolute magnitude with a general range of 10 mm yr however increases as high as 40 mm yr were observed in the upper rio negro river basin in addition to changes in streamflow volume other hydrologic characteristics are changing across the amazon basin including the number of high low flow events figure s6 the rates of water entering and leaving the basin figure s8 and the amplitude and period of the hydrograph figure s10 as with metrics of streamflow volume changes in the number and timing of events are also spatially variable for example the northern and western basins are experiencing an increase in the number of flood events while the southern and southeastern basin are experiencing fewer flood events annually together these metrics indicated intensification of the hydrologic cycle across the northern basin with an increase in the number of flood events figure s6a the rate of water gain and loss from the basin figure s8 and the amplitude and period of the annual hydrograph figure s9 conversely the annual hydrograph of the southern and eastern basin has dampened with decreases in the number of flood events a shorter hydrograph period and a smaller hydrograph amplitude the timing of hydrologic events is also changing most notably a shift to later minimum flows in the western basin and earlier center of mass of flows in the northern and southern basin there have been significant increases in annual precipitation over most of the central and western basin fig 4 areas of significant decrease in annual precipitation occurred in a small number of watersheds in the southern basin wet season precipitation shows a wider extent of increased precipitation across the basin fig 4b dry season precipitation shows much fewer areas of significant change with increasing amounts in the western basin and decreasing amounts in the upper madeira basin fig 4c most of the forest loss in the basin from 1992 to 2015 occurred in the southern region also known as the arc of deforestation which encompasses the upper xingu tapajos and madeira basins fig 5 s11 and s12 at the basin scale the amount of forest lost is directly proportional to the increase of agricultural land in the same basin the tocantins basin had already experienced significant clearing of the natural cerrado vegetation and conversion to agriculture prior to the start of our land cover record in 1992 typical forest loss rates in the central and southern portions of the amazon range from 0 5 to 1 5 of the basin area per year much of the western and northern basin has experienced relatively little deforestation since 1992 analysis of the water balance residual for each gauge basin equation 1 shows significant changes in the sum of evapotranspiration and groundwater storage across the region fig 6 c previously discussed trends in precipitation fig 6a and basin yield fig 6b are mapped for the corresponding period from 1983 to 2014 limited by precipitation data availability trends in the three year moving average of this residual showed increases in the water balance residual over much of central and western portions of the region at the large gauge basin scale smaller basins throughout the region and most of the tapajos basin showed decreases in the water balance residual the tocantins showed a split pattern with increases in the wbr in the north and east and decreases in the southwest portion of the basin most basins have changes between 10 mm yr but they range from 20 to 39 mm yr no significant trend was detected for the xingu basin or the northwestern tocantins trends in the december tws values from grace fig 7 a indicate significantly increased groundwater storage in the xingu tapajos and upper madeira basins in the south as well as in the upper trombetas basin in the north average increases in groundwater storage across these basins were 7 1 mm yr with a maximum increase of 10 5 mm yr no significant decreases in groundwater storage were observed during this same period 2002 2014 the end of dry season discharge shown in supplemental figure 14 has not significantly changed in the xingu madeira or trombetas river basins we do not have sufficient data to assess change in the tapajos basin over this period however analysis for the full discharge record show end of dry season discharge increases in the trombetas and decreases in the tapajos basin the grace gravity anomaly data also showed significant increases in annual total water storage over most of the amazon basin but decreasing tws in the tocantins figure s12 the highest rates of tws increase are observed in basins along the main stem of the amazon river and in the northern trombetas basin basins with significant changes in estimated et equation 3 are shown in fig 7b the results of this analysis show increasing et in the western and south central amazon and decreasing et in the far northern region of the basin the trends in et are strong relative to the other water balance components with increases of 30 or more mm yr and decreases of a similar magnitude analysis of the modis et data available from 2006 to 2014 shows changes in annual average et figure s13 with slopes from 20 mm yr specifically the western and northern basins are showing decreases in et while portions of the upper madeira and tocantins show increases in et trends in our estimated et fig 7b over this period are similar to those in the modis et data figure s13 for the far southern madeira and northern portions of the basin but contrast markedly in the andean western part of the basin in addition the significant increases in et in the tocantins shown in the modis data are not observed in our estimated et the magnitude of the significant trends in both datasets were similar in addition to quantifying trends in both datasets we also compared the values for annual average et between the two datasets fig 8 c 4 discussion within the water balance streamflow is the most accurately measured quantity and commonly has the longest record figure s2 streamflow is an integrator of landscape water dynamics because it is affected by changes in all parts of the water balance as such changes in streamflow provide an important record of changes in water resources in basins like the amazon a number of previous studies demonstrate significant streamflow changes in specific regions or over restricted time spans and have generally focused on one driving factor to help explain these changes costa et al 2003 espinoza villar et al 2009a gloor et al 2013 coe et al 2011 hayhoe et al 2011 timpe and kaplan 2017 and levy et al 2018 our results demonstrate long term changes in streamflow across the entire amazon basin at multiple scales that are affected by complex interactions between climate and landscape factors in addition to changing streamflow patterns our research also demonstrates a significant and spatially variable change in precipitation patterns across the amazon basin haghtalab et al 2020 analyzed changing precipitation patterns including changes to the number of dry days and extreme events across the amazon basin their work showed a similar spatially explicit pattern of change in precipitation with increasing rainfall in the northern basin and decreasing rainfall in the southern basin in addition to changes in land cover and climate the development of physical infrastructure such as hydroelectric dams can alter hydrologic dynamics hydropower is an important energy source across the amazon basin moran et al 2018 with approximately 277 new hydroelectric dams in the early stages of planning and development across the basin castello and macedo 2016 previous work has demonstrated that hydropower infrastructure can affect the timing and magnitude of hydrologic events such as dampening the annual flood pulse timpe and kaplan 2017 while we do not explicitly quantify the effects of hydropower dams they are unlikely to affect long term annual average flows isolating the effects of dams is difficult as records of discharge both before and after installation are limited across the amazon and such changes are overprinted by climate and land cover induced hydrologic alterations furthermore our results indicate that changes in streamflow are also spatially variable with increasing flows in the western and northern basin and decreasing flows in the southern and eastern basin as shown in fig 2 these results support those of espinoza et al 2009a b which show a similar pattern of spatial variation in both precipitation and streamflow across the amazon basin work by duffy et al 2015 and sorribas et al 2016 indicates that this pattern of change in precipitation and discharge will continue with changing climate the duffy et al 2015 analysis of the outputs of 35 climate models in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip as summarized in the intergovernmental panel on climate change 5th assessment report ipcc ar5 indicates that decreased rainfall and more frequent drought will likely occur in the southern and eastern amazon while increased rainfall will likely occur in the north and west in the coming century hydrologic model discharge estimates from 2070 to 2099 by sorribas et al 2016 driven by the ipcc s fifth assessment report cmip5 indicate that the predicted changes in climate will continue to cause decreased streamflow in the eastern basin and increased flows in the western basin in addition to changes in streamflows we also observe significant changes in water balance residual wbr equation 2 shown in fig 6 which indicates that evapotranspiration and groundwater storage are also changing significantly across the basin this conclusion is supported by a first principles understanding of the water balance all of the precipitation reaching the land surface must be routed to streamflow surface water bodies subsurface storage or evapotranspiration given the relatively limited surface water storage in the basin any discrepancy in water mass between precipitation and discharge must either be stored in the subsurface or returned to the atmosphere via et together changes in streamflow data and the calculated wbr indicate that alterations to the landscape have likely affected all major components of the water balance in the amazon basin furthermore processes exerting control on et and groundwater storage including changes in climate land cover sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns have changed significantly since the 1980 s malhi et al 2008 haghtalab et al 2020 espinoza villar et al 2009a the observation that all parts of the water balance including understudied groundwater storage processes gleeson et al 2019 are changing is further supported by our analysis of modis et estimates and grace mass anomaly data these independent quantifications of et and groundwater storage show significant change in both parameters across the basin it is important to note that there are increasing trends in groundwater storage fig 7a in areas of deforestation fig 5b specifically in the xingu madeira and tapajos basins and significant precipitation increases fig 4 in the northern trombetas basin a comparison of grace data to the leaf hydroflood model indicated that changes in tws in the southeastern amazon are dominated by subsurface groundwater storage pokhrel et al 2013 which supports our results indicating groundwater storage increased in the madeira and tapajos basins the trombetas basin also shows some of the highest increases in groundwater storage while the xingu tapajos and madeira show lower rates of storage increase this further indicates that the processes driving groundwater storage increase are likely associated with precipitation increase in the northern basin and deforestation in the southern basin our approach to estimating change in groundwater storage is further supported by the analysis of changing streamflow at the end of the dry season december of the water year shown in figure s14 changes in streamflow are representative of those in surface water storage if changes in the end of dry season total water storage values were a result of changing surface water storage we would expect to observe increasing streamflows however we observe no increases in end of wet season streamflows in the xingu madeira or trombetas basins between 2002 2014 this further indicated that changes in end of dry season total water storage in these regions are a result of increased groundwater storage while we do not have a sufficient discharge record to assess trends in end of dry season discharge for the tapajos basin during the grace record 2002 2014 trends calculated over the full discharge record show no significant increase in december discharge in the tocantins because the ability to estimate water balance fluxes remotely across large areas is a recent advance due to satellite data the record lengths for the remotely sensed groundwater storage and et datasets are relativity short as such validation of our wbr calculation across its whole streamflow record is not possible observed changes in the grace groundwater storage and moids et data are of similar magnitude to those of the wbr and estimated et however our et estimates are consistently lower than those derived from modis data in the central and western portions of the basin while the absolute values of et are different in the two products both estimates show similar patterns of increased et in the southern basin and decreased et in the northern basin one notable exception is in the western andean region of the amazon which shows opposite trends in the two analysis this is likely caused by discrepancies in the chirps rainfall over the andes as discussed below although we cannot disentangle either groundwater storage or et from the wbr over its full record length this calculation suggests that changing climate and land cover have resulted in long term changes in groundwater storage and or et in the amazon basin site and regional scale studies of water dynamics in the amazon also support our conclusion of changing water balance dynamics transitions from forest to pasture or cropland results in shallow rooted land cover which cannot access deep soil moisture or groundwater coe et al 2016 von randow et al 2004 and thus decreasing et and affect groundwater storage in the system neill et al 2013 for example research in the upper xingu and tocantins basins shows that deforestation can increase both runoff to stream channels and soil moisture and decrease et coe et al 2011 hayhoe et al 2011 neill et al 2013 silvério et al 2015 arantes et al 2016 spera et al 2016 coe et al 2017 however extensive deforestation can result in reduced precipitation recycling leading to decreased streamflows stickler et al 2013 as agriculture continues to expand in conjunction with changing climate patterns brazilian agricultural systems may shift from being rainfed to the use of irrigation as evidenced by changes already occurring in the tocantins region a recent paper by latrubesse et al 2019 suggests that expansion of both agriculture and the use of irrigation could result in decreasing water storage and streamflows across the tocantins hydrologic modeling investigations have suggested groundwater plays an import role in the hydrology of the amazon basin miguez macho and fan 2012a used the leaf hydro flood model to investigate the importance of groundwater in streamflow and surface hydrology across the amazon their results indicate that groundwater buffers surface water resources during the dry season and drought conditions these results also indicate that groundwater has varying contribution to streamflow exerting the most control in headwater catchments further work by miguez macho and fan 2012b indicates that groundwater can also affect et capacity in the amazon the presence of groundwater below about 10 m depth can increase root water uptake allowing for continued evapotranspiration across the dry season and drought periods there are uncertainties in the data sets used to quantify changes in the water balance for example the et product is affected by cloud cover and land surface classifications and the chirps precipitation data product may underestimate rainfall in the western amazon basin in a similar manner as has been shown for the climatic research unit cru data coe et al 2009 this likely causes an underestimate of the water balance residual in this region which may explain some of the discrepancy between our estimated et and the modis data product second modis et underestimates et from 2000 to 2005 in the pantanal wetland of brazil and xingu penatti et al 2015 silvério et al 2015 and a similar bias was observed for the amazon basin in this study we thus restricted our modis data analysis to 2006 2014 while data availability for modis is limited in time it does provide a robust estimation of et across the entire amazon previous estimates of et have relied on mathematical estimation from incoming solar radiation or precipitation and rainfall data or the use of global climate models at the basin scale our water balance derived et estimates are lower than those from modis this indicates that either 1 our methods underestimate et due to discrepancies in one of the other water balance components such as underestimation of precipitation by chrips or 2 the modis et data overestimates et in the region further research would be necessary to investigate the cause of this mismatch specifically more direct measurements of et across the amazon are needed to compare with both statistical and remote sensing derived et estimates direct measurements of et exist from field campaigns such as the large scale biosphere atmosphere lba but have limited spatial coverage werth and avissar 2004 to better understand both natural variations in et and its responses to climate and land cover changes we will need to expand our quantifications of et across the basin these methods have been used to demonstrate the seasonality of et maeda et al 2017 and the change in et due to deforestation silvério et al 2015 but have not been used to assess long term trends in et across the amazon basin in addition limited understanding of certain physical process dynamics in the amazon also limits our analysis for example widespread measurements of depth to water or aquifer properties are not currently available in the amazon as such we do not have good constraints on the extent of storage change in these systems these processes affect the degree to which land cover and total storage change affect streamflow in a given region 5 conclusions the combined data records for discharge precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater storage suggest spatially variable changes in all components of the water balance across the amazon basin alterations to the water balance include average changes of 9 5 mm yr to discharge 7 7 mm yr to precipitation 29 mm yr to et and 7 1 mm yr to groundwater storage these observed changes are occurring in a spatially heterogeneous pattern with the northern and western basins showing different hydrologic responses than the southern and eastern basins previous research has attributed changing streamflows to 1 altered precipitation driven by natural climate variability and long term climate changes 2 increased runoff and deceased et due to land cover change 3 reduced precipitation due to reduced et and water vapor recycling in deforested regions our results support these previous findings and show that changing climate and land cover alter the major components of the water balance furthermore we suggest that that streamflows are also altered by changes to the water balance partitioning specifically due to altered groundwater storage in response to deforestation while our work demonstrates significant changes to the amazon basin s water balance we do not currently have enough data to separate changes in groundwater storage and et over the full discharge record such an analysis would require a model based investigation of alterations to the region s water balance using process based landscape hydrology and groundwater models would provide better understanding of the complex water cycle dynamics across the amazon basin such models could be used to explicitly simulate the historic effects of deforestation on groundwater storage and et rates and project changes in the amazon water balance in response to climate change scenarios though the end of this century in particular it will be important to explicitly model the role of changing groundwater storage in the basin s hydrology including how this storage is affected by landscape changes developing an understanding of this complex system through both field and modeling investigations is critical to better project the state of surface water resources within the amazon in the face of changes to both the climate and landscape changes in climate land cover and the hydrologic cycle are likely to continue in the amazon as population growth and increased resource demand continues the resulting alterations to streamflow precipitation groundwater storage and et can affect hydropower production agricultural yield fisheries nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration better understanding how the water balance changes in response to an altered climate and landscape will be important to preserve the water food energy and ecologic resources of the amazon basin author contributions

8307,study region kaleya river catchment in southern zambia study focus the ability of a landscape hydrology approach to detect controls on water availability in a fragmented landscape to inform interventions under a changing environment was investigated simple and measurable climatic and landscape pattern attributes were analysed using change detection trend analysis and backward variable elimination with partial least squares regression plsr to identify controls on seasonal river flows and how landscape components could be enhanced to augment natural river flows new hydrological

seasonal rainfall characteristics than to annual rainfall totals additionally regeneration of larger forest patches could improve river flows the approach can be applied in other regions keywords landscape metrics rainfall characteristics landscape fragmentation seasonal flows variable importance in projection 1 introduction the landscape is a mosaic of many land use types land cover composition with different geometric and spatial arrangements land cover configuration hence the observed hydrological signatures are a result of the linear and non linear interaction of landscape patterns landcover composition and configuration with climatic variables ekness and randhir 2015 hughes et al 2014 although it can be argued that the inter relationships between landscape elements such as forest and hydrology are well known such interactions can be more complex in the rapidly fragmenting landscapes of tropical and subtropical africa guzha et al 2018 malmer et al 2010 despite a plethora of studies investigating land use impacts on hydrological dynamics most studies focus on landscape composition proportion of a landcover class in the landscape using landscape ecology it has been shown that processes such as runoff generation infiltration evapotranspiration et hydrological connectivity sediment transport and water quality are also related to landscape configuration at a watershed scale shi et al 2013 boongaling et al 2018 ding et al 2016 in this regard landscape metrics indices of landscape pattern developed in the field of landscape ecology are increasingly drawing scholarly attention to understand hydrological fluxes in a changing environment ekness 2013 epting 2016 albalawneh et al 2015 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 ding et al 2016 combining hydrological modelling with multivariate statistical methods is becoming widely used in attributing land use controls on hydrological change for example recently partial least square regression plsr was applied to attribute hydrological change to specific changes in land use landcover composition using river flows and sediment data simulated by hydrological models according to various land use scenarios shi et al 2013 woldesenbet et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2019 but the underlying drivers of hydrological variability from among climate landscape composition and configuration controls are rarely investigated simultaneously additionally the studies have mainly used simulated river flows however in fragmented heterogenous and intensively managed meso scale catchments such as the kaleya in southern zambia where dam management operations data does not exist the actual hydrological signatures and processes are difficult to reproduce due to modelling and calibration uncertainties abbaspour et al 2018 hughes et al 2014 hughes 2006 moreover seasonal climatic characteristics in semi arid areas like zambia could be more important in explaining seasonal water availability than annual totals and or land use composition thus managing water resources under a changing environment requires information on specific climatic changes the water resources must adapt to this study addresses these gaps through the lenses of landscape hydrology the field of landscape hydrology provides an opportunity to integrate landscape ecology and catchment hydrology schröder 2006 ferguson 1991 landscape hydrology deals with landscape components such as climate land use composition and configuration including soils geology and topography and how their interactions affect water movement and storage in the catchment landscape ferguson 1991 one of the most distinguishing features of the landscape hydrology approach is that it considers the interactions among the landscape components and how they can be modified by human impact to better manage the water resources and the environment in general ferguson 1991 thus it can provide a framework for informing water resource management decisions in heterogeneous and increasingly fragmented catchment landscapes under a changing climate the kaleya river catchment in southern zambia has undergone extensive landscape transformations since the early 1980s the catchment hosts zambia s oldest private public sugar irrigation scheme akayombokwa et al 2017 seasonal river flows have reduced drastically in the catchment leading to conflicts among water users studies have attributed deterioration of water resources in zambia to changes in landcover composition sakeyo 2008 chisola and kuraz 2016 chomba 2017 tena et al 2019 muchanga et al 2019 climate change and variability are thought to be causing further stress on water resources grz 2008 nkhuwa et al 2013 ngoma et al 2017 although this has mostly not been backed up by scientific evidence as few hydrological studies have been completed nkhuwa et al 2013 in this regard we developed and tested a landscape hydrology approach to tease out how the interactions among seasonal climatic landcover composition and configuration patterns explain the observed hydrological shifts in the kaleya river catchment in particular the study addressed the following research questions 1 how have seasonal climatic characteristics and landscape patterns changed in the catchment since 1972 2 what climatic land use composition and configuration characteristics are important in explaining changes in seasonal river flows in the catchment 3 how should landscape components be enhanced in order to augment seasonal river flows 4 can a landscape hydrology approach implemented without hydrological simulation detect the main interactions among landscape components to inform landscape level water resource management interventions in a heterogeneous and fragmented catchment landscape such information can inform improved decision making and sustainable water resource development under a changing environment 2 description of the study area the kaleya river catchment has an area of about 744 km2 and lies between latitude 15 40 s to 16 20 s and longitude 27 30 e to 28 10 e fig 1 the river water originates from the slow flowing springs upstream near the siamakambo hills in chikankata district of the southern province and flows in the northwest direction into the mazabuka district where it drains into the kafue river the major tributaries of the kaleya river include the chinyanja nanswa mbolela and dimba rivers the flow in the middle section of the catchment is highly regulated by weirs and small dams dam height less than 15 m of these small dams the largest has a capacity of about 6 5 mm3 the catchment is dominated by savannah woodland with a mixture of acacia trees mainly faidherbia albida formerly acacia albida belonging to the munga woodlands and the brachystegia genus of the miombo woodland sichingabula et al 2000 agriculture is the major economic activity in the catchment riparian dependent subsistence farmers are present in the upper catchment many of who were resettled into the area by government before the 1970s these farmers mainly grow maize zea mays l in the rainy season and potatoes solanum tuberosum l among other vegetables in the dry season commercial farmers occupy about 75 of the catchment area and are mostly located in the middle part they mainly grow wheat triticum aestivum l soybeans glycine max l sugarcane saccharum officinarum l lucerne medicago sativa l pasture and seed maize using centre pivots and drip irrigation additionally they keep livestock mainly for the beef industry the lower part of the catchment is home to the sugar estates of the kaleya small holders company as well as nakambala sugar estates belonging to zambia sugar company irrigation water for the two sugar estates is transferred from the kafue river by the zambia sugar company who also supply water to the kaleya small holders company 3 materials and methods 3 1 the landscape hydrology approach we used climatic indices and landscape pattern metrics derived from long term weather data and satellite images respectively to infer controls on seasonal river flows without need for hydrological modelling the approach was applied using post classification landscape change detection trend analysis of hydro meteorological time series and variable elimination in partial least square regression plsr the details of how the approach was implemented are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 2 data acquisition and pre processing cloud free landsat images of the kaleya river catchment were downloaded from the website of the united states geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov for years 1972 1984 1989 1996 2001 and 2011 the images were pre processed by applying geometric and radiometric corrections that included noise and haze reduction pre processing also involved resampling the 60 m resolution landsat mss image for 1972 to a 30 m resolution using the nearest neighbour resampling method all the image pre processing steps were conducted in erdas imagine 2014 historical daily river discharge data from the start of records at the most downstream gauge to 2019 1975 2019 were provided by the water resources management authority warma in zambia however the dataset has gaps between 2011 and 2018 so we restricted our analysis to the 1975 2011 period weather data were obtained from the zambia meteorological department zmd 3 3 data analysis 3 3 1 hydrological and climate based metrics the discharge data was analysed using the indicators of hydrological alteration iha software the nature conservancy 2009 to derive hydrological metrics that define seasonal water availability average monthly flows and the timing of one day maximum and minimum flows in the catchment for the period 1975 2011 the climate based metrics involved seasonal characteristics derived from daily rainfall data analysed in r instant parsons et al 2017 the derived metrics included one day maximum rainfall simple rainfall intensity the ratio of total seasonal rainfall to the number of wet days in the season onset and cessation dates of rainfall and the maximum dry spell length maximum dry period length in a year and annual rainfall totals when deriving the climatic metrics a rainy day was defined as having more than 0 85 mm of rainfall stern et al 2006 the start onset of rainfall was a day after 1 october in each year that gives a total rainfall amount of 20 mm or more over a consecutive period of two days in addition to the absence of a dry spell of 10 days or more in the next 30 days based on stern et al 2006 a dry spell was taken as a period with less than 5 mm of rainfall in five days adopted from hachigonta et al 2008 the date of cessation of rainfall end of rains was taken as the last day after 25 february that accumulates a rainfall amount of 10 mm or more adapted from hachigonta et al 2008 and mupangwa et al 2011 we also derived reference evapotranspiration eto based on the hargreaves method hargreaves 1994 in r environment through the spei package beguería et al 2014 the coefficient of variation cv was computed as the standard deviation of rainfall divided by the average rainfall 3 3 2 digital image processing to derive landscape composition and configuration metrics the landsat images were classified using a hybrid of supervised image classification and onscreen digitising in erdas imagine software to produce landcover maps for the years 1972 1984 1989 1996 2001 and 2011 the hybrid method involved first classifying the images with maximum likelihood classifier using supervised image classification this was followed by onscreen digitising to correct any misclassified pixels the hybrid method has been recommended by other scholars as it reduces misclassifications in heterogeneous landscapes such as kaleya herold et al 2008 betru et al 2019 the generated landcover maps were then subjected to accuracy assessment topographic maps along with google earth imagery and field visits in august 2019 were used as sources of ground truth data for accuracy assessment the landcover maps are based on six classes namely forest scrubland cropland rainfed cropland irrigated reservoirs and built up area a description of these landcover classes is given in table 1 3 3 3 generating landscape composition and configuration metrics from landcover maps landcover maps for the respective years were analysed using fragstat 4 software mcgarigal and marks 1995 to derive landscape composition and configuration metrics we evaluated three class level landscape pattern metrics table 2 based on their use in literature and simplicity in interpretation and application zhou et al 2017 the largest patch index lpi indicates patch dominance mcgarigal et al 2012 the patch density pd indicates landscape fragmentation fragmentation and dominance based metrics are important indicators of hydrological connectivity and ecosystem functioning albalawneh et al 2015 schröder 2006 hence their changes can lead to significant changes in water and nutrient cycling hobbs 1993 a detailed description of the landscape metrics is given by mcgarigal and marks 1995 and mcgarigal et al 2012 a summary of all the derived hydrological climatic and landscape indicators is given in table 3 3 3 4 analysis of trends in hydrometeorological timeseries 3 3 4 1 mann kendall trend test we conducted the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 on seasonal climatic and hydrological variables in table 3 to examine the significance of the trends in the study period to account for serial correlation we used the modified mann kendall test through the yue and wang 2004 variance correction technique in the modifiedmk r package patakamuri et al 2017 the mann kendall test is given by the equation 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the number of observations x j and x i are the jth and ith observations respectively and j i sgn is the sign function between consecutive x values and is defined as 2 sgn x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i the variance is defined by 3 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 j 1 n t i i i 1 2 i 5 18 the modified variance var s is 4 v a r s v a r s n n where n n is the correction factor the test statistic z c is computed by 5 z c s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 given a significant level of α 0 05 the null hypothesis of a non existent trend can be accepted if 1 96 z c 1 96 for a two sided test 3 3 4 2 theil sen s slope estimator the trend magnitude was evaluated using the sen s slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 which is given as 6 β m e d i a n x i x j i j j i where β is the slope of the trend in the time series and x j is the j th observation 3 4 partial least squares regression studies incorporating landscape composition and configuration metrics to attribute influence on hydrological components have mainly combined hydrological modelling with multiple linear regression ekness 2013 epting 2016 pearson correlation chiang et al 2019 stepwise regression amiri et al 2019 yu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 or plsr boongaling et al 2018 shi et al 2013 gebremicael et al 2019 woldesenbet et al 2017 among other methods however previous studies did not incorporate seasonal climatic and landscape composition and configuration metrics simultaneously which could be important in informing water resources management in heterogenous landscapes under a changing environment the independent and dependent variables for our plsr models are given in table 3 3 4 1 justification for partial least squares regression plsr the plsr was selected for several reasons firstly we had many independent variables landscape and climate metrics table 3 and most of them are highly correlated the plsr is useful when the independent variables are highly correlated and where there are more independent variables than observations boongaling et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2017 carrascal et al 2009 secondly given the high number of independent variables in our case variable selection was important to identify only those that are significantly important in explaining seasonal river flows plsr is thus also a powerful tool for variable selection several methods for variable selection in plsr are available and are discussed in detail by mehmood et al 2012 generally variable selection in plsr is based on the variable importance in projection vip the loading weights and regression coefficients but the vips are the most used mehmood et al 2012 variables with vip 0 8 are deemed to be significant variables with a vip 0 8 have no significant influence in the model the higher the vip the more significant the variable is in explaining the dependent variable the plsr also gives regression coefficients whose sign indicates a positive or negative influence on the dependent variable thus despite a variable having a small regression coefficient it can be retained in the model if it has a large vip vip 0 8 loading weights greater than a magnitude of 0 3 irrespective of the sign are taken to be significant and a variable can be deemed important on this basis the sign of the loading weight indicates the direction of influence the higher the loading weight the larger the influence that a variable has on the respective component to obtain the optimum number of components and a balance between the explanatory and the predictive power of the model cross validation is often used in this regard the root mean square error of validation rmsev is used the number of components giving the smallest value of rmsev are selected as optimal for the model the quality of the plsr model is assessed using the goodness of fit r2 which indicates the explanatory ability of the model and the cross validated r2 which shows the extent to which the model can predict a good plsr model is one with r2 0 5 and a cross validated r2 0 097 trap et al 2013 3 4 2 implementation of the partial least squares regression plsr we implemented the plsr in the pls package mevik and wehrens 2007 in r software we developed four separate plsr models for each of the hydrological variables wet season flows dry season flows date of one day maximum flow and date of one day minimum flow the independent variables predictors were all the climate and landcover composition and configuration metrics as outlined in table 3 the climatic and hydrological variables were averaged within small hydro meteorological periods avoiding inclusion of periods and years with data gaps in order to get the most out of the observed data the hydro meteorological periods used were 1975 1979 1980 1985 1989 1994 1995 2000 2001 2005 and 2006 2011 due to lack of continuous time series landcover data the landcover map closest to each of the selected periods was used the magnitude of landcover change within each hydro meteorological period was assumed to be negligible this approach has also been used by other scholars such as yu et al 2019 thus hydro meteorological conditions for the periods 1976 1979 1980 1985 1989 1994 1995 2000 2001 2005 2006 2011 were assigned to the landcover data for 1972 1984 1989 1996 2001 and 2011 respectively we argue that the years and periods left out due to data gaps in hydrological and weather data did not significantly impact the results because what was compared were the hydrological patterns with the corresponding climatic patterns in periods with high quality observed data simulating hydrological data using a hydrological model could overcome some of the challenges in the data gaps however hydrological modelling has its own calibration uncertainties in this highly managed heterogenous catchment landscape hence the preference was to use observed data to answer all our research questions regarding the individual role of observed seasonal climatic conditions and landscape pattern changes in explaining intra annual water availability in the plsr all the variables were standardised scaled and mean centred separate plsr models were developed for each of the hydrological variables that is wet season flows dry season flows date of one day maximum flow and date of one day minimum flow 3 4 3 variable selection variable selection was done through backward elimination frank 1987 pierna et al 2009 in the plsvarsel r package liland et al 2016 mehmood et al 2012 the initial step involved running the plsr with all the predictors in the model predictors with a vip 0 8 were iteratively removed from the model the procedure was repeated until a model with an optimal r2 and cross validated r2 was obtained outlined by mehmood et al 2012 shi et al 2013 and liland et al 2016 shi et al 2013 in both the initial and final plsr models only the components giving the lowest rmsev were retained 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydro meteorological patterns in the catchment from 1975 2011 fig 2 shows patterns in climatic and hydrological time series data annual average rainfall exhibited a non significant increasing trend p 0 218 over the study period in the catchment previous studies in zambia have found trends in rainfall amounts to be inconclusive with some stations showing non significant decreasing trends mubanga and umar 2014 chisola and kuraz 2016 additionally our findings reveal significant increasing trends p 0 05 in one day maximum rainfall coefficient of variation of daily rainfall maximum dry spell length dry period length temperature and reference evapotranspiration table 4 the start of the rains exhibited a significant decreasing trend p 0 00 implying earlier onset of rains although the early onset of rains observed in this study is contrary to the late onset that is generally reported in zambia gannon et al 2014 it is consistent with mulenga et al 2017 who found no evidence of later onset of rains for selected stations in zambia contrary to the perceptions of farmers despite an earlier onset of rainfall dry spells tend to be more than wet spells once the season has started a trend implying earlier ending of the rainy season end of rains was observed but it was not significant p 0 17 mulenga et al 2017 also found that the trends in end of rains were not significant in our case this decreasing trend was not significant due to greater year to year variability in cessation dates compared to the onset date the cessation date of rainfall in southern zambia is linked with the retreating of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz to the north hachigonta et al 2008 other studies have also observed a tendency towards earlier cessation of the rains even though the significance of the trends was not tested hachigonta et al 2008 gannon et al 2014 regarding hydrological metrics the results indicated significant decreasing trends in dry season flows p 0 05 and in the date in which the one day maximum flow occurs p 0 10 table 4 the decreasing trend in the timing of one day maximum flow suggests early occurrence of the maximum flow in the river on the other hand non significant decreasing trends in wet season flows and the date of one day minimum flow were observed earlier drying of the river table 4 in general the results point towards reduction in both wet and dry season river flows in chongwe catchment in zambia wet season flows were reported to have increased while dry season flows had declined chisola and kuraz 2016 tena et al 2019 in the following sections we examine the factors explaining the observed hydrological signatures using plsr 4 2 landscape pattern changes in the catchment 4 2 1 landcover composition dynamics percentage of landscape pland accuracy assessment conducted on the classified landcover maps showed very good classification assessment statistics the landcover map for 1972 obtained an overall accuracy of 83 and a kappa coefficient of 0 77 the 1984 landcover map obtained an overall accuracy of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 92 the overall accuracy for the 1989 landcover map was 95 and a kappa coefficient of 0 93 for the 1996 landcover map the overall accuracy was 96 and the kappa coefficient was 0 95 the 2001 landcover map obtained an overall accuracy of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 92 finally the landcover map for 2011 had a 96 overall accuracy and a 0 95 kappa coefficient fig 3 shows landcover composition from 1972 to 2011 in the kaleya river catchment there is a notable reduction in forest cover and an increase in both irrigated and rainfed agricultural land fig 3 it is noted that rainfed agriculture was already a major economic activity by 1972 accounting for 21 of the landscape table 5 and was the third most dominant landcover after forest 44 and scrubland 35 in 2011 rainfed agriculture increased up to 33 and irrigated agriculture was at 11 table 5 thus agriculture both rainfed and irrigated accounted for a total of 44 of the landscape in 2011 while scrubland dominated the landscape at about 48 4 2 1 1 trends in landcover conversions in the catchment it is noted from fig 3b that irrigated agriculture had a significant presence in the lower catchment by 1984 results further indicate that most of the rainfed agriculture land was lost to irrigated agriculture especially in the period between 1972 and 1984 tables 6 and 7 and fig 3 this drastic increase in irrigated land during this period is attributed to the expansion of the nakambala sugar estates in to the kaleya river catchment and the subsequent engagement of communities and commercial farmers through a small holder out grower scheme called kaleya small holders which became operational in the early 1980s akayombokwa et al 2017 this was a form of private public partnership discussed in the preceding sections aimed at increasing zambian sugar production for export to the european markets and increasing local agricultural productivity akayombokwa et al 2017 the results further indicate that since 1984 expansion in irrigated land has mainly occurred from the middle portion of the catchment fig 3c f table 7 shows that between 1972 and 2011 irrigated agriculture gained more land from rainfed agriculture by a magnitude of about 8 than from any other landcover class the tendency to switch from rainfed to irrigated agriculture indicates agricultural intensification in the landscape during the 1972 1984 period the percentage of reservoir area increased from 0 08 47 ha to 0 22 126 ha in the landscape this relative increase in reservoirs is much smaller compared to the dramatic increase in irrigated land from 40 ha to 4 433 ha in the same period table 5 this is because from inception in 1981 the kaleya small holder irrigation scheme in the lower catchment relies on water transferred from the larger kafue river using a 14 km canal connecting to a 10 km pipeline akayombokwa et al 2017 the period 1984 1989 recorded the highest gain in the percentage of reservoirs in the landscape table 6 this was to support irrigated agriculture that was now expanding from the middle catchment relying on water abstractions from within the kaleya river catchment the observed lag between reservoirs and irrigated cropland from 1972 to 1984 and a similar pattern in their evolution afterwards is also observable from water permit data from warma fig 4 the net decrease in the percentage of reservoir area in the catchment in the 1996 2011 period table 6 is attributed to sedimentation a problem that has attracted the attention of scholars since the late 1990s sichingabula 1997 walling et al 2001 sichingabula et al 2018 the increase in irrigated land and reservoirs could have been a response to the changing climatic patterns in table 7 it is further indicated that from 1972 to 2011 forestland has mainly been lost to scrubland and rainfed cropland cropland rainfed 4 2 2 landcover configuration dynamics 4 2 2 1 patch density pd of landcover classes although about 8 of the landscape was still covered by forest in the catchment in 2011 the pd of forest showed that the remaining forest was more fragmented than before fig 5 the pd is an indicator of connectivity of each landcover in the catchment with higher values indicative of a more fragmented or heterogeneous landcover class or landscape yu et al 2020 thus it is possible to have two different periods with the same percentage cover for a landcover class but the impacts on the flow regime could differ if one is more fragmented the results show that forest had become more fragmentated hence less hydrological connectivity in the forested land the higher pd of reservoirs rainfed and irrigated agriculture in recent years reflect the increase in the number of reservoirs and crop fields in the landscape the pd of scrubland does not show major changes during the study period the general increase in the number of patches for all landcover types relative to the base year 1972 is consistent with the findings of muleta and biru 2019 in the guder watershed in ethiopia since 1973 4 2 2 2 largest patch index lpi of landcover classes the largest patch index lpi is an indicator of dominance of a landcover class in the landscape thus a landcover class can have a smaller percentage in terms of composition in the landscape but have a large enough patch size to influence eco hydrological processes the results indicate that lpi for forest has been reducing while that of the non forest landcover classes has been increasing fig 6 the findings in fig 6 provide further evidence of a more fragmented and scattered forest landscape and the increasing dominance and connectivity of scrubland rainfed and irrigated cropland before 1984 there were smaller reservoirs and weirs in the landscape since then bigger reservoirs such as the kaleya dam have been constructed thus explaining the increasing lpi for reservoirs the lpi value for the built up area is increasing showing that the built up area is becoming more compact similar trends with respect to decreasing lpi of forests and increasing lpi of reservoirs and built up areas were observed by wang et al 2020 in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment in china hydrologically the changes in pd and lpi affect the travel times and the timing of extreme river flows such as the date of maximum and minimum flows in the catchment 4 3 attributing river flows to seasonal climatic conditions and landscape dynamics 4 3 1 wet season flows the plsr model for wet season flows had one component explaining 77 of the variance in the predictors the r2 for the model was 0 84 and the cross validated r2 was 0 64 the major factors explaining the decreasing wet season flows were landscape based mainly dominated by reservoir metrics table 8 these include the percentage of reservoirs pland reservoirs along with the largest patch areas of reservoirs lpi reservoirs and patch density of reservoirs pd reservoirs in the landscape these interacted with climate metrics involving reference evapotranspiration eto and variability of rainfall events cv rainfall to explain decreasing wet season flows higher density of reservoirs pd reservoirs increases catchment fragmentation chin et al 2008 and thus reduces landscape connectivity by impounding the river water downstream wet season flows are reduced while evaporation losses increase especially in the face of rising temperatures increased variability of rainfall events amplifies the effects of reservoirs in reducing downstream wet season flows thus although reservoirs are touted as an adaptation intervention to rainfall variability and or climate change there effectiveness remains uncertain research questions on this subject have revolved around what reservoir capacity numbers and density are optimal to build resilience chin et al 2008 ehsani et al 2017 this could also be a question for further research in kaleya catchment among the important variables explaining wet season flows only the size of forest patches lpi forest and the onset date of rains start of rains had positive regression coefficients thus indicating their positive contribution in explaining wet season flows generally larger forest patches reduce direct runoff and soil erosion but increase groundwater recharge and baseflow boongaling et al 2018 zong et al 2020 promoting larger forest patches in the kaleya catchment landscape could therefore improve infiltration and baseflow opportunities and reduce direct runoff and sedimentation this could in turn improve water availability as the upstream catchment is groundwater baseflow dominated over 50 of water is from the spring and subsurface flow in the rainy season groundwater baseflow contribution increases to 100 in the dry season based on our ongoing analysis using stable water isotopes in the upper part of the catchment 4 3 2 dry season flows the plsr model for dry season flows improved with two components which explained a cumulative total of 98 7 of the variance in the predictors the model had an r2 of 0 89 and a cross validation r2 of 0 58 again the landscape based metrics dominated the model table 8 for dry season flows the most important significant variables were irrigated cropland metrics involving the percentage of irrigated cropland pland crop irrigated and the large patch areas of the irrigated crop fields lpi crop irrigated these along with the extent of the largest scrubland patches lpi scrubland had negative regression coefficients explaining a decrease in dry season flows the dominance of scrubland reduces baseflow ground water contribution to dry season flows due to reduced infiltrated water on the other hand larger patches of irrigated cropland larger lpi crop irrigated and the increase in the percentage of irrigated cropland in general pland crop irrigated explained the decline in dry season flows due to water abstraction these findings are supported by water permit abstraction allocation data for the area which shows a very similar pattern fig 4 thus allocated water permit data show a strong correlation with pland crop irrigated r 0 93 p 0 00 and lpi crop irrigated r 0 89 p 0 00 which have been identified by the plsr as major stressors on dry season flows in the catchment 4 3 3 date of one day maximum flows the model for date of one day maximum flows had one component explaining 82 80 of the variance in the predictors the r2 was 0 83 while the cross validation r2 was 0 44 the results indicate that the tendency towards early date of one day maximum flow is explained mainly by climatic conditions involving higher rainfall intensities rainfall intensity and the earlier onset of rains start of rains table 9 the results further indicate that larger forest patches larger lpi forest are associated with the delay in the timing of one day maximum flow the results are expected as higher rainfall intensities promote quicker concentration of surface runoff on the landscape which could contribute to early occurrence of maximum river flows in contrast increasing the size of forest patches larger lpi forest in the landscape promotes infiltration and slows the movement of surface runoff hence the positive effect of larger forest patches lpi forest which explains delay in the date of one day maximum flows larger day of the year value for one day maximum flows is not surprising however the lpi of forest in the catchment has undergone a rapid decline over the years as observed in fig 6 and thus it effects in delaying peak flows is predominated by climatic factors hence high rainfall intensities and decreasing dominance of forest patches lpi forest are among the underlying factors explaining reduced infiltration opportunities in the catchment and thus a tendency towards an earlier date smaller day of the year value for one day maximum flows of maximum flow 4 3 4 date of one day minimum flows although the trend in the date of one day minimum flows was not statically significant it was important to look at the factors that could explain its variability the plsr results for the timing of extreme low flows are given in table 9 the model had one component explaining 77 of the variance in the predictors the r2 was 0 72 and the cross validated r2 was 0 40 seasonal climatic factors involving higher variability of rainfall events cv seasonal rainfall and landscape metrics involving the percentage of reservoirs pland reservoirs are associated with an early date of minimum flow again the size of forest patches had a positive effect on the date of minimum flow the results reaffirm that increasing the size of forest patches larger lpi forest could promote baseflow and thus delay the day of the year on which the minimum flow occurs delaying the date on which one day minimum river flow occurs in the season has positive water availability implications 4 4 the landscape hydrology approach and implications for sustainable water resource management using the landscape hydrology approach this study identified the climatic and landscape patterns important for informing water resource interventions in a heterogenous intensively managed semi arid catchment landscape the climatic stressors were mainly associated with seasonal rainfall characteristics involving the start of rains intensity and variability in the season and eto these together with landscape metrics particularly reservoir and irrigated agriculture based expansions explained much of the observed hydrological variability and declining seasonal water availability in the catchment seasonal rainfall characteristics were more important in explaining hydrological patterns than rainfall totals as the former influence landscape hydrological processes of surface runoff generation infiltration soil moisture and et dynamics given that most studies in southern african and african region general indicate non significant increasing or decreasing trends in annual rainfall totals kusangaya et al 2014 mubanga and umar 2014 taye et al 2015 this study argues that it is in fact the changing seasonal rainfall distribution that must be of concern for water resources management in the region an improved understanding of trends in seasonal rainfall characteristics such as its intensity variability and dry spell lengths could be even more important than annual rainfall trends for building resilience in semi arid areas our findings indicate that increasing the size of forest patches could offset the negative effect of increasing rainfall intensities and dry spell lengths by helping in flood mitigation through delaying the occurrence of peak river flows and supporting dry season river flows by delaying the date of one day minimum flow larger forest patches can promote infiltration and baseflow we thus recommend increasing the percentage of forest area by promoting larger forest patches widely spread across the catchment to benefit both wet and dry season river flows this could be achieved through farmer assisted natural regeneration of scrubland and abandoned rainfed agricultural land ndeso atanga 2018 akinnifesi 2018 as the majority of the catchment landscape is controlled by farmers and the corporate sector the miombo woodland which is dominant in the catchment has a good coppicing and natural regeneration potential luoga et al 2004 syampungani 2009 handavu et al 2011 zambia s forest act no 4 of 2015 forest act 2015 provides an opportunity for farmers and the corporate sector to own forests and thus diversify their income sources through private forests farmers can earn additional revenues from non timber forest products like mushrooms honey bee keeping and carbon trading while protecting and enhancing water availability for their agricultural produce mfune 2018 proposes the formation of forest cooperatives that can help to increase the volumes of forest produce from individual farmers forest patches and enhance the negotiation power so that farmers can get the most out of their forest practices this diversification could also buffer the farmers against climatic shocks that may affect their agricultural production irrigated agriculture was an important variable explaining reduced water availability especially during the dry season this is due to increased abstractions and increasing eto mainly due to increasing temperature as shown in the results in this regard irrigated agriculture in the catchment should move towards more efficient systems and management practices as well as high value crops farmed on less land 5 conclusions a landscape hydrology approach was successfully applied without hydrological modelling in a highly managed heterogeneous catchment landscape the approach was able to detect stressors from among the landscape components and inform water resource management interventions at a landscape scale significant increasing trends in seasonal climatic characteristics of eto one day maximum rainfall cv of daily rainfall and maximum dry spell length have occurred in the kaleya river catchment over 1975 2011 but not in total annual rainfall in contrast both the onset and cessation of rains show a trend towards earlier onset and cessation even though the latter was not significant both dry and wet season flows show declining trends but only the former is significant based on landscape composition metrics the study concludes that there has been a dramatic decline in forested land expansion of irrigated cropland mainly from land previously used for rainfed agriculture and increase in reservoirs and the catchment landscape is more fragmented in recent years the major climatic stressors are all associated with increasing eto and seasonal rainfall characteristics namely increasing variability of rainfall dry spell length and rainfall intensities in this regard water resource interventions in the region must adapt more to the changing seasonal climatic characteristics than annual totals on the landscape side the major stressors on water availability are the increasing percentage of reservoirs and irrigated cropland increase in the sizes of reservoirs and irrigated crop fields and increased density of reservoirs it is recommended that more efficient agricultural water use and farmer assisted natural regeneration of forest patches towards larger forest patch sizes is needed to enhance landscape hydrological processes that improve seasonal water availability the approach in this study can be applied to other catchments where no major gaps exist in the timeseries data on climate and hydrology and where temporal landcover data is available it could help to support informed decision making when managing water resources under a changing environment

8307,study region kaleya river catchment in southern zambia study focus the ability of a landscape hydrology approach to detect controls on water availability in a fragmented landscape to inform interventions under a changing environment was investigated simple and measurable climatic and landscape pattern attributes were analysed using change detection trend analysis and backward variable elimination with partial least squares regression plsr to identify controls on seasonal river flows and how landscape components could be enhanced to augment natural river flows new hydrological insights for the region landscape pattern showed increasing fragmentation expansion of irrigated cropland and reservoirs and loss of forestland significant increasing trends p 0 05 were observed for reference evapotranspiration eto one day maximum rainfall coefficient of variation cv of rainfall maximum dry spell length and start of rains but not annual rainfall increased cv of rainfall rainfall intensity and eto were the main climatic stressors on river flows increased percentage of landscape pland of irrigated cropland pland of reservoirs patch density pd and largest patch index lpi of reservoirs were the main landscape pattern stressors only the lpi of forestland positively explained seasonal river flows water resource interventions in the region must adapt more to changing seasonal rainfall characteristics than to annual rainfall totals additionally regeneration of larger forest patches could improve river flows the approach can be applied in other regions keywords landscape metrics rainfall characteristics landscape fragmentation seasonal flows variable importance in projection 1 introduction the landscape is a mosaic of many land use types land cover composition with different geometric and spatial arrangements land cover configuration hence the observed hydrological signatures are a result of the linear and non linear interaction of landscape patterns landcover composition and configuration with climatic variables ekness and randhir 2015 hughes et al 2014 although it can be argued that the inter relationships between landscape elements such as forest and hydrology are well known such interactions can be more complex in the rapidly fragmenting landscapes of tropical and subtropical africa guzha et al 2018 malmer et al 2010 despite a plethora of studies investigating land use impacts on hydrological dynamics most studies focus on landscape composition proportion of a landcover class in the landscape using landscape ecology it has been shown that processes such as runoff generation infiltration evapotranspiration et hydrological connectivity sediment transport and water quality are also related to landscape configuration at a watershed scale shi et al 2013 boongaling et al 2018 ding et al 2016 in this regard landscape metrics indices of landscape pattern developed in the field of landscape ecology are increasingly drawing scholarly attention to understand hydrological fluxes in a changing environment ekness 2013 epting 2016 albalawneh et al 2015 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 ding et al 2016 combining hydrological modelling with multivariate statistical methods is becoming widely used in attributing land use controls on hydrological change for example recently partial least square regression plsr was applied to attribute hydrological change to specific changes in land use landcover composition using river flows and sediment data simulated by hydrological models according to various land use scenarios shi et al 2013 woldesenbet et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2019 but the underlying drivers of hydrological variability from among climate landscape composition and configuration controls are rarely investigated simultaneously additionally the studies have mainly used simulated river flows however in fragmented heterogenous and intensively managed meso scale catchments such as the kaleya in southern zambia where dam management operations data does not exist the actual hydrological signatures and processes are difficult to reproduce due to modelling and calibration uncertainties abbaspour et al 2018 hughes et al 2014 hughes 2006 moreover seasonal climatic characteristics in semi arid areas like zambia could be more important in explaining seasonal water availability than annual totals and or land use composition thus managing water resources under a changing environment requires information on specific climatic changes the water resources must adapt to this study addresses these gaps through the lenses of landscape hydrology the field of landscape hydrology provides an opportunity to integrate landscape ecology and catchment hydrology schröder 2006 ferguson 1991 landscape hydrology deals with landscape components such as climate land use composition and configuration including soils geology and topography and how their interactions affect water movement and storage in the catchment landscape ferguson 1991 one of the most distinguishing features of the landscape hydrology approach is that it considers the interactions among the landscape components and how they can be modified by human impact to better manage the water resources and the environment in general ferguson 1991 thus it can provide a framework for informing water resource management decisions in heterogeneous and increasingly fragmented catchment landscapes under a changing climate the kaleya river catchment in southern zambia has undergone extensive landscape transformations since the early 1980s the catchment hosts zambia s oldest private public sugar irrigation scheme akayombokwa et al 2017 seasonal river flows have reduced drastically in the catchment leading to conflicts among water users studies have attributed deterioration of water resources in zambia to changes in landcover composition sakeyo 2008 chisola and kuraz 2016 chomba 2017 tena et al 2019 muchanga et al 2019 climate change and variability are thought to be causing further stress on water resources grz 2008 nkhuwa et al 2013 ngoma et al 2017 although this has mostly not been backed up by scientific evidence as few hydrological studies have been completed nkhuwa et al 2013 in this regard we developed and tested a landscape hydrology approach to tease out how the interactions among seasonal climatic landcover composition and configuration patterns explain the observed hydrological shifts in the kaleya river catchment in particular the study addressed the following research questions 1 how have seasonal climatic characteristics and landscape patterns changed in the catchment since 1972 2 what climatic land use composition and configuration characteristics are important in explaining changes in seasonal river flows in the catchment 3 how should landscape components be enhanced in order to augment seasonal river flows 4 can a landscape hydrology approach implemented without hydrological simulation detect the main interactions among landscape components to inform landscape level water resource management interventions in a heterogeneous and fragmented catchment landscape such information can inform improved decision making and sustainable water resource development under a changing environment 2 description of the study area the kaleya river catchment has an area of about 744 km2 and lies between latitude 15 40 s to 16 20 s and longitude 27 30 e to 28 10 e fig 1 the river water originates from the slow flowing springs upstream near the siamakambo hills in chikankata district of the southern province and flows in the northwest direction into the mazabuka district where it drains into the kafue river the major tributaries of the kaleya river include the chinyanja nanswa mbolela and dimba rivers the flow in the middle section of the catchment is highly regulated by weirs and small dams dam height less than 15 m of these small dams the largest has a capacity of about 6 5 mm3 the catchment is dominated by savannah woodland with a mixture of acacia trees mainly faidherbia albida formerly acacia albida belonging to the munga woodlands and the brachystegia genus of the miombo woodland sichingabula et al 2000 agriculture is the major economic activity in the catchment riparian dependent subsistence farmers are present in the upper catchment many of who were resettled into the area by government before the 1970s these farmers mainly grow maize zea mays l in the rainy season and potatoes solanum tuberosum l among other vegetables in the dry season commercial farmers occupy about 75 of the catchment area and are mostly located in the middle part they mainly grow wheat triticum aestivum l soybeans glycine max l sugarcane saccharum officinarum l lucerne medicago sativa l pasture and seed maize using centre pivots and drip irrigation additionally they keep livestock mainly for the beef industry the lower part of the catchment is home to the sugar estates of the kaleya small holders company as well as nakambala sugar estates belonging to zambia sugar company irrigation water for the two sugar estates is transferred from the kafue river by the zambia sugar company who also supply water to the kaleya small holders company 3 materials and methods 3 1 the landscape hydrology approach we used climatic indices and landscape pattern metrics derived from long term weather data and satellite images respectively to infer controls on seasonal river flows without need for hydrological modelling the approach was applied using post classification landscape change detection trend analysis of hydro meteorological time series and variable elimination in partial least square regression plsr the details of how the approach was implemented are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 2 data acquisition and pre processing cloud free landsat images of the kaleya river catchment were downloaded from the website of the united states geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov for years 1972 1984 1989 1996 2001 and 2011 the images were pre processed by applying geometric and radiometric corrections that included noise and haze reduction pre processing also involved resampling the 60 m resolution landsat mss image for 1972 to a 30 m resolution using the nearest neighbour resampling method all the image pre processing steps were conducted in erdas imagine 2014 historical daily river discharge data from the start of records at the most downstream gauge to 2019 1975 2019 were provided by the water resources management authority warma in zambia however the dataset has gaps between 2011 and 2018 so we restricted our analysis to the 1975 2011 period weather data were obtained from the zambia meteorological department zmd 3 3 data analysis 3 3 1 hydrological and climate based metrics the discharge data was analysed using the indicators of hydrological alteration iha software the nature conservancy 2009 to derive hydrological metrics that define seasonal water availability average monthly flows and the timing of one day maximum and minimum flows in the catchment for the period 1975 2011 the climate based metrics involved seasonal characteristics derived from daily rainfall data analysed in r instant parsons et al 2017 the derived metrics included one day maximum rainfall simple rainfall intensity the ratio of total seasonal rainfall to the number of wet days in the season onset and cessation dates of rainfall and the maximum dry spell length maximum dry period length in a year and annual rainfall totals when deriving the climatic metrics a rainy day was defined as having more than 0 85 mm of rainfall stern et al 2006 the start onset of rainfall was a day after 1 october in each year that gives a total rainfall amount of 20 mm or more over a consecutive period of two days in addition to the absence of a dry spell of 10 days or more in the next 30 days based on stern et al 2006 a dry spell was taken as a period with less than 5 mm of rainfall in five days adopted from hachigonta et al 2008 the date of cessation of rainfall end of rains was taken as the last day after 25 february that accumulates a rainfall amount of 10 mm or more adapted from hachigonta et al 2008 and mupangwa et al 2011 we also derived reference evapotranspiration eto based on the hargreaves method hargreaves 1994 in r environment through the spei package beguería et al 2014 the coefficient of variation cv was computed as the standard deviation of rainfall divided by the average rainfall 3 3 2 digital image processing to derive landscape composition and configuration metrics the landsat images were classified using a hybrid of supervised image classification and onscreen digitising in erdas imagine software to produce landcover maps for the years 1972 1984 1989 1996 2001 and 2011 the hybrid method involved first classifying the images with maximum likelihood classifier using supervised image classification this was followed by onscreen digitising to correct any misclassified pixels the hybrid method has been recommended by other scholars as it reduces misclassifications in heterogeneous landscapes such as kaleya herold et al 2008 betru et al 2019 the generated landcover maps were then subjected to accuracy assessment topographic maps along with google earth imagery and field visits in august 2019 were used as sources of ground truth data for accuracy assessment the landcover maps are based on six classes namely forest scrubland cropland rainfed cropland irrigated reservoirs and built up area a description of these landcover classes is given in table 1 3 3 3 generating landscape composition and configuration metrics from landcover maps landcover maps for the respective years were analysed using fragstat 4 software mcgarigal and marks 1995 to derive landscape composition and configuration metrics we evaluated three class level landscape pattern metrics table 2 based on their use in literature and simplicity in interpretation and application zhou et al 2017 the largest patch index lpi indicates patch dominance mcgarigal et al 2012 the patch density pd indicates landscape fragmentation fragmentation and dominance based metrics are important indicators of hydrological connectivity and ecosystem functioning albalawneh et al 2015 schröder 2006 hence their changes can lead to significant changes in water and nutrient cycling hobbs 1993 a detailed description of the landscape metrics is given by mcgarigal and marks 1995 and mcgarigal et al 2012 a summary of all the derived hydrological climatic and landscape indicators is given in table 3 3 3 4 analysis of trends in hydrometeorological timeseries 3 3 4 1 mann kendall trend test we conducted the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 on seasonal climatic and hydrological variables in table 3 to examine the significance of the trends in the study period to account for serial correlation we used the modified mann kendall test through the yue and wang 2004 variance correction technique in the modifiedmk r package patakamuri et al 2017 the mann kendall test is given by the equation 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the number of observations x j and x i are the jth and ith observations respectively and j i sgn is the sign function between consecutive x values and is defined as 2 sgn x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i the variance is defined by 3 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 j 1 n t i i i 1 2 i 5 18 the modified variance var s is 4 v a r s v

trend can be accepted if 1 96 z c 1 96 for a two sided test 3 3 4 2 theil sen s slope estimator the trend magnitude was evaluated using the sen s slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 which is given as

and configuration metrics to attribute influence on hydrological components have mainly combined hydrological modelling with multiple linear regression ekness 2013 epting 2016 pearson correlation chiang et al 2019 stepwise regression amiri et al 2019 yu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 or plsr boongaling et al 2018 shi et al 2013 gebremicael et al 2019 woldesenbet et al 2017 among other methods however previous studies did not incorporate seasonal climatic and landscape composition and configuration metrics simultaneously which could be important in informing water resources management in heterogenous landscapes under a changing environment the independent and dependent variables for our plsr models are given in table 3 3 4 1 justification for partial least squares regression plsr the plsr was selected for several reasons firstly we had many independent variables landscape and climate metrics table 3 and most of them are highly correlated the plsr is useful when the independent variables are highly correlated and where there are more independent variables than observations boongaling et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2017 carrascal et al 2009 secondly given the high number of independent variables in our case variable selection was important to identify only those that are significantly important in explaining seasonal river flows plsr is thus also a powerful tool for variable selection several methods for variable selection in plsr are available and are discussed in detail by mehmood et al 2012 generally variable selection in plsr is based on the variable importance in projection vip the loading weights and regression coefficients but the vips are the most used mehmood et al 2012 variables with vip 0 8 are deemed to be significant variables with a vip 0 8 have no significant influence in the model the higher the vip the more significant the variable is in explaining the dependent variable the plsr also gives regression coefficients whose sign indicates a positive or negative influence on the dependent variable thus despite a variable having a small regression coefficient it can be retained in the model if it has a large vip vip 0 8 loading weights greater than a magnitude of 0 3 irrespective of the sign are taken to be significant and a variable can be deemed important on this basis the sign of the loading weight indicates the direction of influence the higher the loading weight the larger the influence that a variable has on the respective component to obtain the optimum number of components and a balance between the explanatory and the predictive power of the model cross validation is often used in this regard the root mean square error of validation rmsev is used the number of components giving the smallest value of rmsev are selected as optimal for the model the quality of the plsr model is assessed using the goodness of fit r2 which indicates the explanatory ability of the model and the cross validated r2 which shows the extent to which the model can predict a good plsr model is one with r2 0 5 and a cross validated r2 0 097 trap et al 2013 3 4 2 implementation of the partial least squares regression plsr we implemented the plsr in the pls package mevik and wehrens 2007 in r software we developed four separate plsr models for each of the hydrological variables wet season flows dry season flows date of one day maximum flow and date of one day minimum flow the independent variables predictors were all the climate and landcover composition and configuration metrics as outlined in table 3 the climatic and hydrological variables were averaged within small hydro meteorological periods avoiding inclusion of periods and years with data gaps in order to get the most out of the observed data the hydro meteorological periods used were 1975 1979 1980 1985 1989 1994 1995 2000 2001 2005 and 2006 2011 due to lack of continuous time series landcover data the landcover map closest to each of the selected periods was used the magnitude of landcover change within each hydro meteorological period was assumed to be negligible this approach has also been used by other scholars such as yu et al 2019 thus hydro meteorological conditions for the periods 1976 1979 1980 1985 1989 1994 1995 2000 2001 2005 2006 2011 were assigned to the landcover data for 1972 1984 1989 1996 2001 and 2011 respectively we argue that the years and periods left out due to data gaps in hydrological and weather data did not significantly impact the results because what was compared were the hydrological patterns with the corresponding climatic patterns in periods with high quality observed data simulating hydrological data using a hydrological model could overcome some of the challenges in the data gaps however hydrological modelling has its own calibration uncertainties in this highly managed heterogenous catchment landscape hence the preference was to use observed data to answer all our research questions regarding the individual role of observed seasonal climatic conditions and landscape pattern changes in explaining intra annual water availability in the plsr all the variables were standardised scaled and mean centred separate plsr models were developed for each of the hydrological variables that is wet season flows dry season flows date of one day maximum flow and date of one day minimum flow 3 4 3 variable selection variable selection was done through backward elimination frank 1987 pierna et al 2009 in the plsvarsel r package liland et al 2016 mehmood et al 2012 the initial step involved running the plsr with all the predictors in the model predictors with a vip 0 8 were iteratively removed from the model the procedure was repeated until a model with an optimal r2 and cross validated r2 was obtained outlined by mehmood et al 2012 shi et al 2013 and liland et al 2016 shi et al 2013 in both the initial and final plsr models only the components giving the lowest rmsev were retained 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydro meteorological patterns in the catchment from 1975 2011 fig 2 shows patterns in climatic and hydrological time series data annual average rainfall exhibited a non significant increasing trend p 0 218 over the study period in the catchment previous studies in zambia have found trends in rainfall amounts to be inconclusive with some stations showing non significant decreasing trends mubanga and umar 2014 chisola and kuraz 2016 additionally our findings reveal significant increasing trends p 0 05 in one day maximum rainfall coefficient of variation of daily rainfall maximum dry spell length dry period length temperature and reference evapotranspiration table 4 the start of the rains exhibited a significant decreasing trend p 0 00 implying earlier onset of rains although the early onset of rains observed in this study is contrary to the late onset that is generally reported in zambia gannon et al 2014 it is consistent with mulenga et al 2017 who found no evidence of later onset of rains for selected stations in zambia contrary to the perceptions of farmers despite an earlier onset of rainfall dry spells tend to be more than wet spells once the season has started a trend implying earlier ending of the rainy season end of rains was observed but it was not significant p 0 17 mulenga et al 2017 also found that the trends in end of rains were not significant in our case this decreasing trend was not significant due to greater year to year variability in cessation dates compared to the onset date the cessation date of rainfall in southern zambia is linked with the retreating of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz to the north hachigonta et al 2008 other studies have also observed a tendency towards earlier cessation of the rains even though the significance of the trends was not tested hachigonta et al 2008 gannon et al 2014 regarding hydrological metrics the results indicated significant decreasing trends in dry season flows p 0 05 and in the date in which the one day maximum flow occurs p 0 10 table 4 the decreasing trend in the timing of one day maximum flow suggests early occurrence of the maximum flow in the river on the other hand non significant decreasing trends in wet season flows and the date of one day minimum flow were observed earlier drying of the river table 4 in general the results point towards reduction in both wet and dry season river flows in chongwe catchment in zambia wet season flows were reported to have increased while dry season flows had declined chisola and kuraz 2016 tena et al 2019 in the following sections we examine the factors explaining the observed hydrological signatures using plsr 4 2 landscape pattern changes in the catchment 4 2 1 landcover composition dynamics percentage of landscape pland accuracy assessment conducted on the classified landcover maps showed very good classification assessment statistics the landcover map for 1972 obtained an overall accuracy of 83 and a kappa coefficient of 0 77 the 1984 landcover map obtained an overall accuracy of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 92 the overall accuracy for the 1989 landcover map was 95 and a kappa coefficient of 0 93 for the 1996 landcover map the overall accuracy was 96 and the kappa coefficient was 0 95 the 2001 landcover map obtained an overall accuracy of 94 and a kappa coefficient of 0 92 finally the landcover map for 2011 had a 96 overall accuracy and a 0 95 kappa coefficient fig 3 shows landcover composition from 1972 to 2011 in the kaleya river catchment there is a notable reduction in forest cover and an increase in both irrigated and rainfed agricultural land fig 3 it is noted that rainfed agriculture was already a major economic activity by 1972 accounting for 21 of the landscape table 5 and was the third most dominant landcover after forest 44 and scrubland 35 in 2011 rainfed agriculture increased up to 33 and irrigated agriculture was at 11 table 5 thus agriculture both rainfed and irrigated accounted for a total of 44 of the landscape in 2011 while scrubland dominated the landscape at about 48 4 2 1 1 trends in landcover conversions in the catchment it is noted from fig 3b that irrigated agriculture had a significant presence in the lower catchment by 1984 results further indicate that most of the rainfed agriculture land was lost to irrigated agriculture especially in the period between 1972 and 1984 tables 6 and 7 and fig 3 this drastic increase in irrigated land during this period is attributed to the expansion of the nakambala sugar estates in to the kaleya river catchment and the subsequent engagement of communities and commercial farmers through a small holder out grower scheme called kaleya small holders which became operational in the early 1980s akayombokwa et al 2017 this was a form of private public partnership discussed in the preceding sections aimed at increasing zambian sugar production for export to the european markets and increasing local agricultural productivity akayombokwa et al 2017 the results further indicate that since 1984 expansion in irrigated land has mainly occurred from the middle portion of the catchment fig 3c f table 7 shows that between 1972 and 2011 irrigated agriculture gained more land from rainfed agriculture by a magnitude of about 8 than from any other landcover class the tendency to switch from rainfed to irrigated agriculture indicates agricultural intensification in the landscape during the 1972 1984 period the percentage of reservoir area increased from 0 08 47 ha to 0 22 126 ha in the landscape this relative increase in reservoirs is much smaller compared to the dramatic increase in irrigated land from 40 ha to 4 433 ha in the same period table 5 this is because from inception in 1981 the kaleya small holder irrigation scheme in the lower catchment relies on water transferred from the larger kafue river using a 14 km canal connecting to a 10 km pipeline akayombokwa et al 2017 the period 1984 1989 recorded the highest gain in the percentage of reservoirs in the landscape table 6 this was to support irrigated agriculture that was now expanding from the middle catchment relying on water abstractions from within the kaleya river catchment the observed lag between reservoirs and irrigated cropland from 1972 to 1984 and a similar pattern in their evolution afterwards is also observable from water permit data from warma fig 4 the net decrease in the percentage of reservoir area in the catchment in the 1996 2011 period table 6 is attributed to sedimentation a problem that has attracted the attention of scholars since the late 1990s sichingabula 1997 walling et al 2001 sichingabula et al 2018 the increase in irrigated land and reservoirs could have been a response to the changing climatic patterns in table 7 it is further indicated that from 1972 to 2011 forestland has mainly been lost to scrubland and rainfed cropland cropland rainfed 4 2 2 landcover configuration dynamics 4 2 2 1 patch density pd of landcover classes although about 8 of the landscape was still covered by forest in the catchment in 2011 the pd of forest showed that the remaining forest was more fragmented than before fig 5 the pd is an indicator of connectivity of each landcover in the catchment with higher values indicative of a more fragmented or heterogeneous landcover class or landscape yu et al 2020 thus it is possible to have two different periods with the same percentage cover for a landcover class but the impacts on the flow regime could differ if one is more fragmented the results show that forest had become more fragmentated hence less hydrological connectivity in the forested land the higher pd of reservoirs rainfed and irrigated agriculture in recent years reflect the increase in the number of reservoirs and crop fields in the landscape the pd of scrubland does not show major changes during the study period the general increase in the number of patches for all landcover types relative to the base year 1972 is consistent with the findings of muleta and biru 2019 in the guder watershed in ethiopia since 1973 4 2 2 2 largest patch index lpi of landcover classes the largest patch index lpi is an indicator of dominance of a landcover class in the landscape thus a landcover class can have a smaller percentage in terms of composition in the landscape but have a large enough patch size to influence eco hydrological processes the results indicate that lpi for forest has been reducing while that of the non forest landcover classes has been increasing fig 6 the findings in fig 6 provide further evidence of a more fragmented and scattered forest landscape and the increasing dominance and connectivity of scrubland rainfed and irrigated cropland before 1984 there were smaller reservoirs and weirs in the landscape since then bigger reservoirs such as the kaleya dam have been constructed thus explaining the increasing lpi for reservoirs the lpi value for the built up area is increasing showing that the built up area is becoming more compact similar trends with respect to decreasing lpi of forests and increasing lpi of reservoirs and built up areas were observed by wang et al 2020 in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment in china hydrologically the changes in pd and lpi affect the travel times and the timing of extreme river flows such as the date of maximum and minimum flows in the catchment 4 3 attributing river flows to seasonal climatic conditions and landscape dynamics 4 3 1 wet season flows the plsr model for wet season flows had one component explaining 77 of the variance in the predictors the r2 for the model was 0 84 and the cross validated r2 was 0 64 the major factors explaining the decreasing wet season flows were landscape based mainly dominated by reservoir metrics table 8 these include the percentage of reservoirs pland reservoirs along with the largest patch areas of reservoirs lpi reservoirs and patch density of reservoirs pd reservoirs in the landscape these interacted with climate metrics involving reference evapotranspiration eto and variability of rainfall events cv rainfall to explain decreasing wet season flows higher density of reservoirs pd reservoirs increases catchment fragmentation chin et al 2008 and thus reduces landscape connectivity by impounding the river water downstream wet season flows are reduced while evaporation losses increase especially in the face of rising temperatures increased variability of rainfall events amplifies the effects of reservoirs in reducing downstream wet season flows thus although reservoirs are touted as an adaptation intervention to rainfall variability and or climate change there effectiveness remains uncertain research questions on this subject have revolved around what reservoir capacity numbers and density are optimal to build resilience chin et al 2008 ehsani et al 2017 this could also be a question for further research in kaleya catchment among the important variables explaining wet season flows only the size of forest patches lpi forest and the onset date of rains start of rains had positive regression coefficients thus indicating their positive contribution in explaining wet season flows generally larger forest patches reduce direct runoff and soil erosion but increase groundwater recharge and baseflow boongaling et al 2018 zong et al 2020 promoting larger forest patches in the kaleya catchment landscape could therefore improve infiltration and baseflow opportunities and reduce direct runoff and sedimentation this could in turn improve water availability as the upstream catchment is groundwater baseflow dominated over 50 of water is from the spring and subsurface flow in the rainy season groundwater baseflow contribution increases to 100 in the dry season based on our ongoing analysis using stable water isotopes in the upper part of the catchment 4 3 2 dry season flows the plsr model for dry season flows improved with two components which explained a cumulative total of 98 7 of the variance in the predictors the model had an r2 of 0 89 and a cross validation r2 of 0 58 again the landscape based metrics dominated the model table 8 for dry season flows the most important significant variables were irrigated cropland metrics involving the percentage of irrigated cropland pland crop irrigated and the large patch areas of the irrigated crop fields lpi crop irrigated these along with the extent of the largest scrubland patches lpi scrubland had negative regression coefficients explaining a decrease in dry season flows the dominance of scrubland reduces baseflow ground water contribution to dry season flows due to reduced infiltrated water on the other hand larger patches of irrigated cropland larger lpi crop irrigated and the increase in the percentage of irrigated cropland in general pland crop irrigated explained the decline in dry season flows due to water abstraction these findings are supported by water permit abstraction allocation data for the area which shows a very similar pattern fig 4 thus allocated water permit data show a strong correlation with pland crop irrigated r 0 93 p 0 00 and lpi crop irrigated r 0 89 p 0 00 which have been identified by the plsr as major stressors on dry season flows in the catchment 4 3 3 date of one day maximum flows the model for date of one day maximum flows had one component explaining 82 80 of the variance in the predictors the r2 was 0 83 while the cross validation r2 was 0 44 the results indicate that the tendency towards early date of one day maximum flow is explained mainly by climatic conditions involving higher rainfall intensities rainfall intensity and the earlier onset of rains start of rains table 9 the results further indicate that larger forest patches larger lpi forest are associated with the delay in the timing of one day maximum flow the results are expected as higher rainfall intensities promote quicker concentration of surface runoff on the landscape which could contribute to early occurrence of maximum river flows in contrast increasing the size of forest patches larger lpi forest in the landscape promotes infiltration and slows the movement of surface runoff hence the positive effect of larger forest patches lpi forest which explains delay in the date of one day maximum flows larger day of the year value for one day maximum flows is not surprising however the lpi of forest in the catchment has undergone a rapid decline over the years as observed in fig 6 and thus it effects in delaying peak flows is predominated by climatic factors hence high rainfall intensities and decreasing dominance of forest patches lpi forest are among the underlying factors explaining reduced infiltration opportunities in the catchment and thus a tendency towards an earlier date smaller day of the year value for one day maximum flows of maximum flow 4 3 4 date of one day minimum flows although the trend in the date of one day minimum flows was not statically significant it was important to look at the factors that could explain its variability the plsr results for the timing of extreme low flows are given in table 9 the model had one component explaining 77 of the variance in the predictors the r2 was 0 72 and the cross validated r2 was 0 40 seasonal climatic factors involving higher variability of rainfall events cv seasonal rainfall and landscape metrics involving the percentage of reservoirs pland reservoirs are associated with an early date of minimum flow again the size of forest patches had a positive effect on the date of minimum flow the results reaffirm that increasing the size of forest patches larger lpi forest could promote baseflow and thus delay the day of the year on which the minimum flow occurs delaying the date on which one day minimum river flow occurs in the season has positive water availability implications 4 4 the landscape hydrology approach and implications for sustainable water resource management using the landscape hydrology approach this study identified the climatic and landscape patterns important for informing water resource interventions in a heterogenous intensively managed semi arid catchment landscape the climatic stressors were mainly associated with seasonal rainfall characteristics involving the start of rains intensity and variability in the season and eto these together with landscape metrics particularly reservoir and irrigated agriculture based expansions explained much of the observed hydrological variability and declining seasonal water availability in the catchment seasonal rainfall characteristics were more important in explaining hydrological patterns than rainfall totals as the former influence landscape hydrological processes of surface runoff generation infiltration soil moisture and et dynamics given that most studies in southern african and african region general indicate non significant increasing or decreasing trends in annual rainfall totals kusangaya et al 2014 mubanga and umar 2014 taye et al 2015 this study argues that it is in fact the changing seasonal rainfall distribution that must be of concern for water resources management in the region an improved understanding of trends in seasonal rainfall characteristics such as its intensity variability and dry spell lengths could be even more important than annual rainfall trends for building resilience in semi arid areas our findings indicate that increasing the size of forest patches could offset the negative effect of increasing rainfall intensities and dry spell lengths by helping in flood mitigation through delaying the occurrence of peak river flows and supporting dry season river flows by delaying the date of one day minimum flow larger forest patches can promote infiltration and baseflow we thus recommend increasing the percentage of forest area by promoting larger forest patches widely spread across the catchment to benefit both wet and dry season river flows this could be achieved through farmer assisted natural regeneration of scrubland and abandoned rainfed agricultural land ndeso atanga 2018 akinnifesi 2018 as the majority of the catchment landscape is controlled by farmers and the corporate sector the miombo woodland which is dominant in the catchment has a good coppicing and natural regeneration potential luoga et al 2004 syampungani 2009 handavu et al 2011 zambia s forest act no 4 of 2015 forest act 2015 provides an opportunity for farmers and the corporate sector to own forests and thus diversify their income sources through private forests farmers can earn additional revenues from non timber forest products like mushrooms honey bee keeping and carbon trading while protecting and enhancing water availability for their agricultural produce mfune 2018 proposes the formation of forest cooperatives that can help to increase the volumes of forest produce from individual farmers forest patches and enhance the negotiation power so that farmers can get the most out of their forest practices this diversification could also buffer the farmers against climatic shocks that may affect their agricultural production irrigated agriculture was an important variable explaining reduced water availability especially during the dry season this is due to increased abstractions and increasing eto mainly due to increasing temperature as shown in the results in this regard irrigated agriculture in the catchment should move towards more efficient systems and management practices as well as high value crops farmed on less land 5 conclusions a landscape hydrology approach was successfully applied without hydrological modelling in a highly managed heterogeneous catchment landscape the approach was able to detect stressors from among the landscape components and inform water resource management interventions at a landscape scale significant increasing trends in seasonal climatic characteristics of eto one day maximum rainfall cv of daily rainfall and maximum dry spell length have occurred in the kaleya river catchment over 1975 2011 but not in total annual rainfall in contrast both the onset and cessation of rains show a trend towards earlier onset and cessation even though the latter was not significant both dry and wet season flows show declining trends but only the former is significant based on landscape composition metrics the study concludes that there has been a dramatic decline in forested land expansion of irrigated cropland mainly from land previously used for rainfed agriculture and increase in reservoirs and the catchment landscape is more fragmented in recent years the major climatic stressors are all associated with increasing eto and seasonal rainfall characteristics namely increasing variability of rainfall dry spell length and rainfall intensities in this regard water resource interventions in the region must adapt more to the changing seasonal climatic characteristics than annual totals on the landscape side the major stressors on water availability are the increasing percentage of reservoirs and irrigated cropland increase in the sizes of reservoirs and irrigated crop fields and increased density of reservoirs it is recommended that more efficient agricultural water use and farmer assisted natural regeneration of forest patches towards larger forest patch sizes is needed to enhance landscape hydrological processes that improve seasonal water availability the approach in this study can be applied to other catchments where no major gaps exist in the timeseries data on climate and hydrology and where temporal landcover data is available it could help to support informed decision making when managing water resources under a changing environment

8308,study region data from 28 streamflow gauging stations located in the campania region southern italy were analysed study focus the study was aimed at recommend regional methodologies for environmental flow ef and ef variability estimation for a climatological environment particularly affected by strong climate variability starting from an at site statistical analysis of discharge data a preliminary step where the quantification of ef average value μ q95 and inter annual variability cv q95 was illustrated a regional regression approach was then presented for the prediction of μ q95 and cv q95 new hydrological insights for the region a step wise procedure highlighted the dominant hydrological variables and catchment attributes for ef prediction catchment area and mean annual daily discharge μ q appeared strongly related to μ q95 whereas cv q95 was found to be dependent on the baseflow index and on precipitation variability regional predictions were evaluated on the base of the correlation coefficient and absolute average percentage errors prediction errors amounted to about 30 and 17 respectively in the case of μ q95 and cv q95 in the end an implication for a fully regional approach simply based on catchment attributes also embedding the impact of hydrological variables was presented it showed clearly different performance capacity compared to the prediction based on the observed hydrological variables but not significantly lower keywords environmental flows flow duration curve q95 regional analysis mediterranean area 1 introduction water scientists and stakeholders are nowadays involved in the major challenge of providing the worldwide growing population with reliable water supplies protecting at the same time the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems on this purpose environmental flow ef appears as a critical parameter to be assessed in order to sustain or restore ecosystems and to maintain ecosystem services according to tharme 2003 ef estimating methodologies can be classified into four different groups it is possible to distinguish between i hydrological methods based on the analysis of historical flow regime ii hydraulic methods based on the analysis of stream channel geometry iii habitat simulation methods based on the simulation of physical habitat iv and holistic methodologies where multidisciplinary expertise is needed to achieve particular ecological geomorphological water quality social objectives in the modified system the choice for one of the methodologies depends on available data but also on institutional aspects and regulations and thus may vary from country to country almost all of these methodologies were criticised because of subjectivity arbitrariness or incompleteness and as far as they actually represent complementary methodologies a clear trend oriented toward the use of hydrological and combined methods has consolidated over time and over a global scale tharme 2003 alcázar and palau 2010 opdyke et al 2014 papadaki et al 2017 world meteorological organization 2019 regardless of the selected method estimation procedures should take into account the natural variability of river flow driven by the dynamics of climate catchment land use and domestic agricultural and industrial consumptions and then of the ef itself with reference to hydrological methods a large body of literature was focused on the intra annual variability for ef assessment discussing about the different values that ef should be given according to the particular river flow conditions during the year a monthly based variability was proposed by different authors the tessmann method 1980 considers intra annual variability allocating percentages of monthly flow to calculate ef depending on the different flow seasons high intermediate or low flow months nyika 2017 the basic flow methodology palau and alcazar 2012 peñas et al 2014 defines a monthly maintenance flow regime based on the definition of basic and conditioning flows gleeson et al 2012 defined the ef as the monthly flow quantile q90 in other cases periods or regimes where different ef values should be considered were recognized hanasaki et al 2008 developed an ef method considering intra annual variability based on global monthly river flows defining four different river regimes dry wet stable and variable and assuming that for each regime ef is represented by a percentage of mean monthly flow pastor et al 2014 proposed a non parametric method based on flow quantiles where the annual flow quantile q90 is allocated during the low flow season and the annual flow quantile q50 is instead allocated during the high flow period recent approaches also presented the concept that inter annual variability of flows is furthermore important for the riverine ecosystem in 1996 richter et al 1996 proposed the iha method based on the identification of indicators of hydrologic alteration which defines magnitude timing frequency duration and rate of change on natural flow regimes to define major component of flow that are ecologically important since then a number of applications were presented where based on the computation of various iha indices long term differences in terms of efs were assessed as a consequence of climate and or anthropogenic changes peres and cancelliere 2016 lin et al 2017 ren et al 2018 but the question of the deviation of the ef indices from the natural ranges is far from being fully addressed acreman and dunbar 2004 ren et al 2018 smakhtin et al 1997 and castellarin et al 2007 proposed an analysis of annual flow duration curves in a regional approach discussing about how the largest differences between the individual annual curves occur especially during the low flow period of a year but no specific quantification about the inter annual variability of efs was attempted so far in this framework the current paper main aims are to i recommend methodologies for efs and efs inter annual variability estimation in a particular climate environment the mediterranean basin where ef assessment is important to quantify the potential water supply for domestic and agricultural consumption under a typical rainfall shortage condition ii test if and in case how the recommendation for the most suitable method is influenced by the river basin characteristics with particular reference to the geological and climate settings known to be the main drivers of low flow conditions with this aims and in the challenge of a regional scale framework for environmental flow and environmental flow variability assessment where new approaches are generally warmly foreseen acreman and ferguson 2010 pastor et al 2014 a hydrological method computing ef index from empirical flow duration curve as a discharge value for a particular duration was applied to a dataset of 28 non regulated catchments located in southern italy covering a region of about 25 000 km2 the flow size equalling or exceeding 95 of the time q95 was considered as it is a widely used flow index olsen et al 2013 wmo 2019 in order to describe the q95 inter annual variability individual annual flow duration curves afdcs were considered to assess average and standard deviation values for q95 quantiles at each gauged site within the investigated region one of the most popular method used to predict q95 the regression approach kobold and brilly 1994 castellarin et al 2007 laaha and blöschl 2007 mohamoud 2008 vezza et al 2010 cheng et al 2012 was applied to predict ef and ef inter annual variability at the catchment scale at site analysis where morphological and climate descriptors such as catchment area precipitation elevation land use geology have been related to the environmental flow indicator the results of the at site analysis in terms of average ef and ef statistical variability indices were further analysed over the whole studied area to approach a regional scale tool describing the importance of efs inter annual variability in the end an approach for its quantitative assessment in a fully regional methodology where no hydrological observations are available was suggested the findings encourage a feasible identification of systems mostly affected by the ef variability which would represent an undeniable and interesting finding for future predictions in a global environmental change perspective longobardi and van loon 2018 2 the studied region the study region is a complex relief area with inland highlands running north west to south east and wide and flat plains facing the tyrrhenian sea where all the river channels included in this analysis flow into the geology is rather variable it includes marley clayey impermeable complex in the north east area fissured calcareous and dolomitic complex in the central area representing the most important regional aquifers with the highest potential infiltration coefficient and alluvial complex along the coastline about 30 of the study area can be considered as permeable and about 32 is covered by forest hydrologic data consist of daily streamflow time series for 28 non regulated basins mainly located within the campania region southern italy covering a region of about 25 000 km2 fig 1 the source of streamflow data is the servizio idrografico e mareografico italiano simi the record length ranges from 6 to 65 years the size of the basins ranges between 10 and 5000 km2 the following physiographic and hydrological characteristics were computed for each catchment and indicated in table 1 drainage area km2 mean daily discharge m3 s daily discharge coefficient of variation mean topographic catchment elevation m mean topographic catchment slope percentage of forested area and geology represented by a permeability index pi longobardi and villani 2013 additionally the baseflow index bfi was computed by the application of the lyne and hollick algorithm for hydrograph separation longobardi and villani 2008 the region under investigation is featured by a typical mediterranean and humid climate with very marked dry and wet seasons within the year mean annual precipitation and air temperature show a moderate gradient form the coastline to the inland as the investigated catchments are all located along the hill reliefs climate variables are rather homogeneously spatially distributed the intra annual precipitation distribution is also homogeneous with the minimum amount of precipitation observed from june to september and the maximum from november to february longobardi and villani 2010 longobardi et al 2016 additional climate statistics used for the current analysis including mean annual precipitation μ p annual precipitation coefficient of variation cv p the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean values mean annual air temperature μ t were obtained from the annual time series of precipitation retrieved from an evenly spaced network of 62 thermometric sensors and 163 raingauges distributed over the whole study area longobardi and mautone 2015 they are illustrated in table 2 3 observing and quantifying ef variability the fdc is a representation of the cumulative distribution function of streamflow when recorded streamflow data are available it can be easily graphically derived ranking the data and plotting each data for the corresponding plotting position it is well known that the location and shape of the fcd in the time discharge domain is dependent on the climate the geometrical catchment features and the geology and soil types in particular for what concerns the study area of interest in a previous paper it was showed how the shape of the fdc is significantly affected by the proportion of baseflow to total stream flow the bfi index with flat and steep fdc shapes associated respectively to high and low bfi indices longobardi and villani 2013 similar properties were found in neighbouring region featured by similar hydro geological characteristics showing the possibility for a generalization of the approach based on the geological properties claps and fiorentino 1997 within the study area the bfi index is tightly related to the catchment hydro geo morphological properties summarized by a permeability index pi reported in table 1 longobardi and villani 2008 in turn the fdc shape is mainly affected by the catchment hydro geo morphological properties rainfall properties were showed not to be critical in the fdc shape regional prediction longobardi and villani 2013 as discussed in the introduction q95 the flow size equalling or exceeding 95 of the time was assumed as a measure of efs in the current study empirical q95 assessment requires then necessarily a preliminary construction of the empirical flow duration curve to assess the efs average value and inter annual variability for each of the gauged stations firstly annual fdcs afdc that is fdcs for each single year were constructed and secondly the empirical average of annual flow duration curves was computed mean annual fdc as an example fig 2 illustrates the adfcs and mean annual fdc at four of the considered streamflow gauged sites it is evident as previously mentioned in the description of the general features of the investigated region how small pi indices are associated to steeper fdcs small pi indices also seem to be related to wider afdcs envelope the results of the regional scale analysis will better describe this particular characteristic in the next paragraphs for each afdcs the 95 probability of exceedance was considered and q95 discharge was computed fig 3 the average and the coefficient of variation the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean values of q95 for each catchment μ q95 and cv q95 are reported in table 2 the region under investigation appears quite heterogeneous with μ q95 ranging between 0 03 mc s to 25 46 mc s referred to the largest drainage catchment in the region of about more than 5000 km2 the q95 variability is also markedly heterogeneous with cv q95 ranging 11 138 to quantify the inter annual q95 variability for the specific case study the confidence boundaries for μ q95 were reconstructed for different significance levels and indicated as q95inf α and q95sup α α 0 99 0 95 and 0 9 for each catchment the maximum and minimum q95 values q95max e q95min were quantified as the q95 corresponding to the upper boundary and lower boundary curves of the afdcs envelopment the corresponding values were compared with the confidence boundaries values q95sup α and q95inf α table 3 reports for the different significance levels the percentage of catchments for which q95min or q95max are outside the confidences boundaries that is for which q95min q95inf α and q95max q95sup α it can be observed that for example with reference to α 0 95 the zero hypothesis q95 μ q95 was rejected in the 32 of the cases that is the observed q95min is significantly different from μ q95 for 32 of gauged stations even more markedly q95max is significantly different from the μ q95 for 75 of gauged stations it is clear how at least for the studied region including an assessment of ef inter annual variability would represent a valuable added value for regional scale assessment tools 4 ef and ef inter annual variability at site analysis a database regression analysis framework was applied to explain the year to year q95 variability at each gauged site inter annual variability a time series of q95 was reconstructed selecting the q95 discharge from the single afdcs and it was regressed against related time series of annual precipitation p mean annual daily discharge q and annual bfi index the last was derived in a year by year hydrograph separation of total discharge by the use of the lyne and hollick algorithm longobardi and villani 2008 the bfi index and the discharge q were demonstrated to be the most significant descriptors to be used for low flow prediction within the geographical region the investigated catchments belong to longobardi and villani 2008 in particular the three following regression models were calibrated over each gauged site 1 mod 1 q95 a1 a2 bfi 2 mod 2 q95 b1 b2 bfi b3 q 3 mod 3 q95 c1 c2 bfi c3 q c4 p models were compared in terms of conventional statistics such as the mean standard deviation std coefficient of variation cv the root mean squared error rmse and the pearson correlation coefficient r2cor corrected for the number of model parameters 4 r c o r 2 1 1 r 2 k 1 k p where p is the number of model parameters and k is the sample length results are given in tables 4 and 5 for what concerns eqs 1 and 2 respectively the same tables also provide the cross validation errors estimates derived from the application of the jackknife resampling procedure to assess different sources of error efron 1982 mean total true error mt the average error over the whole sites for each of which the prediction is made with the parameters obtained by excluding from the dataset the observation referring to the site for which the prediction is computed leave one out validation mean apparent error ma the average error over the whole sites for each of which the prediction is made with the parameters obtained by the whole dataset of observations mean expected excess error me the difference between the mean total true error and the mean apparent error the mean apparent error measures the goodness of the adaptation of the regional relationship to the whole dataset descriptive abilities whereas the mean expected excess error measures its reliability in terms of robustness predictive abilities for sake of conciseness the results which refer to the calibration of mod3 were not here reported as the main statistic and performance errors are substantially coincident with the results associated to mod2 showing the relative poor capability of the total annual rainfall to further contribute to the description of the ef average values likely because already embedded within the q variability accounted for in mod1 and mod2 at the regional scale the mod2 regression model including the bfi index and the mean annual discharge as independent variables appeared to be the best performing model tables 4 and 5 in particular q appeared to be the most significant independent variable the average over the region explained variance of mod1 is about 19 max r2 corr 0 51 and min r2 corr 0 09 and it increased up to 55 in the case of mod2 max r2 corr 0 94 and min r2 corr 0 06 predicted average values for q95 were almost equal to the observed ones for both mod1 and mod2 fig 4 left panels mod1 underestimated the q95 coefficient of variation of about 47 fig 4 right upper panel whereas mod2 generated an average underestimation of about 37 prediction of large cv was particularly uncertain but in the case of mod2 likely the existence of the independent variable q in the regression model generated more robust estimates differences between regression models were also detected for what concerns the jackknife error statistic with an important increase of mean expected excess error me a measure of model robustness from 9 in the case of mod1 to 16 in the case of mod2 as an example fig 5 illustrates ef q and bfi time series for two very different catchments fig 5 left panel shows the case of a medium range pi catchment the liri sora with an average bfi equal to 64 whereas fig 5 right panel shows the case of a high pi catchment the fibreno brocco with an average bfi equal to 87 table 1 the fibreno catchment has lower discharge and ef values mainly due to the smaller drainage area compared to the liri catchment the large and mainly constant bfi values indicate a system where streamflow is strongly sustained by the groundwater contribution as a consequence its fdc as illustrated in fig 2 lower right panel would be flat q and ef have very strongly correlated patterns almost similar magnitude and a very moderate variability in time fig 5 right panel in the case of the liri catchment fig 5 left panel q and ef have still well correlated patterns even though ef has a smaller variability and a significantly smaller magnitude compared to q the bfi values are quite variables and the ef pattern variability in the case of the liri catchment is also more marked compared to the fibreno catchment this is also seen in the comparison of the empirical cv q indices respectively 130 and 33 table 1 and of the empirical cv q95 indices respectively 41 and 25 table 2 for what concerns the climate feature the liri catchment is furthermore featured by a large cv p of about 24 compared to the fibreno catchment which cv p amounts to about 19 table 2 5 ef and ef inter annual variability regional analysis the at site analyses highlighted the importance of the mean annual daily discharge q and the bfi index in the prediction of q95 and its variability they furthermore showed how apparently the annual precipitation is not able to additionally beyond q and bfi explain the average q95 and its variability drainage area seemed to matter but clearly its role was not be explicitly accounted for into the at site investigation the regional scale analysis aimed to calibrate regional empirical relationships to predict the average q95 and its variability summarized by the cv starting from synthetic catchment descriptors widely and readily available at the regional scale in particular indices reported in tables 1 and 2 were accounted for the purpose a matrix of correlation coefficients if only larger than 10 is reported in table 6 as a starting point to identify the dominant variables and to define the empirical regional laws the average q95 appeared to be mainly related to basically drainage area a and average daily discharge μ q bfi was poorly related to μ q95 but due to its conceptual value its role in the definition of the regional laws was explored cv q95 appeared instead correlated to different indices included the precipitation index cv p correlation coefficients appeared however rather weak with the most correlated index being the bfi r2 0 46 5 1 mean q95 assessment starting from the results illustrated in table 6 a step wise regression approach indicated the mean daily streamflow μ q to be the dominant variable for μ q95 prediction at the regional scale it explained indeed up to 84 of the variance fig 6 left panel the explained variance increased up to 92 when also catchment drainage area a is accounted for and in the end a very moderate increase up to 95 is provided when in the regression model the bfi index is furthermore considered the relevant equations for regional μ q95 index are reported in table 7 to assess and compare models performance the average percentage error ape index was computed as 5 a p e 1 n i 1 n μ q 95 o b s μ q 95 p r e d μ q 95 o b s where μ q95 obs and μ q95 pred are respectively the observed and regional predicted q95 average values and n is the number gauged sites the ape index assessment for each gauged station referred to the catchment bfi index is illustrated in fig 7 if catchment area was also accounted for the ape index was strongly smaller compared to the case when only μ q was considered single regression model in fig 7 but then it increases again when the bfi was additionally included in the regression even though the multiple regression model using three independent variables represented the best performing according to the correlation coefficient table 7 the increase in the ape index when the three independent variables μ q a bfi were considered was mainly due to the prediction error associated to a particular catchment ape index of about 8000 as illustrated in fig 7 left panel the riomollo settignano falls within the class of the watershed featured by small drainage area and low permeability index which represents indeed the class for which the predictions are rather uncertain in the investigated region if this was removed from the computation of the ape the index would decrease up to 9 82 the prediction errors associated to the simple linear regression model when only μ q is considered appeared important especially for catchments featured by low bfi values fig 7 left panel the simple regression model prediction capabilities can be indeed improved if the calibration of the regression parameters was performed for groups of catchments identified on the base of the bfi index values longobardi and van loon 2018 a threshold value of bfi 60 was found for the case study as the value that optimize the single regression models calibration the bfi threshold identified two groups a poorly drained group of catchments with low groundwater contribution and bfi 60 and a well drained group of catchment with large groundwater contribution and bfi 60 the calibrated parameters and model equations to be applied for the two groups are reported in table 7 along with the model performances percentage errors in comparison with the multiple regression model are illustrated in fig 7 right panel the identification of groups of catchments on the base of the bfi helped to objectively overcome the biased overestimation of the average q95 in the case of the poorly drained watersheds where the riomollo settignano is included as also demonstrated by the correlation coefficients and the ape index improvements illustrated in table 7 to further illustrate the importance of the catchment drainage area in the regional assessment of μ q95 the same regional models reported in table 7 were calibrated using the specific mean annual discharge μs q and the specific mean q95 μs q95 that is the μ q and μ q95 values divided by the catchment drainage area results are illustrated in table 8 even though the correlation coefficient between observed and modelled μs q95 appear larger than in the case of μ q95 ape errors appear extremely larger and mainly due to very important errors associated to the catchments characterized by the smaller drainage area values and low permeability index such as in the case of the riomollo settignano for this specific reason in the following regional prediction models for μ q95 in table 7 were taken into account 5 2 q95 inter annual variability assessment at the regional scale cv q95 was assumed as a measure for q95 inter annual variability similarly to what considered in the case of the regional analysis for μ q95 a step wise regression highlighted the dominant regional variables for cv q95 among the catchment indices as reported in table 6 for what concerns the variability of cv q95 at the regional scale contrarily from what found in the case of μ q95 regression analysis the drainage area a and the mean annual discharge μ q did not play a central role this was probably due to the fact that the coefficient of variation represents a normalized index which is generally adopted in statistical hydrology analyses in order to compare variables whose average values are rather different even though the correlation coefficient indicates a moderate correlation r2 0 46 the bfi appeared as the catchment index that best represent the cv q95 variability at the regional scale with large cv q95 associated to low bfi values fig 8 left panel this feature highlighted how groundwater poorly sustained catchments correspond to the systems which are more impacted by the environmental flow variability a simple regression model that sees the bfi index as the independent variable was the basic model to describe the q95 variability for the studied area the second best correlated independent variable to cv q95 was the climate index related to the rainfall variability that is the cv p including the cv p in a regional regression model beyond bfi increased the explained variance up to 61 and reduced the ape index from about 24 to 17 the examined regression equations including model performances are reported in table 9 the average percentage errors for the simple and multiple regression prediction models are illustrated as function bfi and cv p respectively in fig 9 left and right panel both the simple and multiple regression equations predicted an overestimation in cv q95 assessment magnitude errors seemed larger for large bfi values and large cv p values similarly to the case of the μ q95 prediction the investigated catchments were subdivided into two groups the cv p was used in this case to identify the groups with respect to the regional average cv p which amount to about 21 a group of catchments featured by large rainfall variability with cv p 21 and a group of catchments featured by low rainfall variability with cv p 21 were identified taking into account the grouping resulted in a very moderate increase in the explained variance but in a more marked reduction in the ape index reducing the large cv q95 overestimation for all of the studied catchments although the predictive capabilities of the model were significantly improved the identification of the groups helped to better specify which systems are most affected by the ef variability and to quantify their variabilities the patterns identified in fig 8 right panel in fact showed how compared with catchments featured by cv p below the regional value for catchments featured by cv p above the regional value small variations in the bfi correspond to important variations of the cv q95 therefore the level of inter annual precipitation variability appeared important in the assessment of ef variability only for watershed featured by small bfi values whereas the rainfall inter annual variability did not affect the ef variability in the case of catchments characterized by large bfi values 6 implication for a fully regional model for μ q95 and cv q95 prediction in the previous paragraphs regional relationship for the prediction of μ q95 and cv q95 were calibrated the best performing prediction equations were based on hydrological variables and physical catchment attributes in particular the mean annual daily discharge μ q the bfi the coefficient of variation of the precipitation cv p and the catchment area a appeared the dominant characteristics at the regional scale starting from the summarized findings an implication for a fully regional approach was proposed for applications in fully ungauged catchments the fully regional model was intended to simply rely on physical catchment attributes also embedding the impact of hydrological variables which necessarily originate from continuous observations unavailable for ungauged sites for what concerns the mean annual daily discharge μ q a first assessment at the regional scale μ q a was provided by the relationship with the catchment drainage area a 6 μ q a 0 014 a 3 02 a strong linear correlation between μ q and a of about 91 is reported in table 6 fig 10 left panel compares μ q a prediction with the observed values for the considered catchments in a second instance a regional assessment for μ q μ q d was provided through the regional scale evaluation of mean annual runoff from the annual soil water balance cannarozzo et al 2009 viola et al 2017 in particular for the investigated region rossi and silvagni 1980 proposed the following equation for regional prediction of mean annual runoff μ d 7 μ d 1 3 20 08 11 09 log p 5 19 log t where p and t are respectively the mean annual precipitation and the mean annual air temperature μ d was converted into μ q d by means of catchment area and compared in fig 10 right panel with the observed values for the considered catchments for what concerns instead the bfi in a previous paper longobardi and villani 2008 the authors showed the results of a regional prediction framework for bfi estimation at ungauged sites for the region under investigation in particular it was demonstrated that a simple partition of catchment area a into permeable areas aperm and impervious areas can be used to define a permeability index pi the ratio aperm a which represent the independent variable for the analysed area for the bfi estimation 8 b f i b f i p e r m p i b f i min with bfiperm and bfimin least square regional regression parameters based on the discharge and catchment features data of the studied area a 68 explained variance was found for eq 8 taking into account the illustrated formulations the regression models reported in table 7 for the prediction of μ q95 resulted in the calibration and assessment provided in table 10 clearly the use of both μ q a and μ q d for the regional scale description of μ q led to the same performance for what concerns instead the cv q95 as no relationships were found between the precipitation variability cv p and any of the available catchment attributes only the simple regression equation where the independent variable is the bfi was recalibrated results are provided in table 11 the fully regional approach showed clearly different performance capacity compared to the prediction based on the observed hydrological variables but not significantly lower 7 conclusion the environmental flow ef is a critical parameter called to balance the need to provide the worldwide growing population with reliable water supplies on one side and sustain restore or maintain ecosystem services on the other side some of the estimation procedures take into account the natural variability of river flow by considering the intra annual ef variability but the question of the deviation of the ef indices from the long term natural ranges is far from being fully addressed in this context the current research was framed to recommend methodologies for efs and efs inter annual variability estimation and test how the recommendation for the most suitable method is influenced by the river basin characteristics with particular reference to the geological and climate settings known to be the main drivers of low flow conditions regional relationship for the prediction of average ef μ q95 and ef inter annual variability cv q95 were calibrated they were based on hydrological variables and physical catchment attributes in particular regional regression equations with two independent variables appeared the best prediction models for both μ q95 and cv q95 with μ q95 strongly dependent on catchment area a and mean annual daily discharge μ q and cv q95 dependent on the bfi index and the coefficient of variation of the precipitation cv p it was showed that simple regression regional equations can be valid alternative to multiple regression equations for both μ q95 and cv q95 but it was necessary to group the catchments and provide a specific calibration for each group for what concerns μ q95 the group rule was based on the bfi index and the independent variable was set on the mean annual daily discharge μ q for what concerns instead cv q95 the group rule was based on the cv p index and the independent variable was set on the bfi index the regional regression equations for μ q95 and cv q95 prediction were in the end re calibrated to provide a fully regional approach simply based on physical catchment attributes also embedding the impact of hydrological variables which necessarily originate from continuous observations unavailable for ungauged sites the fully regional approach showed clearly different performance capacity compared to the prediction based on the observed hydrological variables but not significantly lower operationally if hydrometric data are available in the region and it is possible to establish a relationship between μ q and a from this it is possible to estimate the value of μ q and then calculate the average value of ef μ q95 from the geological characteristics it will similarly be possible to estimate the value of cv q95 and from this as μ q95 is known the standard deviation of q95 and therefore the maximum and minimum expect ef values can be assessed if hydrometric data are not available in the region it is possible to use only climatic data and geological characteristics to make the same estimates however with reduced performance as typically occurs in regional analyses the findings related to the inter annual variability of efs on one side confirmed the importance to account for such feature and on the other side encourage a feasible identification of the systems mostly affected by the ef variability large deviations of ef from long term averages were observed for the region under investigation indeed by the reconstruction of annual flow duration curves it was found that in about 32 of cases the minimum observed value of q95 was lower than the lower boundary of a 5 significance level confidence interval the vulnerability of those systems seemed to arise from a combination of both precipitation variability cv p and geological features bfi the ef inter annual variability was more sensitive for catchments featured by large cv p but the difference were mostly evident in the case of low bfi values in a global environmental change and sustainability perspective a conceptual modelling approach able to mimic the hydrological behaviour of those system under climate scenario characterized by more detailed climate variability indices would represent an undeniable useful tool to inform water

8308,study region data from 28 streamflow gauging stations located in the campania region southern italy were analysed study focus the study was aimed at recommend regional methodologies for environmental flow ef and ef variability estimation for a climatological environment particularly affected by strong climate variability starting from an at site statistical analysis of discharge data a preliminary step where the quantification of ef average value μ q95 and inter annual variability cv q95 was illustrated a regional regression approach was then presented for the prediction of μ q95 and cv q95 new hydrological insights for the region a step wise procedure highlighted the dominant hydrological variables and catchment attributes for ef prediction catchment area and mean annual daily discharge μ q appeared strongly related to μ q95 whereas cv q95 was found to be dependent on the baseflow index and on precipitation variability regional predictions were evaluated on the base of the correlation coefficient and absolute average percentage errors prediction errors amounted to about 30 and 17 respectively in the case of μ q95 and cv q95 in the end an implication for a fully regional approach simply based on catchment attributes also embedding the impact of hydrological variables was presented it showed clearly different performance capacity compared to the prediction based on the observed hydrological variables but not significantly lower keywords environmental flows flow duration curve q95 regional analysis mediterranean area 1 introduction water scientists and stakeholders are nowadays involved in the major challenge of providing the worldwide growing population with reliable water supplies protecting at the same time the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems on this purpose environmental flow ef appears as a critical parameter to be assessed in order to sustain or restore ecosystems and to maintain ecosystem services according to tharme 2003 ef estimating methodologies can be classified into four different groups it is possible to distinguish between i hydrological methods based on the analysis of historical flow regime ii hydraulic methods based on the analysis of stream channel geometry iii habitat simulation methods based on the simulation of physical habitat iv and holistic methodologies where multidisciplinary expertise is needed to achieve particular ecological geomorphological water quality social objectives in the modified system the choice for one of the methodologies depends on available data but also on institutional aspects and regulations and thus may vary from country to country almost all of these methodologies were criticised because of subjectivity arbitrariness or incompleteness and as far as they actually represent complementary methodologies a clear trend oriented toward the use of hydrological and combined methods has consolidated over time and over a global scale tharme 2003 alcázar and palau 2010 opdyke et al 2014 papadaki et al 2017 world meteorological organization 2019 regardless of the selected method estimation procedures should take into account the natural variability of river flow driven by the dynamics of climate catchment land use and domestic agricultural and industrial consumptions and then of the ef itself with reference to hydrological methods a large body of literature was focused on the intra annual variability for ef assessment discussing about the different values that ef should be given according to the particular river flow conditions during the year a monthly based variability was proposed by different authors the tessmann method 1980 considers intra annual variability allocating percentages of monthly flow to calculate ef depending on the different flow seasons high intermediate or low flow months nyika 2017 the basic flow methodology palau and alcazar 2012 peñas et al 2014 defines a monthly maintenance flow regime based on the definition of basic and conditioning flows gleeson et al 2012 defined the ef as the monthly flow quantile q90 in other cases periods or regimes where different ef values should be considered were recognized hanasaki et al 2008 developed an ef method considering intra annual variability based on global monthly river flows defining four different river regimes dry wet stable and variable and assuming that for each regime ef is represented by a percentage of mean monthly flow pastor et al 2014 proposed a non parametric method based on flow quantiles where the annual flow quantile q90 is allocated during the low flow season and the annual flow quantile q50 is instead allocated during the high flow period recent approaches also presented the concept that inter annual variability of flows is furthermore important for the riverine ecosystem in 1996 richter et al 1996 proposed the iha method based on the identification of indicators of hydrologic alteration which defines magnitude timing frequency duration and rate of change on natural flow regimes to define major component of flow that are ecologically important since then a number of applications were presented where based on the computation of various iha indices long term differences in terms of efs were assessed as a consequence of climate and or anthropogenic changes peres and cancelliere 2016 lin et al 2017 ren et al 2018 but the question of the deviation of the ef indices from the natural ranges is far from being fully addressed acreman and dunbar 2004 ren et al 2018 smakhtin et al 1997 and castellarin et al 2007 proposed an analysis of annual flow duration curves in a regional approach discussing about how the largest differences between the individual annual curves occur especially during the low flow period of a year but no specific quantification about the inter annual variability of efs was attempted so far in this framework the current paper main aims are to i recommend methodologies for efs and efs inter annual variability estimation in a particular climate environment the mediterranean basin where ef assessment is important to quantify the potential water supply for domestic and agricultural consumption under a typical rainfall shortage condition ii test if and in case how the recommendation for the most suitable method is influenced by the river basin characteristics with particular reference to the geological and climate settings known to be the main drivers of low flow conditions with this aims and in the challenge of a regional scale framework for environmental flow and environmental flow variability assessment where new approaches are generally warmly foreseen acreman and ferguson 2010 pastor et al 2014 a hydrological method computing ef index from empirical flow duration curve as a discharge value for a particular duration was applied to a dataset of 28 non regulated catchments located in southern italy covering a region of about 25 000 km2 the flow size equalling or exceeding 95 of the time q95 was considered as it is a widely used flow index olsen et al 2013 wmo 2019 in order to describe the q95 inter annual variability individual annual flow duration curves afdcs were considered to assess average and standard deviation values for q95 quantiles at each gauged site within the investigated region one of the most popular method used to predict q95 the regression approach kobold and brilly 1994 castellarin et al 2007 laaha and blöschl 2007 mohamoud 2008 vezza et al 2010 cheng et al 2012 was applied to predict ef and ef inter annual variability at the catchment scale at site analysis where morphological and climate descriptors such as catchment area precipitation elevation land use geology have been related to the environmental flow indicator the results of the at site analysis in terms of average ef and ef statistical variability indices were further analysed over the whole studied area to approach a regional scale tool describing the importance of efs inter annual variability in the end an approach for its quantitative assessment in a fully regional methodology where no hydrological observations are available was suggested the findings encourage a feasible identification of systems mostly affected by the ef variability which would represent an undeniable and interesting finding for future predictions in a global environmental change perspective longobardi and van loon 2018 2 the studied region the study region is a complex relief area with inland highlands running north west to south east and wide and flat plains facing the tyrrhenian sea where all the river channels included in this analysis flow into the geology is rather variable it includes marley clayey impermeable complex in the north east area fissured calcareous and dolomitic complex in the central area representing the most important regional aquifers with the highest potential infiltration coefficient and alluvial complex along the coastline about 30 of the study area can be considered as permeable and about 32 is covered by forest hydrologic data consist of daily streamflow time series for 28 non regulated basins mainly located within the campania region southern italy covering a region of about 25 000 km2 fig 1 the source of streamflow data is the servizio idrografico e mareografico italiano simi the record length ranges from 6 to 65 years the size of the basins ranges between 10 and 5000 km2 the following physiographic and hydrological characteristics were computed for each catchment and indicated in table 1 drainage area km2 mean daily discharge m3 s daily discharge coefficient of variation mean topographic catchment elevation m mean topographic catchment slope percentage of forested area and geology represented by a permeability index pi longobardi and villani 2013 additionally the baseflow index bfi was computed by the application of the lyne and hollick algorithm for hydrograph separation longobardi and villani 2008 the region under investigation is featured by a typical mediterranean and humid climate with very marked dry and wet seasons within the year mean annual precipitation and air temperature show a moderate gradient form the coastline to the inland as the investigated catchments are all located along the hill reliefs climate variables are rather homogeneously spatially distributed the intra annual precipitation distribution is also homogeneous with the minimum amount of precipitation observed from june to september and the maximum from november to february longobardi and villani 2010 longobardi et al 2016 additional climate statistics used for the current analysis including mean annual precipitation μ p annual precipitation coefficient of variation cv p the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean values mean annual air temperature μ t were obtained from the annual time series of precipitation retrieved from an evenly spaced network of 62 thermometric sensors and 163 raingauges distributed over the whole study area longobardi and mautone 2015 they are illustrated in table 2 3 observing and quantifying ef variability the fdc is a representation of the cumulative distribution function of streamflow when recorded streamflow data are available it can be easily graphically derived ranking the data and plotting each data for the corresponding plotting position it is well known that the location and shape of the fcd in the time discharge domain is dependent on the climate the geometrical catchment features and the geology and soil types in particular for what concerns the study area of interest in a previous paper it was showed how the shape of the fdc is significantly affected by the proportion of baseflow to total stream flow the bfi index with flat and steep fdc shapes associated respectively to high and low bfi indices longobardi and villani 2013 similar properties were found in neighbouring region featured by similar hydro geological characteristics showing the possibility for a generalization of the approach based on the geological properties claps and fiorentino 1997 within the study area the bfi index is tightly related to the catchment hydro geo morphological properties summarized by a permeability index pi reported in table 1 longobardi and villani 2008 in turn the fdc shape is mainly affected by the catchment hydro geo morphological properties rainfall properties were showed not to be critical in the fdc shape regional prediction longobardi and villani 2013 as discussed in the introduction q95 the flow size equalling or exceeding 95 of the time was assumed as a measure of efs in the current study empirical q95 assessment requires then necessarily a preliminary construction of the empirical flow duration curve to assess the efs average value and inter annual variability for each of the gauged stations firstly annual fdcs afdc that is fdcs for each single year were constructed and secondly the empirical average of annual flow duration curves was computed mean annual fdc as an example fig 2 illustrates the adfcs and mean annual fdc at four of the considered streamflow gauged sites it is evident as previously mentioned in the description of the general features of the investigated region how small pi indices are associated to steeper fdcs small pi indices also seem to be related to wider afdcs envelope the results of the regional scale analysis will better describe this particular characteristic in the next paragraphs for each afdcs the 95 probability of exceedance was considered and q95 discharge was computed fig 3 the average and the coefficient of variation the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean values of q95 for each catchment μ q95 and cv q95 are reported in table 2 the region under investigation appears quite heterogeneous with μ q95 ranging between 0 03 mc s to 25 46 mc s referred to the largest drainage catchment in the region of about more than 5000 km2 the q95 variability is also markedly heterogeneous with cv q95 ranging 11 138 to quantify the inter annual q95 variability for the specific case study the confidence boundaries for μ q95 were reconstructed for different significance levels and indicated as q95inf α and q95sup α α 0 99 0 95 and 0 9 for each catchment the maximum and minimum q95 values q95max e q95min were quantified as the q95 corresponding to the upper boundary and lower boundary curves of the afdcs envelopment the corresponding values were compared with the confidence boundaries values q95sup α and q95inf α table 3 reports for the different significance levels the percentage of catchments for which q95min or q95max are outside the confidences boundaries that is for which q95min q95inf α and q95max q95sup α it can be observed that for example with reference to α 0 95 the zero hypothesis q95 μ q95 was rejected in the 32 of the cases that is the observed q95min is significantly different from μ q95 for 32 of gauged stations even more markedly q95max is significantly different from the μ q95 for 75 of gauged stations it is clear how at least for the studied region including an assessment of ef inter annual variability would represent a valuable added value for regional scale assessment tools 4 ef and ef inter annual variability at site analysis a database regression analysis framework was applied to explain the year to year q95 variability at each gauged site inter annual variability a time series of q95 was reconstructed selecting the q95 discharge from the single afdcs and it was regressed against related time series of annual precipitation p mean annual daily discharge q and annual bfi index the last was derived in a year by year hydrograph separation of total discharge by the use of the lyne and hollick algorithm longobardi and villani 2008 the bfi index and the discharge q were demonstrated to be the most significant descriptors to be used for low flow prediction within the geographical region the investigated catchments belong to longobardi and villani 2008 in particular the three following regression models were calibrated over each gauged site 1 mod 1 q95 a1 a2 bfi 2 mod 2 q95 b1 b2 bfi b3 q 3 mod 3 q95 c1 c2 bfi c3 q c4 p models were compared in terms of conventional statistics such as the mean standard deviation std coefficient of variation cv the root mean squared error rmse and the pearson correlation coefficient r2cor corrected for the number of model parameters 4 r c o r 2 1 1 r 2 k 1 k p where p is the number of model parameters and k is the sample length results are given in tables 4 and 5 for what concerns eqs 1 and 2 respectively the same tables also provide the cross validation errors estimates derived from the application of the jackknife resampling procedure to assess different sources of error efron 1982 mean total true error mt the average error over the whole sites for each of which the prediction is made with the parameters obtained by excluding from the dataset the observation referring to the site for which the prediction is computed leave one out validation mean apparent error ma the average error over the whole sites for each of which the prediction is made with the parameters obtained by the whole dataset of observations mean expected excess error me the difference between the mean total true error and the mean apparent error the mean apparent error measures the goodness of the adaptation of the regional relationship to the whole dataset descriptive abilities whereas the mean expected excess error measures its reliability in terms of robustness predictive abilities for sake of conciseness the results which refer to the calibration of mod3 were not here reported as the main statistic and performance errors are substantially coincident with the results associated to mod2 showing the relative poor capability of the total annual rainfall to further contribute to the description of the ef average values likely because already embedded within the q variability accounted for in mod1 and mod2 at the regional scale the mod2 regression model including the bfi index and the mean annual discharge as independent variables appeared to be the best performing model tables 4 and 5 in particular q appeared to be the most significant independent variable the average over the region explained variance of mod1 is about 19 max r2 corr 0 51 and min r2 corr 0 09 and it increased up to 55 in the case of mod2 max r2 corr 0 94 and min r2 corr 0 06 predicted average values for q95 were almost equal to the observed ones for both mod1 and mod2 fig 4 left panels mod1 underestimated the q95 coefficient of variation of about 47 fig 4 right upper panel whereas mod2 generated an average underestimation of about 37 prediction of large cv was particularly uncertain but in the case of mod2 likely the existence of the independent variable q in the regression model generated more robust estimates differences between regression models were also detected for what concerns the jackknife error statistic with an important increase of mean expected excess error me a measure of model robustness from 9 in the case of mod1 to 16 in the case of mod2 as an example fig 5 illustrates ef q and bfi time series for two very different catchments fig 5 left panel shows the case of a medium range pi catchment the liri sora with an average bfi equal to 64 whereas fig 5 right panel shows the case of a high pi catchment the fibreno brocco with an average bfi equal to 87 table 1 the fibreno catchment has lower discharge and ef values mainly due to the smaller drainage area compared to the liri catchment the large and mainly constant bfi values indicate a system where streamflow is strongly sustained by the groundwater contribution as a consequence its fdc as illustrated in fig 2 lower right panel would be flat q and ef have very strongly correlated patterns almost similar magnitude and a very moderate variability in time fig 5 right panel in the case of the liri catchment fig 5 left panel q and ef have still well correlated patterns even though ef has a smaller variability and a significantly smaller magnitude compared to q the bfi values are quite variables and the ef pattern variability in the case of the liri catchment is also more marked compared to the fibreno catchment this is also seen in the comparison of the empirical cv q indices respectively 130 and 33 table 1 and of the empirical cv q95 indices respectively 41 and 25 table 2 for what concerns the climate feature the liri catchment is furthermore featured by a large cv p of about 24 compared to the fibreno catchment which cv p amounts to about 19 table 2 5 ef and ef inter annual variability regional analysis the at site analyses highlighted the importance of the mean annual daily discharge q and the bfi index in the prediction of q95 and its variability they furthermore showed how apparently the annual precipitation is not able to additionally beyond q and bfi explain the average q95 and its variability drainage area seemed to matter but clearly its role was not be explicitly accounted for into the at site investigation the regional scale analysis aimed to calibrate regional empirical relationships to predict the average q95 and its variability summarized by the cv starting from synthetic catchment descriptors widely and readily available at the regional scale in particular indices reported in tables 1 and 2 were accounted for the purpose a matrix of correlation coefficients if only larger than 10 is reported in table 6 as a starting point to identify the dominant variables and to define the empirical regional laws the average q95 appeared to be mainly related to basically drainage area a and average daily discharge μ q bfi was poorly related to μ q95 but due to its conceptual value its role in the definition of the regional laws was explored cv q95 appeared instead correlated to different indices included the precipitation index cv p correlation coefficients appeared however rather weak with the most correlated index being the bfi r2 0 46 5 1 mean q95 assessment starting from the results illustrated in table 6 a step wise regression approach indicated the mean daily streamflow μ q to be the dominant variable for μ q95 prediction at the regional scale it explained indeed up to 84 of the variance fig 6 left panel the explained variance increased up to 92 when also catchment drainage area a is accounted for and in the end a very moderate increase up to 95 is provided when in the regression model the bfi index is furthermore considered the relevant equations for regional μ q95 index are reported in table 7 to assess and compare models performance the average percentage error ape index was computed as 5 a p e 1 n i 1 n μ q 95 o b s μ q 95 p r e d μ q 95 o b s where μ q95 obs and μ q95 pred are respectively the observed and regional predicted q95 average values and n is the number gauged sites the ape index assessment for each gauged station referred to the catchment bfi index is illustrated in fig 7 if catchment area was also accounted for the ape index was strongly smaller compared to the case when only μ q was considered single regression model in fig 7 but then it increases again when the bfi was additionally included in the regression even though the multiple regression model using three independent variables represented the best performing according to the correlation coefficient table 7 the increase in the ape index when the three independent variables μ q a bfi were considered was mainly due to the prediction error associated to a particular catchment ape index of about 8000 as illustrated in fig 7 left panel the riomollo settignano falls within the class of the watershed featured by small drainage area and low permeability index which represents indeed the class for which the predictions are rather uncertain in the investigated region if this was removed from the computation of the ape the index would decrease up to 9 82 the prediction errors associated to the simple linear regression model when only μ q is considered appeared important especially for catchments featured by low bfi values fig 7 left panel the simple regression model prediction capabilities can be indeed improved if the calibration of the regression parameters was performed for groups of catchments identified on the base of the bfi index values longobardi and van loon 2018 a threshold value of bfi 60 was found for the case study as the value that optimize the single regression models calibration the bfi threshold identified two groups a poorly drained group of catchments with low groundwater contribution and bfi 60 and a well drained group of catchment with large groundwater contribution and bfi 60 the calibrated parameters and model equations to be applied for the two groups are reported in table 7 along with the model performances percentage errors in comparison with the multiple regression model are illustrated in fig 7 right panel the identification of groups of catchments on the base of the bfi helped to objectively overcome the biased overestimation of the average q95 in the case of the poorly drained watersheds where the riomollo settignano is included as also demonstrated by the correlation coefficients and the ape index improvements illustrated in table 7 to further illustrate the importance of the catchment drainage area in the regional assessment of μ q95 the same regional models reported in table 7 were calibrated using the specific mean annual discharge μs q and the specific mean q95 μs q95 that is the μ q and μ q95 values divided by the catchment drainage area results are illustrated in table 8 even though the correlation coefficient between observed and modelled μs q95 appear larger than in the case of μ q95 ape errors appear extremely larger and mainly due to very important errors associated to the catchments characterized by the smaller drainage area values and low permeability index such as in the case of the riomollo settignano for this specific reason in the following regional prediction models for μ q95 in table 7 were taken into account 5 2 q95 inter annual variability assessment at the regional scale cv q95 was assumed as a measure for q95 inter annual variability similarly to what considered in the case of the regional analysis for μ q95 a step wise regression highlighted the dominant regional variables for cv q95 among the catchment indices as reported in table 6 for what concerns the variability of cv q95 at the regional scale contrarily from what found in the case of μ q95 regression analysis the drainage area a and the mean annual discharge μ q did not play a central role this was probably due to the fact that the coefficient of variation represents a normalized index which is generally adopted in statistical hydrology analyses in order to compare variables whose average values are rather different even though the correlation coefficient indicates a moderate correlation r2 0 46 the bfi appeared as the catchment index that best represent the cv q95 variability at the regional scale with large cv q95 associated to low bfi values fig 8 left panel this feature highlighted how groundwater poorly sustained catchments correspond to the systems which are more impacted by the environmental flow variability a simple regression model that sees the bfi index as the independent variable was the basic model to describe the q95 variability for the studied area the second best correlated independent variable to cv q95 was the climate index related to the rainfall variability that is the cv p including the cv p in a regional regression model beyond bfi increased the explained variance up to 61 and reduced the ape index from about 24 to 17 the examined regression equations including model performances are reported in table 9 the average percentage errors for the simple and multiple regression prediction models are illustrated as function bfi and cv p respectively in fig 9 left and right panel both the simple and multiple regression equations predicted an overestimation in cv q95 assessment magnitude errors seemed larger for large bfi values and large cv p values similarly to the case of the μ q95 prediction the investigated catchments were subdivided into two groups the cv p was used in this case to identify the groups with respect to the regional average cv p which amount to about 21 a group of catchments featured by large rainfall variability with cv p 21 and a group of catchments featured by low rainfall variability with cv p 21 were identified taking into account the grouping resulted in a very moderate increase in the explained variance but in a more marked reduction in the ape index reducing the large cv q95 overestimation for all of the studied catchments although the predictive capabilities of the model were significantly improved the identification of the groups helped to better specify which systems are most affected by the ef variability and to quantify their variabilities the patterns identified in fig 8 right panel in fact showed how compared with catchments featured by cv p below the regional value for catchments featured by cv p above the regional value small variations in the bfi correspond to important variations of the cv q95 therefore the level of inter annual precipitation variability appeared important in the assessment of ef variability only for watershed featured by small bfi values whereas the rainfall inter annual variability did not affect the ef variability in the case of catchments characterized by large bfi values 6 implication for a fully regional model for μ q95 and cv q95 prediction in the previous paragraphs regional relationship for the prediction of μ q95 and cv q95 were calibrated the best performing prediction equations were based on hydrological variables and physical catchment attributes in particular the mean annual daily discharge μ q the bfi the coefficient of variation of the precipitation cv p and the catchment area a appeared the dominant characteristics at the regional scale starting from the summarized findings an implication for a fully regional approach was proposed for applications in fully ungauged catchments the fully regional model was intended to simply rely on physical catchment attributes also embedding the impact of hydrological variables which necessarily originate from continuous observations unavailable for ungauged sites for what concerns the mean annual daily discharge μ q a first assessment at the regional scale μ q a was provided by the relationship with the catchment drainage area a 6 μ q a 0 014 a 3 02 a strong linear correlation between μ q and a of about 91 is reported in table 6 fig 10 left panel compares μ q a prediction with the observed values for the considered catchments in a second instance a regional assessment for μ q μ q d was provided through the regional scale evaluation of mean annual runoff from the annual soil water balance cannarozzo et al 2009 viola et al 2017 in particular for the investigated region rossi and silvagni 1980 proposed the following equation for regional prediction of mean annual runoff μ d 7 μ d 1 3 20 08 11 09 log p 5 19 log t where p and t are respectively the mean annual precipitation and the mean annual air temperature μ d was converted into μ q d by means of catchment area and compared in fig 10 right panel with the observed values for the considered catchments for what concerns instead the bfi in a previous paper longobardi and villani 2008 the authors showed the results of a regional prediction framework for bfi estimation at ungauged sites for the region under investigation in particular it was demonstrated that a simple partition of catchment area a into permeable areas aperm and impervious areas can be used to define a permeability index pi the ratio aperm a which represent the independent variable for the analysed area for the bfi estimation 8 b f i b f i p e r m p i b f i min with bfiperm and bfimin least square regional regression parameters based on the discharge and catchment features data of the studied area a 68 explained variance was found for eq 8 taking into account the illustrated formulations the regression models reported in table 7 for the prediction of μ q95 resulted in the calibration and assessment provided in table 10 clearly the use of both μ q a and μ q d for the regional scale description of μ q led to the same performance for what concerns instead the cv q95 as no relationships were found between the precipitation variability cv p and any of the available catchment attributes only the simple regression equation where the independent variable is the bfi was recalibrated results are provided in table 11 the fully regional approach showed clearly different performance capacity compared to the prediction based on the observed hydrological variables but not significantly lower 7 conclusion the environmental flow ef is a critical parameter called to balance the need to provide the worldwide growing population with reliable water supplies on one side and sustain restore or maintain ecosystem services on the other side some of the estimation procedures take into account the natural variability of river flow by considering the intra annual ef variability but the question of the deviation of the ef indices from the long term natural ranges is far from being fully addressed in this context the current research was framed to recommend methodologies for efs and efs inter annual variability estimation and test how the recommendation for the most suitable method is influenced by the river basin characteristics with particular reference to the geological and climate settings known to be the main drivers of low flow conditions regional relationship for the prediction of average ef μ q95 and ef inter annual variability cv q95 were calibrated they were based on hydrological variables and physical catchment attributes in particular regional regression equations with two independent variables appeared the best prediction models for both μ q95 and cv q95 with μ q95 strongly dependent on catchment area a and mean annual daily discharge μ q and cv q95 dependent on the bfi index and the coefficient of variation of the precipitation cv p it was showed that simple regression regional equations can be valid alternative to multiple regression equations for both μ q95 and cv q95 but it was necessary to group the catchments and provide a specific calibration for each group for what concerns μ q95 the group rule was based on the bfi index and the independent variable was set on the mean annual daily discharge μ q for what concerns instead cv q95 the group rule was based on the cv p index and the independent variable was set on the bfi index the regional regression equations for μ q95 and cv q95 prediction were in the end re calibrated to provide a fully regional approach simply based on physical catchment attributes also embedding the impact of hydrological variables which necessarily originate from continuous observations unavailable for ungauged sites the fully regional approach showed clearly different performance capacity compared to the prediction based on the observed hydrological variables but not significantly lower operationally if hydrometric data are available in the region and it is possible to establish a relationship between μ q and a from this it is possible to estimate the value of μ q and then calculate the average value of ef μ q95 from the geological characteristics it will similarly be possible to estimate the value of cv q95 and from this as μ q95 is known the standard deviation of q95 and therefore the maximum and minimum expect ef values can be assessed if hydrometric data are not available in the region it is possible to use only climatic data and geological characteristics to make the same estimates however with reduced performance as typically occurs in regional analyses the findings related to the inter annual variability of efs on one side confirmed the importance to account for such feature and on the other side encourage a feasible identification of the systems mostly affected by the ef variability large deviations of ef from long term averages were observed for the region under investigation indeed by the reconstruction of annual flow duration curves it was found that in about 32 of cases the minimum observed value of q95 was lower than the lower boundary of a 5 significance level confidence interval the vulnerability of those systems seemed to arise from a combination of both precipitation variability cv p and geological features bfi the ef inter annual variability was more sensitive for catchments featured by large cv p but the difference were mostly evident in the case of low bfi values in a global environmental change and sustainability perspective a conceptual modelling approach able to mimic the hydrological behaviour of those system under climate scenario characterized by more detailed climate variability indices would represent an undeniable useful tool to inform water

8309,study region the zambezi river basin a transboundary basin supplying vital resources to vast human and environmental systems and subject to radical changes linked to climate and infrastructural development study focus application of a hydrological model pitman established for 76 sub basins covering the total basin area of about 1 350 000 km2 to assess the potential impacts of increasing water demand under global warming scenarios 1 5 2 and 3 degree new hydrological insights for the region the application of the calibrated model to the analysis of different combinations of climate change and water use showed that the relative impacts are quite different across the whole zambezi river basin the greatest impacts are found in the areas containing large open water bodies natural and man made that are very sensitive to the multiple effects of increased aridity the uncertainty in the future simulation results remains hugely dependent upon the source of the climate change data and the change signals given by them the sample rcm data 6 models used are representative of many more model outputs while the spread of possible climate change signals remains quite large however the main uncertainties do not invalidate the overall message of possible water resources change that is summarized in a substantial decrease in water availability under all the combined scenarios keywords zambezi river basin hydrological models climate change water use change model uncertainties 1 introduction the introduction to the first part of this study refers to the ultimate aim of hydrological models which is to improve the decision making capacity of water management authorities hughes et al 2020 one of the key issues for future water management is related to the likely impact of climate change on the natural water resources availability as well as on the economic activities that rely and utlilise these resources milly et al 2008 the other paper also emphasised the uncertainties inherent in establishing any hydrological model some of these uncertainties being related to the imperfections of the models themselves others to the accuracy and representativeness of the climate data used to force the models and yet others related to the availability and accuracy of the observed stream flow data that provide the calibration signals used to parameterize the model and validate the outputs in most large basins throughout the world the stream flow data often reflect non stationary impacts of water abstractions or modifications to the flow regime e g through storage and hydro power releases all of the uncertainties associated with the data used to force calibrate and validate a model are exacerbated in data scarce regions such as africa however the uncertainties associated with setting up a model to represent historical flow regimes can pale into insignificance compared to those associated with predicting what the future may look like giorgio et al 2009 hargreaves and annan 2014 wang et al 2015 the uncertainties related to the various emission scenarios general circulation models and their configuration the downscaling approaches used shamseddin and chaibi 2019 as well as future socio economic development considerations all have to be added to the model setup uncertainties there are many different ways in which the future uncertainties can be represented in a model study but the most common approach is to generate an ensemble of model outputs based on an ensemble of model inputs dosio et al 2019 this ensemble of inputs includes all the time series data representing future possible climate situations the uncertainty ranges in any of the model parameters erfanian et al 2016 that are considered likely to be affected as well as uncertainty ranges in the water use inputs storage volumes abstractions artificial releases etc however given the large number of possible model inputs particularly related to climate model simulations it is also necessary to establish an appropriate approach for defining the input ensemble lutz et al 2016 it is also necessary to decide how the output ensemble information should be presented to those who might use the information for decision making purposes it is not always easy to convey uncertain prediction results to an audience that is required to make decisions borgomeo et al 2018 greve et al 2018 however it is also not valid to simply present a multi model or ensemble mean particularly when all of the input ensembles are considered to be equally likely to occur the companion of this study hughes et al 2020 described the hydrological models used to establish a basis for water resources assessments across the whole of the zambezi river basin outlined the model calibration approach and presented the results compared to the available observed stream flow data the stated purpose of establishing the models is to establish an approach that allows for future water resources availability under different scenarios of both development and climate change to be assessed the first part highlighted a number of uncertainties in the available data the models used and our understanding of the hydrological dynamics of the basin but concluded that the model setups particularly the pitman model have been established with sufficient confidence and are fit for the purpose of assessing future changes this paper therefore takes the next step and applies one of the established models pitman to evaluate the range of possible conditions that might occur into the future given up to date estimates of what that future might look like from both the perspective of the climate as well as expected water consumption 2 study area the zambezi catchment drains an area of 1 350 000 km2 crossing the borders of eight countries angola botswana malawi mozambique namibia tanzania zambia and zimbabwe in central southern africa beside the main river the system includes major tributaries such as the luangwa kafue chobe and shire rivers natural lakes such as lake malawi nyassa artificial reservoirs such as itezhi tezhi kafue kariba and cahora bassa and several wetlands luangwa and barotse floodplains lukanga swamps kafue flats fig 1 the rainy season is concentrated in the summer 4 6 months between october and march precipitation ranges from over 1 200 mm y 1 in some of the headwater areas of the shire and kafue sub basins to less than 700 mm y 1 in the more arid parts of zimbabwe hughes et al 2020 the main economic activities are represented by mining agriculture fisheries tourism and manufacturing the basin hosts a population of about 40 million zamcom et al 2015 with per capita water consumption estimated to be around 100 m3 yr 1 on average the most water intense sector is agriculture while small scale rainfed agriculture represents the main source of income in the majority of the basin the world bank 2010 estimated agricultural land in the basin to be about 5 2 million hectares with only about 0 25 million irrigated irrigation infrastructural development was identified as a priority and an additional 0 51 million hectares were already identified the hydropower potential of the basin was estimated to be about 20 gw of which only about a quarter is currently exploited mainly in the cahora bassa kariba itezhi tezhi and kafue gorge dams in zambia and mozambique about 40 additional possible installations summing up to about 13 gw of installed capacity have been already identified in the basin some of these projects are currently under construction within the southern african power pool sapp development programme several water transfer projects have also been planned for the basin world bank 2010 3 methods and data the companion paper to this contribution provides a brief description of the hydrological models that have been calibrated for the zambezi river basin pitman and weap for the future projections only the pitman model is used to simulate a number of future scenarios table 1 the first group of scenarios s1 s1a and s1b in table 1 are based on the historical climate information and use revised estimates of present day water use as well as uncertain estimates of future water use the other three sets of scenarios are based on future estimates of climate conditions using 6 downscaled rcm outputs to represent projected conditions for the zambezi basin under 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 average global temperature increases s2 s3 and s4 respectively in table 1 3 1 climate data preparation from rcm s climate scenarios for the analysis were derived from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project giorgi et al 2009 downscaled regional climate models rcms outputs the overall cordex project goal was to dynamically downscale the results of global circulation models gcms participating in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 to produce high resolution historical and future projected data able to more accurately reproduce the regional and continental climate dynamics the reason to prefer a dynamic downscaling methodology instead of a statistical one is related to the ability of a rcm to better reproduce the peculiarities of a regional setting respect to a statistical methodology relying on ground observations very scarce for the area under consideration in addition dynamical downscaling methodologies have been proved to be able to more accurately maintain the range of variability of the original gcm respect to the statistical ones ito et al 2020 the cordex africa project made use of 5 different rcms downscaling the results of 10 gcms for a total of 23 combinations out of the 23 datasets available in this analysis we selected a set of 6 different modeling outputs table 2 derived from the combination of 3 rcms clmcom cclm4 8 17 gerics remo and smhi rca4 and 5 gcms cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es mpi esm lr miroc5 and ipsl cm5a mr the model outputs were selected to cover the largest variability of the climate conditions and to include the largest range of uncertainty spanned by the rcms for the region under consideration when selecting the models our attention focused particularly on the comparison of the historical precipitation seasonal means and intensities with respect to the observed data as made available by two recent studies dosio et al 2019 2020 original data for the 6 selected combinations were made available at a spatial resolution of 0 44 degree 48 km at the equator at daily time steps from the earth system grid federation esgf climate projections from different models reach different global average temperature levels in different times due to the specific gcm s characteristics in this analysis we decided to focus on climate scenarios compatible with the paris agreement unfccc 2015 and 2016 in the 2015 conference the state parties committed to keep global temperature increase below 2 c with more emphasis on an even more ambitious 1 5 c target therefore we selected these two thresholds and an additional scenario 3 c representing the possible failure of the implementation of the agreement in order to represent the 1 5 2 and 3 c scenarios we selected the 30 years data centered in the year in which the specific model table 2 in its rcp 8 5 scenario reaches the warming threshold selected as reported in dosio and fischer 2018 and farinosi et al 2020 it has to be noted that the 1 5 2 and 3 c global average warming scenarios might result in different levels of local temperature changes in different parts of the world 3 2 climate data pre processing for rainfall inputs to the model hughes et al 2014 refer to a previous approach to incorporating climate change rainfall uncertainties into a hydrological model using rainfall data for nine statistically downscaled gcms for baseline 1961 2000 near future 2046 2065 and far future 2081 2100 periods given that the nine baseline rainfall simulations were very different from the available historical data a bias correction approach was applied to generate corrected future rainfall time series used to re run 9 times a model previously calibrated using historical rainfall data hughes et al 2014 referred to a number of possible problems with this approach and proposed an approach that uses a pre processing routine to quantify the uncertainties in the changes between the baseline and future rainfall patterns across all of the climate models and generate stochastic rainfall ensembles used to force an uncertainty version of the hydrological model the pre processing program used in this study calculates the annual means and standard deviations for the baseline and three future 30 years representative of 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 temperature increases periods for each climate model the delta change as fractions in annual means δmi and standard deviations δsdi are then calculated for each rcm i and their ranges determined across all available rcms δmmin to δmmax and δsdmin to δsdmax the mean calendar month fractions of the annual total and their delta changes between the baseline and three futures are also calculated for each period and climate model combination to generate similar minimum and maximum ranges across the rcms uniform distribution random samples from these ranges are used to generate delta change values which are applied to the historical rainfall time series used for the original calibration of the model cru data for 1901 2017 to generate 250 stochastic rainfall ensembles the full set of algorithms for the approach are given in the appendix the random numbers used for the delta change samples of annual mean annual standard deviation and monthly fractions are independent of each other but each sample value is applied to the whole time series of a single ensemble the final part of the algorithm re calculates the monthly rainfalls in any one year to make sure that the annual value is correct after the monthly fraction delta changes are applied which may not necessarily add up to 1 the same random number sample value is applied to all of the sub basins within a single ensemble to ensure that the whole basin is represented by a single possible climate change signal however it is important to note that regional differences in delta change signals e g some areas expected to become wetter or drier than other areas under the same climate change scenario will be preserved because the sampling is based on the delta change ranges for each individual sub basin the key issue is that changes in the annual means and standard deviations are considered to be independent across the rcms as are the seasonal distributions of rainfall because the delta changes are applied to the original historical rainfall data cru in this study the method also assumes that the historical sequences of wet and dry periods will be more or less preserved into the future and this was previously identified as being reasonably valid for south africa hughes et al 2014 a preliminary analysis of the data for the 6 climate models did not reveal any systematic relationships between the changes in annual means and seasonal distributions supporting the use of independent sampling from the different delta changes it is also important to note that any inter annual variations in seasonal distribution related inter alia to variations in the movement of the itcz present in the historical rainfall data will be largely preserved using the method applied 3 3 climate data pre processing for evapotranspiration inputs to the model the evapotranspiration data the main climate input to the pitman model together with precipitation were estimated using the lisvap pre processor burek et al 2013 lisvap is the module of the distributed hydrological model lisflood used to estimate potential evapotranspiration et0 and the potential soil es0 and open water ew0 evaporation the potential et values are computed applying the penman monteith p m equation and theoretically estimated considering a hypothetical reference short crop with approximate height of 0 12 m with unlimited availability of water as in allen et al 1998 in order to estimate the et0 both for historical and projected climate data the p m method uses daily values of several variables minimum and maximum near surface temperature near surface specific humidity surface air pressure surface downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation and near surface wind speed as showed in recent studies naumann et al 2018 and dewes et al 2017 the p m method provides the most accurate estimates of potential evapotranspiration for the climate projections similarly to the process adopted for the precipitation estimates projected et0 from the 6 rcm s for each of the 30 year ranges associated with the three warming levels selected were compared to the historical portion of the rcm itself to estimate the delta changes delta change is calculated using the mean and standard deviation for each rcm analyzing both annual totals and monthly distributions the delta changes were then applied to the historical et data used for the original model calibration hughes et al 2020 consistent with the hydrological model requirements the final input to the hydrological model is a range of uncertainty minimum and maximum values in the annual potential evapotranspiration value for each warming level while the seasonal distributions used for the scenarios remained the same as the historical data the analysis of the rcm s did not suggest significant changes in the seasonal distributions it is important to note that when the model runs through the ensembles the uncertainty range is randomly sampled see later section on running the model however it would not be correct to allow the random sampling to occur independently across all of the sub basins as this would mean that any single ensemble would have a wide mixture of possible et0 change signals therefore all sub basin et0 samples are drawn from the same part of the delta change range within any single ensemble 3 4 estimating present day and future water use the initial calibration of the model hughes et al 2020 did not take into account all of the present day water uses largely because the calibrations were based on historical observed stream flow data that may not reflect current levels of water use there is very little information available to directly quantify water uses and this is one of the typical data scarcity problems that is prevalent throughout southern africa when estimating water uses we have to identify how much water is used what the water is used for in order to estimate the seasonal distributions of use as well as the source of the water large dams small distributed dams direct river abstractions or groundwater the dominant consumptive water use i e excluding hydro power is expected to be for irrigation from distributed small to medium sized reservoirs about 5 106 m3 maximum storage as well as a few larger dams mostly within the zimbabwean sub basins the areas under irrigation are quantified by intersecting a raster coverage ifpri 2019 100 km2 grid size of irrigated areas with the polygon coverage of sub basins to extract the total number of hectares per sub basin the same data source can be used to estimate the total area of rain fed agriculture the latter is expected to influence the downstream flow regimes through changes to runoff generation processes but these impacts are assumed to have existed for many years and would have been accounted for in the hydrological model calibration albeit implicitly rather than explicitly the estimated irrigation extents were then partially ground truthed by estimating the areas of obvious irrigation mostly by identifying centre pivot sites from google earth as well as using some local knowledge in parts of the luangwa river sub basins lawrence personal communication 2020 1 1 lawrence d 2020 personal communication from mr d lawrence of imagen consulting http www imagenconsulting net services html experienced in water resources assessments in zambia lawrence 2020 also provided some insight into the crop types that might be expected from which we could approximately estimate the seasonal distribution of water demands the methods used to estimate water use ignore any use for mining purposes which are known to exist in parts of zambia copper belt and zimbabwe unfortunately we have very little information on these water uses but they are not expected to very large relative to the total streamflow in the relevant sub basins the maximum surface area of reservoirs is based on a gis coverage of water bodies pekel et al 2016 gonzalez sanchez et al 2020 this coverage includes wetland areas as well as artificial storage and several processing steps were required to eliminate the former before the coverage could be intersected with the sub basin coverage to extract the total surface area of reservoirs and then estimate the total storage volume using assumed area volume power relationships hughes and mantel 2010 the parameters used in the area volume relationships are extremely uncertain in the absence of reservoir bathymetric surveys and this uncertainty can be very large for reservoirs with large surface areas fortunately there are independent sources of volume data for at least some of larger reservoirs notably the register of dams available from the fao aquastat database http www fao org aquastat en databases dams accessed during march 2020 such that these can be eliminated from the gis analysis and their volumes added back afterwards the results for the remaining dams will still be uncertain but there are no other known sources of information available to be able to use the total reservoir volumes in the hydrological model it is also necessary to quantify the proportion of the total sub basin area that contributes to these dams while in theory this could be done automatically using a dem and automatic delineation of catchment areas for each dam this is not a practical proposition as there are many thousands of small dams the proportions were therefore estimated subjectively by simply viewing the distribution of the dams together with the sub basin areal extents and the available river channel coverage inevitably the contributing proportion of the sub basin becomes a highly uncertain parameter in the hydrological model see next section for more details 3 5 running the model for climate and or water use scenarios there are several versions of the pitman model available within the spatsim framework the simplest is the single run version that was mainly used for the model calibration runs hughes et al 2020 the single run version uses fixed parameter values including annual potential evapotranspiration depth and a single input of rainfall time series data the other versions allow for uncertainty in the parameter inputs using minimum and maximum values to define uniform distributions which are sampled during the ensemble model runs for scenario 1b table 1 only the water use parameters are considered uncertain and the model generates 10 000 ensembles using independent random sampling of the range of future water use parameters for scenario 2 1a only 250 ensembles are generated and these are based on random sampling from the ensemble of stochastic rainfall inputs explained above with no additional parameter uncertainty all of the 2b scenarios i e changes to rainfall evapotranspiration demand and water use are based on a combination of 250 rainfall input samples plus 200 samples from the parameters that are considered uncertain annual potential evapotranspiration and future water demands therefore generating 50 000 ensembles a post processing utility is used to extract the minimum maximum and 95 50 and 5 exceeded values for each month of the time series across all of the ensemble sets the main purpose of this utility is to generate data that can be used to plot the ensemble bounds for any given scenario the utility is normally used to extract the simulated cumulative flow at the outlet of any sub basin however it can also be used to examine the uncertainty bounds of sub basin incremental flow or the storage volume of a reservoir or wetland for those sub basins where they exist 4 water use scenarios present day and future during the calibration phase of the project some poorly defined existing water uses were largely ignored as they were not considered likely to affect the overall calibration or were expected to have occurred more recently than most of the historical observed stream flow data that formed the basis of the calibration however it is important to include these in the present day scenario s1a in table 1 even if they remain poorly quantified table 3 summarises the estimates of irrigation water use based on the gis analysis of assumed irrigation areas ifpri 2019 and a fixed demand of 750 mm y 1 this value was based on some local knowledge of irrigation practices in parts of zambia lawrence 2020 while it might be expected that some of the drier parts of the basin e g within zimbabwe will have higher demands table 4 lists the irrigation water demands for those sub basins where there is also evidence of supply from either distributed small reservoirs or from large reservoirs and includes the estimates of the reservoir full supply volumes the last two columns in table 4 provide an estimate of the sub basin contributing area as well as the mean annual inflow volume m3 106 y 1 based on the calibration simulations there are some cases where there is a reasonable match between the estimated inflow volumes the available storage and the demand e g map1 man1 and map3 while there are other cases where there appears to be far more water available than the demand e g lng10 lng8 and mam2 as well as others where the demand appears to exceed the estimated supply kaf9 table 5 provides a summary of the water uses that were included in the calibration phase as well as estimates for both the present day s1a and future s1b to s4b scenarios this table includes additional sub basins where there are water demands assumed to be supplied directly from the river as well as water demands for urban and mining supplies the following sub sections provide more information about the water uses and the information used to generate the estimates it has to be acknowledged that the majority of the estimates in all the water demand tables tables 3 5 are based on limited information uncertain analysis methods or subjective assessments of future demands the full details of how the future demands are likely to be met are not included in table 5 lack of space but the general assumption is that where reservoir storage is currently used this will increase in the future 4 1 luangwa river there is very little clear evidence of extensive cultivation or irrigation in the main eastern headwater areas lng1 to lng5 nor in the downstream sub basins lng7 and lng9 the present day demand table 4 for areas lng4 5 and 6 are based on the ifpri 2019 data and is expected to double in the future both lng8 and 10 have clearly identifiable irrigation areas as well as extensive dryland cultivation there is one large irrigation scheme upstream of mita hills reservoir lng10 that covers an area of greater than 1 500 km2 while estimates based on local knowledge lawrence pers comm 2020 broadly agree with the ifpri 2019 data that the area irrigated at any one time is less than 160 km2 it has been assumed that the area has almost reached full development partly due to competition with future hydropower requirements and will only expand to about 200 km2 within lng8 there is approximately 40 km2 of obvious irrigation centre pivots which is supported by a number of distributed small dams the demand is assumed to double into the future there are large reservoirs in both lng8 mulungushi dam with storage of 490 106 m3 and generating capacity of 32 mw and lng10 mita hills dam with storage of 680 106 m3 and generating capacity of 24 mw while a future new storage reservoir is planned within lng10 with additional storage of 450 106 m3 4 2 kafue river there are clear signs of irrigation and water use for mining assumed to be direct from the river in the headwater sub basins kaf11 1 2 and 3 above the lukangwa swamps and these are expected to increase into the future there is less evidence of cultivation in kaf4 and future water use in this sub basin is not expected to be significant there are large areas of cultivation in kaf5 around the borders of the lukangwa swamps and along the main river with some indication of irrigation similarly kaf6 and kaf7 have relatively small areas of irrigation there is some cultivation around itezhi tezhi reservoir within kaf8 as well as in the southern parts of the sub areas representing the kafue flats kaf9 but this appears to be mostly dryland farming there are two extensive areas of irrigation close to the main river and near the outlet of kaf9 just upstream of kafue gorge dam and close to lusaka the total area of irrigation for kaf9 is estimated by ifpri 2019 data to be about 132 km2 and is assumed to be supplied direct from the kafue river as well as from some reservoirs table 3 it has been assumed that the area will increase by about 50 a relatively low figure compared to assumptions in other sub basins largely due to the limited land space and competition with water for hydropower development the zambian capital lusaka lies on the catchment boundary between kaf9 and zam4 the kariba dam sub basin and according to the web site of the lusaka water and sewerage company http www lwsc com zm accessed in february 2020 some 36 106 m3 y 1 is abstracted at the iolanda water treatment plant just upstream of kafue gorge dam in kaf10 this translates into about 50 l head 1 d 1 for the current population of lusaka further information suggests that there is also some groundwater abstraction in the city itself clearly both of these are expected to grow substantially in the future 4 3 upper zambezi kariba and upstream and chobe river while there is evidence of quite extensive cultivation in the eastern headwater tributaries above the barotse floodplain notably within bar3 and bar4 there is no evidence of irrigation further downstream there is cultivation along the main river and some irrigation 12 km2 near the town of katima mulilo at the outlet of bar6 but this is very small relative to even the dry season flow in the zambezi at this point and is not expected to expand a great deal while there is a planned hydro power plant at ngonye falls bar5 this is a run of river scheme and is not expected to substantially influence the downstream flow regime there is no evidence of much cultivation or irrigation in the sub basins of the chobe river there is some irrigation in the tributary catchments of zam1 2 and 3 as well as direct abstractions from the river in zam1 for several towns there is also a proposed inter basin transfer scheme to supply water from the zambezi within zam2 to botswana at a rate of 495 106 m3 y 1 as well as a further transfer scheme to supply water for a new dam shangani dam on the gwayi river in zimbabwe to be operated mainly for hydro power it has proved to be very difficult to obtain reliable values for these planned transfers and only the botswana transfer has been included in the model at this stage 4 4 central basin tributaries some storage dams were allowed for in the calibration model for the gwayi river sub basins but due to lack of information no water use was included the expected water uses in gwa3 and gwa4 include those for agriculture mining and domestic supplies and the ifpri 2019 data are expected to under estimate the total demand certainly the available storage and inflow volume are far greater than the demand given in ifpri 2019 even if the 750 mm y 1 of irrigation demand is increased for this drier region mkandla et al 2005 provide some information about water supplies to bulawayo on the catchment boundary of gwa4 and the majority of the city supplies appear to come from surface water storage to the south in the limpopo river basin but they do refer to some groundwater usage 3 6 106 m3 y 1 from gwa4 gwa1 gwa2 and sng1 are not expected to experience significant water uses despite quite large areas of rain fed agriculture the senyati river sub system map1 to 4 has several large reservoirs e g claw dam with 21 106 m3 total storage and assumed to supply the kadoma district with water as well as a large number of distributed small reservoirs the total storage appears to be over 500 106 m3 but the water demand appears to be less than 200 106 m3 y 1 possibly reflecting the semi arid and variable nature of the flow regime the manyame river sub system includes three large dams within man3 and one in man2 the most upstream one lake chivero supplying harare with water there are also a large number of much smaller dams in all the sub basins with a combined storage of over 370 106 m3 y 1 the total current irrigation demand is estimated at some 200 106 m3 y 1 tables 4 and 5 while it is assumed that an additional 30 106 m3 y 1 is abstracted for urban water use a very uncertain value many of these demands are expected to increase in the future particularly those from the large dams in man3 to supply the city of harare the headwaters of the mazoe river in maz2 lie just to the east of harare and are intensively cultivated with many small to medium sized dams the headwaters of maz1 also appear to be similar but is perhaps less intensively cultivated as with the other zimbabwe sub basins future water demands are expected to increase and while the level of increase is very uncertain it is likely to be limited by the available resources given the current level of small dam development it is not expected that the reservoir storage capacity will be increased substantially in the future 4 5 lake malawi nyasa sub system there is extensive cultivation in many of the valleys of the headwater tributaries as well on the shores of the lake the ifpri 2019 data suggest that there is about 240 km2 of irrigation most of which occurs near the lake and can therefore be considered in the model as abstractions from the lake there is also a quite large area of irrigation in shr2 120 km2 lil1 contains malawi s capital city lilongwe population of approximately 1 1 million which is supplied by kamuzu dam total storage of about 24 106 m3 y 1 and a catchment area of 1 870 km2 the present day abstractions are based on 50 l head 1 d 1 and expected to increase in the future table 5 this information is based on data from lilongwe water board https www vei nl partners lwb accessed during march 2020 blantyre shr1 is supplied with water direct from the shire river current demand is estimated at about 16 5 106 m3 y 1 and is expected to at least double into the future 4 6 main zambezi river downstream of kariba and other tributaries there is some irrigation in the tributary areas of all the main zambezi river sub basins with the highest being in zam4 and assumed to be supplied by the available reservoir storage further downstream most of the irrigation appears to be along the river some allowance has also been made for direct abstractions for the city of tete population 310 000 from zam6 5 results the results for the different scenarios are mainly presented as flow duration curve comparisons at four key sites in the basin these sites are the inflows to itezhi tezhi and kariba dams kaf7 and zam2 flows downstream of cahora bassa at tete zam6 and flows at the outlet of lake malawi nyasa mal1 additional comparisons are made for some other sub basins where these illustrate specific issues relating to water management under future projected changes all of the future scenarios are compared with scenario 1 that represents the calibrated model outputs but with fixed operating rules for kariba and cahora bassa dams used to replace the historical time series of observed releases this is necessary because the observed releases do not extend throughout the total duration of the modelling period the dams did not exist in the earlier years 5 1 delta change ranges for rainfall fig 2 shows the frequency distributions across all of the sub basins for the annual means and standard deviations minimum and maximum values representing the ranges of delta change across the six climate models while fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the maximum and minimum delta change in mean annual rainfall the overall across all three warming scenarios spatial median for the annual mean minimum fractional delta maximum decrease in rainfall is approximately 0 13 while the equivalent value for the maximum increase is 0 03 the climate models therefore suggest a greater drying trend than a wetter trend in terms of the annual standard deviation the median decrease is 0 125 while the median increase is 0 325 suggesting a trend towards more variable annual rainfall fig 4 illustrates the changes using the mean delta change across the climate models with respect to their own baseline conditions for the three global warming scenarios and supports the data presented in fig 2 that suggests that the differences between the 1 5 to 2 0 scenarios are substantially less than the changes for the 3 scenario the spatial patterns suggest that there are more sub basins in the southern and western parts of the catchment with the highest rainfall reductions but lake malawi nyasa also shows quite high reductions if the climate model mean values are used 5 2 delta change ranges for potential evapotranspiration and temperature table 6 lists some statistics for the range of changes across the different climate models lowest to highest and across all of the sub basins mean standard deviation minimum and maximum fig 5 a and b provides some indications of the spatial variability of the temperature and potential evapotranspiration changes expected for the three global warming scenarios based on the climate model mean changes from their own baseline period fig 5a highlights how the temperature changes in the basin are relatively higher than the global warming scenarios considered both table 6 and fig 5b suggest that there is a relatively low degree of variation in terms of evapotranspiration demand in the changes across the sub basins although this increases for the 3 0 global warming scenario s4 2b similarly there are bigger overall differences between the 2 0 and 3 0 scenarios than between the 1 5 and 2 0 scenarios a result that could be clearly anticipated and is also reflected in the rainfall data there is no strong spatial pattern in the changes partly a consequence of the relatively low variability across the sub basins however it is interesting to note that the lowest changes for the 3 change occurs over the lake malawi nyasa sub basin mal1 as well the upper zambezi above the barotse wetland bar2 bar3 and bar7 most of the biggest changes occur in the lower sub basins of the luangwa and kafue basins as well as some of the lake malawi nyasa tributary sub basins this spatial pattern is repeated for all the global warming scenarios if we use the highest change estimates across the climate models but different patterns emerge when the lowest estimates across the climate models are used while these results reflect the results of the regional downscaling of the different climate models the overall impacts on the modelling results is expected to be relatively small due to the low variability across the different sub basins table 6 5 3 simulation results for scenarios 1a and 1b the total present day consumptive use referred to in table 5 amounts to a total of 1 532 106 m3 which is 78 less than the value given in zamcom 2019 but nevertheless the same order of magnitude relative to the total water resources availability the impact of including these revised estimates as part of the scenario using historical climate data s1a on the flow duration curves of the key stations kaf7 mal1 zam2 and zam6 is almost negligible even in those tributary basins where the water use appears to be quite high luangwa and the zimbabwean sub basins the largest impacts are generally no greater than a 5 reduction in mean monthly flow volume scenario 1b is based on uncertainty ranges of expected future water use and distributed dam volumes and catchment areas the lower values of the range are based on the values provided in table 5 column 3 while the upper ranges are variable depending on the degree of uncertainty in the future estimates it is acknowledged that most of the future estimates are uncertain but some e g lng10 are based on more information than others the total for the values given in table 5 is 3 330 106 m3 while the total for the upper range of uncertainty is 3 950 106 m3 representing increases of between 217 and 258 over the present day estimates even with the upper uncertainty estimates of water use there are very few differences between the flow duration curves at the four key sites the four zimbabwean basins gwa1 map1 man1 and maz1 show the largest impacts ranging from about a 90 reduction at maz1 to almost a 70 reduction at man1 for the upper uncertainty bound the overall conclusion is that the amount of estimated consumptive water use has relatively little impact on the total resources of the zambezi river 5 4 simulation results for scenarios 2 1 and 2 2 fig 6 shows the results for only the 1 5 temperature increase rainfall changes s2 1a for the selected sub basins and it is quite clear that the 95 exceeded impacts the worse case rainfall change ensemble are quite different throughout the basin the increased impacts noted in zam2 and zam6 compared to kaf7 are likely to be related to the larger rainfall reductions in the many of the headwater sub areas of the upper zambezi relative to the kafue headwaters figs 3 and 4 as well as the impacts of the combined effects of climate change on the barotse floodplain wetland upstream in bar5 the result for mal1 is very uncertain partly because the original model calibration of the dynamics of lake malawi nyasa was very uncertain hughes et al 2020 some of the model calibrations for the contributing sub areas were also quite uncertain at least some of the higher degree of change relative to the other sub basins might be attributed to the direct impacts of rainfall on the large surface area of the lake and the dominant role that this plays in the overall water balance however further analysis suggests that the total upstream inflow is also quite highly reduced in the driest ensembles attempts to attribute differences in flow reductions to the way in which the total runoff has been simulated did not reveal any clear patterns that might point to excessive reductions being linked to modelling artifacts however as might be expected some of the sub basins with high proportions of total runoff being simulated as surface runoff are linked to relatively higher stream flow reductions this is particularly true if the majority of the surface runoff is simulated as saturation excess rather than infiltration excess runoff in the former the effects of reduced rainfall are not only direct less rainfall to runoff but also indirect and related to reduced moisture storage and therefore generally lower proportions of saturation it is quite difficult to assess whether the rather drastic reduction in outflow from lake malawi nyasa and extended periods of no outflow under the most extreme rainfall reduction ensemble is a credible result or not the results are in broad agreement with those of kling et al 2015 but some of other literature on climate impacts on the lake outflows do not always agree with each other even in terms of the historical patterns of lake levels both lyons et al 2010 and kumambala and ervine 2010 used models to simulate the historical patterns of lake levels and both refer to earlier papers covering a similar subject however they disagree quite substantially about the key water balance components of the basin and lake system suggesting that it is difficult to use their results to check our own simulations the cru rainfall data used in this study suggest that the historical rainfall for the lake sub basin is some 1 202 mm y 1 with the evaporation being 1 527 mm y 1 a net loss of 325 mm y 1 kumambala and ervine 2010 suggest that the mean annual rainfall is actually at least 1 350 mm y 1 and evaporation about 1 610 mm y 1 a net loss of 260 mm y 1 further calder et al 1995 noted that changes in rainfall can explain historical patterns of change in lake levels better than any other effects but their analysis did not include any of the quite large changes in evaporation associated with a warming climate we could not achieve a satisfactory calibration relative to observed outflow patterns in our model if we scaled our input data to give a net evaporative loss of 260 mm y 1 over the lake the 50 exceeded median ensemble has been included in fig 6 for the lake malawi nyasa outflows mal1 to illustrate that there is a substantial degree of non linearity in the stream flow reductions compared to the rainfall reductions which are based on uniform sampling fig 7 suggests that the inclusion of evaporation effects s2 2b for a 1 5 temperature change does not make a huge difference to the results at kaf7 and zam2 but does quite substantially reduce the moderate to high flows at zam6 as might be expected from the comments already made about lake malawi nyasa the impacts of the drier ensembles 50 exceeded or greater on mal1 are extremely large with zero outflows for 100 of the time in the 95 exceeded ensemble these results clearly reflect the increased impacts of evaporative losses downstream of large open water bodies reservoirs and wetlands 5 5 simulation results for scenario 3 2b fig 8 illustrates that the differences between s2 2b and s2 3b are not very large for most of the sub basins although the frequency of zero outflows for lake malawi nyasa increases quite substantially this is associated with the relatively small differences between the delta change values for these two scenarios while the differences in evaporation demand are also not very large when taking into account the uncertainty range as well as the variations across the sub basins 5 6 simulation results for scenario 4 2b fig 9 shows that the full complement of climate and water use change signals for a 3 0 temperature increase suggest a much greater degree of change for all of the sub basins but especially for the downstream parts of the main zambezi river zam6 and for lake malawi nyasa mal1 the results for zam6 are likely to be quite strongly affected by the operating rules of kariba and cahora bassa dams no attempts have been made to optimize these for different climate scenarios and they have remained fixed for all of the model runs from scenario 1 onwards see next section for lake malawi nyasa even the 5 exceeded scenario suggests that their will only be flow out of the lake into the shire river for some 40 of the time to further examine the validity of this results the mean annual water balance of lake malawi nyasa for the three main climate scenarios s2 2b s32 b and s4 2b can be compared to the s1 scenario the net evaporation from the lake rainfall evaporation for scenario 1b is some 325 mm which is balanced in the same scenario by about 760 mm of inflow the net evaporation loss increases to a maximum i e the lowest rainfall and highest evaporation estimates for each scenario of 597 613 and 746 mm for scenarios 2 2b 3 2b and 4 2b respectively given that the inflows progressively reduce through the three scenarios to less than 460 mm for the overall driest situation the graphs in figs 7d 8 d and 9 d are not at all surprising 5 7 simulation results for kariba dam fig 10 shows the exceedance frequency distribution of kariba dam storage volumes expressed as a of full storage capacity for the three main temperature change and future water use scenarios s2 2b s3 2b and s4 2b compared to the baseline scenario s1 the 65 level represents the approximate level below which hydro power generation is no longer possible while the hydro power release rule column to the right of the graph shows the rules that have been implemented in all of the model runs these rules were roughly based on the historical record of hydro power releases that were used during the model calibration run however no attempt has been made to optimize them for any particular inflow regime they are therefore only used to illustrate the likely differences in releases and by implication power generation between scenarios the text box at the bottom of fig 10 summarises the average release for each scenario relative to the full release capacity the lower and upper values for the three change scenarios represent the 95 and 5 exceedance values the 5 exceedance values show either slightly increased or very similar releases relative to s1 while the worst case situation for the three scenarios show decreases of 12 17 and 40 for the 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 temperature changes respectively no attempt has been made in this study to convert the release changes into actual power production as the focus here is mainly on the water resources changes part of the complexity of the relationships between this diagram and the kariba inflow changes at zam2 figs 7d 8 d and 9 d are related to the fact that the modelled operating rules for kariba dam also include flood releases dominantly at storage volumes of 90 and higher and their patterns of variability will also change across the various scenarios 5 8 changes in some headwater sub basins table 7 compares the mean annual runoff volumes for scenario 1 with the other scenarios for selected headwater sub basins with different aridity indices mean annual potential evapotranspiration divided by mean annual rainfall using the median of the ensemble output results the results are inevitably quite mixed partly because each sub basin has a different range of rainfall and evapotranspiration delta changes as well as water use changes the original idea behind this comparison was to try and identify if different degrees of aridity and or proportions of the three main runoff components in the calibrated model would influence the degree of change for example it might be expected that sub basins dominated by saturated area surface runoff could experience greater impacts due to the combined effects of reduced rainfall less runoff and increased evapotranspiration reduced moisture storage however there are too many other variables involved to reach any conclusions about these issues most of the differences can be explained by the range of rainfall delta changes across the three scenarios for example for ruh2 the upper values of the delta changes are positive and quite large for all three scenarios 0 18 0 19 and 0 17 while for ruk2 they are weakly positive for s2 2b 0 11 and s3 2b 0 03 but negative for s4 2b 0 02 5 9 discussion perhaps one of the key questions for discussion is the extent to which the future changes are partly artefacts of the hydrological model setup and whether the climate change signals from the rcms are being propagated appropriately through the model in most senses it is reasonable to assume that this is not the case because the model has adequately simulated the runoff responses to quite a high degree of variability both seasonally and inter annually in the historical record however given the high degree of uncertainty in our understanding of the dynamics of the large wetland systems notably lake malawi nyasa as well as the methods used to represent them in the model we cannot entirely reject the possibility that some of the extreme changes that have been simulated are not at least partly modelling artefacts kumambala and ervine 2010 predicted drops in lake levels using hadcm3 climate data but do not predict zero outflows however their future climate inputs are quite different to those used in the present study and include higher rainfalls and quite modest increases in evaporation demand the relatively simple water balance check that was included within the results section suggest that the loss of downstream outflow from lake malawi nyasa is inevitable given the climate change signals used in this paper and are certainly not a modelling artefact a related issue is associated with the fact that none of the hydrological parameters were changed from the historical calibrations to the climate scenario runs while this may not be strictly the correct approach to adopt we currently have little understanding or scientific basis for determining which parameters to change and by how much we could have speculated about changes in such as infiltration rooting depth or vegetation cover regimes and introduced uncertainty ranges into the relevant parameters as part of the future scenario ensemble runs but these changes would not have been based on any real knowledge or full understanding such changes can be made to the model in the future if and when there is greater evidence for quantifying the changes it has already been noted that there are quite large discrepancies between our own uncertain estimates of future water use and those that are contained in previous reports zamcom 2019 refers to a more than threefold increase in consumptive water use as well as total current use that is some 26 higher than our own estimates kling et al 2014 using figures based on a world bank study refer to current use that is 73 higher than our values as well as moderate and high development options that are some 2 4 and 7 6 times their current use estimates respectively however on the one hand the sources of these other estimates are not fully explained while on the other hand even a much greater increase in water use would have relatively small impacts compared to the effects of the lower bound estimates of the climate change signals despite this observation it is acknowledged that our own analysis of water consumption patterns and change is based on weak information and should certainly be improved for future model runs however we have accounted for some of the constraints on development such as competing users irrigation and hydro power in lng8 and 10 for example as well as competition for land resources between commercial irrigation and community rain fed agriculture both issues noted as important by lawrence 2020 there are also quite large tracts of land within some sub basins of inter alia the luangwa kafue and chobe river sub systems that are occupied by national parks that are considered here unlikely to experience substantial development impacts some of the smaller water uses e g rural water supplies have been largely ignored as likely to have very small impacts on the main points of interest within the basin however these could have significant impacts at a more local scale particularly in the more arid parts of the basin while small scale but extensive use of groundwater could impact on the low flow regimes of some of the tributary sub basins unfortunately the necessary data are not currently available and therefore were not included the results show very clearly that the major source of uncertainty for the future lies in the projections of future climate conditions and these are heavily dependent upon all the many assumptions that are built into the gcms rcms as well as the associated downscaling approaches these are issues that hydrological modellers have little control over and we have to accept that our climate modelling colleagues generate the best information that they can hargreaves and annan 2014 the validity of the simulated stream flow changes is therefore very dependent upon the validity or appropriateness of the climate change signals used to force the model given that the model responds correctly to the changed climate signals the previous discussion paragraphs have partly addressed this issue but it is also interesting to look quite broadly at the runoff drivers in this basin there is a quite strong relationship between the aridity index mean annual values of potential evapotranspiration divide by precipitation and the runoff ratio for the headwater sub basins r2 0 65 if the aridity index values for the wetter and drier bounds of the three warming scenarios are re calculated the wetter bounds for all three scenarios show slight decreases or increases in aridity however the drier bounds i e largest decreases in rainfall and largest increases in et0 show increases in aridity of 124 130 and 147 averaged across all sub basins for the three scenarios respectively thus the combined effects of reduced rainfall and reduced runoff ratio will certainly account for the results illustrated in figs 7d 8 d and 9 d particularly when the effects of increased evaporation losses from the open water bodies reservoirs lake malawi nyasa and the wetlands during the wet season are also taken into consideration kling et al 2014 used two climate models cnrm and mpi and two temperature change scenarios 1 7 and 4 8 and assessed the impacts upstream of tete zam6 in our model using the cnrm data produced higher flows for both futures while with mri the warmer temperature future produced results that were somewhat lower than the 5 exceeded line given in fig 9c while kling et al 2014 do not provide very much detail of the climate change data used their climate sensitivity scenario is based on changes of 10 rainfall and temperature increases of 2 and 4 based on the changes in reservoir evaporation reported in the paper the temperature changes translate into evaporation demand increases of between 4 and 8 figs 2 5 of this paper indicate that the possible decreases in rainfall and increases in et0 used in this study are far greater for the 3 warming scenario the difference in the projections of future water availability between their study and ours are therefore not at all surprising comparisons with the results given by beck and bernauer 2011 are quite difficult as they lump together the impacts of development and climate change and have based their future simulations on very different assumptions from those used in this paper the values that they give for development changes suggest a 16 times increase in consumptive water use excluding evaporation from hydro power dams this increase is clearly far greater than any changes that we have accounted for and will clearly dominate the future values in at least some parts of the basin it is perhaps not surprising that their worst case scenario predicts zero minimum flows at victoria falls zam2 for all but 2 months of the wet season it is similarly difficult to compare our results with those presented by spalding fecher et al 2017 because their results are confined to changes in power generation however for some of their drier scenarios they suggest that the average annual power availability at kariba could drop to some 25 of maximum generation capacity which is similar to our worst case situation under scenario 4 2b fig 10 from a water management perspective the bands of future uncertainty probably remain too wide in some parts of the basin for effective decision making and this further emphasizes the need to narrow the gap between the projections of the future climate forcing data this contribution has not examined the sustainability of projected future water demands in any detail apart from noting some possible changes in the power output of kariba dam in fig 10 largely because this was out of the scope of this study however the model setup can be used for this purpose by simply looking at how frequently the projected demands are met under different change scenarios 6 conclusions hughes et al 2020 and this study have attempted to demonstrate that the established pitman model is fit for purpose in terms of simulating historical and future water resources availability it is acknowledged that the model contains uncertainties as will all models based on imperfect forcing data with imperfect structures and imperfect observational data with which to calibrate and validate the model the papers have therefore also attempted to identify the key uncertainties and their likely impacts on the practical value of the model setup and so that future studies can be focused on reducing these uncertainties however we believe that the main uncertainties do not invalidate the overall message of possible water resources change that is conveyed by the model results it is always difficult to make comparisons with previous studies of climate and development change partly because the science of climate change assessment is highly dynamic and partly because previous papers do not always contain the full details of the climate or development change signals used we have provided quite a lot of details of the estimates of present day and future consumptive water use in this paper but the results tend to be very low notably for the future compared to previous studies beck and bernauer 2011 kling et al 2011 zamcom 2019 while relatively moderate increases in the upper values of assumed water use are unlikely to have substantial effects on the main results if the values used by beck and bernauer 2011 are really appropriate then the results will be quite different these estimates therefore remain a substantial source of uncertainty in our results one of the key conclusions is that the future simulation results are hugely dependent upon the source of the climate change data and the change signals that are given by them the sample rcm data 6 models used in this study were selected from recently available information to be representative of many more model outputs that are currently available the spread of climate change signals across these different models remains quite large and that spread is translated into the future uncertainties illustrated in the main results diagrams of this paper figs 6 10 the key points selected kaf7 zam2 zam6 and mal1 illustrate that the relative impacts can be quite different across the whole zambezi river basin the greatest impacts being in the lake malawi nyasa sub system in agreement with kling et al 2015 as well as other areas containing large open water bodies natural and man made that are very sensitive to the combined effects of increased aridity additional uncertainty might be related to the climate change projections experiment selected the dynamical downscaling methodology of the cmip5 climate projections used in this analysis cordex might be different from a statistical downscaling exercise of the same gcms outputs and both from the newly released cmip6 projections the quantification of the uncertainty derived by this might the focus of future research what of the future development and use of the model there remain many improvements that could be made to the model as well as several additional more detailed analyses it is hoped that hughes et al 2020 and this contribution as well as the availability of the existing model setup may inspire other interested individuals or groups within the region to pursue further investigations and add value to the model the paper concludes with a few suggestions for further work further assessment of the regional groundwater recharge patterns and refinement of this part of the model might also include the addition of groundwater abstraction as part of the water uses assessments of possible climate change consequences land cover etc and how these could affect the model parameter sets rather than simply fixing the parameters between the historical and future scenario runs integrating various rainfall databases to provide improved historical forcing data and overcome some of the potential problems with using the cru data further analysis of the available observed stream flow data where there are apparent anomalies hughes et al 2020 to extend the amount of model calibration data extending the application of the weap model to include the effects of development and climate change to provide further information that can be compared with the pitman model results developing a better understanding of the dynamics of water exchange between the large wetlands and river channels to improve the representation of wetlands in the model further detailed assessment of expected future water uses and their

8309,study region the zambezi river basin a transboundary basin supplying vital resources to vast human and environmental systems and subject to radical changes linked to climate and infrastructural development study focus application of a hydrological model pitman established for 76 sub basins covering the total basin area of about 1 350 000 km2 to assess the potential impacts of increasing water demand under global warming scenarios 1 5 2 and 3 degree new hydrological insights for the region the application of the calibrated model to the analysis of different combinations of climate change and water use showed that the relative impacts are quite different across the whole zambezi river basin the greatest impacts are found in the areas containing large open water bodies natural and man made that are very sensitive to the multiple effects of increased aridity the uncertainty in the future simulation results remains hugely dependent upon the source of the climate change data and the change signals given by them the sample rcm data 6 models used are representative of many more model outputs while the spread of possible climate change signals remains quite large however the main uncertainties do not invalidate the overall message of possible water resources change that is summarized in a substantial decrease in water availability under all the combined scenarios keywords zambezi river basin hydrological models climate change water use change model uncertainties 1 introduction the introduction to the first part of this study refers to the ultimate aim of hydrological models which is to improve the decision making capacity of water management authorities hughes et al 2020 one of the key issues for future water management is related to the likely impact of climate change on the natural water resources availability as well as on the economic activities that rely and utlilise these resources milly et al 2008 the other paper also emphasised the uncertainties inherent in establishing any hydrological model some of these uncertainties being related to the imperfections of the models themselves others to the accuracy and representativeness of the climate data used to force the models and yet others related to the availability and accuracy of the observed stream flow data that provide the calibration signals used to parameterize the model and validate the outputs in most large basins throughout the world the stream flow data often reflect non stationary impacts of water abstractions or modifications to the flow regime e g through storage and hydro power releases all of the uncertainties associated with the data used to force calibrate and validate a model are exacerbated in data scarce regions such as africa however the uncertainties associated with setting up a model to represent historical flow regimes can pale into insignificance compared to those associated with predicting what the future may look like giorgio et al 2009 hargreaves and annan 2014 wang et al 2015 the uncertainties related to the various emission scenarios general circulation models and their configuration the downscaling approaches used shamseddin and chaibi 2019 as well as future socio economic development considerations all have to be added to the model setup uncertainties there are many different ways in which the future uncertainties can be represented in a model study but the most common approach is to generate an ensemble of model outputs based on an ensemble of model inputs dosio et al 2019 this ensemble of inputs includes all the time series data representing future possible climate situations the uncertainty ranges in any of the model parameters erfanian et al 2016 that are considered likely to be affected as well as uncertainty ranges in the water use inputs storage volumes abstractions artificial releases etc however given the large number of possible model inputs particularly related to climate model simulations it is also necessary to establish an appropriate approach for defining the input ensemble lutz et al 2016 it is also necessary to decide how the output ensemble information should be presented to those who might use the information for decision making purposes it is not always easy to convey uncertain prediction results to an audience that is required to make decisions borgomeo et al 2018 greve et al 2018 however it is also not valid to simply present a multi model or ensemble mean particularly when all of the input ensembles are considered to be equally likely to occur the companion of this study hughes et al 2020 described the hydrological models used to establish a basis for water resources assessments across the whole of the zambezi river basin outlined the model calibration approach and presented the results compared to the available observed stream flow data the stated purpose of establishing the models is to establish an approach that allows for future water resources availability under different scenarios of both development and climate change to be assessed the first part highlighted a number of uncertainties in the available data the models used and our understanding of the hydrological dynamics of the basin but concluded that the model setups particularly the pitman model have been established with sufficient confidence and are fit for the purpose of assessing future changes this paper therefore takes the next step and applies one of the established models pitman to evaluate the range of possible conditions that might occur into the future given up to date estimates of what that future might look like from both the perspective of the climate as well as expected water consumption 2 study area the zambezi catchment drains an area of 1 350 000 km2 crossing the borders of eight countries angola botswana malawi mozambique namibia tanzania zambia and zimbabwe in central southern africa beside the main river the system includes major tributaries such as the luangwa kafue chobe and shire rivers natural lakes such as lake malawi nyassa artificial reservoirs such as itezhi tezhi kafue kariba and cahora bassa and several wetlands luangwa and barotse floodplains lukanga swamps kafue flats fig 1 the rainy season is concentrated in the summer 4 6 months between october and march precipitation ranges from over 1 200 mm y 1 in some of the headwater areas of the shire and kafue sub basins to less than 700 mm y 1 in the more arid parts of zimbabwe hughes et al 2020 the main economic activities are represented by mining agriculture fisheries tourism and manufacturing the basin hosts a population of about 40 million zamcom et al 2015 with per capita water consumption estimated to be around 100 m3 yr 1 on average the most water intense sector is agriculture while small scale rainfed agriculture represents the main source of income in the majority of the basin the world bank 2010 estimated agricultural land in the basin to be about 5 2 million hectares with only about 0 25 million irrigated irrigation infrastructural development was identified as a priority and an additional 0 51 million hectares were already identified the hydropower potential of the basin was estimated to be about 20 gw of which only about a quarter is currently exploited mainly in the cahora bassa kariba itezhi tezhi and kafue gorge dams in zambia and mozambique about 40 additional possible installations summing up to about 13 gw of installed capacity have been already identified in the basin some of these projects are currently under construction within the southern african power pool sapp development programme several water transfer projects have also been planned for the basin world bank 2010 3 methods and data the companion paper to this contribution provides a brief description of the hydrological models that have been calibrated for the zambezi river basin pitman and weap for the future projections only the pitman model is used to simulate a number of future scenarios table 1 the first group of scenarios s1 s1a and s1b in table 1 are based on the historical climate information and use revised estimates of present day water use as well as uncertain estimates of future water use the other three sets of scenarios are based on future estimates of climate conditions using 6 downscaled rcm outputs to represent projected conditions for the zambezi basin under 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 average global temperature increases s2 s3 and s4 respectively in table 1 3 1 climate data preparation from rcm s climate scenarios for the analysis were derived from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project giorgi et al 2009 downscaled regional climate models rcms outputs the overall cordex project goal was to dynamically downscale the results of global circulation models gcms participating in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 to produce high resolution historical and future projected data able to more accurately reproduce the regional and continental climate dynamics the reason to prefer a dynamic downscaling methodology instead of a statistical one is related to the ability of a rcm to better reproduce the peculiarities of a regional setting respect to a statistical methodology relying on ground observations very scarce for the area under consideration in addition dynamical downscaling methodologies have been proved to be able to more accurately maintain the range of variability of the original gcm respect to the statistical ones ito et al 2020 the cordex africa project made use of 5 different rcms downscaling the results of 10 gcms for a total of 23 combinations out of the 23 datasets available in this analysis we selected a set of 6 different modeling outputs table 2 derived from the combination of 3 rcms clmcom cclm4 8 17 gerics remo and smhi rca4 and 5 gcms cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es mpi esm lr miroc5 and ipsl cm5a mr the model outputs were selected to cover the largest variability of the climate conditions and to include the largest range of uncertainty spanned by the rcms for the region under consideration when selecting the models our attention focused particularly on the comparison of the historical precipitation seasonal means and intensities with respect to the observed data as made available by two recent studies dosio et al 2019 2020 original data for the 6 selected combinations were made available at a spatial resolution of 0 44 degree 48 km at the equator at daily time steps from the earth system grid federation esgf climate projections from different models reach different global average temperature levels in different times due to the specific gcm s characteristics in this analysis we decided to focus on climate scenarios compatible with the paris agreement unfccc 2015 and 2016 in the 2015 conference the state parties committed to keep global temperature increase below 2 c with more emphasis on an even more ambitious 1 5 c target therefore we selected these two thresholds and an additional scenario 3 c representing the possible failure of the implementation of the agreement in order to represent the 1 5 2 and 3 c scenarios we selected the 30 years data centered in the year in which the specific model table 2 in its rcp 8 5 scenario reaches the warming threshold selected as reported in dosio and fischer 2018 and farinosi et al 2020 it has to be noted that the 1 5 2 and 3 c global average warming scenarios might result in different levels of local temperature changes in different parts of the world 3 2 climate data pre processing for rainfall inputs to the model hughes et al 2014 refer to a previous approach to incorporating climate change rainfall uncertainties into a hydrological model using rainfall data for nine statistically downscaled gcms for baseline 1961 2000 near future 2046 2065 and far future 2081 2100 periods given that the nine baseline rainfall simulations were very different from the available historical data a bias correction approach was applied to generate corrected future rainfall time series used to re run 9 times a model previously calibrated using historical rainfall data hughes et al 2014 referred to a number of possible problems with this approach and proposed an approach that uses a pre processing routine to quantify the uncertainties in the changes between the baseline and future rainfall patterns across all of the climate models and generate stochastic rainfall ensembles used to force an uncertainty version of the hydrological model the pre processing program used in this study calculates the annual means and standard deviations for the baseline and three future 30 years representative of 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 temperature increases periods for each climate model the delta change as fractions in annual means δmi and standard deviations δsdi are then calculated for each rcm i and their ranges determined across all available rcms δmmin to δmmax and δsdmin to δsdmax the mean calendar month fractions of the annual total and their delta changes between the baseline and three futures are also calculated for each period and climate model combination to generate similar minimum and maximum ranges across the rcms uniform distribution random samples from these ranges are used to generate delta change values which are applied to the historical rainfall time series used for the original calibration of the model cru data for 1901 2017 to generate 250 stochastic rainfall ensembles the full set of algorithms for the approach are given in the appendix the random numbers used for the delta change samples of annual mean annual standard deviation and monthly fractions are independent of each other but each sample value is applied to the whole time series of a single ensemble the final part of the algorithm re calculates the monthly rainfalls in any one year to make sure that the annual value is correct after the monthly fraction delta changes are applied which may not necessarily add up to 1 the same random number sample value is applied to all of the sub basins within a single ensemble to ensure that the whole basin is represented by a single possible climate change signal however it is important to note that regional differences in delta change signals e g some areas expected to become wetter or drier than other areas under the same climate change scenario will be preserved because the sampling is based on the delta change ranges for each individual sub basin the key issue is that changes in the annual means and standard deviations are considered to be independent across the rcms as are the seasonal distributions of rainfall because the delta changes are applied to the original historical rainfall data cru in this study the method also assumes that the historical sequences of wet and dry periods will be more or less preserved into the future and this was previously identified as being reasonably valid for south africa hughes et al 2014 a preliminary analysis of the data for the 6 climate models did not reveal any systematic relationships between the changes in annual means and seasonal distributions supporting the use of independent sampling from the different delta changes it is also important to note that any inter annual variations in seasonal distribution related inter alia to variations in the movement of the itcz present in the historical rainfall data will be largely preserved using the method applied 3 3 climate data pre processing for evapotranspiration inputs to the model the evapotranspiration data the main climate input to the pitman model together with precipitation were estimated using the lisvap pre processor burek et al 2013 lisvap is the module of the distributed hydrological model lisflood used to estimate potential evapotranspiration et0 and the potential soil es0 and open water ew0 evaporation the potential et values are computed applying the penman monteith p m equation and theoretically estimated considering a hypothetical reference short crop with approximate height of 0 12 m with unlimited availability of water as in allen et al 1998 in order to estimate the et0 both for historical and projected climate data the p m method uses daily values of several variables minimum and maximum near surface temperature near surface specific humidity surface air pressure surface downwelling and upwelling shortwave and longwave radiation and near surface wind speed as showed in recent studies naumann et al 2018 and dewes et al 2017 the p m method provides the most accurate estimates of potential evapotranspiration for the climate projections similarly to the process adopted for the precipitation estimates projected et0 from the 6 rcm s for each of the 30 year ranges associated with the three warming levels selected were compared to the historical portion of the rcm itself to estimate the delta changes delta change is calculated using the mean and standard deviation for each rcm analyzing both annual totals and monthly distributions the delta changes were then applied to the historical et data used for the original model calibration hughes et al 2020 consistent with the hydrological model requirements the final input to the hydrological model is a range of uncertainty minimum and maximum values in the annual potential evapotranspiration value for each warming level while the seasonal distributions used for the scenarios remained the same as the historical data the analysis of the rcm s did not suggest significant changes in the seasonal distributions it is important to note that when the model runs through the ensembles the uncertainty range is randomly sampled see later section on running the model however it would not be correct to allow the random sampling to occur independently across all of the sub basins as this would mean that any single ensemble would have a wide mixture of possible et0 change signals therefore all sub basin et0 samples are drawn from the same part of the delta change range within any single ensemble 3 4 estimating present day and future water use the initial calibration of the model hughes et al 2020 did not take into account all of the present day water uses largely because the calibrations were based on historical observed stream flow data that may not reflect current levels of water use there is very little information available to directly quantify water uses and this is one of the typical data scarcity problems that is prevalent throughout southern africa when estimating water uses we have to identify how much water is used what the water is used for in order to estimate the seasonal distributions of use as well as the source of the water large dams small distributed dams direct river abstractions or groundwater the dominant consumptive water use i e excluding hydro power is expected to be for irrigation from distributed small to medium sized reservoirs about 5 106 m3 maximum storage as well as a few larger dams mostly within the zimbabwean sub basins the areas under irrigation are quantified by intersecting a raster coverage ifpri 2019 100 km2 grid size of irrigated areas with the polygon coverage of sub basins to extract the total number of hectares per sub basin the same data source can be used to estimate the total area of rain fed agriculture the latter is expected to influence the downstream flow regimes through changes to runoff generation processes but these impacts are assumed to have existed for many years and would have been accounted for in the hydrological model calibration albeit implicitly rather than explicitly the estimated irrigation extents were then partially ground truthed by estimating the areas of obvious irrigation mostly by identifying centre pivot sites from google earth as well as using some local knowledge in parts of the luangwa river sub basins lawrence personal communication 2020 1 1 lawrence d 2020 personal communication from mr d lawrence of imagen consulting http www imagenconsulting net services html experienced in water resources assessments in zambia lawrence 2020 also provided some insight into the crop types that might be expected from which we could approximately estimate the seasonal distribution of water demands the methods used to estimate water use ignore any use for mining purposes which are known to exist in parts of zambia copper belt and zimbabwe unfortunately we have very little information on these water uses but they are not expected to very large relative to the total streamflow in the relevant sub basins the maximum surface area of reservoirs is based on a gis coverage of water bodies pekel et al 2016 gonzalez sanchez et al 2020 this coverage includes wetland areas as well as artificial storage and several processing steps were required to eliminate the former before the coverage could be intersected with the sub basin coverage to extract the total surface area of reservoirs and then estimate the total storage volume using assumed area volume power relationships hughes and mantel 2010 the parameters used in the area volume relationships are extremely uncertain in the absence of reservoir bathymetric surveys and this uncertainty can be very large for reservoirs with large surface areas fortunately there are independent sources of volume data for at least some of larger reservoirs notably the register of dams available from the fao aquastat database http www fao org aquastat en databases dams accessed during march 2020 such that these can be eliminated from the gis analysis and their volumes added back afterwards the results for the remaining dams will still be uncertain but there are no other known sources of information available to be able to use the total reservoir volumes in the hydrological model it is also necessary to quantify the proportion of the total sub basin area that contributes to these dams while in theory this could be done automatically using a dem and automatic delineation of catchment areas for each dam this is not a practical proposition as there are many thousands of small dams the proportions were therefore estimated subjectively by simply viewing the distribution of the dams together with the sub basin areal extents and the available river channel coverage inevitably the contributing proportion of the sub basin becomes a highly uncertain parameter in the hydrological model see next section for more details 3 5 running the model for climate and or water use scenarios there are several versions of the pitman model available within the spatsim framework the simplest is the single run version that was mainly used for the model calibration runs hughes et al 2020 the single run version uses fixed parameter values including annual potential evapotranspiration depth and a single input of rainfall time series data the other versions allow for uncertainty in the parameter inputs using minimum and maximum values to define uniform distributions which are sampled during the ensemble model runs for scenario 1b table 1 only the water use parameters are considered uncertain and the model generates 10 000 ensembles using independent random sampling of the range of future water use parameters for scenario 2 1a only 250 ensembles are generated and these are based on random sampling from the ensemble of stochastic rainfall inputs explained above with no additional parameter uncertainty all of the 2b scenarios i e changes to rainfall evapotranspiration demand and water use are based on a combination of 250 rainfall input samples plus 200 samples from the parameters that are considered uncertain annual potential evapotranspiration and future water demands therefore generating 50 000 ensembles a post processing utility is used to extract the minimum maximum and 95 50 and 5 exceeded values for each month of the time series across all of the ensemble sets the main purpose of this utility is to generate data that can be used to plot the ensemble bounds for any given scenario the utility is normally used to extract the simulated cumulative flow at the outlet of any sub basin however it can also be used to examine the uncertainty bounds of sub basin incremental flow or the storage volume of a reservoir or wetland for those sub basins where they exist 4 water use scenarios present day and future during the calibration phase of the project some poorly defined existing water uses were largely ignored as they were not considered likely to affect the overall calibration or were expected to have occurred more recently than most of the historical observed stream flow data that formed the basis of the calibration however it is important to include these in the present day scenario s1a in table 1 even if they remain poorly quantified table 3 summarises the estimates of irrigation water use based on the gis analysis of assumed irrigation areas ifpri 2019 and a fixed demand of 750 mm y 1 this value was based on some local knowledge of irrigation practices in parts of zambia lawrence 2020 while it might be expected that some of the drier parts of the basin e g within zimbabwe will have higher demands table 4 lists the irrigation water demands for those sub basins where there is also evidence of supply from either distributed small reservoirs or from large reservoirs and includes the estimates of the reservoir full supply volumes the last two columns in table 4 provide an estimate of the sub basin contributing area as well as the mean annual inflow volume m3 106 y 1 based on the calibration simulations there are some cases where there is a reasonable match between the estimated inflow volumes the available storage and the demand e g map1 man1 and map3 while there are other cases where there appears to be far more water available than the demand e g lng10 lng8 and mam2 as well as others where the demand appears to exceed the estimated supply kaf9 table 5 provides a summary of the water uses that were included in the calibration phase as well as estimates for both the present day s1a and future s1b to s4b scenarios this table includes additional sub basins where there are water demands assumed to be supplied directly from the river as well as water demands for urban and mining supplies the following sub sections provide more information about the water uses and the information used to generate the estimates it has to be acknowledged that the majority of the estimates in all the water demand tables tables 3 5 are based on limited information uncertain analysis methods or subjective assessments of future demands the full details of how the future demands are likely to be met are not included in table 5 lack of space but the general assumption is that where reservoir storage is currently used this will increase in the future 4 1 luangwa river there is very little clear evidence of extensive cultivation or irrigation in the main eastern headwater areas lng1 to lng5 nor in the downstream sub basins lng7 and lng9 the present day demand table 4 for areas lng4 5 and 6 are based on the ifpri 2019 data and is expected to double in the future both lng8 and 10 have clearly identifiable irrigation areas as well as extensive dryland cultivation there is one large irrigation scheme upstream of mita hills reservoir lng10 that covers an area of greater than 1 500 km2 while estimates based on local knowledge lawrence pers comm 2020 broadly agree with the ifpri 2019 data that the area irrigated at any one time is less than 160 km2 it has been assumed that the area has almost reached full development partly due to competition with future hydropower requirements and will only expand to about 200 km2 within lng8 there is approximately 40 km2 of obvious irrigation centre pivots which is supported by a number of distributed small dams the demand is assumed to double into the future there are large reservoirs in both lng8 mulungushi dam with storage of 490 106 m3 and generating capacity of 32 mw and lng10 mita hills dam with storage of 680 106 m3 and generating capacity of 24 mw while a future new storage reservoir is planned within lng10 with additional storage of 450 106 m3 4 2 kafue river there are clear signs of irrigation and water use for mining assumed to be direct from the river in the headwater sub basins kaf11 1 2 and 3 above the lukangwa swamps and these are expected to increase into the future there is less evidence of cultivation in kaf4 and future water use in this sub basin is not expected to be significant there are large areas of cultivation in kaf5 around the borders of the lukangwa swamps and along the main river with some indication of irrigation similarly kaf6 and kaf7 have relatively small areas of irrigation there is some cultivation around itezhi tezhi reservoir within kaf8 as well as in the southern parts of the sub areas representing the kafue flats kaf9 but this appears to be mostly dryland farming there are two extensive areas of irrigation close to the main river and near the outlet of kaf9 just upstream of kafue gorge dam and close to lusaka the total area of irrigation for kaf9 is estimated by ifpri 2019 data to be about 132 km2 and is assumed to be supplied direct from the kafue river as well as from some reservoirs table 3 it has been assumed that the area will increase by about 50 a relatively low figure compared to assumptions in other sub basins largely due to the limited land space and competition with water for hydropower development the zambian capital lusaka lies on the catchment boundary between kaf9 and zam4 the kariba dam sub basin and according to the web site of the lusaka water and sewerage company http www lwsc com zm accessed in february 2020 some 36 106 m3 y 1 is abstracted at the iolanda water treatment plant just upstream of kafue gorge dam in kaf10 this translates into about 50 l head 1 d 1 for the current population of lusaka further information suggests that there is also some groundwater abstraction in the city itself clearly both of these are expected to grow substantially in the future 4 3 upper zambezi kariba and upstream and chobe river while there is evidence of quite extensive cultivation in the eastern headwater tributaries above the barotse floodplain notably within bar3 and bar4 there is no evidence of irrigation further downstream there is cultivation along the main river and some irrigation 12 km2 near the town of katima mulilo at the outlet of bar6 but this is very small relative to even the dry season flow in the zambezi at this point and is not expected to expand a great deal while there is a planned hydro power plant at ngonye falls bar5 this is a run of river scheme and is not expected to substantially influence the downstream flow regime there is no evidence of much cultivation or irrigation in the sub basins of the chobe river there is some irrigation in the tributary catchments of zam1 2 and 3 as well as direct abstractions from the river in zam1 for several towns there is also a proposed inter basin transfer scheme to supply water from the zambezi within zam2 to botswana at a rate of 495 106 m3 y 1 as well as a further transfer scheme to supply water for a new dam shangani dam on the gwayi river in zimbabwe to be operated mainly for hydro power it has proved to be very difficult to obtain reliable values for these planned transfers and only the botswana transfer has been included in the model at this stage 4 4 central basin tributaries some storage dams were allowed for in the calibration model for the gwayi river sub basins but due to lack of information no water use was included the expected water uses in gwa3 and gwa4 include those for agriculture mining and domestic supplies and the ifpri 2019 data are expected to under estimate the total demand certainly the available storage and inflow volume are far greater than the demand given in ifpri 2019 even if the 750 mm y 1 of irrigation demand is increased for this drier region mkandla et al 2005 provide some information about water supplies to bulawayo on the catchment boundary of gwa4 and the majority of the city supplies appear to come from surface water storage to the south in the limpopo river basin but they do refer to some groundwater usage 3 6 106 m3 y 1 from gwa4 gwa1 gwa2 and sng1 are not expected to experience significant water uses despite quite large areas of rain fed agriculture the senyati river sub system map1 to 4 has several large reservoirs e g claw dam with 21 106 m3 total storage and assumed to supply the kadoma district with water as well as a large number of distributed small reservoirs the total storage appears to be over 500 106 m3 but the water demand appears to be less than 200 106 m3 y 1 possibly reflecting the semi arid and variable nature of the flow regime the manyame river sub system includes three large dams within man3 and one in man2 the most upstream one lake chivero supplying harare with water there are also a large number of much smaller dams in all the sub basins with a combined storage of over 370 106 m3 y 1 the total current irrigation demand is estimated at some 200 106 m3 y 1 tables 4 and 5 while it is assumed that an additional 30 106 m3 y 1 is abstracted for urban water use a very uncertain value many of these demands are expected to increase in the future particularly those from the large dams in man3 to supply the city of harare the headwaters of the mazoe river in maz2 lie just to the east of harare and are intensively cultivated with many small to medium sized dams the headwaters of maz1 also appear to be similar but is perhaps less intensively cultivated as with the other zimbabwe sub basins future water demands are expected to increase and while the level of increase is very uncertain it is likely to be limited by the available resources given the current level of small dam development it is not expected that the reservoir storage capacity will be increased substantially in the future 4 5 lake malawi nyasa sub system there is extensive cultivation in many of the valleys of the headwater tributaries as well on the shores of the lake the ifpri 2019 data suggest that there is about 240 km2 of irrigation most of which occurs near the lake and can therefore be considered in the model as abstractions from the lake there is also a quite large area of irrigation in shr2 120 km2 lil1 contains malawi s capital city lilongwe population of approximately 1 1 million which is supplied by kamuzu dam total storage of about 24 106 m3 y 1 and a catchment area of 1 870 km2 the present day abstractions are based on 50 l head 1 d 1 and expected to increase in the future table 5 this information is based on data from lilongwe water board https www vei nl partners lwb accessed during march 2020 blantyre shr1 is supplied with water direct from the shire river current demand is estimated at about 16 5 106 m3 y 1 and is expected to at least double into the future 4 6 main zambezi river downstream of kariba and other tributaries there is some irrigation in the tributary areas of all the main zambezi river sub basins with the highest being in zam4 and assumed to be supplied by the available reservoir storage further downstream most of the irrigation appears to be along the river some allowance has also been made for direct abstractions for the city of tete population 310 000 from zam6 5 results the results for the different scenarios are mainly presented as flow duration curve comparisons at four key sites in the basin these sites are the inflows to itezhi tezhi and kariba dams kaf7 and zam2 flows downstream of cahora bassa at tete zam6 and flows at the outlet of lake malawi nyasa mal1 additional comparisons are made for some other sub basins where these illustrate specific issues relating to water management under future projected changes all of the future scenarios are compared with scenario 1 that represents the calibrated model outputs but with fixed operating rules for kariba and cahora bassa dams used to replace the historical time series of observed releases this is necessary because the observed releases do not extend throughout the total duration of the modelling period the dams did not exist in the earlier years 5 1 delta change ranges for rainfall fig 2 shows the frequency distributions across all of the sub basins for the annual means and standard deviations minimum and maximum values representing the ranges of delta change across the six climate models while fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the maximum and minimum delta change in mean annual rainfall the overall across all three warming scenarios spatial median for the annual mean minimum fractional delta maximum decrease in rainfall is approximately 0 13 while the equivalent value for the maximum increase is 0 03 the climate models therefore suggest a greater drying trend than a wetter trend in terms of the annual standard deviation the median decrease is 0 125 while the median increase is 0 325 suggesting a trend towards more variable annual rainfall fig 4 illustrates the changes using the mean delta change across the climate models with respect to their own baseline conditions for the three global warming scenarios and supports the data presented in fig 2 that suggests that the differences between the 1 5 to 2 0 scenarios are substantially less than the changes for the 3 scenario the spatial patterns suggest that there are more sub basins in the southern and western parts of the catchment with the highest rainfall reductions but lake malawi nyasa also shows quite high reductions if the climate model mean values are used 5 2 delta change ranges for potential evapotranspiration and temperature table 6 lists some statistics for the range of changes across the different climate models lowest to highest and across all of the sub basins mean standard deviation minimum and maximum fig 5 a and b provides some indications of the spatial variability of the temperature and potential evapotranspiration changes expected for the three global warming scenarios based on the climate model mean changes from their own baseline period fig 5a highlights how the temperature changes in the basin are relatively higher than the global warming scenarios considered both table 6 and fig 5b suggest that there is a relatively low degree of variation in terms of evapotranspiration demand in the changes across the sub basins although this increases for the 3 0 global warming scenario s4 2b similarly there are bigger overall differences between the 2 0 and 3 0 scenarios than between the 1 5 and 2 0 scenarios a result that could be clearly anticipated and is also reflected in the rainfall data there is no strong spatial pattern in the changes partly a consequence of the relatively low variability across the sub basins however it is interesting to note that the lowest changes for the 3 change occurs over the lake malawi nyasa sub basin mal1 as well the upper zambezi above the barotse wetland bar2 bar3 and bar7 most of the biggest changes occur in the lower sub basins of the luangwa and kafue basins as well as some of the lake malawi nyasa tributary sub basins this spatial pattern is repeated for all the global warming scenarios if we use the highest change estimates across the climate models but different patterns emerge when the lowest estimates across the climate models are used while these results reflect the results of the regional downscaling of the different climate models the overall impacts on the modelling results is expected to be relatively small due to the low variability across the different sub basins table 6 5 3 simulation results for scenarios 1a and 1b the total present day consumptive use referred to in table 5 amounts to a total of 1 532 106 m3 which is 78 less than the value given in zamcom 2019 but nevertheless the same order of magnitude relative to the total water resources availability the impact of including these revised estimates as part of the scenario using historical climate data s1a on the flow duration curves of the key stations kaf7 mal1 zam2 and zam6 is almost negligible even in those tributary basins where the water use appears to be quite high luangwa and the zimbabwean sub basins the largest impacts are generally no greater than a 5 reduction in mean monthly flow volume scenario 1b is based on uncertainty ranges of expected future water use and distributed dam volumes and catchment areas the lower values of the range are based on the values provided in table 5 column 3 while the upper ranges are variable depending on the degree of uncertainty in the future estimates it is acknowledged that most of the future estimates are uncertain but some e g lng10 are based on more information than others the total for the values given in table 5 is 3 330 106 m3 while the total for the upper range of uncertainty is 3 950 106 m3 representing increases of between 217 and 258 over the present day estimates even with the upper uncertainty estimates of water use there are very few differences between the flow duration curves at the four key sites the four zimbabwean basins gwa1 map1 man1 and maz1 show the largest impacts ranging from about a 90 reduction at maz1 to almost a 70 reduction at man1 for the upper uncertainty bound the overall conclusion is that the amount of estimated consumptive water use has relatively little impact on the total resources of the zambezi river 5 4 simulation results for scenarios 2 1 and 2 2 fig 6 shows the results for only the 1 5 temperature increase rainfall changes s2 1a for the selected sub basins and it is quite clear that the 95 exceeded impacts the worse case rainfall change ensemble are quite different throughout the basin the increased impacts noted in zam2 and zam6 compared to kaf7 are likely to be related to the larger rainfall reductions in the many of the headwater sub areas of the upper zambezi relative to the kafue headwaters figs 3 and 4 as well as the impacts of the combined effects of climate change on the barotse floodplain wetland upstream in bar5 the result for mal1 is very uncertain partly because the original model calibration of the dynamics of lake malawi nyasa was very uncertain hughes et al 2020 some of the model calibrations for the contributing sub areas were also quite uncertain at least some of the higher degree of change relative to the other sub basins might be attributed to the direct impacts of rainfall on the large surface area of the lake and the dominant role that this plays in the overall water balance however further analysis suggests that the total upstream inflow is also quite highly reduced in the driest ensembles attempts to attribute differences in flow reductions to the way in which the total runoff has been simulated did not reveal any clear patterns that might point to excessive reductions being linked to modelling artifacts however as might be expected some of the sub basins with high proportions of total runoff being simulated as surface runoff are linked to relatively higher stream flow reductions this is particularly true if the majority of the surface runoff is simulated as saturation excess rather than infiltration excess runoff in the former the effects of reduced rainfall are not only direct less rainfall to runoff but also indirect and related to reduced moisture storage and therefore generally lower proportions of saturation it is quite difficult to assess whether the rather drastic reduction in outflow from lake malawi nyasa and extended periods of no outflow under the most extreme rainfall reduction ensemble is a credible result or not the results are in broad agreement with those of kling et al 2015 but some of other literature on climate impacts on the lake outflows do not always agree with each other even in terms of the historical patterns of lake levels both lyons et al 2010 and kumambala and ervine 2010 used models to simulate the historical patterns of lake levels and both refer to earlier papers covering a similar subject however they disagree quite substantially about the key water balance components of the basin and lake system suggesting that it is difficult to use their results to check our own simulations the cru rainfall data used in this study suggest that the historical rainfall for the lake sub basin is some 1 202 mm y 1 with the evaporation being 1 527 mm y 1 a net loss of 325 mm y 1 kumambala and ervine 2010 suggest that the mean annual rainfall is actually at least 1 350 mm y 1 and evaporation about 1 610 mm y 1 a net loss of 260 mm y 1 further calder et al 1995 noted that changes in rainfall can explain historical patterns of change in lake levels better than any other effects but their analysis did not include any of the quite large changes in evaporation associated with a warming climate we could not achieve a satisfactory calibration relative to observed outflow patterns in our model if we scaled our input data to give a net evaporative loss of 260 mm y 1 over the lake the 50 exceeded median ensemble has been included in fig 6 for the lake malawi nyasa outflows mal1 to illustrate that there is a substantial degree of non linearity in the stream flow reductions compared to the rainfall reductions which are based on uniform sampling fig 7 suggests that the inclusion of evaporation effects s2 2b for a 1 5 temperature change does not make a huge difference to the results at kaf7 and zam2 but does quite substantially reduce the moderate to high flows at zam6 as might be expected from the comments already made about lake malawi nyasa the impacts of the drier ensembles 50 exceeded or greater on mal1 are extremely large with zero outflows for 100 of the time in the 95 exceeded ensemble these results clearly reflect the increased impacts of evaporative losses downstream of large open water bodies reservoirs and wetlands 5 5 simulation results for scenario 3 2b fig 8 illustrates that the differences between s2 2b and s2 3b are not very large for most of the sub basins although the frequency of zero outflows for lake malawi nyasa increases quite substantially this is associated with the relatively small differences between the delta change values for these two scenarios while the differences in evaporation demand are also not very large when taking into account the uncertainty range as well as the variations across the sub basins 5 6 simulation results for scenario 4 2b fig 9 shows that the full complement of climate and water use change signals for a 3 0 temperature increase suggest a much greater degree of change for all of the sub basins but especially for the downstream parts of the main zambezi river zam6 and for lake malawi nyasa mal1 the results for zam6 are likely to be quite strongly affected by the operating rules of kariba and cahora bassa dams no attempts have been made to optimize these for different climate scenarios and they have remained fixed for all of the model runs from scenario 1 onwards see next section for lake malawi nyasa even the 5 exceeded scenario suggests that their will only be flow out of the lake into the shire river for some 40 of the time to further examine the validity of this results the mean annual water balance of lake malawi nyasa for the three main climate scenarios s2 2b s32 b and s4 2b can be compared to the s1 scenario the net evaporation from the lake rainfall evaporation for scenario 1b is some 325 mm which is balanced in the same scenario by about 760 mm of inflow the net evaporation loss increases to a maximum i e the lowest rainfall and highest evaporation estimates for each scenario of 597 613 and 746 mm for scenarios 2 2b 3 2b and 4 2b respectively given that the inflows progressively reduce through the three scenarios to less than 460 mm for the overall driest situation the graphs in figs 7d 8 d and 9 d are not at all surprising 5 7 simulation results for kariba dam fig 10 shows the exceedance frequency distribution of kariba dam storage volumes expressed as a of full storage capacity for the three main temperature change and future water use scenarios s2 2b s3 2b and s4 2b compared to the baseline scenario s1 the 65 level represents the approximate level below which hydro power generation is no longer possible while the hydro power release rule column to the right of the graph shows the rules that have been implemented in all of the model runs these rules were roughly based on the historical record of hydro power releases that were used during the model calibration run however no attempt has been made to optimize them for any particular inflow regime they are therefore only used to illustrate the likely differences in releases and by implication power generation between scenarios the text box at the bottom of fig 10 summarises the average release for each scenario relative to the full release capacity the lower and upper values for the three change scenarios represent the 95 and 5 exceedance values the 5 exceedance values show either slightly increased or very similar releases relative to s1 while the worst case situation for the three scenarios show decreases of 12 17 and 40 for the 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 temperature changes respectively no attempt has been made in this study to convert the release changes into actual power production as the focus here is mainly on the water resources changes part of the complexity of the relationships between this diagram and the kariba inflow changes at zam2 figs 7d 8 d and 9 d are related to the fact that the modelled operating rules for kariba dam also include flood releases dominantly at storage volumes of 90 and higher and their patterns of variability will also change across the various scenarios 5 8 changes in some headwater sub basins table 7 compares the mean annual runoff volumes for scenario 1 with the other scenarios for selected headwater sub basins with different aridity indices mean annual potential evapotranspiration divided by mean annual rainfall using the median of the ensemble output results the results are inevitably quite mixed partly because each sub basin has a different range of rainfall and evapotranspiration delta changes as well as water use changes the original idea behind this comparison was to try and identify if different degrees of aridity and or proportions of the three main runoff components in the calibrated model would influence the degree of change for example it might be expected that sub basins dominated by saturated area surface runoff could experience greater impacts due to the combined effects of reduced rainfall less runoff and increased evapotranspiration reduced moisture storage however there are too many other variables involved to reach any conclusions about these issues most of the differences can be explained by the range of rainfall delta changes across the three scenarios for example for ruh2 the upper values of the delta changes are positive and quite large for all three scenarios 0 18 0 19 and 0 17 while for ruk2 they are weakly positive for s2 2b 0 11 and s3 2b 0 03 but negative for s4 2b 0 02 5 9 discussion perhaps one of the key questions for discussion is the extent to which the future changes are partly artefacts of the hydrological model setup and whether the climate change signals from the rcms are being propagated appropriately through the model in most senses it is reasonable to assume that this is not the case because the model has adequately simulated the runoff responses to quite a high degree of variability both seasonally and inter annually in the historical record however given the high degree of uncertainty in our understanding of the dynamics of the large wetland systems notably lake malawi nyasa as well as the methods used to represent them in the model we cannot entirely reject the possibility that some of the extreme changes that have been simulated are not at least partly modelling artefacts kumambala and ervine 2010 predicted drops in lake levels using hadcm3 climate data but do not predict zero outflows however their future climate inputs are quite different to those used in the present study and include higher rainfalls and quite modest increases in evaporation demand the relatively simple water balance check that was included within the results section suggest that the loss of downstream outflow from lake malawi nyasa is inevitable given the climate change signals used in this paper and are certainly not a modelling artefact a related issue is associated with the fact that none of the hydrological parameters were changed from the historical calibrations to the climate scenario runs while this may not be strictly the correct approach to adopt we currently have little understanding or scientific basis for determining which parameters to change and by how much we could have speculated about changes in such as infiltration rooting depth or vegetation cover regimes and introduced uncertainty ranges into the relevant parameters as part of the future scenario ensemble runs but these changes would not have been based on any real knowledge or full understanding such changes can be made to the model in the future if and when there is greater evidence for quantifying the changes it has already been noted that there are quite large discrepancies between our own uncertain estimates of future water use and those that are contained in previous reports zamcom 2019 refers to a more than threefold increase in consumptive water use as well as total current use that is some 26 higher than our own estimates kling et al 2014 using figures based on a world bank study refer to current use that is 73 higher than our values as well as moderate and high development options that are some 2 4 and 7 6 times their current use estimates respectively however on the one hand the sources of these other estimates are not fully explained while on the other hand even a much greater increase in water use would have relatively small impacts compared to the effects of the lower bound estimates of the climate change signals despite this observation it is acknowledged that our own analysis of water consumption patterns and change is based on weak information and should certainly be improved for future model runs however we have accounted for some of the constraints on development such as competing users irrigation and hydro power in lng8 and 10 for example as well as competition for land resources between commercial irrigation and community rain fed agriculture both issues noted as important by lawrence 2020 there are also quite large tracts of land within some sub basins of inter alia the luangwa kafue and chobe river sub systems that are occupied by national parks that are considered here unlikely to experience substantial development impacts some of the smaller water uses e g rural water supplies have been largely ignored as likely to have very small impacts on the main points of interest within the basin however these could have significant impacts at a more local scale particularly in the more arid parts of the basin while small scale but extensive use of groundwater could impact on the low flow regimes of some of the tributary sub basins unfortunately the necessary data are not currently available and therefore were not included the results show very clearly that the major source of uncertainty for the future lies in the projections of future climate conditions and these are heavily dependent upon all the many assumptions that are built into the gcms rcms as well as the associated downscaling approaches these are issues that hydrological modellers have little control over and we have to accept that our climate modelling colleagues generate the best information that they can hargreaves and annan 2014 the validity of the simulated stream flow changes is therefore very dependent upon the validity or appropriateness of the climate change signals used to force the model given that the model responds correctly to the changed climate signals the previous discussion paragraphs have partly addressed this issue but it is also interesting to look quite broadly at the runoff drivers in this basin there is a quite strong relationship between the aridity index mean annual values of potential evapotranspiration divide by precipitation and the runoff ratio for the headwater sub basins r2 0 65 if the aridity index values for the wetter and drier bounds of the three warming scenarios are re calculated the wetter bounds for all three scenarios show slight decreases or increases in aridity however the drier bounds i e largest decreases in rainfall and largest increases in et0 show increases in aridity of 124 130 and 147 averaged across all sub basins for the three scenarios respectively thus the combined effects of reduced rainfall and reduced runoff ratio will certainly account for the results illustrated in figs 7d 8 d and 9 d particularly when the effects of increased evaporation losses from the open water bodies reservoirs lake malawi nyasa and the wetlands during the wet season are also taken into consideration kling et al 2014 used two climate models cnrm and mpi and two temperature change scenarios 1 7 and 4 8 and assessed the impacts upstream of tete zam6 in our model using the cnrm data produced higher flows for both futures while with mri the warmer temperature future produced results that were somewhat lower than the 5 exceeded line given in fig 9c while kling et al 2014 do not provide very much detail of the climate change data used their climate sensitivity scenario is based on changes of 10 rainfall and temperature increases of 2 and 4 based on the changes in reservoir evaporation reported in the paper the temperature changes translate into evaporation demand increases of between 4 and 8 figs 2 5 of this paper indicate that the possible decreases in rainfall and increases in et0 used in this study are far greater for the 3 warming scenario the difference in the projections of future water availability between their study and ours are therefore not at all surprising comparisons with the results given by beck and bernauer 2011 are quite difficult as they lump together the impacts of development and climate change and have based their future simulations on very different assumptions from those used in this paper the values that they give for development changes suggest a 16 times increase in consumptive water use excluding evaporation from hydro power dams this increase is clearly far greater than any changes that we have accounted for and will clearly dominate the future values in at least some parts of the basin it is perhaps not surprising that their worst case scenario predicts zero minimum flows at victoria falls zam2 for all but 2 months of the wet season it is similarly difficult to compare our results with those presented by spalding fecher et al 2017 because their results are confined to changes in power generation however for some of their drier scenarios they suggest that the average annual power availability at kariba could drop to some 25 of maximum generation capacity which is similar to our worst case situation under scenario 4 2b fig 10 from a water management perspective the bands of future uncertainty probably remain too wide in some parts of the basin for effective decision making and this further emphasizes the need to narrow the gap between the projections of the future climate forcing data this contribution has not examined the sustainability of projected future water demands in any detail apart from noting some possible changes in the power output of kariba dam in fig 10 largely because this was out of the scope of this study however the model setup can be used for this purpose by simply looking at how frequently the projected demands are met under different change scenarios 6 conclusions hughes et al 2020 and this study have attempted to demonstrate that the established pitman model is fit for purpose in terms of simulating historical and future water resources availability it is acknowledged that the model contains uncertainties as will all models based on imperfect forcing data with imperfect structures and imperfect observational data with which to calibrate and validate the model the papers have therefore also attempted to identify the key uncertainties and their likely impacts on the practical value of the model setup and so that future studies can be focused on reducing these uncertainties however we believe that the main uncertainties do not invalidate the overall message of possible water resources change that is conveyed by the model results it is always difficult to make comparisons with previous studies of climate and development change partly because the science of climate change assessment is highly dynamic and partly because previous papers do not always contain the full details of the climate or development change signals used we have provided quite a lot of details of the estimates of present day and future consumptive water use in this paper but the results tend to be very low notably for the future compared to previous studies beck and bernauer 2011 kling et al 2011 zamcom 2019 while relatively moderate increases in the upper values of assumed water use are unlikely to have substantial effects on the main results if the values used by beck and bernauer 2011 are really appropriate then the results will be quite different these estimates therefore remain a substantial source of uncertainty in our results one of the key conclusions is that the future simulation results are hugely dependent upon the source of the climate change data and the change signals that are given by them the sample rcm data 6 models used in this study were selected from recently available information to be representative of many more model outputs that are currently available the spread of climate change signals across these different models remains quite large and that spread is translated into the future uncertainties illustrated in the main results diagrams of this paper figs 6 10 the key points selected kaf7 zam2 zam6 and mal1 illustrate that the relative impacts can be quite different across the whole zambezi river basin the greatest impacts being in the lake malawi nyasa sub system in agreement with kling et al 2015 as well as other areas containing large open water bodies natural and man made that are very sensitive to the combined effects of increased aridity additional uncertainty might be related to the climate change projections experiment selected the dynamical downscaling methodology of the cmip5 climate projections used in this analysis cordex might be different from a statistical downscaling exercise of the same gcms outputs and both from the newly released cmip6 projections the quantification of the uncertainty derived by this might the focus of future research what of the future development and use of the model there remain many improvements that could be made to the model as well as several additional more detailed analyses it is hoped that hughes et al 2020 and this contribution as well as the availability of the existing model setup may inspire other interested individuals or groups within the region to pursue further investigations and add value to the model the paper concludes with a few suggestions for further work further assessment of the regional groundwater recharge patterns and refinement of this part of the model might also include the addition of groundwater abstraction as part of the water uses assessments of possible climate change consequences land cover etc and how these could affect the model parameter sets rather than simply fixing the parameters between the historical and future scenario runs integrating various rainfall databases to provide improved historical forcing data and overcome some of the potential problems with using the cru data further analysis of the available observed stream flow data where there are apparent anomalies hughes et al 2020 to extend the amount of model calibration data extending the application of the weap model to include the effects of development and climate change to provide further information that can be compared with the pitman model results developing a better understanding of the dynamics of water exchange between the large wetlands and river channels to improve the representation of wetlands in the model further detailed assessment of expected future water uses and their
