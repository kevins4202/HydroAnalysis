9640,with population increasing and global warming extreme weather events and water resource shortage have become nonnegligible factors restricting maize production the effects of humic acid ha on plant growth and stress tolerance have been extensively studied however the underlying physiological and molecular mechanism of how ha influences drought resistance in maize plants remains unknown in the present study a pot experiment was conducted with two irrigation levels w1 drought stress 45 60 of field capacity w2 well watered 75 100 of field capacity two ha application rates h0 0 kg ha 1 h1 45 kg ha 1 and two maize genotypes zhengdan958 and xianyu335 the results showed that ha applied at 45 kg ha 1 improved the proportion of macro aggregates in the soil while increasing the soil water content by 5 0 at w1 compared with h0 the availabilities of p k fe and mg in soil were improved and the activities of rubisco and atp synthase the content of iaa and the concentrations of osmotically active solutes i e soluble sugars betaine and proline in maize were increased with ha application in addition the expressions of genes involved in primary metabolic processes especially photosynthesis carbon fixation and hormone and osmotic metabolisms in maize leaves were regulated higher maize yields were achieved in the treatments with ha applied by 19 7 in zhengdan958 and 14 3 in xianyu335 than without ha applied under drought stress respectively and the water use efficiency of zhengdan958 and xianyu335 was 2 16 g kg 1 and 2 08 g kg 1 in the treatments with ha applied respectively in conclusion ha application enhanced the drought resistance and growth of maize the results of this study help to understand the drought resistance mechanism of maize and provide support for crop production in face of water shortage keywords drought stress humic acid physiological response maize yellow river basin 1 introduction water has always been the main factor limiting crop production around the world especially in areas with limited rainfall nassiri mahallati and jahan 2020 piao et al 2010 climate change is altering precipitation regimes and resulting in more frequent severer droughts with longer durations negatively affecting crop production and global food security huang et al 2016 sherwood and fu 2014 mclaughlin et al 2020 valipour et al 2021 meanwhile agricultural water shortage has been exacerbated by rising domestic water consumption as a result of population growth and economic development huang et al 2016 maja and ayano 2021 it is reported that annual crop yield loss caused by drought is up to 8 1012 kg higher than the total annual crop yield loss caused by all other adverse factors in china song et al 2020 2018 hao and singh 2015 maize zea mays l is a crop that can be used for human consumption animal feed industrial raw material and energy it is one of the most essential grains in the world and its production is of significance for global food security world demand for maize increases due to the growing population and industry stimulating maize cultivation nandan et al 2021 china is one of the top three the other two are the united states and brazil maize production and consumption countries li et al 2020 with the north and northeast china plains being the main maize producing areas wan et al 2021 maize is a high water consuming crop ali et al 2018 however as a results of global warming low flows in the yellow river an important irrigation water source for maize production in the north china plain have become more common resulting in significant maize yield losses fang et al 2010 plant physiological problems such as insufficient water absorption by roots imbalanced nutrient distribution disordered cell osmotic system excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased photosynthetic capacity are the main reasons for agricultural production loss under drought stress wan et al 2021 qu et al 2020 mukarram et al 2021 qamer et al 2021 in particular photosynthetic capacity decrease in leaves is a major reason for crop yield reduction song et al 2020 previous studies have found that soil drought significantly decreased rubisco activity in leaves resulting in decreased photosynthetic capability inhibiting the transport of photosynthetic products to the reproductive organs reduced carbohydrate accumulation and eventually reduced crop yield sarker et al 2020 monneveux et al 2006 water is a raw material for photosynthesis under mild or moderate drought stress the transpiration of leaves is reduced due to stomata closure and at the same time less co2 enters mesophyll cells as a result intercellular co2 concentration is low cai et al 2015 chaves et al 2009 oxygen becomes the electron acceptor in mesophyll cells ros are rapidly produced and lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane is induced grassi and magnani 2005 consequently superoxide free radicals are produced photosynthetic pigments are degraded the photosynthetic electron transfer system is destroyed electron transfer is impeded and the photosynthetic organs are functionally damaged leading to reduced photosynthetic rate inhibited plant growth and decreased yield li et al 2018 signarbieux and feller 2011 therefore it is of significance to find an effective strategy to improve drought resistance and water use efficiency wue of maize to minimize drought induced yield loss many strategies including genetic engineering breeding technology and bioengineering have been employed to generate drought tolerant maize lines min et al 2016 zheng et al 2010 however these strategies are generally time consuming and technology intensive in contrast soil amendment seems to be a simple and cost effective strategy for improving plant resistance tolerance to stresses including drought abdallah et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 humic acid ha the principal component of humic substances is hydrophilic and acidic with a high cation exchange capacity and adsorption capacity canellas et al 2015b gulser et al 2010 humic acid improves soil hydrophysical properties and nutrient availability stimulates plant growth and improves plant drought resistance in arid and semi arid regions osman and rady 2012 defines et al 2005 previous reports have shown that ha application maintains cell membrane stability and the ultrastructure of mesophyll cells mitigates non stomatal limitation of photosynthesis stimulates root elongation and water absorption increases leaf area and water retention and enhances photosynthesis under drought stress popescu and popescu 2018 although it has been reported that ha can improve soil hydrophysical properties and drought resistance of plants the underlying molecular mechanism has not been elucidated in addition the stress resistance related genes induced by ha also need to be further studied therefore to explore the molecular mechanism of how ha improves crop drought resistance and provide a useful guideline for drought mitigation in water limited areas i e the north china plain at the lowest reaches of the yellow river the effects of ha application on drought resistance of two maize genotypes under different soil moisture content conditions were studied through an outdoor pot experiment the purposes of this study were to 1 analyze the soil water content swc aggregate size and nutrients supply intensity after ha addition under soil moisture conditions 2 evaluate the effects of ha on plant growth yield and wue under different soil moisture conditions and 3 explore the effects of ha on the physiological responses and gene expression of the endogenous hormones osmoregulation system and photosynthesis of maize in drought conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description soil and

pathway 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of ha on soil properties maize is sensitive to drought and its grain yield is strongly influenced by soil moisture during its growth comas et al 2019 however seasonal drought is very common during maize cultivation which causes maize yield loss the result of the present study showed that ha application increased maize yield by 14 3 19 7 and improved wue under drought stress yang and antonietti 2020 pointed out that ha improves soil fertility by improving soil texture and increasing water and nutrient retention in this study the application of ha increased swc fig 1 and improved the proportion of medium macro aggregates 1 2 mm and small macro aggregates 0 25 1 mm this is due to the fact that ha cements soil particles and creates clay organic complexes with soil clay enhancing aggregate stability regelink et al 2015 das et al 2021 and swc xu et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 reported similar findings stating that the application of ha promoted the binding of micro aggregates into macro aggregates furthermore the presence of hydrophilic cellulose and polyols groups in ha vlƒçkov√° et al 2009 increases swhc and water retention as well brooks et al 2004 the application of ha improves soil fertility by increasing nutrient availability rosa et al 2018 in this study the addition of ha increased the concentrations of p k ca mg fe mn and zn in soil solution at the key growth stage i e silking stage of maize especially under drought conditions similar findings were reported by rosa et al 2018 recent studies have demonstrated that the functional groups of ha e g oh co cc and cc fig s2 recorded by the ftir spectrum are associated with soil nutrient availability rosa et al 2018 on the one hand the reason for increased p availability may be that ha reduces the adsorption of p on soil minerals by competing with p for adsorption sites on the surface of soil minerals yang et al 2021 humic acid increases k availability by increasing the proportion of exchangeable k in adsorbed k olk and cassman 1995 on the other hand recent researches have shown that the molecular structure of ha is a driving stimulus for hormone action and root proliferation rosa et al 2018 canellas and olivares 2017 root growth is stimulated by the administration of ha and enhanced exudation of low molecular weight organic anions by roots leads to the release of soil nutrients from the soil including fe mn and zn mendes et al 2013 4 2 physiological response and genes regulation of maize with ha application under drought stress to minimize drought induced oxidative damage crops have evolved multiple physiological and biochemical such as antioxidant metabolism osmotic adjustment and ion homeostasis amino acids soluble sugars polyamines and ammonium compounds are among the osmotically active substances that help to modify osmotic balance soluble sugars the main contributors to osmotic adjustment under drought stress are important in regulating metabolism and development of crops kuang et al 2017 hao et al 2020 in this study the application of ha increased the contents of soluble sugar in maize leaves for zd958 and xy335 under drought stress fig 4 moreover one glycogen phosphorylase glgp gene which was a catabolic enzyme of starch was up regulated after ha addition under drought fig 9 these results are in agreement with the studies of lee et al 2008 showing that water deficit triggers starch degradation besides for zd958 the trehalose content of zh1w1 was significantly higher than that of zh0w1 fig 4c under drought conditions ha application regulated the trehalose synthesis pathway and the tpp gene was up regulated driving the transformation of trehalose 6 phosphate to trehalose fig 9 trehalose is an osmoprotective sugar that can help cells with osmotic stress by stabilizing membranes and proteins djilianov et al 2005 ingram and bartels 1996 however a significant increase in trehalose did not find in xy335 after ha addition in addition the proline and betaine in maize leaves for zd958 and xy335 were increased by application of ha under drought stress fig 5 the significant change of the osmotically active compounds implied that maize adaptively responds to soil drought after ha addition which may be a biochemical mechanism helping maize to enhance resistance to drought changes in hormonal balance may be to blame for plant growth reduction during drought stress min et al 2016 fig 3 hormones even at an extremely low level play an important role in plant growth development and response to abiotic stresses i e drought aba based root to shoot chemical transmission which causes partial stomatal closure and slowing of leaf expansion development lowering water loss through transpiration is thought to be one of the underlying processes of enhanced wue under drought stress setter et al 2010 however the results of this investigation revealed that ha spray lowered the aba content of maize leaf the aba biosynthesis related genes arabidopsis aldehyde oxidase 3 aao3 and 9 cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases nced were down regulated in the treatments with ha application table s4 with less irrigation stomatal conductance and transpiration rate did not decrease significantly table 3 in addition ha application increased iaa content in zd958 and xy335 under drought conditions the iaa signaling pathway is involved in cell division and plant growth the aux iaa genes which are a key component of the auxin mediated regulatory networks and play an important regulatory role in maintaining the stable development of plants were up regulated with the application of ha under drought conditions the up regulated expression of iaa with ha application maintained plant photosynthetic efficiency delayed senescence and stimulated primary plant growth under drought stress li et al 2018 humic acid mediated osmotic adjustment and hormonal balance may delay leaf senescence and protect photosynthetic functions under drought stress chaves et al 2009 in this study ha application improved maize photosynthesis by increasing leaf chlorophyll spad value and photosynthesis rate according to fig s6 ha application enhances plant photosensitivity by regulating the expression of the lhc‚Ö± genes of the light harvesting antenna complexes allen and forsberg 2001 the antenna complexes absorb sunlight and transfer the excitation energy to the core complexes of ps ii and ps i driving photosynthetic electron transport jenny et al 2003 in addition the peripheral subunits psbp and psbq which are responsible for stabilizing the oxygen evolving complex were up regulated with the application of ha which would be conducive to h2o decomposition o2 production proton accumulation and electron generation li and liu 2018 this was evidenced by the increased fv fm in zd958 and xy335 with ha application under drought stress table 3 the generated electrons would pass sequentially through the ps domain plastoquinone pool cytochrome b6f and plastocyanin and then be transferred to ferredoxin by ps i the ha mediated up regulation of pete genes was beneficial to electron transfer in addition ha application stimulated atp synthase activity and up regulated the expression of Œ≥ atpase as a subunit of atp synthase Œ≥ atpase participates in catalyzing the production of energy storing atp and facilitates electron transport in both ps i and ps ii sun et al 2019 yamori et al 2011 the atp produced in the light reaction process provides energy for the dark reaction process and promotes the fixation and conversion of co2 into bioavailable carbohydrates sun et al 2019 the calvin cycle is the primary carbon fixation mechanism the carboxylation of rubp which is the first step of the calvin cycle is catalyzed by rubisco rubisco activity in zd958 and xy335 was boosted in this work when ha application was applied under drought conditions fig 2 the prk enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of d ribulose 5 phosphate to create rubp which is the last and also the rate limiting step of the calvin cycle sun et al 2019 determining plant metabolic rate and growth miziorko et al 2000 in zd958 and xy335 ha increased prk content and activity improving photosynthesis and biomass production and ultimately increasing maize grain yield under drought stress 4 3 deficit irrigation in the two maize genotypes the amount of irrigation had a considerable impact on grain production in both zd958 and xy335 and was significantly reduced during drought stress however water management in the face of limited water resources agricultural water productivity yield per unit water used by the crop should be prioritized over yield comas et al 2019 attia et al 2021 the yield increase was a result of both ha application and the difference in irrigation amount maize grain yield was 149 3 g pot 1 and 136 1 g pot 1 in zd958 and xy335 with ha applied at 45 kg ha 1 under mild drought stress table s5 which were higher than that without ha applied under well watered conditions this is maybe that the moderate drought stress treatment improved soil aeration and root growth compared with the well watered treatment sun et al 2012 therefore more nutrients were absorbed and higher yields were achieved in addition deficit irrigation promoted root water absorption and improved wue qu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 it is worth noting that the yield of zd958 was higher than that of xy335 at the w2 irrigation level moderate water stress this may be related to the higher expression levels of genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation in zd958 compared with xy335 then assimilating co2 into organic matter using light energy in the photosynthesis process hence deficit irrigation as a new water saving irrigation method should be studied with soil amendment e g ha together with different crops in the future researches to promote the sustainable development of agricultural water management 5 conclusion the effects of ha treatment on maize growth yield and wue under drought stress were examined in this study the results showed that applying ha to soil improved the formation of macro aggregates water content and nutrient availability in soil additionally ha application increased the contents of osmotically active solutes and endogenous hormones promoting drought resistance of maize moreover ha application improved photosynthesis and biomass production when ha was applied under drought stress the yields of both genotypes were lower compared with no ha application under well watered conditions but ha application increased the yield of zd958 and xy335 under drought stress by 19 7 and 14 3 respectively taken together this research lays the groundward for understanding the mechanism of maize drought resistance as well as a valuable and viable technique for enhancing crop water productivity in face of water shortage furthermore deficit irrigation at the field level under various agro climatic conditions with varying crops and soils types should be investigated in the future as it may help crops maintain yield with less water which is especially important for buffering crops against yield losses due to end of season water shortages in water limited areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9640,with population increasing and global warming extreme weather events and water resource shortage have become nonnegligible factors restricting maize production the effects of humic acid ha on plant growth and stress tolerance have been extensively studied however the underlying physiological and molecular mechanism of how ha influences drought resistance in maize plants remains unknown in the present study a pot experiment was conducted with two irrigation levels w1 drought stress 45 60 of field capacity w2 well watered 75 100 of field capacity two ha application rates h0 0 kg ha 1 h1 45 kg ha 1 and two maize genotypes zhengdan958 and xianyu335 the results showed that ha applied at 45 kg ha 1 improved the proportion of macro aggregates in the soil while increasing the soil water content by 5 0 at w1 compared with h0 the availabilities of p k fe and mg in soil were improved and the activities of rubisco and atp synthase the content of iaa and the concentrations of osmotically active solutes i e soluble sugars betaine and proline in maize were increased with ha application in addition the expressions of genes involved in primary metabolic processes especially photosynthesis carbon fixation and hormone and osmotic metabolisms in maize leaves were regulated higher maize yields were achieved in the treatments with ha applied by 19 7 in zhengdan958 and 14 3 in xianyu335 than without ha applied under drought stress respectively and the water use efficiency of zhengdan958 and xianyu335 was 2 16 g kg 1 and 2 08 g kg 1 in the treatments with ha applied respectively in conclusion ha application enhanced the drought resistance and growth of maize the results of this study help to understand the drought resistance mechanism of maize and provide support for crop

droughts with longer durations negatively affecting crop production and global food security huang et al 2016 sherwood and fu 2014 mclaughlin et al 2020 valipour et al 2021 meanwhile agricultural water shortage has been exacerbated by rising domestic water consumption as a result of population growth and economic development huang et al 2016 maja and ayano 2021 it is reported that annual crop

and brazil maize production and consumption countries li et al 2020 with the north and northeast china plains being the main maize producing areas wan et al 2021 maize is a high water consuming crop ali et al 2018 however as a results of global warming low flows in the yellow river an important irrigation water source for maize production in the north china plain have become more common resulting in significant maize yield losses fang et al 2010 plant physiological problems such as insufficient water absorption by roots imbalanced nutrient distribution disordered cell osmotic system excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased photosynthetic capacity are the main reasons for agricultural production loss under drought stress wan et al 2021 qu et al 2020 mukarram et al 2021 qamer et al 2021 in particular photosynthetic capacity decrease in leaves is a major reason for crop yield reduction song et al 2020 previous studies have found that soil drought significantly decreased rubisco activity in leaves resulting in decreased photosynthetic capability inhibiting the transport of photosynthetic products to the reproductive organs reduced carbohydrate accumulation and eventually reduced crop yield sarker et al 2020 monneveux et al 2006 water is a raw material for photosynthesis under mild or moderate drought stress the transpiration of leaves is reduced due to stomata closure and at the same time less co2 enters mesophyll cells as a result intercellular co2 concentration is low cai et al 2015 chaves et al 2009 oxygen becomes the electron acceptor in mesophyll cells ros are rapidly produced and lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane is induced grassi and magnani 2005 consequently superoxide free radicals are produced photosynthetic pigments are degraded the photosynthetic electron transfer system is destroyed electron transfer is impeded and the photosynthetic organs are functionally damaged leading to reduced photosynthetic rate inhibited plant growth and decreased yield li et al 2018 signarbieux and feller 2011 therefore it is of significance to find an effective strategy to improve drought resistance and water use efficiency wue of maize to minimize drought induced yield loss many strategies including genetic engineering breeding technology and bioengineering have been employed to generate drought tolerant maize lines min et al 2016 zheng et al 2010 however these strategies are generally time consuming and technology intensive in contrast soil amendment seems to be a simple and cost effective strategy for improving plant

popescu and popescu 2018 although it has been reported that ha can improve soil hydrophysical properties and drought resistance of plants the underlying molecular mechanism has not been elucidated in addition the stress resistance related genes induced by ha also need to be further studied therefore to explore the molecular mechanism of how ha improves crop drought resistance and provide a useful guideline for drought mitigation in water limited areas i e the north china plain at the lowest reaches of the yellow river the effects of ha application on drought resistance of two maize genotypes

responsive element binding factor abf gene were significantly down regulated in zd958 in xy335 one pp2c gene and one snpk2 gene were down regulated dramatically whereas one snpk2 gene was significantly up regulated significantly 3 5 4 starch and sucrose metabolism trehalose production sucrose biosynthesis and starch degradation to maltose are all part of the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway which is linked to soluble sugar metabolism fig 9 in the trehalose metabolism pathway one trehalose 6 phosphate synthase phosphatase tps tpp gene a crucial enzyme in the production of trehalose from udp glucose in both zd958 and xy335 was considerably down regulated in addition one trehalose 6 phosphate phosphatase tpp gene was significantly up regulated in zd958 and one tpp gene was significantly down regulated in xy335 in the sucrose metabolism pathway three sucrose synthase sus genes responded to ha application in both zd958 and xy335 under drought stress in addition one glycogen phosphorylase glgp gene was up regulated in both zd958 and xy335 besides three genes responded to ha application under drought stress in both zd958 and xy335 in the d glucose metabolism pathway 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of ha on soil properties maize is sensitive to drought and its grain yield is strongly influenced by soil moisture during its growth comas et al 2019 however seasonal drought is very common during maize cultivation which causes maize yield loss the result of the present study showed that ha application increased maize yield by 14 3 19 7 and improved wue under drought stress yang and antonietti 2020 pointed out that ha improves soil fertility by improving soil texture and increasing water and nutrient retention in this study the application of ha increased swc fig 1 and improved the proportion of medium macro aggregates 1 2 mm and small macro aggregates 0 25 1 mm this is due to the fact that ha cements soil particles and creates clay organic complexes with soil clay enhancing aggregate stability regelink et al 2015 das et al 2021 and swc xu et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 reported similar findings stating that the application of ha promoted the binding of micro aggregates into macro aggregates furthermore the presence of hydrophilic cellulose and polyols groups in ha vlƒçkov√° et al 2009 increases swhc and water retention as well brooks et al 2004 the application of ha improves soil fertility by increasing nutrient availability rosa et al 2018 in this study the addition of ha increased the concentrations of p k ca mg fe mn and zn in soil solution at the key growth stage i e silking stage of maize especially under drought conditions similar findings were reported by rosa et al 2018 recent studies have demonstrated that the functional groups of ha e g oh co cc and cc fig s2 recorded by the ftir spectrum are associated with soil nutrient availability rosa et al 2018 on the one hand the reason for increased p availability may be that ha reduces the adsorption of p on soil minerals by competing with p for adsorption sites on the surface of soil minerals yang et al 2021 humic acid increases k availability by increasing the proportion of exchangeable k in adsorbed k olk and cassman 1995 on the other hand recent researches have shown that the molecular structure of ha is a driving stimulus for hormone action and root proliferation rosa et al 2018 canellas and olivares 2017 root growth is stimulated by the administration of ha and enhanced exudation of low molecular weight organic anions by roots leads to the release of soil nutrients from the soil including fe mn and zn mendes et al 2013 4 2 physiological response and genes regulation of maize with ha application under drought stress to minimize drought induced oxidative damage crops have evolved multiple physiological and biochemical such as antioxidant metabolism osmotic adjustment and ion homeostasis amino acids soluble sugars polyamines and ammonium compounds are among the osmotically active substances that help to modify osmotic balance soluble sugars the main contributors to osmotic adjustment under drought stress are important in regulating metabolism and development of crops kuang et al 2017 hao et al 2020 in this study the application of ha increased the contents of soluble sugar in maize leaves for zd958 and xy335 under drought stress fig 4 moreover one glycogen phosphorylase glgp gene which was a catabolic enzyme of starch was up regulated after ha addition under drought fig 9 these results are in agreement with the studies of lee et al 2008 showing that water deficit triggers starch degradation besides for zd958 the trehalose content of zh1w1 was significantly higher than that of zh0w1 fig 4c under drought conditions ha application regulated the trehalose synthesis pathway and the tpp gene was up regulated driving the transformation of trehalose 6 phosphate to trehalose fig 9 trehalose is an osmoprotective sugar that can help cells with osmotic stress by stabilizing membranes and proteins djilianov et al 2005 ingram and bartels 1996 however a significant increase in trehalose did not find in xy335 after ha addition in addition the proline and betaine in maize leaves for zd958 and xy335 were increased by application of ha under drought stress fig 5 the significant change of the osmotically active compounds implied that maize adaptively responds to soil drought after ha addition which may be a biochemical mechanism helping maize to enhance resistance to drought changes in hormonal balance may be to blame for plant growth reduction during drought stress min et al 2016 fig 3 hormones even at an extremely low level play an important role in plant growth development and response to abiotic stresses i e drought aba based root to shoot chemical transmission which causes partial stomatal closure and slowing of leaf expansion development lowering water loss through transpiration is thought to be one of the underlying processes of enhanced wue under drought stress setter et al 2010 however the results of this investigation revealed that ha spray lowered the aba content of maize leaf the aba biosynthesis related genes arabidopsis aldehyde oxidase 3 aao3 and 9 cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases nced were down regulated in the treatments with ha application table s4 with less irrigation stomatal conductance and transpiration rate did not decrease significantly table 3 in addition ha application increased iaa content in zd958 and xy335 under drought conditions the iaa signaling pathway is involved in cell division and plant growth the aux iaa genes which are a key component of the auxin mediated regulatory networks and play an important regulatory role in maintaining the stable development of plants were up regulated with the application of ha under drought conditions the up regulated expression of iaa with ha application maintained plant photosynthetic efficiency delayed senescence and stimulated primary plant growth under drought stress li et al 2018 humic acid mediated osmotic adjustment and hormonal balance may delay leaf senescence and protect photosynthetic functions under drought stress chaves et al 2009 in this study ha application improved maize photosynthesis by increasing leaf chlorophyll spad value and photosynthesis rate according to fig s6 ha application enhances plant photosensitivity by regulating the expression of the lhc‚Ö± genes of the light harvesting antenna complexes allen and forsberg 2001 the antenna complexes absorb sunlight and transfer the excitation energy to the core complexes of ps ii and ps i driving photosynthetic electron transport jenny et al 2003 in addition the peripheral subunits psbp and psbq which are responsible for stabilizing the oxygen evolving complex were up regulated with the application of ha which would be conducive to h2o decomposition o2 production proton accumulation and electron generation li and liu 2018 this was evidenced by the increased fv fm in zd958 and xy335 with ha application under drought stress table 3 the generated electrons would pass sequentially through the ps domain plastoquinone pool cytochrome b6f and plastocyanin and then be transferred to ferredoxin by ps i the ha mediated up regulation of pete genes was beneficial to electron transfer in addition ha application stimulated atp synthase activity and up regulated the expression of Œ≥ atpase as a subunit of atp synthase Œ≥ atpase participates in catalyzing the production of energy storing atp and facilitates electron transport in both ps i and ps ii sun et al 2019 yamori et al 2011 the atp produced in the light reaction process provides energy for the dark reaction process and promotes the fixation and conversion of co2 into bioavailable carbohydrates sun et al 2019 the calvin cycle is the primary carbon fixation mechanism the carboxylation of rubp which is the first step of the calvin cycle is catalyzed by rubisco rubisco activity in zd958 and xy335 was boosted in this work when ha application was applied under drought conditions fig 2 the prk enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of d ribulose 5 phosphate to create rubp which is the last and also the rate limiting step of the calvin cycle sun et al 2019 determining plant metabolic rate and growth miziorko et al 2000 in zd958 and xy335 ha increased prk content and activity improving photosynthesis and biomass production and ultimately increasing maize grain yield under drought stress 4 3 deficit irrigation in the two maize genotypes the amount of irrigation had a considerable impact on grain production in both zd958 and xy335 and was significantly reduced during drought stress however water management in the face of limited water resources agricultural water productivity yield per unit water used by the crop should be prioritized over yield comas et al 2019 attia et al 2021 the yield increase was a result of both ha application and the difference in irrigation amount maize grain yield was 149 3 g pot 1 and 136 1 g pot 1 in zd958 and xy335 with ha applied at 45 kg ha 1 under mild drought stress table s5 which were higher than that without ha applied under well watered conditions this is maybe that the moderate drought stress treatment improved soil aeration and root growth compared with the well watered treatment sun et al 2012 therefore more nutrients were absorbed and higher yields were achieved in addition deficit irrigation promoted root water absorption and improved wue qu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 it is worth noting that the yield of zd958 was higher than that of xy335 at the w2 irrigation level moderate water stress this may be related to the higher expression levels of genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation in zd958 compared with xy335 then assimilating co2 into organic matter using light energy in the photosynthesis process hence deficit irrigation as a new water saving irrigation method should be studied with soil amendment e g ha together with different crops in the future researches to promote the sustainable development of agricultural water management 5 conclusion the effects of ha treatment on maize growth yield and wue under drought stress were examined in this study the results showed that applying ha to soil improved the formation of macro aggregates water content and nutrient availability in soil additionally ha application increased the contents of osmotically active solutes and endogenous hormones promoting drought resistance of maize moreover ha application improved photosynthesis and biomass production when ha was applied under drought stress the yields of both genotypes were lower compared with no ha application under well watered conditions but ha application increased the yield of zd958 and xy335 under drought stress by 19 7 and 14 3 respectively taken together this research lays the groundward for understanding the mechanism of maize drought resistance as well as a valuable and viable technique for enhancing crop water productivity in face of water shortage furthermore deficit irrigation at the field level under various agro climatic conditions with varying crops and soils types should be investigated in the future as it may help crops maintain yield with less water which is especially important for buffering crops against yield losses due to end of season water shortages in water limited areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9641,managed aquifer recharge mar can play an important role in agricultural water management and productivity where suitable aquifers exist yet while the benefits and costs of surface water storage have been extensively reported the benefits and costs of mar have been under reported and poorly conceptualised to date in this study of ten potential mar schemes in wet dry tropical climates of northern australia the estimated levelized costs ranged from us 0 04 to 0 36 m3 for mar schemes of 0 6 5 mm3 y capacity the type of mar scheme had the largest influence on cost resulting in the following order of increasing cost for 1 mm3 y schemes recharge release infiltration basin recharge weir aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr aquifer storage and recovery asr seawater intrusion barrier infiltration type schemes were typically lower cost than well injection scheme scale end use and experience with similar schemes were also key influences on cost a five fold increase in scale reduced the levelized cost of asr by 60 conceptualisation allows comparison across dissimilar schemes and revealed significant costs 20 100 of operating associated with approvals and monitoring required for risk based scheme development and operation mar can facilitate conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for improved agricultural water management dams typically provide considerably larger storages which results in lower levelized costs with estimates of 0 03 to 0 18 m3 for options annual yield 55 1248 mm3 in the same study area mar is more favoured in areas of low relief offers the benefit of reducing evaporative losses and is well suited to mosaic irrigation with incremental development and relatively low capital expenditure which may be attractive for agricultural irrigation graphical abstract ga1 keywords managed aquifer recharge water banking levelized cost capital cost operating cost northern australia 1 introduction there is considerable interest to improve agricultural water management internationally molden et al 2010 irrigated agriculture represents 20 of cultivated land and contributes 40 of food production globally world bank 2020 water is a critical resource to support global food production alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 and thus improved agricultural water management is considered an opportunity to support irrigated agriculture food production and economic progress biswas 2012 water scarcity is a persistent and increasing issue for agriculture in australia and future climate predictions are expected to exacerbate the effects of water scarcity kelly et al 2019 northern australia makes a particularly interesting case study because the majority of rivers are unregulated petheram et al 2018 and consequently there is an unique opportunity to strategically plan future water and irrigated agricultural development agricultural initiatives in the largely unpopulated vast expanse of northern australia face numerous challenges and have had varied success in the past ash et al 2017 the north of australia is characterised by a wet dry tropical climate with a high seasonality and high inter annual variability of rainfall charles et al 2016 and an inter annual variability of runoff that is higher than other parts of the world with a similar mean annual rainfall petheram et al 2008 the highly seasonal rainfall and runoff and the challenges associated with trafficability during the wet season and flood risk mean that in many parts of northern australia cropping during the dry season is preferable this however requires water to be stored into the dry season and depending upon the variability of flow in the river and the required reliability of irrigation water stored water may also need to be carried over across several years managed aquifer recharge mar uses aquifers to store water and is defined as the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit dillon 2005 storing water in aquifers can contribute to planned conjunctive water management to increase the security of water supply this approach sometimes referred to as water banking has benefits which include recharging depleted aquifers to manage overdraft and increasing the reliability of supply during dry periods gonzalez et al 2020 knapton et al 2019 reducing evaporative losses in areas where potential evaporation is high such as in northern australia where potential evaporation exceeds 1800 mm y charles et al 2016 creating strategic water reserves for the future knapton et al 2019 and improving water quality dillon et al 2010 donn et al 2020 page et al 2018 mar can be achieved with a range of recharge techniques dillon 2005 mar has been used successfully in over 30 countries for the storage and treatment of water dillon 2005 and has reached an estimated 10 km3 per year dillon et al 2019 despite growth in mar over the last 60 years mar contributes less than 3 of the aggregate volume of groundwater extraction in countries where mar is reported dillon et al 2019 suggesting there is substantial opportunity for further growth of this technique in agricultural water management presently groundwater is a primary source of water supply for domestic 36 agricultural 42 and industrial 27 use globally d√∂ll et al 2012 among water supply augmentation options such as building dams water recycling and desalination mar appears to be an underutilized potential solution to ameliorate pressure on groundwater and achieve future water security one reason often cited for the poor uptake is uncertainty regarding the economics of mar maliva 2014 parsons et al 2012 ross and hasnain 2018 zheng et al 2021 the absence of published economic information may be attributed to various factors including the site specificity of mar schemes and the influence of hydrogeological setting and mar type on cost and the difficulty in monetizing benefits which extend beyond water supply and security to include environmental and social benefits in a business case maliva 2014 to address the uncertainty regarding the economics of mar this study i estimates the costs of ten potential mar schemes applying six different mar types across three geographically distinct regions in northern australia to address the uncertainty regarding the economics of mar this study ii assesses mar scheme costs based on common key components that can be identified in all types of mar iii includes the costs of risk based scheme development and operation and iv assesses the factors affecting cost and their impact on capital and operating expenditure finally the role of mar is discussed in relation to surface storage and conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater 2 methods 2 1 mar components this study reports the estimated capital operating and levelized costs for ten potential mar schemes for each mar scheme the costs are conceptualised within seven generalised components that can be identified within all mar schemes regardless of the hydrogeological setting and mar type 1 source water capture 2 pre treatment 3 recharge 4 aquifer storage 5 recovery of stored water 6 post treatment and 7 end use s fig 1 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 capture zone 1 recharge 3 subsurface storage 4 and recovery 5 costs refer to the cost of harvesting water for recharge recharging the aquifer e g via infiltration basin or injection well storing water and recovering water for use e g via a recovery well pre 2 and post 6 treatment allows for treatment prior to recharge or after recovery and prior to use end use 7 costs are less commonly reported and include the costs associated with risk based scheme development and operation in accordance with the australian mar guidelines nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 such as investigations to obtain health and environmental regulatory approvals and ongoing monitoring assessing the costs of the ten proposed mar schemes in relation to these seven common components illustrates an approach for robust and comparable cost estimates across differing hydrogeological and operating conditions but without the influence of socio economic factors that can arise when making international comparisons ross 2021 this standardised approach is necessary to allow comparison between scheme types and address uncertainty in mar scheme long term costs that may hinder uptake of this method for storing water using this framework the costs of mar schemes were assessed across three regions of northern australia i fitzroy catchment in western australia ii darwin catchments adelaide finniss mary and wildman in the northern territory and iii mitchell catchment in queensland these three regions are shown in comparison to the location of existing mar schemes in australia which are predominantly located within southern australia fig 2 current water resource management geographical and hydrogeological features and socioeconomic and environmental considerations influence the type of mar schemes considered ten potential schemes were considered within a pre feasibility assessment including two in the fitzroy catchment five in the darwin catchments and three in the mitchell catchment table 1 six different types of mar were included and where possible infiltration based schemes were given priority due to their typically lower cost than well injection type schemes ross and hasnain 2018 the intention was to minimise costs to assist viability for agricultural water management as well as higher value uses such as drinking water supply and water security maliva 2014 while three schemes were explored for their potential to support urban water supply all schemes and mar types can be applied for agricultural water management if deemed to be commercially viable scheme capacity was 1 mm3 y aside from one recharge weir darwin with a capacity of 0 6 mm3 y and one larger capacity scheme asr large darwin of 5 mm3 y it was assumed that 100 of the injected volume would be available to recover source water availability remains to be confirmed cost information for mar using recharge weirs was informed by a pioneering recharge weir on the ashburton river in the pilbara region of wa in operation since 2011 the indicative costs of this project were estimated in two ways i with high investigative costs required for a novel project in a new region and ii with reduced investigative costs due to a level of confidence built from experience which is applicable to subsequent weirs in the same region extensive investigations were required to demonstrate technical feasibility and obtain approvals for the pioneering recharge weir on the ashburton river which resulted in a levelized cost of approximately 0 13 m3 it is estimated that subsequent weirs in the same region would benefit from the experience of the initial scheme and require less investigations prior to operation potentially reducing the ongoing cost of recharge weirs by an estimated 23 to 0 10 m3 vanderzalm et al 2018 2 1 1 fitzroy catchment western australia the fitzroy catchment occupies an area of 94 000 km2 and the main land use is pastoralism 95 characterised by large grazing leases with cattle feeding on native pastures shrubs and introduced forages and legumes nature conservation and indigenous protected areas cover the remaining area population is sparse and the two main population centres are derby population 3261 abs 2013a and fitzroy crossing population 1144 abs 2013b the fitzroy catchment has a climate characterised by a highly distinctive wet and dry season for the 125 year historical period 1 september 1890 31 august 2015 the mean annual rainfall at fitzroy crossing was 552 mm with approximately 93 of annual rain falling during the wet season months 1 november to 30 april charles et al 2016 in this catchment groundwater within a sub artesian regional scale groundwater system is abundant and represents the most prospective initial means of developing water resources of the catchment although there are a number of topographically and hydrologically suitable locations within the catchment for large instream dams their construction would be highly contentious due to their potential to inundate culturally and ecologically sensitive areas petheram et al 2018 and alter water dependent ecosystems downstream pollino et al 2018 similarly instream types of mar e g recharge weirs were not considered in this region groundwater is used for town water supply in derby and the quality of this resource is at risk to seawater intrusion morgan and werner 2015 approximately 7 of the fitzroy catchment was assessed to have promise for mar vanderzalm et al 2018 and based on the hydrogeology of the catchment two potential mar schemes were examined 1 infiltration basin scheme this scheme would comprise an offstream infiltration basin and ten extraction bores each up to approximately 50 m deep as there are few existing groundwater extraction bores that could be used the basin would be situated in a thick alluvial aquifer overlying an unconfined section of the wallal sandstone aquifer with groundwater salinity around 1000 mg l tds and near a non perennial reach of a river from which recharge will be sourced pre treatment is not required but maintenance of the infiltration surface e g basin scraping is assumed to be necessary on an annual basis to maintain sustainable infiltration rates post treatment is not required for irrigation use 2 seawater intrusion barrier scheme this scheme would comprise a series of ten injection bores approximately 200 m deep to create a seawater intrusion barrier in the lower erskine sandstone aquifer while groundwater from this aquifer is currently used to supply drinking water to derby seawater intrusion barriers can be used to mitigate the impacts of groundwater extraction regardless of end use pre treatment filtration is required to prevent clogging of the injection well while recovery is not intended as the mar scheme is creating a hydraulic barrier the levelized cost is an indicative estimate based on the potential to recover 1 mm3 y it is possible this resource could contribute to derby s drinking water supply and in this case post treatment and recovery would be as per the current arrangement for the town water supply i e sunk costs 2 1 2 darwin catchments northern territory the darwin catchments comprise the finniss adelaide mary and wildman river basins which collectively encompass an area of about 30 000 km2 the city of darwin is located within the finniss river basin and is the capital of the northern territory the greater darwin region has a population of 140 368 while the total nt population is 245 079 abs 2014 the main land use in the study area is conservation 53 followed by grazing 31 farming 7 and urban or peri urban 2 the finniss and adelaide rivers are critical for darwin s domestic water supply with about 85 of darwin s reticulated urban and industrial supply sourced from the darwin river dam and the remaining 15 extracted from the koolpinah dolostone aquifer knapton et al 2019 the darwin catchments are characterised by a distinctive wet and dry season due to their location in the australian summer monsoon belt the mean annual rainfall averaged over the darwin catchments for the 125 year historical period 1 september 1890 31 august 2015 was 1423 mm approximately 95 of rain falls in the darwin catchments during the wet season months november to april charles et al 2016 approximately 26 of the darwin catchments were assessed to have promise for mar vanderzalm et al 2018 within aquifers currently developed for water supply based on the hydrogeology of the region five conceptual mar schemes were developed to explore the breadth of mar technology that may be applicable to the darwin catchments 1 aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr scheme this scheme would comprise ten injection bores each approximately 40 m in depth the purpose of the injection of available surface water is to augment a stressed groundwater resource in the koolpinyah dolostone aquifer from which water is currently extracted for domestic peri urban and urban and irrigation use injection would occur in the vicinity of current groundwater use where the aquifer is typically unconfined knapton 2010 pre treatment filtration would be required to prevent clogging of the injection wells recovery would occur through existing groundwater extraction wells and additional post treatment would not be required 2 aquifer storage and recovery asr large scheme this scheme would comprise 16 injection and recovery wells asr refers to the use of the same well for injection and recovery each approximately 40 m in depth as per the astr scheme the purpose of the injection of available surface water is to augment the groundwater resource in the koolpinyah dolostone aquifer furthermore it allows the current extraction for urban supply to be relocated as the proposed asr wells are located to the north of the current groundwater use where the aquifer is thought to be confined knapton 2010 this scheme has a larger capacity than the others and assumes a higher injection rate under confined aquifer conditions pre treatment filtration would be required to prevent clogging of the asr wells agricultural and urban end uses are possible for urban supply post treatment would be required and it is assumed that this would be provided by the existing water treatment plant for darwin 3 aquifer storage and recovery asr small scheme this scheme comprises ten injection and recovery wells each approximately 40 m deep like the astr and large asr schemes outlined above surface water from urban areas would be injected into the dolostone aquifer beneath palmerston a satellite city of darwin to augment the existing groundwater resource pre treatment filtration would be required to prevent clogging of the asr wells post treatment would not be required for non potable urban use 4 recharge release scheme this scheme would utilise the existing darwin river dam and no additional infrastructure would be required surface water from the darwin river dam would be released using an existing outlet on the dam into the darwin river to infiltrate through the river bed in non perennial reaches downstream of the dam to enhance natural recharge to the dolostone aquifer for domestic and irrigation use the intended release represents less than 3 of the dam s sustainable annual yield of 36 7 mm3 y storage capacity 350 mm3 no pre or post treatment would be required and the recovery of water would occur through existing groundwater extraction wells 5 recharge weir scheme this scheme would comprise a recharge weir in fluvial deposits overlying a fractured rock aquifer and six recovery bores each approximately 40 m deep a 6 m high weir on snake creek 10 m wide was recommended and costed previously dames and moore 1992 it is assumed that post treatment for drinking water supply would occur through the existing water treatment plant 2 1 3 mitchell catchment queensland the mitchell catchment encompasses an area of 72 000 km2 and is sparsely populated with no major urban population centres the largest settlements are the towns of chillagoe population 192 abs 2013c dimbulah population 1414 abs 2013d and kowanyama population 1031 abs 2013e the main land use is pastoralism 95 characterised by large grazing leases with cattle grazing on native pastures and shrubs with little clearing of trees to support sown and improved pastures or crops conservation reserves are the second largest land use but comprise only 3 of the catchment the mitchell catchment is characterised by a distinctive wet and dry season due to its location in the australian summer monsoon the mean annual rainfall over the 125 year historical period 1890 2015 averaged across the catchment was 996 mm with close to 90 of rain falling during the wet season november to april charles et al 2016 approximately 13 of the mitchell catchment was assessed to have promise for mar vanderzalm et al 2018 and three mar schemes were examined in the catchment all situated within quaternary alluvial aquifers 1 recharge weir scheme this scheme would comprise a weir 3 m high and up to 50 m wide and ten groundwater extraction bores each about 20 m deep as there are few existing groundwater extraction bores within these aquifers the weir would need to be sited in a non perennial reach of river and would detain runoff events which could infiltrate through the wetted surface upstream of the weir the detention of water in the weir pool provides particulate settling but contributes to clogging of infiltration surface no pre treatment is required but remediation of clogging may be required after several years of operation no post treatment would be required for irrigation use 2 recharge release scheme this scheme would comprise ten groundwater extraction bores of assumed average depth of 10 m within an alluvial aquifer downstream of a dam without an existing dam recharge release would not be proposed as an economically viable options for agriculture therefore for the purposes of this comparison it is assumed that the dam would be built for an alternative use and consequently the cost of the dam is not included in this scheme the scheme would need to be sited in a non perennial reach of a river water from the dam would be released with the intent that it infiltrates into the river bedsands and into the alluvial aquifer it is assumed that a dam s reservoir would assist settling particulate that may reduce the infiltration characteristics of downstream bed sands and hence it is assumed no pre treatment would be required no post treatment would be required for irrigation use 3 infiltration basin scheme this scheme would comprise an offstream infiltration basin and ten groundwater extraction bores each assumed to be 20 m deep the offstream infiltration basin would need to overlie a thick alluvial aquifer in close proximity to a non perennial reach of river pre treatment is not required but maintenance of the infiltration surface e g basin scraping is assumed to be necessary on an annual basis no post treatment would be required for irrigation use 2 2 mar economic assessment the recycled water economic assessment tool marsden jacob associates 2013 was used to calculate capital operating and levelized costs for each of the ten mar schemes levelized cost is the constant level of revenue necessary each year to recover all the capital operating and maintenance costs over the assumed life of the project using an assumed discount rate divided by the annual volume of water supply levelized cost or benefit is commonly used in the water industry as it allows options with different capacities to be compared on a like for like basis wsaa 2020 this full cost recovery approach is consistent with the australian national water initiative pricing principles nrmmc 2010 here it is not feasible to quantify benefits without development of the scheme design operation and end use supplementary material in table s 1 and table s 2 provide a summary of the general assumptions and base costs applied to the mar scheme cost estimates the capital and operating cost estimates are presented in relation to the seven components of a mar scheme nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 to demonstrate how each of these components contributes to the overall cost of a mar scheme table s 2 indicates which of the seven mar components costs were attributed to costs are reported in us 2020 including those reported elsewhere and used for comparative purposes 3 results total capital costs for the ten potential mar schemes ranged from approximately us 200 000 to 3600 000 while operating costs varied between 20 000 y and 260 000 y fig 3 annual operating costs were between 3 and 19 of capital costs levelized cost ranged from 0 04 to 0 36 m3 aud 0 05 0 51 m3 for schemes of 0 6 5 mm3 y capacity fig 4 excluding the seawater intrusion barrier the levelized cost of water supply via injection wells was up to 0 25 m3 and for infiltration schemes only was up to 0 17 m3 while no provision was made for land acquisition the cost of infrastructure to transfer water from the source to the mar site or from the mar site to the end use this was consistent in the economic assessment for each scheme and therefore does not impact on the relative costs fig 4 a summary of all the calculated mar scheme costs is in table 2 fig 5 presents the relative contribution of each mar component to capital and operating costs for different categories of mar type recharge release infiltration basin recharge weir and injection wells asr astr seawater intrusion barrier for potential schemes in this study the recharge component accounts for up to 90 of capital cost and 61 of operating with the highest costs incurred for well based injection schemes i e asr astr sea water intrusion barrier for infiltration schemes the recharge infrastructure represents between 28 and 77 of capital expenditure while for injection schemes this component consistently dominates capital costs 88 90 recovery costs contribute up to 48 of capital and 39 of operating and are typically higher for well based schemes recovery costs are likely to decrease if groundwater use is developed prior to mar i e can then use existing wells 4 discussion 4 1 cost comparisons the mar scheme levelized cost estimates table 2 are largely within the range reported by evans et al 2017 at 0 13 to 2 84 m3 for schemes of 0 5 28 mm3 y capacity in the northern territory and 0 06 to 0 21 m3 for schemes sized 1 4 mm3 y in western australia the calculated levelized costs are also in the broad range reported by ross 2021 and ross and hasnain 2018 for operational mar schemes globally which also illustrated the influence of source water and mar type on cost in an evaluation of 21 mar schemes in five countries most were operational ross and hasnain 2018 reported a mean levelized cost of 0 20 m3 for infiltration schemes with surface water 0 48 m3 for injection schemes with surface water 1 61 m3 for infiltration schemes with recycled water and 1 56 m3 for injection schemes with recycled water more recently ross 2021 found a volume weighted mean levelized cost of 0 17 m3 for eleven schemes across eight countries recharging surface water via infiltration and 0 82 m3 for six schemes across five countries recharging recycled water via infiltration and well injection four of the five examples of mar dedicated to agricultural water supply used infiltration types of mar while the cost of using recycled water to recharge the aquifer is typically higher than using surface water three of these five operational agricultural mar examples used recycled water as their source water presumably due to its attraction as a climate independent water resource assessment of cost in relation to scheme type can be influenced by socio economic factors ross 2021 similarly the results of this study also compare favourably with the median proposed pre commissioning stage levelized cost for mar in california of 0 36 m3 based on funding applications for mar with surface water stormwater recycled water or a blend of water sources perrone and rhode 2016 perrone and rhode 2016 found schemes using surface water to recharge the aquifer had the lowest median cost of 0 28 m3 and had the least variability in this study calculated costs are generally lower than the range of levelized costs reported for a potential mar scheme of comparable scale 0 9 mm3 y in southern australia e g khan et al 2008 khan et al 2008 estimated levelized costs of 0 46 to 1 00 m3 for infiltration schemes and 1 26 to 1 29 m3 for injection schemes this was inclusive of costs to transfer water to and from the mar scheme which were not included in this study and considerably higher estimates for filtration wells or scraping basins to manage clogging despite having higher costs estimates than the current study khan et al 2008 concluded that mar can be developed at less than half the capital cost of equivalent surface storage facilities without undesirable environmental consequences or significant evaporation losses 4 2 factors influencing mar scheme costs different types of mar within three regions of northern australia are compared it is apparent from fig 4 which displays levelized cost in increasing order that mar scheme type has greater influence on cost than the end use or the geographic location note that the intended end use may have a greater contribution to capital cost if construction of a water treatment plant was necessary mar via recharge release was the lowest cost option the highest cost was for the seawater intrusion barrier and can be explained by the high capital and operating cost for deep well injection targeting an aquifer that is used for drinking water supply and therefore requires the highest level of risk management to protect water quality three types of mar recharge release asr large scale and astr were assumed to have a mixed end use agriculture and urban use in the darwin catchments and vary considerably in cost 0 05 m3 0 10 m3 and 0 23 m3 respectively these levelized costs compare with the current urban water price in darwin of 1 40 m3 that also covers distribution costs and water utility overheads powerwater 2020 suggesting that mar may be economically viable for peri urban water supply allowing for the additional cost to transfer water to or from the mar scheme the same type of mar scheme has comparable costs across regions as illustrated by recharge release 0 04 0 05 m3 and recharge weirs 0 13 0 17 m3 in the mitchell and darwin catchments scheme scale was shown to influence the cost of asr schemes in dolostone aquifers in darwin where a five fold increase in scale reduced the unit capital cost of recharge infrastructure and the levelized cost by 60 0 10 m3 for 5 mm3 y compared to 0 25 m3 for 1 mm3 y some of this cost reduction can be attributed to aquifer properties as the larger scale scheme would be in an aquifer which allows higher injection rates the capital and operating costs are greatest for the 5 mm3 y asr scheme compared to 0 6 1 mm3 y schemes fig 4 but the larger scale of this operation results in a levelized cost that is 13 lower than the median levelized cost for all 10 schemes cooley and phurisamban 2016 also highlighted the importance of scheme scale on cost for centralised stormwater capture and use schemes in california by reporting median costs of 1 32 and 0 52 m3 for small 1 8 mm3 y and large scale 8 mm3 y respectively their reported reduction in unit cost is approximately 60 for a greater than four fold increase in capacity which is also comparable to the findings for northern australia the costs associated with recharge release reported here may seem high given that there is no recharge infrastructure required however monitoring and risk management costs have been included and in examples where groundwater is not currently exploited e g mitchell catchment the cost of recovery bores are also included groundwater is currently used in the darwin catchments and therefore the mar scheme costs do not include additional recovery infrastructure which reduces the capital cost of the same scheme type in darwin when compared to the mitchell region however mixed end use in darwin including urban and drinking water supply increases the water quality risk management requirements and associated operating costs for the same low cost type of mar the higher operating cost in the darwin catchments outweighs the lower capital cost in the mitchell catchment and results in higher levelized costs in darwin another economic consideration related to mar type may be the relative importance of capital expenditure versus ongoing operating costs fig 3 capital costs of example mar schemes up to 1 mm3 range from approximately 200 000 to 3600 000 with annual operating costs from 20 000 to 98 000 for all types of mar excluding the seawater intrusion barrier the capital costs for example schemes intended for agricultural end use ranged from 20 000 to 1300 000 with operating costs up to approximately 41 000 per year in general infiltration types of mar were associated with capital expenditure under 2 million for the schemes evaluated whereas well injection types of mar exceeded this amount similarly operating costs were lower for infiltration schemes and remained below 50 000 y while for well injection operating costs were typically below 100 000 y in some instances incentives or subsidies may be available to construct but not operate a scheme for example australian government infrastructure development funds have previously supported construction of mar schemes vanderzalm et al 2020a whereas operating costs are the responsibility of the scheme operator in this case levelized operating costs of 0 02 to 0 09 m3 excluding the seawater intrusion barrier are consistent with median irrigation water prices in australia of 0 09 m3 gupta et al 2020 and therefore are likely to be recovered from agriculture users while full cost recovery of construction and operating costs 0 04 to 0 25 m3 excluding the seawater intrusion barrier is consistent with the premium farmers are reportedly willing to pay for agricultural innovations 0 1 to 2 m3 olum et al 2020 and also the range of recent irrigation prices in australia 0 01 to 0 5 m3 gupta et al 2020 it is likely that mar would be most attractive to increase water security for higher value horticultural crops and buffer against price volatility gonzalez et al 2020 the ratio of operating to capital cost is highest for recharge release where the end use includes urban supply darwin as the capital costs are the smallest for urban supply there is an increased requirement for risk management through monitoring and the annual operating cost is almost twice that of a scheme for agricultural supply only mitchell capital and operating costs of 3400 000 and 265 000 are estimated for the larger scheme 5 mm3 despite the significant initial and ongoing investment in the larger asr scheme its levelized cost is around 40 that of 1 mm3 asr scheme in the same location all mar schemes require investigations to demonstrate viability and gain approval to proceed and incur ongoing costs to manage health environmental and operational risks here these are represented as operating costs assigned to component 7 end use water quality risk based operating costs represent greater than 90 of the operating costs for recharge release 65 78 for infiltration basins 51 81 for recharge weirs and 20 56 for injection well based mar schemes it is likely that over time and operational experience in a mar scheme that risk based monitoring requirements may be reduced similarly with experience and confidence with mar in a region the investigations to gain approval may also be reduced for subsequent projects thus the operating costs associated with end use should reduce with time as better information is collected and uncertainty is reduced other operating costs such as pumping costs for recharge well injection or recovery are not likely to decline with time conversely they may increase if clogging is observed all schemes that were not recharge releases included provision to manage clogging a prevalent operating risk in mar martin 2013 costing estimates were based on filtration prior to recharge to minimise the potential for physical clogging for all well injection type mar schemes infiltration based schemes using recharge weirs and infiltration basins included provisions for regular maintenance of infiltration surfaces in the case of recharge release it is assumed that detention in the dam prior to release provides adequate removal of suspended material an evaluation of the effectiveness of these generic clogging management strategies is recommended during scheme development construction and commissioning trials as site specific factors e g fine sediments or nutrients in the source water may deem pre treatment to be necessary well injection schemes can also incur significant pre treatment costs as clogging is more challenging to manage in injection wells than in infiltration schemes and therefore minimisation of clogging is a priority martin 2013 here filtration is assumed to provide adequate treatment of surface water for management of clogging but it is recommended that pre treatment requirements are assessed during scheme development investment in studies to understand the impact of clogging page et al 2014 vanderzalm et al 2020b and how it can be managed is more cost effective than remediation of irreversible clogging dillon et al 2016 pre treatment by filtration to manage clogging in injection wells is a minor cost burden for the examples provided 3 of capital or operating costs this assumes coarse grained aquifers with source water of high quality with low risk of causing clogging i e low nutrient and suspended solids concentrations advanced pre treatment for finer grained aquifers prior to well injection may include activated carbon filtration microfiltration and ph and eh adjustment e g page et al 2014 martin 2013 for infiltration based schemes clogging remediation e g desilting scraping of the infiltration surface can be performed as required the end use component can incur significant operating expenses when uses include drinking water supply as this requires more stringent measures to protect health and gain regulatory approval page et al 2010 perrone and rhode 2016 considered the difference between proposed and actual costs for the californian mar examples actual costs varied considerably and were reported to be both lower and greater than the interquartile range of estimated costs factors influencing differences between estimated and actual costs included revised feasibility studies adjusted contingency factors changes in environmental compliance and land costs and competitive bidding for construction uncertainty in cost estimates is expected for pre feasibility studies such as described here however progression from these pre feasibility costs to the better defined mar scheme pre commissioning stage nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 will also reduce uncertainty regarding the requirements for risk management and therefore allow confidence in proposed operational costs following the risk based approach in the australian mar guidelines nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 a mar scheme cannot proceed to commissioning phase until there is confidence that it poses an acceptably low risk with respect to both human health and environmental values at commissioning stage the requirements for risk management planning are well understood failure to address risks adequately in the pre commissioning stage of project development will incur increased costs prior to scheme operation and in the case of clogging management remediation costs are likely to significantly exceed avoided investigation costs dillon et al 2016 aside from this the greatest uncertainty in pre commissioning mar scheme cost estimates relate to project logistics and management especially in remote areas such as described in this study where mobilisation costs are very high 4 3 conjunctive use of surface and subsurface storage large dams typically provide storages at least one to two orders of magnitude greater than the mar schemes considered here so while capital costs can be higher they typically have lower levelized costs in a pre feasibility analysis petheram et al 2017 reported modelled levelized costs for two large potential dams near darwin for irrigation use with annual yields of 280 mm3 and 150 mm3 at 0 04 m3 and 0 06 m3 capital cost 130 140 million levelized cost for selected potential dams in the mitchell catchment 55 1248 mm3 ranged from 0 03 m3 to 0 18 m3 capital cost 185 790 million the mar examples are instead suited to smaller scale mosaic irrigation with incremental and relatively low capital expenditure opportunities to combine aquifer mar and surface storage should be evaluated particularly when groundwater and surface water resources are both used for water supply a conjunctive approach is more likely to optimise the harvesting of surface water supplies dillon and arshad 2016 gonzalez et al 2020 scanlon et al 2016 allowing targeted development where demand exists or is imminent in parallel with broad scale development over the longer term when large scale dam infrastructure is designed approved and funded release of water from a dam with the intent that it infiltrates through the river bed and into an alluvial aquifer recharge release is an example of where the surface and groundwater storages can be combined in nearby but contrasting landscape topographies while the volume of additional groundwater recharge may be slight in comparison to dam yield in the right hydrogeological setting the aquifer can be used to convey water to the users without surface distribution infrastructure there are many potential benefits of planned conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater as this increases flexibility and expands the options for agricultural water management leading to greater efficiency in water use evans and dillon 2018 this in turn may translate to increased drought resilience through potential multi year groundwater storage complementing shorter term surface reservoir storage gonzalez et al 2020 scanlon et al 2016 subsurface storage avoids net evaporative losses which are up to 40 per annum on average in shallow storages mdba 2019 mar can be subject to loss on recovery from aquifers when water is stored in an aquifer with groundwater of unsuitable quality for the intended end use in general this loss is based on groundwater salinity with no loss for fresh aquifers with low hydraulic gradient up to 20 loss if aquifers are brackish or with moderate gradient and high variable losses in saline aquifers ward et al 2009 however with good management losses even in highly saline groundwater can be minimised pyne 2005 zuurbier 2016 despite these limitations it is evident that mar is useful for agriculture maintaining and improving groundwater systems and increasing water security 5 conclusions this study is the first reported assessment of mar scheme costs based on common key components that can be identified in all types of mar a range of infiltration and well injection types of mar across northern australia are compared total estimated capital costs for ten potential mar schemes of 0 6 5 mm3 y capacity using six different types of mar ranged from approximately us 200 000 to 3600 000 while estimated operating costs varied between 20 000 and 260 000 y and estimated levelized cost ranged from 0 04 to 0 36 m3 the type of mar scheme had the largest influence on estimated scheme cost resulting in the following order of increasing cost for 1 mm3 y schemes recharge release infiltration basin recharge weir aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr aquifer storage and recovery asr seawater intrusion barrier infiltration schemes were typically estimated to have lower unit costs than well injection and therefore are considered most viable for agricultural water supply however a five fold increase in scale of asr was estimated to reduce the levelized cost by 60 this assessment considers a range of mar types suited to conjunctive water management in northern australia that clearly have different cost implications for agricultural water management importantly this study captures often neglected costs associated with health and environmental regulatory approvals in the end use component good investigations to assess the suitability of the aquifer and the scale design and viability of a scheme are vital for efficient and sustainable schemes and need to be budgeted end use accounted for 20 100 of operating costs with high value uses such as drinking water supply associated with more stringent requirements and highest cost mar schemes have potential to support agricultural water management mar is favoured in areas where suitable aquifers are present and land has low topographic relief and offers the benefit of reduced evaporative losses mar is also suited to mosaic irrigation

9641,managed aquifer recharge mar can play an important role in agricultural water management and productivity where suitable aquifers exist yet while the benefits and costs of surface water storage have been extensively reported the benefits and costs of mar have been under reported and poorly conceptualised to date in this study of ten potential mar schemes in wet dry tropical climates of northern australia the estimated levelized costs ranged from us 0 04 to 0 36 m3 for mar schemes of 0 6 5 mm3 y capacity the type of mar scheme had the largest influence on cost resulting in the following order of increasing cost for 1 mm3 y schemes recharge release infiltration basin recharge weir aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr aquifer storage and recovery asr seawater intrusion barrier infiltration type schemes were typically lower cost than well injection scheme scale end use and experience with similar schemes were also key influences on cost a five fold increase in scale reduced the levelized cost of asr by 60 conceptualisation allows comparison across dissimilar schemes and revealed significant costs 20 100 of operating associated with approvals and monitoring required for risk based scheme development and operation mar can facilitate conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for improved agricultural water management dams typically provide considerably larger storages which results in lower levelized costs with estimates of 0 03 to 0 18 m3 for options annual yield 55 1248 mm3 in the same study area mar is more favoured in areas of low relief offers

agricultural water management internationally molden et al 2010 irrigated agriculture represents 20 of cultivated land and contributes 40 of food production globally world bank 2020 water is a critical resource to support global food production alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 and thus improved agricultural water management is considered an opportunity to support irrigated agriculture food production and economic progress biswas 2012 water scarcity is a persistent and increasing issue for agriculture in australia and future climate predictions are expected to exacerbate the effects of water scarcity kelly et al 2019 northern australia makes a particularly interesting case study because the majority of rivers are unregulated petheram et al 2018 and consequently there is an unique opportunity to strategically plan future water and irrigated agricultural development agricultural initiatives in the largely unpopulated vast expanse of northern australia face numerous challenges and have had varied success in the past ash et al 2017 the north of australia is characterised by a wet dry tropical climate with a high seasonality and high inter annual variability of rainfall charles et al 2016 and an inter annual variability of runoff that is higher than other parts of the world with a similar mean annual rainfall petheram et al 2008 the highly seasonal rainfall and runoff and the challenges associated with trafficability during the wet season and flood risk mean that in many parts of northern australia cropping during the dry season is preferable this however requires water to be stored into the dry season and depending upon the variability of flow in the river and the required reliability of irrigation water stored water may also need to be carried over across several years managed aquifer recharge mar uses aquifers to store water and is defined as the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit dillon 2005 storing water in aquifers can contribute to planned conjunctive water management to increase the security of water supply this approach sometimes referred to as water banking has benefits which include recharging depleted aquifers to manage overdraft and increasing the reliability of supply during dry periods gonzalez et al 2020 knapton et al 2019 reducing evaporative losses in areas where potential evaporation is high such as in northern australia where potential evaporation exceeds 1800 mm y charles et al 2016 creating strategic water reserves for the future knapton et al 2019 and improving water quality dillon et al 2010 donn et al 2020 page et al 2018 mar can be achieved with a range of recharge techniques dillon 2005 mar has been used successfully in over 30 countries for the storage and treatment of water dillon 2005 and has reached an estimated 10 km3 per year dillon et al 2019 despite growth in mar over the last 60 years mar contributes less than 3 of the aggregate volume of groundwater extraction in countries where mar is reported dillon et al 2019 suggesting there is substantial opportunity for further growth of this technique in agricultural water management presently groundwater is a primary source of water supply for domestic 36 agricultural 42 and industrial 27 use globally d√∂ll et al 2012 among water supply augmentation options such as building dams water recycling and desalination mar appears to be an underutilized potential solution to ameliorate pressure on groundwater and achieve future water security one reason often cited for the poor uptake is uncertainty regarding the economics of mar maliva 2014 parsons et al 2012 ross and hasnain 2018 zheng et al 2021 the absence of published economic information may be attributed to various factors including the site specificity of mar schemes and the influence of hydrogeological setting and mar type on cost and the difficulty in monetizing benefits which extend beyond water supply and security to include environmental and social benefits in a business case maliva 2014 to address the uncertainty regarding the economics of mar this study i estimates the costs of ten potential mar schemes applying six different mar types across three geographically distinct regions in northern australia to address the uncertainty regarding the economics of mar this study ii assesses mar scheme costs based on common key components that can be identified in all types of mar iii includes the costs of risk based scheme development and operation and iv assesses the factors affecting cost and their impact on capital and operating expenditure finally the role of mar is discussed in relation to surface storage and conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater 2 methods 2 1 mar components this study reports the estimated capital operating and levelized costs for ten potential mar schemes for each mar scheme the costs are conceptualised within seven generalised components that can be identified within all mar schemes regardless of the hydrogeological setting and mar type 1 source water capture 2 pre treatment 3 recharge 4 aquifer storage 5 recovery of stored water 6 post treatment and 7 end use s fig 1 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 capture zone 1 recharge 3 subsurface storage 4 and recovery 5 costs refer to the cost of harvesting water for recharge recharging the aquifer e g via infiltration basin or injection well storing water and recovering water for use e g via a recovery well pre 2 and post 6 treatment allows for treatment prior to recharge or after recovery and prior to use end use 7 costs are less commonly reported and include the costs associated with risk based scheme development and operation in accordance with the australian mar guidelines nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 such as investigations to obtain health and environmental regulatory approvals and ongoing monitoring assessing the costs of the ten proposed mar schemes in relation to these seven common components illustrates an approach for robust and comparable cost estimates across differing hydrogeological and operating conditions but without the influence of socio economic factors that can arise when making international comparisons ross 2021 this standardised approach is necessary to allow comparison between scheme types and address uncertainty in mar scheme long term costs that may hinder uptake of this method for storing water using this framework the costs of mar schemes were assessed across three regions of northern australia i fitzroy catchment in western australia ii darwin catchments adelaide finniss mary and wildman in the northern territory and iii mitchell catchment in queensland these three regions are shown in comparison to the location of existing mar schemes in australia which are predominantly located within southern australia fig 2 current water resource management geographical and hydrogeological features and socioeconomic and environmental considerations influence the type of mar schemes considered ten potential schemes were considered within a pre feasibility assessment including two in the fitzroy catchment five in the darwin catchments and three in the mitchell catchment table 1 six different types of mar were included and where possible infiltration based schemes were given priority due to their typically lower cost than well injection type schemes ross and hasnain 2018 the intention was to minimise costs to assist viability for agricultural water management as well as higher value uses such as drinking water supply and water security maliva 2014 while three schemes were explored for their potential to support urban water supply all schemes and mar types can be applied for agricultural water management if deemed to be commercially viable scheme capacity was 1 mm3 y aside from one recharge weir darwin with a capacity of 0 6 mm3 y and one larger capacity scheme asr large darwin of 5 mm3 y it was assumed that 100 of the injected volume would be available to recover source water availability remains to be confirmed cost information for mar using recharge weirs was informed by a pioneering recharge weir on the ashburton river in the pilbara region of wa in operation since 2011 the indicative costs of this project were estimated in two ways i with high investigative costs required for a novel project in a new region and ii with reduced investigative costs due to a level of confidence built from experience which is applicable to subsequent weirs in the same region extensive investigations were required to demonstrate technical feasibility and obtain approvals for the pioneering recharge weir on the ashburton river which resulted in a levelized cost of approximately 0 13 m3 it is estimated that subsequent weirs in the same region would benefit from the experience of the initial scheme and require less investigations prior to operation potentially reducing the ongoing cost of recharge weirs by an estimated 23 to 0 10 m3 vanderzalm et al 2018 2 1 1 fitzroy catchment western australia the fitzroy catchment occupies an area of 94 000 km2 and the main land use is pastoralism 95 characterised by large grazing leases with cattle feeding on native pastures shrubs and introduced forages and legumes nature conservation and indigenous protected areas cover the remaining area population is sparse and the two main population centres are derby population 3261 abs 2013a and fitzroy crossing population 1144 abs 2013b the fitzroy catchment has a climate characterised by a highly distinctive wet and dry season for the 125 year historical period 1 september 1890 31 august 2015 the mean annual rainfall at fitzroy crossing was 552 mm with approximately 93 of annual rain falling during the wet season months 1 november to 30 april charles et al 2016 in this catchment groundwater within a sub artesian regional scale groundwater system is abundant and represents the most prospective initial means of developing water resources of the catchment although there are a number of topographically and hydrologically suitable locations within the catchment for large instream dams their construction would be highly contentious due to their potential to inundate culturally and ecologically sensitive areas petheram et al 2018 and alter water dependent ecosystems downstream pollino et al 2018 similarly instream types of mar e g recharge weirs were not considered in this region groundwater is used for town water supply in derby and the quality of this resource is at risk to seawater intrusion morgan and werner 2015 approximately 7 of the fitzroy catchment was assessed to have promise for mar vanderzalm et al 2018 and based on the hydrogeology of the catchment two potential mar schemes were examined 1 infiltration basin scheme this scheme would comprise an offstream infiltration basin and ten extraction bores each up to approximately 50 m deep as there are few existing groundwater extraction bores that could be used the basin would be situated in a thick alluvial aquifer overlying an unconfined section of the wallal sandstone aquifer with groundwater salinity around 1000 mg l tds and near a non perennial reach of a river from which recharge will be sourced pre treatment is not required but maintenance of the infiltration surface e g basin scraping is assumed to be necessary on an annual basis to maintain sustainable infiltration rates post treatment is not required for irrigation use 2 seawater intrusion barrier scheme this scheme would comprise a series of ten injection bores approximately 200 m deep to create a seawater intrusion barrier in the lower erskine sandstone aquifer while groundwater from this aquifer is currently used to supply drinking water to derby seawater intrusion barriers can be used to mitigate the impacts of groundwater extraction regardless of end use pre treatment filtration is required to prevent clogging of the injection well while recovery is not intended as the mar scheme is creating a hydraulic barrier the levelized cost is an indicative estimate based on the potential to recover 1 mm3 y it is possible this resource could contribute to derby s drinking water supply and in this case post treatment and recovery would be as per the current arrangement for the town water supply i e sunk costs 2 1 2 darwin catchments northern territory the darwin catchments comprise the finniss adelaide mary and wildman river basins which collectively encompass an area of about 30 000 km2 the city of darwin is located within the finniss river basin and is the capital of the northern territory the greater darwin region has a population of 140 368 while the total nt population is 245 079 abs 2014 the main land use in the study area is conservation 53 followed by grazing 31 farming 7 and urban or peri urban 2 the finniss and adelaide rivers are critical for darwin s domestic water supply with about 85 of darwin s reticulated urban and industrial supply sourced from the darwin river dam and the remaining 15 extracted from the koolpinah dolostone aquifer knapton et al 2019 the darwin catchments are characterised by a distinctive wet and dry season due to their location in the australian summer monsoon belt the mean annual rainfall averaged over the darwin catchments for the 125 year historical period 1 september 1890 31 august 2015 was 1423 mm approximately 95 of rain falls in the darwin catchments during the wet season months november to april charles et al 2016 approximately 26 of the darwin catchments were assessed to have promise for mar vanderzalm et al 2018 within aquifers currently developed for water supply based on the hydrogeology of the region five conceptual mar schemes were developed to explore the breadth of mar technology that may be applicable to the darwin catchments 1 aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr scheme this scheme would comprise ten injection bores each approximately 40 m in depth the purpose of the injection of available surface water is to augment a stressed groundwater resource in the koolpinyah dolostone aquifer from which water is currently extracted for domestic peri urban and urban and irrigation use injection would occur in the vicinity of current groundwater use where the aquifer is typically unconfined knapton 2010 pre treatment filtration would be required to prevent clogging of the injection wells recovery would occur through existing groundwater extraction wells and additional post treatment would not be required 2 aquifer storage and recovery asr large scheme this scheme would comprise 16 injection and recovery wells asr refers to the use of the same well for injection and recovery each approximately 40 m in depth as per the astr scheme the purpose of the injection of available surface water is to augment the groundwater resource in the koolpinyah dolostone aquifer furthermore it allows the current extraction for urban supply to be relocated as the proposed asr wells are located to the north of the current groundwater use where the aquifer is thought to be confined knapton 2010 this scheme has a larger capacity than the others and assumes a higher injection rate under confined aquifer conditions pre treatment filtration would be required to prevent clogging of the asr wells agricultural and urban end uses are possible for urban supply post treatment would be required and it is assumed that this would be provided by the existing water treatment plant for darwin 3 aquifer storage and recovery asr small scheme this scheme comprises ten injection and recovery wells each approximately 40 m deep like the astr and large asr schemes outlined above surface water from urban areas would be injected into the dolostone aquifer beneath palmerston a satellite city of darwin to augment the existing groundwater resource pre treatment filtration would be required to prevent clogging of the asr wells post treatment would not be required for non potable urban use 4 recharge release scheme this scheme would utilise the existing darwin river dam and no additional infrastructure would be required surface water from the darwin river dam would be released using an existing outlet on the dam into the darwin river to infiltrate through the river bed in non perennial reaches downstream of the dam to enhance natural recharge to the dolostone aquifer for domestic and irrigation use the intended release represents less than 3 of the dam s sustainable annual yield of 36 7 mm3 y storage capacity 350 mm3 no pre or post treatment would be required and the recovery of water would occur through existing groundwater extraction wells 5 recharge weir scheme this scheme would comprise a recharge weir in fluvial deposits overlying a fractured rock aquifer and six recovery bores each approximately 40 m deep a 6 m high weir on snake creek 10 m wide was recommended and costed previously dames and moore 1992 it is assumed that post treatment for drinking water supply would occur through the existing water treatment plant 2 1 3 mitchell catchment queensland the mitchell catchment encompasses an area of 72 000 km2 and is sparsely populated with no major urban population centres the largest settlements are the towns of chillagoe population 192 abs 2013c dimbulah population 1414 abs 2013d and kowanyama population 1031 abs 2013e the main land use is pastoralism 95 characterised by large grazing leases with cattle grazing on native pastures and shrubs with little clearing of trees to support sown and improved pastures or crops conservation reserves are the second largest land use but comprise only 3 of the catchment the mitchell catchment is characterised by a distinctive wet and dry season due to its location in the australian summer monsoon the mean annual rainfall over the 125 year historical period 1890 2015 averaged across the catchment was 996 mm with close to 90 of rain falling during the wet season november to april charles et al 2016 approximately 13 of the mitchell catchment was assessed to have promise for mar vanderzalm et al 2018 and three mar schemes were examined in the catchment all situated within quaternary alluvial aquifers 1 recharge weir scheme this scheme would comprise a weir 3 m high and up to 50 m wide and ten groundwater extraction bores each about 20 m deep as there are few existing groundwater extraction bores within these aquifers the weir would need to be sited in a non perennial reach of river and would detain runoff events which could infiltrate through the wetted surface upstream of the weir the detention of water in the weir pool provides particulate settling but contributes to clogging of infiltration surface no pre treatment is required but remediation of clogging may be required after several years of operation no post treatment would be required for irrigation use 2 recharge release scheme this scheme would comprise ten groundwater extraction bores of assumed average depth of 10 m within an alluvial aquifer downstream of a dam without an existing dam recharge release would not be proposed as an economically viable options for agriculture therefore for the purposes of this comparison it is assumed that the dam would be built for an alternative use and consequently the cost of the dam is not included in this scheme the scheme would need to be sited in a non perennial reach of a river water from the dam would be released with the intent that it infiltrates into the river bedsands and into the alluvial aquifer it is assumed that a dam s reservoir would assist settling particulate that may reduce the infiltration characteristics of downstream bed sands and hence it is assumed no pre treatment would be required no post treatment would be required for irrigation use 3 infiltration basin scheme this scheme would comprise an offstream infiltration basin and ten groundwater extraction bores each assumed to be 20 m deep the offstream infiltration basin would need to overlie a thick alluvial aquifer in close proximity to a non perennial reach of river pre treatment is not required but maintenance of the infiltration surface e g basin scraping is assumed to be necessary on an annual basis no post treatment would be required for irrigation use 2 2 mar economic assessment the recycled water economic assessment tool marsden jacob associates 2013 was used to calculate capital operating and levelized costs for each of the ten mar schemes levelized cost is the constant level of revenue necessary each year to recover all the capital operating and maintenance costs over the assumed life of the project using an assumed discount rate divided by the annual volume of water supply levelized cost or benefit is commonly used in the water industry as it allows options with different capacities to be compared on a like for like basis wsaa 2020 this full cost recovery approach is consistent with the australian national water initiative pricing principles nrmmc 2010 here it is not feasible to quantify benefits without development of the scheme design operation and end use supplementary material in table s 1 and table s 2 provide a summary of the general assumptions and base costs applied to the mar scheme cost estimates the capital and operating cost estimates are presented in relation to the seven components of a mar scheme nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 to demonstrate how each of these components contributes to the overall cost of a mar scheme table s 2 indicates which of the seven mar components costs were attributed to costs are reported in us 2020 including those reported elsewhere and used for comparative purposes 3 results total capital costs for the ten potential mar schemes ranged from approximately us 200 000 to 3600 000 while operating costs varied between 20 000 y and 260 000 y fig 3 annual operating costs were between 3 and 19 of capital costs levelized cost ranged from 0 04 to 0 36 m3 aud 0 05 0 51 m3 for schemes of 0 6 5 mm3 y capacity fig 4 excluding the seawater intrusion barrier the levelized cost of water supply via injection wells was up to 0 25 m3 and for infiltration schemes only was up to 0 17 m3 while no provision was made for land acquisition the cost of infrastructure to transfer water from the source to the mar site or from the mar site to the end use this was consistent in the economic assessment for each scheme and therefore does not impact on the relative costs fig 4 a summary of all the calculated mar scheme costs is in table 2 fig 5 presents the relative contribution of each mar component to capital and operating costs for different categories of mar type recharge release infiltration basin recharge weir and injection wells asr astr seawater intrusion barrier for potential schemes in this study the recharge component accounts for up to 90 of capital cost and 61 of operating with the highest costs incurred for well based injection schemes i e asr astr sea water intrusion barrier for infiltration schemes the recharge infrastructure represents between 28 and 77 of capital expenditure while for injection schemes this component consistently dominates capital costs 88 90 recovery costs contribute up to 48 of capital and 39 of operating and are typically higher for well based schemes recovery costs are likely to decrease if groundwater use is developed prior to mar i e can then use existing wells 4 discussion 4 1 cost comparisons the mar scheme levelized cost estimates table 2 are largely within the range reported by evans et al 2017 at 0 13 to 2 84 m3 for schemes of 0 5 28 mm3 y capacity in the northern territory and 0 06 to 0 21 m3 for schemes sized 1 4 mm3 y in western australia the calculated levelized costs are also in the broad range reported by ross 2021 and ross and hasnain 2018 for operational mar schemes globally which also illustrated the influence of source water and mar type on cost in an evaluation of 21 mar schemes in five countries most were operational ross and hasnain 2018 reported a mean levelized cost of 0 20 m3 for infiltration schemes with surface water 0 48 m3 for injection schemes with surface water 1 61 m3 for infiltration schemes with recycled water and 1 56 m3 for injection schemes with recycled water more recently ross 2021 found a volume weighted mean levelized cost of 0 17 m3 for eleven schemes across eight countries recharging surface water via infiltration and 0 82 m3 for six schemes across five countries recharging recycled water via infiltration and well injection four of the five examples of mar dedicated to agricultural water supply used infiltration types of mar while the cost of using recycled water to recharge the aquifer is typically higher than using surface water three of these five operational agricultural mar examples used recycled water as their source water presumably due to its attraction as a climate independent water resource assessment of cost in relation to scheme type can be influenced by socio economic factors ross 2021 similarly the results of this study also compare favourably with the median proposed pre commissioning stage levelized cost for mar in california of 0 36 m3 based on funding applications for mar with surface water stormwater recycled water or a blend of water sources perrone and rhode 2016 perrone and rhode 2016 found schemes using surface water to recharge the aquifer had the lowest median cost of 0 28 m3 and had the least variability in this study calculated costs are generally lower than the range of levelized costs reported for a potential mar scheme of comparable scale 0 9 mm3 y in southern australia e g khan et al 2008 khan et al 2008 estimated levelized costs of 0 46 to 1 00 m3 for infiltration schemes and 1 26 to 1 29 m3 for injection schemes this was inclusive of costs to transfer water to and from the mar scheme which were not included in this study and considerably higher estimates for filtration wells or scraping basins to manage clogging despite having higher costs estimates than the current study khan et al 2008 concluded that mar can be developed at less than half the capital cost of equivalent surface storage facilities without undesirable environmental consequences or significant evaporation losses 4 2 factors influencing mar scheme costs different types of mar within three regions of northern australia are compared it is apparent from fig 4 which displays levelized cost in increasing order that mar scheme type has greater influence on cost than the end use or the geographic location note that the intended end use may have a greater contribution to capital cost if construction of a water treatment plant was necessary mar via recharge release was the lowest cost option the highest cost was for the seawater intrusion barrier and can be explained by the high capital and operating cost for deep well injection targeting an aquifer that is used for drinking water supply and therefore requires the highest level of risk management to protect water quality three types of mar recharge release asr large scale and astr were assumed to have a mixed end use agriculture and urban use in the darwin catchments and vary considerably in cost 0 05 m3 0 10 m3 and 0 23 m3 respectively these levelized costs compare with the current urban water price in darwin of 1 40 m3 that also covers distribution costs and water utility overheads powerwater 2020 suggesting that mar may be economically viable for peri urban water supply allowing for the additional cost to transfer water to or from the mar scheme the same type of mar scheme has comparable costs across regions as illustrated by recharge release 0 04 0 05 m3 and recharge weirs 0 13 0 17 m3 in the mitchell and darwin catchments scheme scale was shown to influence the cost of asr schemes in dolostone aquifers in darwin where a five fold increase in scale reduced the unit capital cost of recharge infrastructure and the levelized cost by 60 0 10 m3 for 5 mm3 y compared to 0 25 m3 for 1 mm3 y some of this cost reduction can be attributed to aquifer properties as the larger scale scheme would be in an aquifer which allows higher injection rates the capital and operating costs are greatest for the 5 mm3 y asr scheme compared to 0 6 1 mm3 y schemes fig 4 but the larger scale of this operation results in a levelized cost that is 13 lower than the median levelized cost for all 10 schemes cooley and phurisamban 2016 also highlighted the importance of scheme scale on cost for centralised stormwater capture and use schemes in california by reporting median costs of 1 32 and 0 52 m3 for small 1 8 mm3 y and large scale 8 mm3 y respectively their reported reduction in unit cost is approximately 60 for a greater than four fold increase in capacity which is also comparable to the findings for northern australia the costs associated with recharge release reported here may seem high given that there is no recharge infrastructure required however monitoring and risk management costs have been included and in examples where groundwater is not currently exploited e g mitchell catchment the cost of recovery bores are also included groundwater is currently used in the darwin catchments and therefore the mar scheme costs do not include additional recovery infrastructure which reduces the capital cost of the same scheme type in darwin when compared to the mitchell region however mixed end use in darwin including urban and drinking water supply increases the water quality risk management requirements and associated operating costs for the same low cost type of mar the higher operating cost in the darwin catchments outweighs the lower capital cost in the mitchell catchment and results in higher levelized costs in darwin another economic consideration related to mar type may be the relative importance of capital expenditure versus ongoing operating costs fig 3 capital costs of example mar schemes up to 1 mm3 range from approximately 200 000 to 3600 000 with annual operating costs from 20 000 to 98 000 for all types of mar excluding the seawater intrusion barrier the capital costs for example schemes intended for agricultural end use ranged from 20 000 to 1300 000 with operating costs up to approximately 41 000 per year in general infiltration types of mar were associated with capital expenditure under 2 million for the schemes evaluated whereas well injection types of mar exceeded this amount similarly operating costs were lower for infiltration schemes and remained below 50 000 y while for well injection operating costs were typically below 100 000 y in some instances incentives or subsidies may be available to construct but not operate a scheme for example australian government infrastructure development funds have previously supported construction of mar schemes vanderzalm et al 2020a whereas operating costs are the responsibility of the scheme operator in this case levelized operating costs of 0 02 to 0 09 m3 excluding the seawater intrusion barrier are consistent with median irrigation water prices in australia of 0 09 m3 gupta et al 2020 and therefore are likely to be recovered from agriculture users while full cost recovery of construction and operating costs 0 04 to 0 25 m3 excluding the seawater intrusion barrier is consistent with the premium farmers are reportedly willing to pay for agricultural innovations 0 1 to 2 m3 olum et al 2020 and also the range of recent irrigation prices in australia 0 01 to 0 5 m3 gupta et al 2020 it is likely that mar would be most attractive to increase water security for higher value horticultural crops and buffer against price volatility gonzalez et al 2020 the ratio of operating to capital cost is highest for recharge release where the end use includes urban supply darwin as the capital costs are the smallest for urban supply there is an increased requirement for risk management through monitoring and the annual operating cost is almost twice that of a scheme for agricultural supply only mitchell capital and operating costs of 3400 000 and 265 000 are estimated for the larger scheme 5 mm3 despite the significant initial and ongoing investment in the larger asr scheme its levelized cost is around 40 that of 1 mm3 asr scheme in the same location all mar schemes require investigations to demonstrate viability and gain approval to proceed and incur ongoing costs to manage health environmental and operational risks here these are represented as operating costs assigned to component 7 end use water quality risk based operating costs represent greater than 90 of the operating costs for recharge release 65 78 for infiltration basins 51 81 for recharge weirs and 20 56 for injection well based mar schemes it is likely that over time and operational experience in a mar scheme that risk based monitoring requirements may be reduced similarly with experience and confidence with mar in a region the investigations to gain approval may also be reduced for subsequent projects thus the operating costs associated with end use should reduce with time as better information is collected and uncertainty is reduced other operating costs such as pumping costs for recharge well injection or recovery are not likely to decline with time conversely they may increase if clogging is observed all schemes that were not recharge releases included provision to manage clogging a prevalent operating risk in mar martin 2013 costing estimates were based on filtration prior to recharge to minimise the potential for physical clogging for all well injection type mar schemes infiltration based schemes using recharge weirs and infiltration basins included provisions for regular maintenance of infiltration surfaces in the case of recharge release it is assumed that detention in the dam prior to release provides adequate removal of suspended material an evaluation of the effectiveness of these generic clogging management strategies is recommended during scheme development construction and commissioning trials as site specific factors e g fine sediments or nutrients in the source water may deem pre treatment to be necessary well injection schemes can also incur significant pre treatment costs as clogging is more challenging to manage in injection wells than in infiltration schemes and therefore minimisation of clogging is a priority martin 2013 here filtration is assumed to provide adequate treatment of surface water for management of clogging but it is recommended that pre treatment requirements are assessed during scheme development investment in studies to understand the impact of clogging page et al 2014 vanderzalm et al 2020b and how it can be managed is more cost effective than remediation of irreversible clogging dillon et al 2016 pre treatment by filtration to manage clogging in injection wells is a minor cost burden for the examples provided 3 of capital or operating costs this assumes coarse grained aquifers with source water of high quality with low risk of causing clogging i e low nutrient and suspended solids concentrations advanced pre treatment for finer grained aquifers prior to well injection may include activated carbon filtration microfiltration and ph and eh adjustment e g page et al 2014 martin 2013 for infiltration based schemes clogging remediation e g desilting scraping of the infiltration surface can be performed as required the end use component can incur significant operating expenses when uses include drinking water supply as this requires more stringent measures to protect health and gain regulatory approval page et al 2010 perrone and rhode 2016 considered the difference between proposed and actual costs for the californian mar examples actual costs varied considerably and were reported to be both lower and greater than the interquartile range of estimated costs factors influencing differences between estimated and actual costs included revised feasibility studies adjusted contingency factors changes in environmental compliance and land costs and competitive bidding for construction uncertainty in cost estimates is expected for pre feasibility studies such as described here however progression from these pre feasibility costs to the better defined mar scheme pre commissioning stage nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 will also reduce uncertainty regarding the requirements for risk management and therefore allow confidence in proposed operational costs following the risk based approach in the australian mar guidelines nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 a mar scheme cannot proceed to commissioning phase until there is confidence that it poses an acceptably low risk with respect to both human health and environmental values at commissioning stage the requirements for risk management planning are well understood failure to address risks adequately in the pre commissioning stage of project development will incur increased costs prior to scheme operation and in the case of clogging management remediation costs are likely to significantly exceed avoided investigation costs dillon et al 2016 aside from this the greatest uncertainty in pre commissioning mar scheme cost estimates relate to project logistics and management especially in remote areas such as described in this study where mobilisation costs are very high 4 3 conjunctive use of surface and subsurface storage large dams typically provide storages at least one to two orders of magnitude greater than the mar schemes considered here so while capital costs can be higher they typically have lower levelized costs in a pre feasibility analysis petheram et al 2017 reported modelled levelized costs for two large potential dams near darwin for irrigation use with annual yields of 280 mm3 and 150 mm3 at 0 04 m3 and 0 06 m3 capital cost 130 140 million levelized cost for selected potential dams in the mitchell catchment 55 1248 mm3 ranged from 0 03 m3 to 0 18 m3 capital cost 185 790 million the mar examples are instead suited to smaller scale mosaic irrigation with incremental and relatively low capital expenditure opportunities to combine aquifer mar and surface storage should be evaluated particularly when groundwater and surface water resources are both used for water supply a conjunctive approach is more likely to optimise the harvesting of surface water supplies dillon and arshad 2016 gonzalez et al 2020 scanlon et al 2016 allowing targeted development where demand exists or is imminent in parallel with broad scale development over the longer term when large scale dam infrastructure is designed approved and funded release of water from a dam with the intent that it infiltrates through the river bed and into an alluvial aquifer recharge release is an example of where the surface and groundwater storages can be combined in nearby but contrasting landscape topographies while the volume of additional groundwater recharge may be slight in comparison to dam yield in the right hydrogeological setting the aquifer can be used to convey water to the users without surface distribution infrastructure there are many potential benefits of planned conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater as this increases flexibility and expands the options for agricultural water management leading to greater efficiency in water use evans and dillon 2018 this in turn may translate to increased drought resilience through potential multi year groundwater storage complementing shorter term surface reservoir storage gonzalez et al 2020 scanlon et al 2016 subsurface storage avoids net evaporative losses which are up to 40 per annum on average in shallow storages mdba 2019 mar can be subject to loss on recovery from aquifers when water is stored in an aquifer with groundwater of unsuitable quality for the intended end use in general this loss is based on groundwater salinity with no loss for fresh aquifers with low hydraulic gradient up to 20 loss if aquifers are brackish or with moderate gradient and high variable losses in saline aquifers ward et al 2009 however with good management losses even in highly saline groundwater can be minimised pyne 2005 zuurbier 2016 despite these limitations it is evident that mar is useful for agriculture maintaining and improving groundwater systems and increasing water security 5 conclusions this study is the first reported assessment of mar scheme costs based on common key components that can be identified in all types of mar a range of infiltration and well injection types of mar across northern australia are compared total estimated capital costs for ten potential mar schemes of 0 6 5 mm3 y capacity using six different types of mar ranged from approximately us 200 000 to 3600 000 while estimated operating costs varied between 20 000 and 260 000 y and estimated levelized cost ranged from 0 04 to 0 36 m3 the type of mar scheme had the largest influence on estimated scheme cost resulting in the following order of increasing cost for 1 mm3 y schemes recharge release infiltration basin recharge weir aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr aquifer storage and recovery asr seawater intrusion barrier infiltration schemes were typically estimated to have lower unit costs than well injection and therefore are considered most viable for agricultural water supply however a five fold increase in scale of asr was estimated to reduce the levelized cost by 60 this assessment considers a range of mar types suited to conjunctive water management in northern australia that clearly have different cost implications for agricultural water management importantly this study captures often neglected costs associated with health and environmental regulatory approvals in the end use component good investigations to assess the suitability of the aquifer and the scale design and viability of a scheme are vital for efficient and sustainable schemes and need to be budgeted end use accounted for 20 100 of operating costs with high value uses such as drinking water supply associated with more stringent requirements and highest cost mar schemes have potential to support agricultural water management mar is favoured in areas where suitable aquifers are present and land has low topographic relief and offers the benefit of reduced evaporative losses mar is also suited to mosaic irrigation with incremental and relatively low capital expenditure which may be attractive for developing agricultural areas or for higher value agriculture that requires a high level of water security

9642,irrigation is widely implemented in china to enhance grain production and ensure food security spatiotemporal information on irrigation is critically important but the existing global and regional irrigation products have a coarse spatial resolution low accuracy and short temporal coverage which is a knowledge gap to be filled generating explicit and accurate information on the spatial and temporal extent of irrigation is essential to underpin and facilitate water resource allocation and management as well as to understand catchment hydrology and evaluate irrigation infrastructure investment we proposed a two step strategy to map annual irrigated areas at 500 m resolution in china from 2000 to 2019 we first generated initial irrigation maps using modis data and statistical data mirad gi then we combined mirad gi the existing irrigation maps and land use cover products with irrigation information into an improved series of annual irrigation maps irrimap syn with constrained statistics afterwards pixel wise accuracy assessment for irrimap syn was conducted in four representative regions in three years the resultant irrigation dataset performed well with a mean overall accuracy of 0 89 and a kappa coefficient of 0 82 according to our annual irrigation maps the total irrigated area in china increased by 24 8 from 52 8 million ha in 2000 65 9 million ha in 2019 at a rate of 690 000 ha per year spatially irrigated croplands increased substantially in north china especially in xinjiang and heilongjiang land reclamation largely contributed to the increase in irrigation in north china a growing population and improved irrigation infrastructure also promoted the increase in irrigated areas as the first of its kind in the country our spatially explicit maps of irrigated croplands advance our understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of irrigation dynamics in china and are expected to contribute to sustainable water resource management and irrigation strategies in the face of climate change keywords annual irrigated areas irrigation dynamics modis data improved irrigation infrastructure water resource management 1 introduction irrigation has played an important role in promoting grain yield and ensuring food security over the past four decades and continues to expand to satisfy the global increase in demand for food mcdonald and girvetz 2013 however as the largest water consuming sector agricultural irrigation depletes about 70 of the world s total available freshwater cai and rosegrant 2002 cotterman et al 2017 scanlon et al 2012 which has led to many environmental problems such as water shortage zhou et al 2021 soil salinization and erosion dehaan and taylor 2002 wu et al 2014 and landslides watkinson and hall 2019 as one of the largest agricultural countries with limited water resources food production in china relies heavily on intensive irrigation posing great pressure on its water security e g the groundwater crisis in north china plain sun et al 2015 explicit and accurate information on the spatial and temporal extent of irrigation is essential to underpin and facilitate water resource allocation and management droogers and aerts 2005 as well as understand catchment hydrology zhang et al 2017a and evaluate irrigation infrastructure investment fao 2011 but scarce in china thus there is an urgent need to fill this knowledge gap over the last two decades remote sensing has become an advanced tool for monitoring irrigated lands ozdogan et al 2010 several attempts have been made to estimate the long term extent of irrigation at regional and global scales ketchum et al 2020 ozdogan et al 2006 pe√±a arancibia et al 2014 sharma et al 2018 for instance the global irrigation maps from 2001 to 2015 with a resolution of 5 deepak nagaraj et al 2021 the 250 m irrigation maps of india for 2000 2015 ambika et al 2016 30 m annual irrigation maps for the republican river basin in the us since 1984 deines et al 2019 and the conterminous us for 1997 2017 xie and lark 2021 however on one hand global time series irrigation maps cannot accurately reflect national and regional irrigated areas due to their coarse resolution on the other hand moderate or high resolution maps based on remote sensing based classification methods often suffer from undermined accuracy in humid areas deines et al 2019 because the signals of irrigated and rainfed crops are too similar to differentiate xie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 integrating agricultural statistics and remote sensing data provides an alternative to overcome the deficiency of approaches solely based on remote sensing brown and pervez 2014 pervez and brown 2010 shahriar pervez et al 2014 shrestha et al 2021 verburg et al 2011 for example lu et al 2020 used the synergy mapping method to develop a global map of croplands and the method was based on the fusion of multiple existing cropland maps and multi level statistics of croplands which was independent of training samples fritz et al 2011 ranked five existing land cover maps and assigned different weights based on expert knowledge or their assessed accuracies to produce the cropland map for africa in 2005 to the best of our knowledge the synergistic mapping method has not been used to produce national irrigation products many efforts to map irrigation at the regional and global scales have been made table 1 and those maps provide crucial preliminary information for the generation of new and improved irrigation maps they include the global map of irrigation areas version 5 0 gmia 5 0 siebert

map for china in 2016 xiang2016 xiang et al 2020 etc in this study we made full use of these available irrigation products to generate the new irrigation products we had three objectives for our study first we aimed to develop a new two step framework to generate annual irrigation maps of china at 500 m resolution for 2000 2019 through the synergy of remote sensing statistics and historical irrigation datasets second we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of irrigated croplands at the national provincial and catchment scales third we discussed the relationship between irrigated areas agricultural water consumption and water use efficiency and the underlying factors that drove the changes in irrigated areas to achieve these objectives we produced new irrigation maps by integrating remote sensing statistical data and existing irrigation maps i e gmia gripc iaaa gfsad and xiang2016 and lulc products i e nlcd cci lc and glc fcs our resultant irrigation maps irrimap syn were validated in four typical irrigated regions to our limited knowledge this is the first effort to generate national irrigation maps in china for the last two decades these maps could advance our understanding of the spatial and temporal pattern of irrigation in china and are useful for decision making and management of china s water resources 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 remote sensing data we used the terra modis surface spectral reflectance data product mod09a1 v6 as the primary data source to generate the initial irrigation maps with statistical data mod09a1 provided data for seven spectral bands at 500 m resolution and was corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses aerosols and rayleigh scattering the greenness index gi gitelson et al 2005 a proxy to indicate water stress and irrigation status ozdogan and gutman 2008 was calculated near infrared band divides green band as the primary indicator to generate the irrigation maps the gi time series was filtered to reduce outliers and interpolate missing values using the savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 2 1 2 statistical data of irrigation we collected all available irrigation statistics released by the national bureau of statistics of china nbs at the provincial municipal and county levels from 2000 to 2019 we took the following steps to produce a continuous set of time series irrigation statistical data first we used linear interpolation to fill temporal gaps in the data of some counties and prefectures in certain years second we used municipal or provincial level data for analyses when the county level statistical data were not available for the whole period such as some counties of heilongjiang and inner mongolia fig s1 third we calibrated the data for counties or prefectures whose administrative boundaries had changed or data source was diverse see text s1 finally we transformed the continuous time series irrigation data into shapefile format with arcgis 2 1 3 existing thematic irrigation maps among the numerous global and regional irrigation products we selected gmia m gripc gfsad global food security support analysis data iaaa and xiang2016 as the input datasets table 1 these products differed in spatial resolution data sources temporal coverage production methods and accuracy due to the coarse resolution of the gmia dataset we used the extended version gmia m with 1 km resolution produced by meier et al 2018 which was strongly correlated with the statistical data r 0 84 gripc used supervised classification with remote sensing climate and agricultural inventory data to generate a 500 m global map of irrigated rain fed and paddy croplands for 2005 with an overall accuracy of 69 salmon et al 2015 the gfsad was a nasa funded project to provide high resolution global cropland data and their water use to contribute to global food security in the twenty first century thenkabail et al 2009a it provided information on global cropland extent and irrigated versus rainfed cropping iaaa was developed for the asian and african regions to indicate irrigated and rainfed croplands which was available at 250 m resolution for 2000 and 2010 and was obtained from the international water management institute iwmi siddiqui et al 2016 xiang2016 was produced for mainland china in 2016 with an overall accuracy of 62 using statistical data mean annual precipitation modis land cover type data and surface reflectance data xiang et al 2020 2 1 4 lulc maps with irrigation information two long term lulc products nlcd cci lc and one two year product glc fcs were also selected to serve as a baseline for irrigated croplands table 1 the 100 m nlcd datasets in 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 were collected from the data center for resource and environmental sciences of the chinese academy of sciences they were generated using visual interpretation of landsat and cbers imagery liu et al 2014 and possessed high overall accuracies of over 90 liu et al 2005 2010 in the nlcd the paddy croplands type 11 referred to fields of rice and other paddy crops like lotus root thus all the paddy fields were considered as part of irrigated croplands with high confidence as the products had a five year interval we extended the valid time range by two years before and after the benchmark year of one product e g nlcd 2010 was used for 2008 2012 cci lc was produced by the european space agency esa climate change initiative and consisted of 22 1 level class types the accuracy of the classification of rain fed croplands by cci lc was 0 85 and that of the irrigated or post flooding croplands was 0 88 defourny et al 2016 this dataset was produced annually from 1992 to 2019 and provided valuable data with a high spatial and temporal resolution glc fcs was developed on the gee platform by integrating landsat imagery a global training dataset and local adaptive random forest models the glc fcs data shared the same class scheme with cci lc the overall accuracy of glc fcs under the classification scheme of 24 classes was 68 7 with a kappa coefficient of 0 662 zhang et al 2021a the sources of data used in our synergy mapping can be grouped into three parts table 1 the initial irrigation map mirad gi the existing thematic maps of irrigation and lulc maps containing irrigation information and annual statistical data the list of input datasets for each year was displayed in table s1 although there were slight differences in the temporal coverage among these input irrigation maps their differences had a minor impact on the final fused map as the inconsistency among the input datasets is much larger than the time difference lu et al 2017 preprocessing of the satellite based maps was conducted due to their differences both in their coordinate systems and spatial resolutions we used the albers equal area projected coordinate system with wgs84 datum as the base projection since the spatial resolution of these products varied from 30 m to 1000 m all maps were resampled to a standard resolution of 500 m we also used a unified cropland mask to exclude non agriculture areas within the satellite datasets for example the cropland mask of 2005 was applied for 2003 2007 table s1 since we assume the variation of cropland area is stable within five years 2 2 methods 2 2 1 initial irrigation maps for 2000 2019 using modis and statistical data mirad gi an intermediate irrigation dataset modis irrigated area dataset generated by gi mirad gi was first generated by fusing remote sensing and statistical data it is widely acknowledged that moisture stress in vegetation is strongly manifested in spectral indices of remote sensing related to chlorophyll content gitelson et al 2003 zarco tejada et al 2002 irrigated crops with very little or no soil moisture stress have a higher chlorophyll content than non irrigated crops with potential moisture stress ozdogan and gutman 2008 due to its high sensitivity to chlorophyll content gitelson et al 2003 the greenness index gi has been widely used as a proxy of the irrigation status of vegetation deines et al 2017 xie and lark 2021 all pixels within a county were ranked descending by annual peak gi value and the pixels with higher gi values were counted until the area of the selected pixels reached the statistical irrigation data fig 1 a more detailed description of this procedure could be found in pervez and brown 2010 afterwards mirad gi together with multiple available irrigation products and lulc maps were synergized into improved irrigation maps with constrained statistics as we demonstrate below 2 2 2 synergy irrigation mapping by fusing mirad gi statistics and multiple existing maps synergistic approaches mainly involve two categories agreement scoring methods fritz et al 2011 and regression methods see et al 2015 we adopted the former due to the difficulty in collecting a large number of ground samples to implement regression models the fundamental idea behind the synergy mapping method is to first determine the weight order of the input datasets then calculate the score based on the weighted order of the current products and finally sum the irrigated area within a specific level region to match the statistical area a suitable weight order of the input products is essential for the synergistic approach which usually depends on accuracy assessments of the input data or expert judgment in terms of the former approach fritz et al 2015 ranked different input datasets at the national level using crowdsourced data from geo wiki to create a map that reflects the likelihood that the grid cell contains croplands lu et al 2017 assessed the accuracy of existing cropland datasets by using cropland sampling point data from tsinghua university and visual interpretation of google earth images in addition the absolute difference of area between the input dataset and the statistics was also used to assess the accuracy of the input map lu et al 2020 when it is hard to collect validation points or confidence in the accuracy of the input dataset is worrisome expert judgment can also be adopted like fritz et al 2011 did in producing a cropland map for sub saharan african using five land cover data sets since it was hard to evaluate the input datasets based on massive in situ data we used accuracy and expert judgment fused method to rank the weight order based on the following rules datasets with higher known overall accuracy ranked higher in the weight order when accuracy information was absent we considered timeliness and spatial resolution take the 2010 input products for example the weight order was nlcd cci lc mirad gi iaaa and gfsad nlcd was a reliable product with an overall accuracy of over 0 90 for all class levels liu et al 2014 and the overall accuracy for irrigated or post flooding cropland in cci lc was 0 88 defourny et al 2016 thus nlcd ranked first followed by cci lc mirad gi the intermediate irrigation product we generated was closely connected to gi and statistical data and can represent the approximate distribution of irrigated croplands pervez and brown 2010 both iaaa and gfsad lacked an accuracy assessment so based on our rule the dataset with a higher spatial resolution ranked higher also through visual inspection we found that iaaa covered most irrigation hotspots in china and performed better than gfsad consequently iaaa and gfsad ranked 4th and 5th respectively the principle of the synergy approach is to assign each pixel a score based upon the agreement between various irrigation products jung et al 2006 in general a pixel with a higher agreement among the input datasets is identified as irrigated with a higher likelihood based on the consensus among various irrigation products and their weight order pixels are assigned different scores from various permutations five input datasets were adopted for each year in our study and they were labeled as a b c d and e according to a descending weight order in other words product a ranked first and e last considering their accuracy or importance then various permutations were obtained for score assignment and calibrated with the statistical data text s2 fig 2 shows the agreement level and score distribution based on the five input datasets for 2010 some obvious agreement can be found in north china plain guan zhong plain sichuan basin all of which are traditional agricultural districts and extensively irrigated accordingly these hotspots gained higher scores from 25 to 31 all pixels within a county prefecture or province were ranked according to their scores and the pixels with the highest scores were counted until their area reached the statistical irrigation data the calibration with statistical data is an iterative process to allocate the total irrigated cropland area to the pixels with higher ranking scores automatically until the cumulative irrigated area is closest to the statistical data after the calibration procedure the resulting maps based on multi level statistical data were mosaicked into the final synergy irrigation map irrimap syn 2 2 3 validation of the resulting maps and comparison with the existing maps two methods were adopted to assess the performance of the irrimap syn first a pixel based validation method was carried out in four case regions based on ground samples it is difficult to collect ground truth samples for the whole country xie et al 2019 so we selected four typical agricultural districts with an extent of 3 3 from north to south fig 3 fig s2 to perform the validation for the years 2001 2010 and 2019 more than 5000 ground samples were randomly generated across all selected regions of three assessment years based on three experimental and scientific clues 1 the distance of the croplands to rivers or lakes 2 comparison of evapotranspiration and precipitation and 3 peak greenness see text s3 second inter comparisons between the irrimap syn and several currently available products were conducted to analyze their consistencies text s4 3 results 3 1 accuracy assessment of resultant irrigation maps irrimap syn table 2 illustrates the accuracies of the irrimap syn dataset for 2001 2010 and 2019 over the four validation regions five evaluation metrics including the producer s accuracy which corresponds to the omission error user s accuracy which corresponds to the commission error of irrigated areas the overall accuracy kappa coefficient and f1 score were adopted to assess the performance in general all irrigated croplands in the four regions had high overall accuracies over 0 87 kappa coefficients over 0 80 and f1 scores near 0 90 hetao plain performed best with the highest mean overall accuracy of 0 90 and mean f1 score of 0 93 for the three assessment years followed by sanjiang plain 0 89 0 90 north china plain 0 88 0 89 and jianghan plain 0 87 0 89 the lower mean overall accuracy in jianghan plain may be due to coarser statistics at the prefecture level compared with the producer s accuracy the user s accuracy performed better with values over 0 90 in nearly all regions which indicated that irrimap syn had lower commission errors than omission errors in addition the qualitative assessment through intercomparisons with existing irrigation products also demonstrated irrimap syn outperformed other products see text s4 3 2 spatiotemporal pattern of changes in irrigation during the last two decades substantial changes have occurred in the magnitude and spatial pattern of irrigation the gross area of irrigated croplands increased by 25 from 52 800 000 ha in 2000 65 900 000 ha in 2019 fig 4a north china exceeded south china both in irrigated area and the rate of change fig 4b from 2000 2019 the irrigated area in north china increased by 8 700 000 ha accounting for 66 of the nationwide increment at a rate of 460 000 ha per year and the irrigated area in south china increased 440 000 ha 34 of the total increment at a rate of 230 000 ha per year both increases and decreases in the irrigated area were found across mainland china since 2000 fig s5 fig 5 illustrates the dynamics of irrigated croplands in 5 year and 20 year periods across conterminous china from 2000 2019 the irrigated area in china increased by 74 but decreased by 49 resulting in a 25 net increase across the entire period irrigated croplands in 2000 2005 were most stable with 79 of the area not changing followed by 2005 2010 with 71 2010 2015 with 59 and 2015 2019 with 57 which implied that the dynamics were becoming more violent with time newly irrigated areas rose from 24 in 2000 2005 50 in 2010 2015 but stabilized to 47 in 2015 2019 the changes of the irrigated area were diverse at the watershed level fig 5 songhua and liaohe river basin slrb had the greatest increase where irrigated cropland area increased by 150 over the last two decades in terms of unchanged irrigated fields continental basin cnb had the most with 66 the huaihe river basin hurb and yellow river basin yerb were also stable with more than 60 unchanged the pearl river basin prb was the least stable with only 35 of its irrigated area remaining unchanged as for losses in irrigated area prb had the most with 65 followed by the southeast basin seb with 64 and the southwest basin swb with 60 both prb and seb are in the most economically developed regions of china where urbanization has occupied a lot of croplands which may have led to the loss of the irrigated croplands less irrigated area loss happened in cnb 34 and yerb 39 both of which are in the less developed regions of china next we calculated the mean and trend of irrigated area in nine catchments in recent five years fig 6c d the yangtze river basin yarb had the highest mean gross irrigation area with 16 800 000 ha accounting for 26 of the national total due to the expansive agricultural fields such as those in the upper reaches of the sichuan basin the middle reaches of the jianghan plain and the delta plain in the lower reaches of yangtze river hurb had the second most with 12 300 000 ha 19 of total followed by slrb with 11 100 000 ha 17 and haihe river basin harb with 6 900 000 ha 11 although cnb has the most land area it ranked sixth with 5 100 000 ha 7 9 due to the limited croplands seb and swb had the least mean gross irrigated area because seb mainly consist of hills and mountains and swb is on the plateau at the province level most provinces had a noticeable increase in irrigated area heilongjiang experienced the most remarkable expansion with a rate of 270 400 ha per year fig 6b followed by xinjiang with 118 400 ha and anhui with 83 600 ha per year the recent five year mean irrigation area in these three provinces was also the highest fig 6a contrary to the large increase in irrigation area in most provinces notable decreases in the irrigated area were observed in beijing shanghai and xizang by about 45 irrigated areas in these three regions are very small so the decrease had little impact on the overall increase seen on the national scale in addition some provinces were relatively stable in irrigated areas such as shaanxi guangxi and qinghai fig 6a 3 3 timing and frequency of irrigations irrigation frequency represents the number of years the croplands were irrigated from 2000 to 2019 as illustrated in fig 7 we found considerable spatial differences in irrigation frequency across china traditional agricultural planting areas exhibited higher frequency such as hurb harb and cnb due to the stability of the irrigated croplands to illustrate the regional differences we selected four irrigated areas from north to south i e sanjiang plain hetao plain north china plain jianghan plain and determined the start and end year for irrigation only a small portion of the croplands in sanjiang plain was irrigated for more than 15 years fig 7a more than 20 of the croplands were irrigated more than 19 years in hetao plain and the probability distribution of irrigation frequency in north china plain and jianghan plain were relatively even in terms of the start year of irrigation more than 60 of the croplands in hetao plain and north china plain were irrigated since or earlier than 2000 as both regions are important grain production bases of china and have a long history of irrigation since the 1980 s wu et al 2019 nearly one half of the croplands in jianghan plain have started to be irrigated since 2000 possibly due to the lagged development of irrigation infrastructure as the biggest grain base in china only 21 of croplands in sanjiang plain were irrigated in 2000 but irrigation developed rapidly after 2000 due to the warming climate and fertile black soil reclamation paddy rice fields were planted at the beginning of the 21st century and the planting area increased rapidly year by year dong et al 2016a 2016b xin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as for the end of irrigation most croplands continued to be irrigated for example more than 60 of croplands in the four zones continued to be irrigated until 2019 4 discussion 4 1 underlying drivers of changes in irrigated croplands numerous causal factors may affect irrigation area including climate factors precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic factors such as population growth land use change the development of irrigation infrastructure the south to north water diversion project the adjustment of cropping patterns and the implementation of crop rotation and fallow systems we investigated the relationship between precipitation and irrigation at the watershed level as illustrated in fig s6 precipitation was highly dynamic and it seems that the variation in precipitation did not lead to increases or decreases in irrigated area correspondingly which agreed with a previous study deines et al 2017 in terms of anthropogenic factors the chinese population has increased by 10 5 or 0 13 billion from 2000 to 2019 national statistical bureau 2020 which has increased demand for agricultural production and an increased reliance on irrigation ozdogan et al 2010 also irrigation is highly dependent on water resources according to the statistical data from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china mwr http www mwr gov cn the increases in the number of reservoirs and the number of irrigation districts were substantial fig s7 consequently the large expansion of irrigated croplands across mainland china was significantly correlated to investments in irrigation infrastructure r2 0 9 p 0 001 in addition cultivated croplands have experienced tremendous growth in some provinces since 2000 for instance the cropland area of xinjiang increased by 52 5 over the last two decades national statistical bureau 2020 correspondingly the irrigated area had a net increase of 74 5 due to the great efforts made by the production and construction corps as well as the policies aimed to alleviate poverty oasis agriculture in xinjiang has boomed and the irrigated area has greatly expanded zhang et al 2021b zong et al 2021 similar trends could be found in heilongjiang due to fertile black soil abundant surface water storage and a warming climate rice soybean and maize have expanded in sanjiang plain and the songnen plain at a high rate since 2000 dong et al 2016b xin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b as a result the irrigated area in heilongjiang has increased substantially from 1 910 000 in 2000 6 180 000 ha in 2019 to quantitatively demonstrate the effects of increased cropland area on irrigation expansion we selected four prefectures from east to west i e jiamusi qiqihaer zhangye kelamayi detailed position can be found in fig s8 to investigate the correlation between cropland area and irrigated area all of them are traditional agricultural production bases and have experienced a tremendous expansion of croplands from 2000 to 2019 as illustrated in fig 8 in these four prefectures irrigated areas were significantly augmented with the expansion of croplands with r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 92 p 0 001 4 2 relationship between regional irrigation area water use efficiency and agricultural water consumption irrigation is the largest water use sector and global irrigation consumes 70 of the available freshwater cai and rosegrant 2002 which imposes pressures on regional water resources the increasing area of irrigated croplands tends to induce increased agricultural water consumption but this causal relationship may not stand in some regions where water saving technology is developed in other words less water depletion can be achieved if water saving irrigation instruments and scientific water management measures are adopted dong et al 2016b to investigate the potential relationship of irrigated area expansion water use efficiency and water depletion amount we collected agricultural water use data for nine watersheds from mwr the expansion of irrigated croplands seems to affect water use consumption positively in most of the watersheds the strongest correlation can be found in slrb r2 0 77 followed by yarb r2 0 57 and hurb r2 0 54 fig 9 due to an abundance of surface water resources and a warming climate paddy rice in the slrb has expanded a lot dong et al 2016b zhang et al 2017b meanwhile with rudimentary irrigation technology a lack of water conservation and the low investment in irrigation infrastructure the irrigated area using the water saving technique in heilongjiang was less than 30 and the water utilization rate of irrigation is not as high as that in beijing and hebei fig s9 consequently the expansion of irrigated croplands has led to increased agricultural water use yarb where rice is the most widely planted crop had the largest irrigated area but the high volume of surface water storage and high precipitation masks the need to institute water saving irrigation projects as a result the expansion of irrigated areas also leads to a significant augmentation of water use for the cnb in northwest china due to the extremely arid desert climate the evapotranspiration is high which increases the demand for irrigation and lowers water using efficiency however agricultural water consumption began to decline despite an increase in irrigated area since 2014 fig 9f because drip irrigation under mulch which has been carried out across xinjiang since the early 1990s expanded from 50 000 ha in the early 2000 s to 2 000 000 ha in 2014 zong et al 2021 accordingly agricultural water consumption has exhibited a decreasing trend since 2014 the lowest determinant coefficient was for the harb 0 03 followed by swb 0 09 and prb 0 23 harb covers most of north china plain which sustains 18 of china s croplands and 23 of the nation s grain production while using only 6 of the nation s freshwater resources huang et al 2015 many investments in agriculture infrastructure and water saving irrigation techniques have led to higher water use efficiency and lower water consumption per ha huang et al 2019 4 3 advantages uncertainties and implications agricultural irrigation is an essential tool to prevent crops from drought and enhance crop yields especially in arid and semi arid regions but the lack of knowledge of spatial distribution and temporal changes of irrigated areas hinders the analysis of national and regional water resources depletion i e surface runoff and groundwater stocks as well as the adaption ability of agriculture to climate change we fill this knowledge gap by producing annual irrigation maps in china in the last two decades by integrating several historical irrigation products and statistics and analyzing the spatiotemporal changes of irrigated areas at different scales i e nationwide watersheds province and pixels the synergistic framework proposed in this study took full use of the available multisource irrigation maps and statistical archives and the reasonable assigned weight orders for different input products assured that irrigation information with a higher and convincible accuracy was adopted in priority despite different definitions and coverages in the various input datasets we can still extract the information that we are interested since synergy mapping is an assembling process and different input products play a supplementary role compared with other products generated from remote sensing based classification methods that are susceptible to clouds and rains as well as mismatching with statistics the resulting maps in this study are more consistent with statistics last the spatial and temporal variation analysis of irrigated croplands coupling water consumption provides important insights into the water resource imbalance and crisis in hotspot regions e g north china plain and northwest china however several uncertain factors and limitations cannot be neglected first the statistical data may have uncertainty and be inadequate especially for county level data the statistical method adopted in the early years by nbs may introduce some bias into the inventory and the political objectives of local governments could vary ozdogan and gutman 2008 ozdogan et al 2010 compared to the irrigated area derived using only remote sensing approaches general underestimation could exist in the statistical data meier et al 2018 thenkabail et al 2009b the agricultural data reported by nbs mainly reflected croplands equipped with irrigation infrastructure such as large irrigation districts with an area above 666 7 ha and thus could neglect fragmented patches of irrigated croplands managed by small stakeholders vogels et al 2019 nevertheless official statistics cover most irrigated croplands and seem to be the only reliable data source that is available mapping irrigated croplands based on remote sensing methods may be a more objective solution when enough ground truth samples can be obtained thenkabail et al 2009a xie and lark 2021 the second is the potential uncertainty of the initial irrigation map mirad gi although the peak greenness has been used as the key differentiator between irrigated and rainfed crops ozdogan et al 2010 the effectiveness of this approach is usually compromised in humid environments deines et al 2017 pervez and brown 2010 xu et al 2019 such as the southern and coastal china however we still have confidence in mirad gi because croplands in southern and coastal china are sparsely distributed and account for only a small part of the whole cropland area so that the bias introduced by gi s false detection is limited furthermore the uncertainty of mirad gi can be constrained and mitigated in the synergy mapping process to some extent third the synergy irrigation map is highly dependent on the input datasets and their weight order local discrepancies among the different input datasets could lead to uncertainties also the ranking list used in our study was employed for all fields and did not consider local discrepancies because irrigation products could have different accuracies in different regions the score table should be dynamic and regional specific lu et al 2017 therefore local adaptive weight ranking orders can be developed in the future when more information on the spatial differences in their accuracies is available last is the uncertainty of accuracy assessment it is difficult to collect nationwide ground truth points for a comprehensive evaluation so we selected four typical districts to implement pixel wise validation which may lead to some potential biases however these four regions represent important agricultural bases with different climatic and ecological backgrounds text s3 and more importantly we pay more attention to the accuracy performance in these extensively irrigated districts than other sparsely irrigated areas furthermore these districts may be considered as the sampling validation zones on behalf of the whole to be verified fields according to the sampling inspection method 5 conclusions irrigation is vital for increasing agricultural production and regional food security by reducing crop vulnerability to droughts the expansion of irrigated croplands may increase the pressure on water resources and influence regional climate thus tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigated croplands could facilitate water management and its adaptation to climate change we produced annual irrigation maps irrimap syn across mainland china for 2000 2019 through the synergy of remote sensing statistics and historical irrigation datasets our maps had a high overall accuracy which was assessed using ground truth validations in four representative irrigation districts our resultant annual maps provide a complete picture of the changes in irrigated croplands across mainland china in the 21st century we found a substantial increase in irrigated croplands in china from 52 800 000 to 65 900 000 ha 24 8 over the past two decades remarkable spatial differences in irrigated area and their changes can be found among the provinces and watersheds specifically irrigated croplands in heilongjiang expanded the most 200 followed by guizhou 140 and xinjiang 74 beijing had the largest decrease in the irrigated area 72 followed by shanghai 33 the increase in cropland area and continuous investments in the construction of water conservancy facilities were identified as major drivers for the expansion of irrigation we also found that the dynamics of irrigated areas can explain changes in water consumption at the catchment level with high correlations in the songnen and liaohe river basin and the yangtze river basin and a low correlation in the haihe river basin with the increasing population and demand for food irrigation is expected to expand in the future thus the potential consequences of increased cropland irrigation need more attention knowledge of the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of irrigated areas is of vital significance for evaluating the trade offs between food security and water security in the context of climate

9642,irrigation is widely implemented in china to enhance grain production and ensure food security spatiotemporal information on irrigation is critically important but the existing global and regional irrigation products have a coarse spatial resolution low accuracy and short temporal coverage which is a knowledge gap to be filled generating explicit and accurate information on the spatial and temporal extent of irrigation is essential to underpin and facilitate water resource allocation and management as well as to understand catchment hydrology and evaluate irrigation infrastructure investment we proposed a two step strategy to map annual irrigated areas at 500 m resolution in china from 2000 to 2019 we first generated initial irrigation maps using modis data and statistical data mirad gi then we combined mirad gi the existing irrigation maps and land use cover products with irrigation information into an improved series of annual irrigation maps irrimap syn with constrained statistics afterwards pixel wise accuracy assessment for irrimap syn was conducted in four representative regions in three years the resultant irrigation dataset performed well with a mean overall accuracy of 0 89 and a kappa coefficient of 0 82 according to our annual irrigation maps the total irrigated area in china increased by 24 8 from 52 8 million ha in 2000 65 9 million ha in 2019 at a rate of 690 000 ha per year spatially irrigated croplands increased substantially in north china especially in xinjiang and heilongjiang land reclamation largely contributed to the increase in irrigation in north china a growing population and improved irrigation infrastructure also promoted the increase in irrigated areas as the first of its kind in the country our spatially explicit maps of irrigated croplands advance our understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of irrigation dynamics in china and are expected to contribute to sustainable water resource management and irrigation strategies in the face of climate change keywords annual irrigated areas irrigation dynamics modis data improved irrigation infrastructure water resource management 1 introduction irrigation has played an important role in promoting grain yield and ensuring food security over the past four decades and continues to expand to satisfy the global increase in demand for food mcdonald and girvetz 2013 however as the largest water consuming sector agricultural irrigation depletes about 70 of the world s total available freshwater cai and rosegrant 2002 cotterman et al 2017 scanlon et al 2012 which has led to many environmental problems such as water shortage zhou et al 2021 soil salinization and erosion dehaan and taylor 2002 wu et al 2014 and landslides watkinson and hall 2019 as one of the largest agricultural countries with limited water resources food production in china relies heavily on intensive irrigation posing great pressure on its water security e g the groundwater crisis in north china plain sun et al 2015 explicit and accurate information on the spatial and temporal extent of irrigation is essential to underpin and facilitate water resource allocation and management droogers and aerts 2005 as well as understand catchment hydrology zhang et al 2017a and evaluate irrigation infrastructure investment fao 2011 but scarce in china thus there is an urgent need to fill this knowledge gap over the last two decades remote sensing has become an advanced tool for monitoring irrigated lands ozdogan et al 2010 several attempts have been made to estimate the long term extent of irrigation at regional and global scales ketchum et al 2020 ozdogan et al 2006 pe√±a arancibia et al 2014 sharma et al 2018 for instance the global irrigation maps from 2001 to 2015 with a resolution of 5 deepak nagaraj et al 2021 the 250 m irrigation maps of india for 2000 2015 ambika et al 2016 30 m annual irrigation maps for the republican river basin in the us since 1984 deines et al 2019 and the conterminous us for 1997 2017 xie and lark 2021 however on one hand global time series irrigation maps cannot accurately reflect national and regional irrigated areas due to their coarse resolution on the other hand moderate or high resolution maps based on remote sensing based classification methods often suffer from undermined accuracy in humid areas deines et al 2019 because the signals of irrigated and rainfed crops are too similar to differentiate xie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 integrating agricultural statistics and remote sensing data provides an alternative to overcome the deficiency of approaches solely based on remote sensing brown and pervez 2014 pervez and brown 2010 shahriar pervez et al 2014 shrestha et al 2021 verburg et al 2011 for example lu et al 2020 used the synergy mapping method to develop a global map of croplands and the method was based on the fusion of multiple existing cropland maps and multi level statistics of croplands which was independent of training samples fritz et al 2011 ranked five existing land cover maps and assigned different weights based on expert knowledge or their assessed accuracies to produce the cropland map for africa in 2005 to the best of our knowledge the synergistic mapping method has not been used to produce national irrigation products many efforts to map irrigation at the regional and global scales have been made table 1 and those maps provide crucial preliminary information for the generation of new and improved irrigation maps they include the global map of irrigation areas version 5 0 gmia 5 0 siebert et al 2013 2015 the global rainfed irrigated and paddy croplands gripc map at 500 m resolution salmon et al 2015 irrigated area map for asia and africa iaaa siddiqui et al 2016 and xiang s irrigation map for china in 2016 xiang2016 xiang et al 2020 etc in this study we made full use of these available irrigation products to generate the new irrigation products we had three objectives for our study first we aimed to develop a new two step framework to generate annual irrigation maps of china at 500 m resolution for 2000 2019 through the synergy of remote sensing statistics and historical irrigation datasets second we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of irrigated croplands at the national provincial and catchment scales third we discussed the relationship between irrigated areas agricultural water consumption and water use efficiency and the underlying factors that drove the changes in irrigated areas to achieve these objectives we produced new irrigation maps by integrating remote sensing statistical data and existing irrigation maps i e gmia gripc iaaa gfsad and xiang2016 and lulc products i e nlcd cci lc and glc fcs our resultant irrigation maps irrimap syn were validated in four typical irrigated regions to our limited knowledge this is the first effort to generate national irrigation maps in china for the last two decades these maps could advance our understanding of the spatial and temporal pattern of irrigation in china and are useful for decision making and management of china s water resources 2 data and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 remote sensing data we used the terra modis surface spectral reflectance data product mod09a1 v6 as the primary data source to generate the initial irrigation maps with statistical data mod09a1 provided data for seven spectral bands at 500 m resolution and was corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses aerosols and rayleigh scattering the greenness index gi gitelson et al 2005 a proxy to indicate water stress and irrigation status ozdogan and gutman 2008 was calculated near infrared band divides green band as the primary indicator to generate the irrigation maps the gi time series was filtered to reduce outliers and interpolate missing values using the savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 2 1 2 statistical data of irrigation we collected all available irrigation statistics released by the national bureau of statistics of china nbs at the provincial municipal and county levels from 2000 to 2019 we took the following steps to produce a continuous set of time series irrigation statistical data first we used linear interpolation to fill temporal gaps in the data of some counties and prefectures in certain years second we used municipal or provincial level data for analyses when the county level statistical data were not available for the whole period such as some counties of heilongjiang and inner mongolia fig s1 third we calibrated the data for counties or prefectures whose administrative boundaries had changed or data source was diverse see text s1 finally we transformed the continuous time series irrigation data into shapefile format with arcgis 2 1 3 existing thematic irrigation maps among the numerous global and regional irrigation products we selected gmia m gripc gfsad global food security support analysis data iaaa and xiang2016 as the input datasets table 1 these products differed in spatial resolution data sources temporal coverage production methods and accuracy due to the coarse resolution of the gmia dataset we used the extended version gmia m with 1 km resolution produced by meier et al 2018 which was strongly correlated with the statistical data r 0 84 gripc used supervised classification with remote sensing climate and agricultural inventory data to generate a 500 m global map of irrigated rain fed and paddy croplands for 2005 with an overall accuracy of 69 salmon et al 2015 the gfsad was a nasa funded project to provide high resolution global cropland data and their water use to contribute to global food security in the twenty first century thenkabail et al 2009a it provided information on global cropland extent and irrigated versus rainfed cropping iaaa was developed for the asian and african regions to indicate irrigated and rainfed croplands which was available at 250 m resolution for 2000 and 2010 and was obtained from the international water management institute iwmi siddiqui et al 2016 xiang2016 was produced for mainland china in 2016 with an overall accuracy of 62 using statistical data mean annual precipitation modis land cover type data and surface reflectance data xiang et al 2020 2 1 4 lulc maps with irrigation information two long term lulc products nlcd cci lc and one two year product glc fcs were also selected to serve as a baseline for irrigated croplands table 1 the 100 m nlcd datasets in 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 were collected from the data center for resource and environmental sciences of the chinese academy of sciences they were generated using visual interpretation of landsat and cbers imagery liu et al 2014 and possessed high overall accuracies of over 90 liu et al 2005 2010 in the nlcd the paddy croplands type 11 referred to fields of rice and other paddy crops like lotus root thus all the paddy fields were considered as part of irrigated croplands with high confidence as the products had a five year interval we extended the valid time range by two years before and after the benchmark year of one product e g nlcd 2010 was used for 2008 2012 cci lc was produced by the european space agency esa climate change initiative and consisted of 22 1 level class types the accuracy of the classification of rain fed croplands by cci lc was 0 85 and that of the irrigated or post flooding croplands was 0 88 defourny et al 2016 this dataset was produced annually from 1992 to 2019 and provided valuable data with a high spatial and temporal resolution glc fcs was developed on the gee platform by integrating landsat imagery a global training dataset and local adaptive random forest models the glc fcs data shared the same class scheme with cci lc the overall accuracy of glc fcs under the classification scheme of 24 classes was 68 7 with a kappa coefficient of 0 662 zhang et al 2021a the sources of data used in our synergy mapping can be grouped into three parts table 1 the initial irrigation map mirad gi the existing thematic maps of irrigation and lulc maps containing irrigation information and annual statistical data the list of input datasets for each year was displayed in table s1 although there were slight differences in the temporal coverage among these input irrigation maps their differences had a minor impact on the final fused map as the inconsistency among the input datasets is much larger than the time difference lu et al 2017 preprocessing of the satellite based maps was conducted due to their differences both in their coordinate systems and spatial resolutions we used the albers equal area projected coordinate system with wgs84 datum as the base projection since the spatial resolution of these products varied from 30 m to 1000 m all maps were resampled to a standard resolution of 500 m we also used a unified cropland mask to exclude non agriculture areas within the satellite datasets for example the cropland mask of 2005 was applied for 2003 2007 table s1 since we assume the variation of cropland area is stable within five years 2 2 methods 2 2 1 initial irrigation maps for 2000 2019 using modis and statistical data mirad gi an intermediate irrigation dataset modis irrigated area dataset generated by gi mirad gi was first generated by fusing remote sensing and statistical data it is widely acknowledged that moisture stress in vegetation is strongly manifested in spectral indices of remote sensing related to chlorophyll content gitelson et al 2003 zarco tejada et al 2002 irrigated crops with very little or no soil moisture stress have a higher chlorophyll content than non irrigated crops with potential moisture stress ozdogan and gutman 2008 due to its high sensitivity to chlorophyll content gitelson et al 2003 the greenness index gi has been widely used as a proxy of the irrigation status of vegetation deines et al 2017 xie and lark 2021 all pixels within a county were ranked descending by annual peak gi value and the pixels with higher gi values were counted until the area of the selected pixels reached the statistical irrigation data fig 1 a more detailed description of this procedure could be found in pervez and brown 2010 afterwards mirad gi together with multiple available irrigation products and lulc maps were synergized into improved irrigation maps with constrained statistics as we demonstrate below 2 2 2 synergy irrigation mapping by fusing mirad gi statistics and multiple existing maps synergistic approaches mainly involve two categories agreement scoring methods fritz et al 2011 and regression methods see et al 2015 we adopted the former due to the difficulty in collecting a large number of ground samples to implement regression models the fundamental idea behind the synergy mapping method is to first determine the weight order of the input datasets then calculate the score based on the weighted order of the current products and finally sum the irrigated area within a specific level region to match the statistical area a suitable weight order of the input products is essential for the synergistic approach which usually depends on accuracy assessments of the input data or expert judgment in terms of the former approach fritz et al 2015 ranked different input datasets at the national level using crowdsourced data from geo wiki to create a map that reflects the likelihood that the grid cell contains croplands lu et al 2017 assessed the accuracy of existing cropland datasets by using cropland sampling point data from tsinghua university and visual interpretation of google earth images in addition the absolute difference of area between the input dataset and the statistics was also used to assess the accuracy of the input map lu et al 2020 when it is hard to collect validation points or confidence in the accuracy of the input dataset is worrisome expert judgment can also be adopted like fritz et al 2011 did in producing a cropland map for sub saharan african using five land cover data sets since it was hard to evaluate the input datasets based on massive in situ data we used accuracy and expert judgment fused method to rank the weight order based on the following rules datasets with higher known overall accuracy ranked higher in the weight order when accuracy information was absent we considered timeliness and spatial resolution take the 2010 input products for example the weight order was nlcd cci lc mirad gi iaaa and gfsad nlcd was a reliable product with an overall accuracy of over 0 90 for all class levels liu et al 2014 and the overall accuracy for irrigated or post flooding cropland in cci lc was 0 88 defourny et al 2016 thus nlcd ranked first followed by cci lc mirad gi the intermediate irrigation product we generated was closely connected to gi and statistical data and can represent the approximate distribution of irrigated croplands pervez and brown 2010 both iaaa and gfsad lacked an accuracy assessment so based on our rule the dataset with a higher spatial resolution ranked higher also through visual inspection we found that iaaa covered most irrigation hotspots in china and performed better than gfsad consequently iaaa and gfsad ranked 4th and 5th respectively the principle of the synergy approach is to assign each pixel a score based upon the agreement between various irrigation products jung et al 2006 in general a pixel with a higher agreement among the input datasets is identified as irrigated with a higher likelihood based on the consensus among various irrigation products and their weight order pixels are assigned different scores from various permutations five input datasets were adopted for each year in our study and they were labeled as a b c d and e according to a descending weight order in other words product a ranked first and e last considering their accuracy or importance then various permutations were obtained for score assignment and calibrated with the statistical data text s2 fig 2 shows the agreement level and score distribution based on the five input datasets for 2010 some obvious agreement can be found in north china plain guan zhong plain sichuan basin all of which are traditional agricultural districts and extensively irrigated accordingly these hotspots gained higher scores from 25 to 31 all pixels within a county prefecture or province were ranked according to their scores and the pixels with the highest scores were counted until their area reached the statistical irrigation data the calibration with statistical data is an iterative process to allocate the total irrigated cropland area to the pixels with higher ranking scores automatically until the cumulative irrigated area is closest to the statistical data after the calibration procedure the resulting maps based on multi level statistical data were mosaicked into the final synergy irrigation map irrimap syn 2 2 3 validation of the resulting maps and comparison with the existing maps two methods were adopted to assess the performance of the irrimap syn first a pixel based validation method was carried out in four case regions based on ground samples it is difficult to collect ground truth samples for the whole country xie et al 2019 so we selected four typical agricultural districts with an extent of 3 3 from north to south fig 3 fig s2 to perform the validation for the years 2001 2010 and 2019 more than 5000 ground samples were randomly generated across all selected regions of three assessment years based on three experimental and scientific clues 1 the distance of the croplands to rivers or lakes 2 comparison of evapotranspiration and precipitation and 3 peak greenness see text s3 second inter comparisons between the irrimap syn and several currently available products were conducted to analyze their consistencies text s4 3 results 3 1 accuracy assessment of resultant irrigation maps irrimap syn table 2 illustrates the accuracies of the irrimap syn dataset for 2001 2010 and 2019 over the four validation regions five evaluation metrics including the producer s accuracy which corresponds to the omission error user s accuracy which corresponds to the commission error of irrigated areas the overall accuracy kappa coefficient and f1 score were adopted to assess the performance in general all irrigated croplands in the four regions had high overall accuracies over 0 87 kappa coefficients over 0 80 and f1 scores near 0 90 hetao plain performed best with the highest mean overall accuracy of 0 90 and mean f1 score of 0 93 for the three assessment years followed by sanjiang plain 0 89 0 90 north china plain 0 88 0 89 and jianghan plain 0 87 0 89 the lower mean overall accuracy in jianghan plain may be due to coarser statistics at the prefecture level compared with the producer s accuracy the user s accuracy performed better with values over 0 90 in nearly all regions which indicated that irrimap syn had lower commission errors than omission errors in addition the qualitative assessment through intercomparisons with existing irrigation products also demonstrated irrimap syn outperformed other products see text s4 3 2 spatiotemporal pattern of changes in irrigation during the last two decades substantial changes have occurred in the magnitude and spatial pattern of irrigation the gross area of irrigated croplands increased by 25 from 52 800 000 ha in 2000 65 900 000 ha in 2019 fig 4a north china exceeded south china both in irrigated area and the rate of change fig 4b from 2000 2019 the irrigated area in north china increased by 8 700 000 ha accounting for 66 of the nationwide increment at a rate of 460 000 ha per year and the irrigated area in south china increased 440 000 ha 34 of the total increment at a rate of 230 000 ha per year both increases and decreases in the irrigated area were found across mainland china since 2000 fig s5 fig 5 illustrates the dynamics of irrigated croplands in 5 year and 20 year periods across conterminous china from 2000 2019 the irrigated area in china increased by 74 but decreased by 49 resulting in a 25 net increase across the entire period irrigated croplands in 2000 2005 were most stable with 79 of the area not changing followed by 2005 2010 with 71 2010 2015 with 59 and 2015 2019 with 57 which implied that the dynamics were becoming more violent with time newly irrigated areas rose from 24 in 2000 2005 50 in 2010 2015 but stabilized to 47 in 2015 2019 the changes of the irrigated area were diverse at the watershed level fig 5 songhua and liaohe river basin slrb had the greatest increase where irrigated cropland area increased by 150 over the last two decades in terms of unchanged irrigated fields continental basin cnb had the most with 66 the huaihe river basin hurb and yellow river basin yerb were also stable with more than 60 unchanged the pearl river basin prb was the least stable with only 35 of its irrigated area remaining unchanged as for losses in irrigated area prb had the most with 65 followed by the southeast basin seb with 64 and the southwest basin swb with 60 both prb and seb are in the most economically developed regions of china where urbanization has occupied a lot of croplands which may have led to the loss of the irrigated croplands less irrigated area loss happened in cnb 34 and yerb 39 both of which are in the less developed regions of china next we calculated the mean and trend of irrigated area in nine catchments in recent five years fig 6c d the yangtze river basin yarb had the highest mean gross irrigation area with 16 800 000 ha accounting for 26 of the national total due to the expansive agricultural fields such as those in the upper reaches of the sichuan basin the middle reaches of the jianghan plain and the delta plain in the lower reaches of yangtze river hurb had the second most with 12 300 000 ha 19 of total followed by slrb with 11 100 000 ha 17 and haihe river basin harb with 6 900 000 ha 11 although cnb has the most land area it ranked sixth with 5 100 000 ha 7 9 due to the limited croplands seb and swb had the least mean gross irrigated area because seb mainly consist of hills and mountains and swb is on the plateau at the province level most provinces had a noticeable increase in irrigated area heilongjiang experienced the most remarkable expansion with a rate of 270 400 ha per year fig 6b followed by xinjiang with 118 400 ha and anhui with 83 600 ha per year the recent five year mean irrigation area in these three provinces was also the highest fig 6a contrary to the large increase in irrigation area in most provinces notable decreases in the irrigated area were observed in beijing shanghai and xizang by about 45 irrigated areas in these three regions are very small so the decrease had little impact on the overall increase seen on the national scale in addition some provinces were relatively stable in irrigated areas such as shaanxi guangxi and qinghai fig 6a 3 3 timing and frequency of irrigations irrigation frequency represents the number of years the croplands were irrigated from 2000 to 2019 as illustrated in fig 7 we found considerable spatial differences in irrigation frequency across china traditional agricultural planting areas exhibited higher frequency such as hurb harb and cnb due to the stability of the irrigated croplands to illustrate the regional differences we selected four irrigated areas from north to south i e sanjiang plain hetao plain north china plain jianghan plain and determined the start and end year for irrigation only a small portion of the croplands in sanjiang plain was irrigated for more than 15 years fig 7a more than 20 of the croplands were irrigated more than 19 years in hetao plain and the probability distribution of irrigation frequency in north china plain and jianghan plain were relatively even in terms of the start year of irrigation more than 60 of the croplands in hetao plain and north china plain were irrigated since or earlier than 2000 as both regions are important grain production bases of china and have a long history of irrigation since the 1980 s wu et al 2019 nearly one half of the croplands in jianghan plain have started to be irrigated since 2000 possibly due to the lagged development of irrigation infrastructure as the biggest grain base in china only 21 of croplands in sanjiang plain were irrigated in 2000 but irrigation developed rapidly after 2000 due to the warming climate and fertile black soil reclamation paddy rice fields were planted at the beginning of the 21st century and the planting area increased rapidly year by year dong et al 2016a 2016b xin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as for the end of irrigation most croplands continued to be irrigated for example more than 60 of croplands in the four zones continued to be irrigated until 2019 4 discussion 4 1 underlying drivers of changes in irrigated croplands numerous causal factors may affect irrigation area including climate factors precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic factors such as population growth land use change the development of irrigation infrastructure the south to north water diversion project the adjustment of cropping patterns and the implementation of crop rotation and fallow systems we investigated the relationship between precipitation and irrigation at the watershed level as illustrated in fig s6 precipitation was highly dynamic and it seems that the variation in precipitation did not lead to increases or decreases in irrigated area correspondingly which agreed with a previous study deines et al 2017 in terms of anthropogenic factors the chinese population has increased by 10 5 or 0 13 billion from 2000 to 2019 national statistical bureau 2020 which has increased demand for agricultural production and an increased reliance on irrigation ozdogan et al 2010 also irrigation is highly dependent on water resources according to the statistical data from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china mwr http www mwr gov cn the increases in the number of reservoirs and the number of irrigation districts were substantial fig s7 consequently the large expansion of irrigated croplands across mainland china was significantly correlated to investments in irrigation infrastructure r2 0 9 p 0 001 in addition cultivated croplands have experienced tremendous growth in some provinces since 2000 for instance the cropland area of xinjiang increased by 52 5 over the last two decades national statistical bureau 2020 correspondingly the irrigated area had a net increase of 74 5 due to the great efforts made by the production and construction corps as well as the policies aimed to alleviate poverty oasis agriculture in xinjiang has boomed and the irrigated area has greatly expanded zhang et al 2021b zong et al 2021 similar trends could be found in heilongjiang due to fertile black soil abundant surface water storage and a warming climate rice soybean and maize have expanded in sanjiang plain and the songnen plain at a high rate since 2000 dong et al 2016b xin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b as a result the irrigated area in heilongjiang has increased substantially from 1 910 000 in 2000 6 180 000 ha in 2019 to quantitatively demonstrate the effects of increased cropland area on irrigation expansion we selected four prefectures from east to west i e jiamusi qiqihaer zhangye kelamayi detailed position can be found in fig s8 to investigate the correlation between cropland area and irrigated area all of them are traditional agricultural production bases and have experienced a tremendous expansion of croplands from 2000 to 2019 as illustrated in fig 8 in these four prefectures irrigated areas were significantly augmented with the expansion of croplands with r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 92 p 0 001 4 2 relationship between regional irrigation area water use efficiency and agricultural water consumption irrigation is the largest water use sector and global irrigation consumes 70 of the available freshwater cai and rosegrant 2002 which imposes pressures on regional water resources the increasing area of irrigated croplands tends to induce increased agricultural water consumption but this causal relationship may not stand in some regions where water saving technology is developed in other words less water depletion can be achieved if water saving irrigation instruments and scientific water management measures are adopted dong et al 2016b to investigate the potential relationship of irrigated area expansion water use efficiency and water depletion amount we collected agricultural water use data for nine watersheds from mwr the expansion of irrigated croplands seems to affect water use consumption positively in most of the watersheds the strongest correlation can be found in slrb r2 0 77 followed by yarb r2 0 57 and hurb r2 0 54 fig 9 due to an abundance of surface water resources and a warming climate paddy rice in the slrb has expanded a lot dong et al 2016b zhang et al 2017b meanwhile with rudimentary irrigation technology a lack of water conservation and the low investment in irrigation infrastructure the irrigated area using the water saving technique in heilongjiang was less than 30 and the water utilization rate of irrigation is not as high as that in beijing and hebei fig s9 consequently the expansion of irrigated croplands has led to increased agricultural water use yarb where rice is the most widely planted crop had the largest irrigated area but the high volume of surface water storage and high precipitation masks the need to institute water saving irrigation projects as a result the expansion of irrigated areas also leads to a significant augmentation of water use for the cnb in northwest china due to the extremely arid desert climate the evapotranspiration is high which increases the demand for irrigation and lowers water using efficiency however agricultural water consumption began to decline despite an increase in irrigated area since 2014 fig 9f because drip irrigation under mulch which has been carried out across xinjiang since the early 1990s expanded from 50 000 ha in the early 2000 s to 2 000 000 ha in 2014 zong et al 2021 accordingly agricultural water consumption has exhibited a decreasing trend since 2014 the lowest determinant coefficient was for the harb 0 03 followed by swb 0 09 and prb 0 23 harb covers most of north china plain which sustains 18 of china s croplands and 23 of the nation s grain production while using only 6 of the nation s freshwater resources huang et al 2015 many investments in agriculture infrastructure and water saving irrigation techniques have led to higher water use efficiency and lower water consumption per ha huang et al 2019 4 3 advantages uncertainties and implications agricultural irrigation is an essential tool to prevent crops from drought and enhance crop yields especially in arid and semi arid regions but the lack of knowledge of spatial distribution and temporal changes of irrigated areas hinders the analysis of national and regional water resources depletion i e surface runoff and groundwater stocks as well as the adaption ability of agriculture to climate change we fill this knowledge gap by producing annual irrigation maps in china in the last two decades by integrating several historical irrigation products and statistics and analyzing the spatiotemporal changes of irrigated areas at different scales i e nationwide watersheds province and pixels the synergistic framework proposed in this study took full use of the available multisource irrigation maps and statistical archives and the reasonable assigned weight orders for different input products assured that irrigation information with a higher and convincible accuracy was adopted in priority despite different definitions and coverages in the various input datasets we can still extract the information that we are interested since synergy mapping is an assembling process and different input products play a supplementary role compared with other products generated from remote sensing based classification methods that are susceptible to clouds and rains as well as mismatching with statistics the resulting maps in this study are more consistent with statistics last the spatial and temporal variation analysis of irrigated croplands coupling water consumption provides important insights into the water resource imbalance and crisis in hotspot regions e g north china plain and northwest china however several uncertain factors and limitations cannot be neglected first the statistical data may have uncertainty and be inadequate especially for county level data the statistical method adopted in the early years by nbs may introduce some bias into the inventory and the political objectives of local governments could vary ozdogan and gutman 2008 ozdogan et al 2010 compared to the irrigated area derived using only remote sensing approaches general underestimation could exist in the statistical data meier et al 2018 thenkabail et al 2009b the agricultural data reported by nbs mainly reflected croplands equipped with irrigation infrastructure such as large irrigation districts with an area above 666 7 ha and thus could neglect fragmented patches of irrigated croplands managed by small stakeholders vogels et al 2019 nevertheless official statistics cover most irrigated croplands and seem to be the only reliable data source that is available mapping irrigated croplands based on remote sensing methods may be a more objective solution when enough ground truth samples can be obtained thenkabail et al 2009a xie and lark 2021 the second is the potential uncertainty of the initial irrigation map mirad gi although the peak greenness has been used as the key differentiator between irrigated and rainfed crops ozdogan et al 2010 the effectiveness of this approach is usually compromised in humid environments deines et al 2017 pervez and brown 2010 xu et al 2019 such as the southern and coastal china however we still have confidence in mirad gi because croplands in southern and coastal china are sparsely distributed and account for only a small part of the whole cropland area so that the bias introduced by gi s false detection is limited furthermore the uncertainty of mirad gi can be constrained and mitigated in the synergy mapping process to some extent third the synergy irrigation map is highly dependent on the input datasets and their weight order local discrepancies among the different input datasets could lead to uncertainties also the ranking list used in our study was employed for all fields and did not consider local discrepancies because irrigation products could have different accuracies in different regions the score table should be dynamic and regional specific lu et al 2017 therefore local adaptive weight ranking orders can be developed in the future when more information on the spatial differences in their accuracies is available last is the uncertainty of accuracy assessment it is difficult to collect nationwide ground truth points for a comprehensive evaluation so we selected four typical districts to implement pixel wise validation which may lead to some potential biases however these four regions represent important agricultural bases with different climatic and ecological backgrounds text s3 and more importantly we pay more attention to the accuracy performance in these extensively irrigated districts than other sparsely irrigated areas furthermore these districts may be considered as the sampling validation zones on behalf of the whole to be verified fields according to the sampling inspection method 5 conclusions irrigation is vital for increasing agricultural production and regional food security by reducing crop vulnerability to droughts the expansion of irrigated croplands may increase the pressure on water resources and influence regional climate thus tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigated croplands could facilitate water management and its adaptation to climate change we produced annual irrigation maps irrimap syn across mainland china for 2000 2019 through the synergy of remote sensing statistics and historical irrigation datasets our maps had a high overall accuracy which was assessed using ground truth validations in four representative irrigation districts our resultant annual maps provide a complete picture of the changes in irrigated croplands across mainland china in the 21st century we found a substantial increase in irrigated croplands in china from 52 800 000 to 65 900 000 ha 24 8 over the past two decades remarkable spatial differences in irrigated area and their changes can be found among the provinces and watersheds specifically irrigated croplands in heilongjiang expanded the most 200 followed by guizhou 140 and xinjiang 74 beijing had the largest decrease in the irrigated area 72 followed by shanghai 33 the increase in cropland area and continuous investments in the construction of water conservancy facilities were identified as major drivers for the expansion of irrigation we also found that the dynamics of irrigated areas can explain changes in water consumption at the catchment level with high correlations in the songnen and liaohe river basin and the yangtze river basin and a low correlation in the haihe river basin with the increasing population and demand for food irrigation is expected to expand in the future thus the potential consequences of increased cropland irrigation need more attention knowledge of the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of irrigated areas is of vital significance for evaluating the trade offs between food security and water security in the context of climate

corresponding author handling editor dr b e clothier mobile drip irrigation mdi system is interesting because it combines the efficiency of drip irrigation with the versatility of center pivot irrigation however experimental information about clogging of mdi emitters caused by dragging of driplines on the ground and by solid particles in the irrigation water simultaneously are not presented to date in the literature the objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of high flow mdi drippers regarding the clogging resistance of emitters from dragging driplines over different soil types experiment 1 and regarding clogging resistance from solid particles in the irrigation water experiment 2 the research was carried out at the irrigation material testing laboratory at the university of s√£o paulo usp brazil in experiment 1 dragging of driplines over ground for 3 soil types for different dripper models under dynamic and static conditions were tested in experiment 2 driplines resistance to clogging by solid particles in the irrigation water was evaluated dragging of driplines over ground did not cause significant clogging of emitters a and b for the in dynamic

down showed a 25 flow rate reduction over the 500 h of evaluation emitter b with the pre filter vertical and facing upwards had the highest average relative flows of 98 2 and 94 6 respectively while

probability that farmers will adopt the mdi system for their mechanized irrigation systems and thus realize the economic and environmental advantages of this hybrid irrigation method using a filtering system with larger screen openings and fewer filter elements less maintenance greater water use efficiency by crops no evaporation or drift loses and greater energy efficiency of the pumping system this research evaluated the resistance of high flow drip emitters to clogging from the entrance of soil particles through outlet holes of drippers by dragging driplines over the irrigated area and the resistance of high flow drip emitters to clogging from solid particles in the irrigation water 2 material and methods 2 1 location and characterization of test benches the research was carried out at the irrigation material testing laboratory lemi of the biosystems engineering department at the university of s√£o paulo esalq usp piracicaba sp brazil two separated experiments were carried out in the experiment 1 driplines dragging condition in an mdi system was simulated and emitter resistance to clogging was evaluated through the entry of soil particles into the water outlet holes of the drippers in the direction from outside to inside of dripline in experiment 2 the clogging resistance of driplines to solid particles suspended in the irrigation water was evaluated in experiment 1 to simulate the dragging condition a specific bench was designed fig 1 the test bench was composed of metallic gutters covered with a geotextile blanket where soils and a displacement mechanism were adapted video link https youtu be kmdbu yfgiy the displacement mechanism fig 2a was composed of a metallic structure 6 m x 1 m which was moved over a set of pulleys and a pair of rack rails by means of a motor with a nominal voltage of 12 v a 5 v voltage regulator was used to electronically reduce the engine rotation speed obtaining the proper speed for testing and an inductive pnp positive negative positive sensor was installed at the end of the rack rail fig 2b which reversed the direction of rotation of the motor when the platform reached that point resulting in the alternate drag of the driplines the displacement system was powered by a 60 w power supply controlled from an electronic set using an arduino microcontroller the developed mechanism promoted a maximum displacement speed of the driplines of about 2 cm s 1 comparable to traditional rotation speeds of the center pivot equipment in the field a closed hydraulic circuit consisting of a motor driven centrifugal pump pressure gauges filters and flexible pipes was developed to supply the driplines three driplines with a length of 6 m were fed simultaneously to allow recirculation of water to the reservoir a gutter was added to the system the use of flexible pipes at the entrance to the manifold of the gutters fig 2c allowed the metal structure of the displacement system to move without interrupting the water supply to the driplines for the clogging resistance test by solid particles in the irrigation water experiment 2 another bench consisting of a closed hydraulic circuit with a 250 l reservoir was used fig 3 to keep the particles in suspension a mechanical propeller stirrer was used a motorized pump fed the bypass pipes which were built in symmetrical bifurcations to avoid a preferential flow path of solid particles in the manifold at the end of the lateral lines center pivot type nozzles were added to control the flow velocity 1 m s 1 preventing the sedimentation of particles inside the driplines the flow from driplines returned to the reservoir through the gutter which was installed on a slope to prevent contaminants from entering the system a sieve was installed on the return pipe to the reservoir the sieve mesh was modified in each phase of the clogging test according to the size of solid particles applied in each test phase more details of the clogging test bench can be found in lavanholi et al 2018 and pereira et al 2020 who developed the same kind of clogging test using low flow emitters in the same laboratory in the same test bench under similar conditions of water quality and methodology 2 2 characterization of evaluated emitters for the two experiments performed in this research three dripline models with non compensating integrated cylindrical emitters with a service pressure of 98 kpa were used each with a nominal dripline diameter of 0 016 m and spaced at 0 20 m the hydraulic characteristics of the emitters labeled a b and c are shown in table 1 in the tests that simulate dripline drag on the ground emitter models a and b were used in the tests of resistance to clogging by solid particles in the irrigation water emitters b and c were used dripper design geometries are shown in fig 4 the water trajectory inside the emitter follows a path from the pre filter through the labyrinth and the transition zone to the exit orifice the dimensions of the pre filter and labyrinth structures are shown in table 2 initially the dragging test experiment 1 was performed using emitters a and b with higher flow rates traditionally used on mdi systems the initial hypothesis was that higher flow rates with larger outlet holes would be more susceptible to clogging under dragging conditions for the clogging test of solid particles in the irrigation water experiment 2 emitter a was replaced by emitter c with the minimum flow rate traditionally used on mdi systems emitter a was not evaluated in experiment 2 because its flow rate was very close to that of emitter b and according to the research project schedule there was enough time to test only two emitters in this second experiment the hypothesis here was that a lower flow rate emitter would be more susceptible to clogging by solid particles in the irrigation water 2 3 tests to simulate dripline drag on the ground experiment 1 three types of soil were used in this test table 3 to simulate the different kinds of soil particles that can be present in the field before starting the dragging tests an accommodation step was performed to settle the soil in the gutter the settlement of the soil under the geotextile blanket was necessary to eliminate porous spaces which could allow a preferential flow of water from the emitters fractured flow driplines were subjected to 500 h of dragging over simulated wet soil conditions for a total distance of 40 000 m testing was conducted for approximately 50 days throughout 2020 with 10 h of testing per day this number of hours was calculated as the average time used to irrigate the full growing cycle of a commercial industrial tomato crop in the cerrado region of central brazil savanna area in this test the water was recirculated to represent the conditions of irrigation with surface water used in the savanna areas of central brazil despite the recirculation the water used in the experiment had excellent quality at the entrance of the driplines because there was a water filtration system that was composed of a geotextile blanket sieve systems a decanter tank and a disk filter 100 mesh before entering manifold with driplines the values of suspended solid particles concentration in the recirculated irrigation water respected the low risk level of classification from nakayama and bucks 1991 after this filtration step the water had an electrical conductivity of about 50 Œºs cm 1 to control chemical and biological agents during the experiment the temperature ph and electrical conductivity of the water were monitored as recommended by pereira et al 2020 water temperature was monitored to correct the specific weight of water a water ph of 5 1 6 3 was observed throughout the test period to assess emitter clogging degree flow tests were performed on 20 samples of each emitter and soil type combination at the beginning of each test the test bench was filled up initially with deionized water from a filtering system and every 125 h of operation of the drag system a flow measurement of emitters was carried out by weighing the volume of water collected on an electronic scale marte model as 5500 c the collection time 420 s was measured with a digital cronometer to simulate the end of a growing cycle static condition when the irrigation system is turned off in the field irrigation was stopped for 30 days causing a reduction in soil moisture under the gutters after the 30 days pause the flow test of the emitters was carried out again to verify clogging of the emitters the sensitivity to dripper clogging was evaluated through the relative flow rate throughout the experiment eq 1 according to feng et al 2019 1 dra 100 i n q i q o n where dra is the relative flow rate in qo is the initial flow of emitters in l h 1 using clean water qi is the current flow of the emitter in l h 1 on the day of assessment and n is the number of observations when the average relative flow reached the value of 75 of the initial flow the evaluated dripper was considered clogged at the end of the clogging test all clogged emitters were carefully opened to investigate the cause of clogging and photos were taken 2 4 clogging resistance tests by solid particles in the irrigation water experiment 2 for the clogging resistance test of solid particles in the irrigation water different positions of the dripper pre filter were evaluated fig 5 for model b the following pre filter positions were evaluated facing upwards c facing downwards b and facing vertical v inside the tube in the model c emitter three pre filter positions were evaluated horizontal h vertical v and diagonal d in this experiment standard deionized water of excellent quality was used thus avoiding the presence of chemical and biological agents in addition to promoting a standard of water quality the water filtration system consisted of a 5 ¬µm pleated filter irritec an activated carbon cartridge fusati a 1 ¬µm polypropylene filter 120 mesh disc filter irritec and a reverse osmosis chamber fusati after this filtration step the water had an electrical conductivity of about 50 Œºs cm 1 to control the chemical and biological agents during this test the same methodology as the tests to simulate dripline drag on the ground was used and the water temperature and ph were also monitored throughout the test period solid particles used in the clogging tests came from a natural soil of sandy loam texture classified as red yellow latosol in these tests particles with diameters from 45 to 1000 ¬µm were used which comprises the silt to sand fractions the preparation of the soil mixture followed the standard procedure for determining the particle size distribution in mineral soils iso11227 2009 which is composed of processes of destruction of organic matter dispersion of soil aggregates and separation by particle diameter to ensure the elimination of organic matter biological agent and salts chemical agent to avoid undesirable precipitations during the experiment a procedure was performed adding water to the soil samples followed by the elimination of the supernatant until reaching the electrical conductivity of the water of 400 Œºs cm 1 homogeneous soil fractions of different particle sizes were obtained for testing by shaking soil through a set of sieves of graded aperture size the compositions of particle size ranges and the amount to be added to the reservoir are shown in table 4 dripline clogging tests by solid particles in the irrigation water were carried out for 500 h throughout 2020 10 h of testing per day for 50 days at the beginning of the clogging tests before the addition of solid particles a test phase was carried out with deionized water only to determine the initial flow rate variation coefficient cvf the clogging test was divided into six phases table 5 varying the diameter and concentration of particles in addition to varying the water flow condition at the end of driplines during the first four phases the system operated with the end of the line open for 100 h of each phase at the end of each phase particles with a diameter greater than the already completed phase were added to the water reservoir at a concentration of 125 mg l 1 in phases 5 and 6 there was no increase in the concentration and diameter of the particles however there was a variation in the opening or closing of the end of the dripline in the fifth phase it was operated with the end of the line closed for 88 h and in the sixth phase it was operated with the end of the line open during 12 h of testing in drip irrigation systems under field conditions dripline ends are normally closed in tests involving particles in suspension if this condition were followed there would be an accumulation of particles inside the drippers and consequently it would cause a decrease in the concentration of test particles in the irrigation water therefore it was decided to start the trial with the ends of the lines open controlling the flow velocity in the line 1 m s 1 thus avoiding deposition in the dripline and maintaining a preferential path for the solid particles in the line under field conditions an mdi system has a maximum length of lateral lines of 50 70 m on the test bench used in experiment 1 the lateral length was only 6 m if the ends of the lines were kept closed under these conditions it would represent only the final 6 m portion of the 50 70 m of driplines in the field at the end of each day of operation the flow rate of 150 selected drippers was evaluated an electronic scale marte model as 5500c was used to determine the weight of the collected water under 420 s digital chronometer the clogging sensitivity was evaluated through the relative flow rate of emitters throughout the test phases eq 1 when the relative average flow reached the value of 75 of the initial flow the evaluated dripper was considered clogged at the end of the clogging test all clogged emitters were carefully opened to investigate the cause of clogging and photos were taken the analysis of variance anova and comparison of averages of the studied variables were performed using sisvar tukey s test of means was used assuming 95 confidence level for significance and graphical representation of the data was done using microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 tests to simulate dripline drag on the ground regarding the risk of clogging caused by mechanical dragging of driplines across different soil types dynamic conditions no reduction in the flow rate was observed for dripper models a and b after 500 h of operation regardless of the soil type considered fig 6 however after 30 days without irrigation static conditions which allowed the drying of sludge around driplines and inside emitters there was visible soil aggregation on the external walls of driplines and a reduction in the flow rate with s1 and s2 soils of 27 and 20 respectively for model a and 47 and 35 respectively for model b with soil s3 there was an 8 flow reduction in model a but none in model b when opening drippers for examining the cause of the clogging it was observed that there was an accumulation plug mainly in the exit orifice fig 7a and in a small number of occurrences in the transition zone between the labyrinth and the exit orifice fig 7b the accumulation of large particles near the dripper s exit orifice mainly with soils s1 and s2 was the main cause of the clogging although these dripper models have more than one outlet these could become clogged when they were in contact with the soil surface soils s1 and s2 have a high sand content which favors the deposition of large particles in the exit orifice blocking the flow to minimize the clogging risk of driplines during prolonged periods of equipment shutdown in the field the pump could be run periodically with the mdi system stopped in the resting position this is like the flushing procedure commonly used in fixed drip irrigation systems to clean out sediments inside the lines to reduce emitter clogging chemical treatments such as chlorination could also be used to promote favorable conditions for longer system shutdowns after repeated dragging driplines on the ground revealed no damage to the external walls of the polyethylene pipe this demonstrated the resistance to abrasion by the three soils analyzed under conditions of different texture and moisture indicating that this mdi system is mechanically sound from an operational standpoint for these drippers it is important to emphasize that under field conditions driplines can be subject on some occasions to cuts and cracks caused by stones screws pins etc another point that deserves attention under normal operating conditions of an mdi is the reversal movement of center pivot direction which can twist the driplines blocking the flow of irrigation water in certain portion of these lines therefore in future mdi studies it is recommended an experiment to evaluate the flow blockage effect of torsion on driplines reversal movement 3 2 clogging resistance tests by solid particles in the irrigation water fig 8 shows the results of the clogging test for emitters b and c both models proved to be resistant to the test protocol up to phase 1 with particles 125 ¬µm regardless of pre filter position with increasing particle diameter up to 212 ¬µm only model b with the pre filter facing down showed sensitivity to clogging resulting in approximately 25 flow reduction with the pre filter vertical and facing upwards relative flows of 96 and 87 were obtained in the face down position the relative flow was 65 of the initial condition which proved that this emitter was very resistant to the test protocol fig 8a model c was found to be resistant to clogging up to the beginning of phase 3 of the test particles with diameters up to 500 ¬µm with a relative flow rate 84 for all positions of the pre filter fig 8b in phase 4 the flow reduction with the pre filter in the horizontal position 44 of the initial flow was statistically significant in phase 5 with the end of the lateral line closed there was a very brief overpressure of 2 94 mpa in the system which unblocked some drippers and increased the relative flow this observation was also made by li et al 2019 who showed that overpressure on the hydraulic network of drip irrigation systems can help to clean emitters under certain conditions in phase 6 in which the ends of the lines were reopened the sedimented solid particles began circulating throughout the entire bench which clogged the emitters and reduced the relative flow in general model b was more resistant to clogging than model c table 6 probably because of the difference in the internal dimensions of the labyrinths of the two drippers emitters with smaller dimensions are more susceptible to clogging model c presents labyrinth dimensions close to the largest dimension of the pre filter with a width of 0 8 mm this dimension is only 1 6 times larger than the diameter of the largest particle in phase 3 of the test at which point the onset of clogging was observed in this phase the smallest dimension of model b depth is about twice as large as the particle diameter because the filters recommended for drip irrigation are 120 mesh 125 ¬µm the particles present from phase 2 on would be retained kisekka et al 2017 o shaughnessy and colaizzi 2017 however these particles could enter the system under negative pressure conditions when the system is shut down or is being assembled in the field however even under extreme operating conditions model b proved to be resistant to clogging by solid particles while model c remained susceptible to clogging it was verified that there was a greater resistance to clogging by solid particles in high flow emitters mdi for systems operating at low flow rates of 2 l h 1 fixed drip emitters pereira et al 2020 and lavanholi et al 2019 using the same test bench in the same laboratory and the using the same methodology under similar water quality conditions reported that the small dimensions of the labyrinths caused these emitters to be easily clogged by 150 ¬µm diameter particles even at low concentrations in this study emitters b and c were only susceptible to clogging by particles 212 ¬µm in terms of improvement in wp mdi overcame the disadvantages of the surface drip irrigation system cited by aydinsakir et al 2021 and wang et al 2021 and reduced the disadvantages of the center pivot sprinkler irrigation system cited by sadeghi et al 2017 al ghobari et al 2018 and hui et al 2021 although high flow emitters are more resistant to clogging by solid particles there is still a need for an adequate filtration system however the filter can have a larger screen opening which reduces its cost and the number of filter elements in operation and maintenance of the mdi system kisseka et al 2017 compared the mdi to a low elevation spray application lesa system in western kansas usa and demonstrated that it was possible to virtually eliminate emitter clogging problems using only a 130 ¬µm disc filter in the mdi system as for the observed clogging processes three phenomena should be noted the deposition of a single particle larger than one of the dimensions of the labyrinth channel deposition of a large particle followed by smaller particles and deposition of numerous smaller particles which accumulate and block the flow fig 9 a pre filter with a smaller passage section could be constructed as a preventive measure for inefficient filtration situations or the entry of large particles into the system in the evaluated models the smallest dimension of the pre filter presents similar dimensions with the smallest dimension of the labyrinth by optimizing the pre filter and respecting the hydraulic conditions of the emitter it should be possible to have an emitter with high resistance to clogging and excellent hydraulic performance on mdi systems conditions 4 conclusions the results obtained in this mobile drip irrigation mdi study showed the good resistance to clogging of high flow drip emitters 3 8 l h 1 from dragging driplines over three different soil types however care must be taken to prevent clogging under static conditions when the equipment sits idle in the field under continuous operation no emitter clogging phenomena were observed in the mdi system from any of the soil types tested and emitter models a and b during prolonged periods of equipment downtime however the solidification of mud outside driplines and the aggregation of soil particles inside the emitter s labyrinth plugging can cause an incrustation process that is not easily reversible after turning the irrigation system back on resulting in a significant clogging level of the high flow emitters for the three soil types the clogging of the high flow emitters models b and c by solid particles suspended in the irrigation water was dependent on the orientation of the emitter pre filter inside the dripline pre filters facing down were more sensitive to solid particle clogging the analyzed dripper models had relative flow rate averages 70 up to 300 h of evaluation in all tested pre filter positions declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

probability that farmers will adopt the mdi system for their mechanized irrigation systems and thus realize the economic and environmental advantages of this hybrid irrigation method using a filtering system with larger screen openings and fewer filter elements less maintenance greater water use efficiency by crops no evaporation or drift loses and greater energy efficiency of the pumping system this research evaluated the resistance of high flow drip emitters to clogging from the entrance of soil particles through outlet holes of drippers by dragging driplines over the irrigated area and the resistance of high flow drip emitters to clogging from solid particles in the irrigation water 2 material and methods 2 1 location and characterization of test benches the research was carried out at the irrigation material testing laboratory lemi of the biosystems engineering department at the university of s√£o paulo esalq usp piracicaba sp brazil two separated experiments were carried out in the experiment 1 driplines dragging condition in an mdi system was simulated and emitter resistance to clogging was evaluated through the entry of soil particles into the water outlet holes of the drippers in the direction from outside to inside of dripline in experiment 2 the clogging resistance of driplines to solid particles suspended in the irrigation water was evaluated in experiment 1 to simulate the dragging condition a specific bench was designed fig 1 the test bench was composed of metallic gutters covered with a geotextile blanket where soils and a displacement mechanism were adapted video link https youtu be kmdbu yfgiy the displacement mechanism fig 2a was composed of a metallic structure 6 m x 1 m which was moved over a set of pulleys and a pair of rack rails by means of a motor with a nominal voltage of 12 v a 5 v voltage regulator was used to electronically reduce the engine rotation speed obtaining the proper speed for testing and an inductive pnp positive negative positive sensor was installed at the end of the rack rail fig 2b which reversed the direction of rotation of the motor when the platform reached that point resulting in the alternate drag of the driplines the displacement system was powered by a 60 w power supply controlled from an electronic set using an arduino microcontroller the developed mechanism promoted a maximum displacement speed of the driplines of about 2 cm s 1 comparable to traditional rotation speeds of the center pivot equipment in the field a closed hydraulic circuit consisting of a motor driven centrifugal pump pressure gauges filters and flexible pipes was developed to supply the driplines three driplines with a length of 6 m were fed simultaneously to allow recirculation of water to the reservoir a gutter was added to the system the use of flexible pipes at the entrance to the manifold of the gutters fig 2c allowed the metal structure of the displacement system to move without interrupting the water supply to the driplines for the clogging resistance test by solid particles in the irrigation water experiment 2 another bench consisting of a closed hydraulic circuit with a 250 l reservoir was used fig 3 to keep the particles in suspension a mechanical propeller stirrer was used a motorized pump fed the bypass pipes which were built in symmetrical bifurcations to avoid a preferential flow path of solid particles in the manifold at the end of the lateral lines center pivot type nozzles were added to control the flow velocity 1 m s 1 preventing the sedimentation of particles inside the driplines the flow from driplines returned to the reservoir through the gutter which was installed on a slope to prevent contaminants from entering the system a sieve was installed on the return pipe to the reservoir the sieve mesh was modified in each phase of the clogging test according to the size of solid particles applied in each test phase more details of the clogging test bench can be found in lavanholi et al 2018 and pereira et al 2020 who developed the same kind of clogging test using low flow emitters in the same laboratory in the same test bench under similar conditions of water quality and methodology 2 2 characterization of evaluated emitters for the two experiments performed in this research three dripline models with non compensating integrated cylindrical emitters with a service pressure of 98 kpa were used each with a nominal dripline diameter of 0 016 m and spaced at 0 20 m the hydraulic characteristics of the emitters labeled a b and c are shown in table 1 in the tests that simulate dripline drag on the ground emitter models a and b were used in the tests of resistance to clogging by solid particles in the irrigation water emitters b and c were used dripper design geometries are shown in fig 4 the water trajectory inside the emitter follows a path from the pre filter through the labyrinth and the transition zone to the exit orifice the dimensions of the pre filter and labyrinth structures are shown in table 2 initially the dragging test experiment 1 was performed using emitters a and b with higher flow rates traditionally used on mdi systems the initial hypothesis was that higher flow rates with larger outlet holes would be more susceptible to clogging under dragging conditions for the clogging test of solid particles in the irrigation water experiment 2 emitter a was replaced by emitter c with the minimum flow rate traditionally used on mdi systems emitter a was not evaluated in experiment 2 because its flow rate was very close to that of emitter b and according to the research project schedule there was enough time to test only two emitters in this second experiment the hypothesis here was that a lower flow rate emitter would be more susceptible to clogging by solid particles in the irrigation water 2 3 tests to simulate dripline drag on the ground experiment 1 three types of soil were used in this test table 3 to simulate the different kinds of soil particles that can be present in the field before starting the dragging tests an accommodation step was performed to settle the soil in the gutter the settlement of the soil under the geotextile blanket was necessary to eliminate porous spaces which could allow a preferential flow of water from the emitters fractured flow driplines were subjected to 500 h of dragging over simulated wet soil conditions for a total distance of 40 000 m testing was conducted for approximately 50 days throughout 2020 with 10 h of testing per day this number of hours was calculated as the average time used to irrigate the full growing cycle of a commercial industrial tomato crop in the cerrado region of central brazil savanna area in this test the water was recirculated to represent the conditions of irrigation with surface water used in the savanna areas of central brazil despite the recirculation the water used in the experiment had excellent quality at the entrance of the driplines because there was a water filtration system that was composed of a geotextile blanket sieve systems a decanter tank and a disk filter 100 mesh before entering manifold with driplines the values of suspended solid particles concentration in the recirculated irrigation water respected the low risk level of classification from nakayama and bucks 1991 after this filtration step the water had an electrical conductivity of about 50 Œºs cm 1 to control chemical and biological agents during the experiment the temperature ph and electrical conductivity of the water were monitored as recommended by pereira et al 2020 water temperature was monitored to correct the specific weight of water a water ph of 5 1 6 3 was observed throughout the test period to assess emitter clogging degree flow tests were performed on 20 samples of each emitter and soil type combination at the beginning of each test the test bench was filled up initially with deionized water from a filtering system and every 125 h of operation of the drag system a flow measurement of emitters was carried out by weighing the volume of water collected on an electronic scale marte model as 5500 c the collection time 420 s was measured with a digital cronometer to simulate the end of a growing cycle static condition when the irrigation system is turned off in the field irrigation was stopped for 30 days causing a reduction in soil moisture under the gutters after the 30 days pause the flow test of the emitters was carried out again to verify clogging of the emitters the sensitivity to dripper clogging was evaluated through the relative flow rate throughout the experiment eq 1 according to feng et al 2019 1 dra 100 i n q i q o n where dra is the relative flow rate in qo is the initial flow of emitters in l h 1 using clean water qi is the current flow of the emitter in l h 1 on the day of assessment and n is the number of observations when the average relative flow reached the value of 75 of the initial flow the evaluated dripper was considered clogged at the end of the clogging test all clogged emitters were carefully opened to investigate the cause of clogging and photos were taken 2 4 clogging resistance tests by solid particles in the irrigation water experiment 2 for the clogging resistance test of solid particles in the irrigation water different positions of the dripper pre filter were evaluated fig 5 for model b the following pre filter positions were evaluated facing upwards c facing downwards b and facing vertical v inside the tube in the model c emitter three pre filter positions were evaluated horizontal h vertical v and diagonal d in this experiment standard deionized water of excellent quality was used thus avoiding the presence of chemical and biological agents in addition to promoting a standard of water quality the water filtration system consisted of a 5 ¬µm pleated filter irritec an activated carbon cartridge fusati a 1 ¬µm polypropylene filter 120 mesh disc filter irritec and a reverse osmosis chamber fusati after this filtration step the water had an electrical conductivity of about 50 Œºs cm 1 to control the chemical and biological agents during this test the same methodology as the tests to simulate dripline drag on the ground was used and the water temperature and ph were also monitored throughout the test period solid particles used in the clogging tests came from a natural soil of sandy loam texture classified as red yellow latosol in these tests particles with diameters from 45 to 1000 ¬µm were used which comprises the silt to sand fractions the preparation of the soil mixture followed the standard procedure for determining the particle size distribution in mineral soils iso11227 2009 which is composed of processes of destruction of organic matter dispersion of soil aggregates and separation by particle diameter to ensure the elimination of organic matter biological agent and salts chemical agent to avoid undesirable precipitations during the experiment a procedure was performed adding water to the soil samples followed by the elimination of the supernatant until reaching the electrical conductivity of the water of 400 Œºs cm 1 homogeneous soil fractions of different particle sizes were obtained for testing by shaking soil through a set of sieves of graded aperture size the compositions of particle size ranges and the amount to be added to the reservoir are shown in table 4 dripline clogging tests by solid particles in the irrigation water were carried out for 500 h throughout 2020 10 h of testing per day for 50 days at the beginning of the clogging tests before the addition of solid particles a test phase was carried out with deionized water only to determine the initial flow rate variation coefficient cvf the clogging test was divided into six phases table 5 varying the diameter and concentration of particles in addition to varying the water flow condition at the end of driplines during the first four phases the system operated with the end of the line open for 100 h of each phase at the end of each phase particles with a diameter greater than the already completed phase were added to the water reservoir at a concentration of 125 mg l 1 in phases 5 and 6 there was no increase in the concentration and diameter of the particles however there was a variation in the opening or closing of the end of the dripline in the fifth phase it was operated with the end of the line closed for 88 h and in the sixth phase it was operated with the end of the line open during 12 h of testing in drip irrigation systems under field conditions dripline ends are normally closed in tests involving particles in suspension if this condition were followed there would be an accumulation of particles inside the drippers and consequently it would cause a decrease in the concentration of test particles in the irrigation water therefore it was decided to start the trial with the ends of the lines open controlling the flow velocity in the line 1 m s 1 thus avoiding deposition in the dripline and maintaining a preferential path for the solid particles in the line under field conditions an mdi system has a maximum length of lateral lines of 50 70 m on the test bench used in experiment 1 the lateral length was only 6 m if the ends of the lines were kept closed under these conditions it would represent only the final 6 m portion of the 50 70 m of driplines in the field at the end of each day of operation the flow rate of 150 selected drippers was evaluated an electronic scale marte model as 5500c was used to determine the weight of the collected water under 420 s digital chronometer the clogging sensitivity was evaluated through the relative flow rate of emitters throughout the test phases eq 1 when the relative average flow reached the value of 75 of the initial flow the evaluated dripper was considered clogged at the end of the clogging test all clogged emitters were carefully opened to investigate the cause of clogging and photos were taken the analysis of variance anova and comparison of averages of the studied variables were performed using sisvar tukey s test of means was used assuming 95 confidence level for significance and graphical representation of the data was done using microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 tests to simulate dripline drag on the ground regarding the risk of clogging caused by mechanical dragging of driplines across different soil types dynamic conditions no reduction in the flow rate was observed for dripper models a and b after 500 h of operation regardless of the soil type considered fig 6 however after 30 days without irrigation static conditions which allowed the drying of sludge around driplines and inside emitters there was visible soil aggregation on the external walls of driplines and a reduction in the flow rate with s1 and s2 soils of 27 and 20 respectively for model a and 47 and 35 respectively for model b with soil s3 there was an 8 flow reduction in model a but none in model b when opening drippers for examining the cause of the clogging it was observed that there was an accumulation plug mainly in the exit orifice fig 7a and in a small number of occurrences in the transition zone between the labyrinth and the exit orifice fig 7b the accumulation of large particles near the dripper s exit orifice mainly with soils s1 and s2 was the main cause of the clogging although these dripper models have more than one outlet these could become clogged when they were in contact with the soil surface soils s1 and s2 have a high sand content which favors the deposition of large particles in the exit orifice blocking the flow to minimize the clogging risk of driplines during prolonged periods of equipment shutdown in the field the pump could be run periodically with the mdi system stopped in the resting position this is like the flushing procedure commonly used in fixed drip irrigation systems to clean out sediments inside the lines to reduce emitter clogging chemical treatments such as chlorination could also be used to promote favorable conditions for longer system shutdowns after repeated dragging driplines on the ground revealed no damage to the external walls of the polyethylene pipe this demonstrated the resistance to abrasion by the three soils analyzed under conditions of different texture and moisture indicating that this mdi system is mechanically sound from an operational standpoint for these drippers it is important to emphasize that under field conditions driplines can be subject on some occasions to cuts and cracks caused by stones screws pins etc another point that deserves attention under normal operating conditions of an mdi is the reversal movement of center pivot direction which can twist the driplines blocking the flow of irrigation water in certain portion of these lines therefore in future mdi studies it is recommended an experiment to evaluate the flow blockage effect of torsion on driplines reversal movement 3 2 clogging resistance tests by solid particles in the irrigation water fig 8 shows the results of the clogging test for emitters b and c both models proved to be resistant to the test protocol up to phase 1 with particles 125 ¬µm regardless of pre filter position with increasing particle diameter up to 212 ¬µm only model b with the pre filter facing down showed sensitivity to clogging resulting in approximately 25 flow reduction with the pre filter vertical and facing upwards relative flows of 96 and 87 were obtained in the face down position the relative flow was 65 of the initial condition which proved that this emitter was very resistant to the test protocol fig 8a model c was found to be resistant to clogging up to the beginning of phase 3 of the test particles with diameters up to 500 ¬µm with a relative flow rate 84 for all positions of the pre filter fig 8b in phase 4 the flow reduction with the pre filter in the horizontal position 44 of the initial flow was statistically significant in phase 5 with the end of the lateral line closed there was a very brief overpressure of 2 94 mpa in the system which unblocked some drippers and increased the relative flow this observation was also made by li et al 2019 who showed that overpressure on the hydraulic network of drip irrigation systems can help to clean emitters under certain conditions in phase 6 in which the ends of the lines were reopened the sedimented solid particles began circulating throughout the entire bench which clogged the emitters and reduced the relative flow in general model b was more resistant to clogging than model c table 6 probably because of the difference in the internal dimensions of the labyrinths of the two drippers emitters with smaller dimensions are more susceptible to clogging model c presents labyrinth dimensions close to the largest dimension of the pre filter with a width of 0 8 mm this dimension is only 1 6 times larger than the diameter of the largest particle in phase 3 of the test at which point the onset of clogging was observed in this phase the smallest dimension of model b depth is about twice as large as the particle diameter because the filters recommended for drip irrigation are 120 mesh 125 ¬µm the particles present from phase 2 on would be retained kisekka et al 2017 o shaughnessy and colaizzi 2017 however these particles could enter the system under negative pressure conditions when the system is shut down or is being assembled in the field however even under extreme operating conditions model b proved to be resistant to clogging by solid particles while model c remained susceptible to clogging it was verified that there was a greater resistance to clogging by solid particles in high flow emitters mdi for systems operating at low flow rates of 2 l h 1 fixed drip emitters pereira et al 2020 and lavanholi et al 2019 using the same test bench in the same laboratory and the using the same methodology under similar water quality conditions reported that the small dimensions of the labyrinths caused these emitters to be easily clogged by 150 ¬µm diameter particles even at low concentrations in this study emitters b and c were only susceptible to clogging by particles 212 ¬µm in terms of improvement in wp mdi overcame the disadvantages of the surface drip irrigation system cited by aydinsakir et al 2021 and wang et al 2021 and reduced the disadvantages of the center pivot sprinkler irrigation system cited by sadeghi et al 2017 al ghobari et al 2018 and hui et al 2021 although high flow emitters are more resistant to clogging by solid particles there is still a need for an adequate filtration system however the filter can have a larger screen opening which reduces its cost and the number of filter elements in operation and maintenance of the mdi system kisseka et al 2017 compared the mdi to a low elevation spray application lesa system in western kansas usa and demonstrated that it was possible to virtually eliminate emitter clogging problems using only a 130 ¬µm disc filter in the mdi system as for the observed clogging processes three phenomena should be noted the deposition of a single particle larger than one of the dimensions of the labyrinth channel deposition of a large particle followed by smaller particles and deposition of numerous smaller particles which accumulate and block the flow fig 9 a pre filter with a smaller passage section could be constructed as a preventive measure for inefficient filtration situations or the entry of large particles into the system in the evaluated models the smallest dimension of the pre filter presents similar dimensions with the smallest dimension of the labyrinth by optimizing the pre filter and respecting the hydraulic conditions of the emitter it should be possible to have an emitter with high resistance to clogging and excellent hydraulic performance on mdi systems conditions 4 conclusions the results obtained in this mobile drip irrigation mdi study showed the good resistance to clogging of high flow drip emitters 3 8 l h 1 from dragging driplines over three different soil types however care must be taken to prevent clogging under static conditions when the equipment sits idle in the field under continuous operation no emitter clogging phenomena were observed in the mdi system from any of the soil types tested and emitter models a and b during prolonged periods of equipment downtime however the solidification of mud outside driplines and the aggregation of soil particles inside the emitter s labyrinth plugging can cause an incrustation process that is not easily reversible after turning the irrigation system back on resulting in a significant clogging level of the high flow emitters for the three soil types the clogging of the high flow emitters models b and c by solid particles suspended in the irrigation water was dependent on the orientation of the emitter pre filter inside the dripline pre filters facing down were more sensitive to solid particle clogging the analyzed dripper models had relative flow rate averages 70 up to 300 h of evaluation in all tested pre filter positions declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

9644,rapid and accurate monitoring of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields the start end duration and irrigation peak etc at field scales is crucial to the fine management of agricultural water resources especially in typical areas with water shortages however there is still a lack of sufficient research to depict irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at high temporal and spatial levels to this end this study fused sentinel 2 and modis images to map the spatio temporal dynamics of irrigation events in paddy fields a popular spatiotemporal fusion algorithm enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm was used to generate 25 high spatial resolution 10 m remote sensing images based on 9 sentinel 2 images and 24 modis images random forest algorithm was used to extract the spatial distribution of irrigated paddy fields water body index and vegetation index were employed to identify the start end and duration of irrigation in paddy fields penman monteith model was used to estimate water surplus and deficit of irrigation during the critical irrigation period with daily observation data from meteorological stations this study was carried out in rice growing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china the results indicated that the spatial distribution difference of irrigation events in paddy fields with the shortest 3 day interval could be monitored in collaboration with sentinel 2 and modis images the start end and duration of irrigation in paddy fields presented significant spatial differences at field scales a large amount of water from groundwater and yellow river was needed because the total water shortage of irrigation in paddy fields in the study area was about 80 79 of the total water demand in addition paddy fields with higher water demand were more concentrated spatially as were paddy fields with lower water demand the feasibility of spatiotemporal fusion of multi source remote sensing data makes it possible to continuously monitor irrigation dynamics in paddy fields on high spatial resolution scales which is conducive to the construction of spatiotemporal database and big data platform of agricultural irrigation information this would not only help in promoting the high quality development of agricultural water resources management but also alleviating the contradiction of regional water resources graphical abstract ga1 keywords sentinel 2 spatiotemporal fusion paddy fields water dynamics yellow river basin 1 introduction eighty six percent of the world s rice grows in flooding paddy fields which require 25 33 of the world s developed freshwater resources ranghetti et al 2016 the high water demand for irrigation in paddy fields has brought attention to the management of agricultural water resources zhang and zeng 2015 g zhang et al 2015 in recent years freshwater resources for irrigation have become increasingly scarce due to population growth rapid economic development environmental pollution and resource depletion the traditional rice planting mode requires continuous irrigation to ensure that the paddy fields flooded during the rice growing period to effectively save freshwater resources the continuous irrigation is gradually changing to the discontinuous irrigation for the discontinuous irrigation mode the flooding status of the paddy field changes dynamically during the rice growing period however the discontinuous irrigation mode easily causes a loss of about 10 30 in the rice yield cesari de maria et al 2016 meanwhile changes in irrigation patterns of paddy fields may also cause freshwater resources to shift from the land surface and conflicts in water use by multiple crops ultimately these changes will affect the allocation of regional water resources and the balance of surface water teluguntla et al 2015 flooding paddy fields are often regarded as an important aquatic ecosystem with constructed wetland function as they contain a large number of terrestrial and aquatic organisms elphick et al 2010 tornos et al 2015 the dynamic change of irrigation in paddy fields will lead to the change in the ecological environment system in paddy fields niel and mcvicar 2004 for example with the popularization of direct seeding rice technology changes in the starting and ending date of irrigation in paddy fields can easily reduce the available habitat area for birds during nesting which will affect the birds reproduction and survival ranghetti et al 2016 paddy fields are also among the main sources of greenhouse gases such as methane and n2o and the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields significantly affects the emission of greenhouse gases denier 2000 ranghetti et al 2016 tornos et al 2015 wassmann et al 2000 for instance the greenhouse effect of discontinuous irrigation in paddy fields mainly emitting n2o is 30 45 times that of continuous flooding paddy fields mainly emitting methane kritee et al 2018 therefore monitoring the key temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields can better quantify the impact of the rice ecosystem on regional water resources management policies and sustainable development of the regional ecological environment irrigation events in paddy fields have significant seasonality the flooding signal after irrigation was first used to monitor the hydrological changes in the paddy field in the early stage of transplanting xiao et al 2002 believed that the significant increase of surface water before and after irrigation was sensitive to capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of hydrology in paddy fields during the transformation from non rice agriculture such as winter wheat to rice agriculture zheng 2008 argued that the flooding signal of paddy fields was capable to identify paddy fields and non paddy fields in the soaking and transplanting periods thereby providing useful information for estimating rice yield and distribution xiao et al 2006 identified the initial time and spatial distribution of irrigation in paddy fields and rice transplanting according to the abnormal increase of surface water and established a rice agricultural management database for 13 countries in south and southeast asia which was very useful for farmland irrigation food security and greenhouse gas emission estimation in these countries in recent years the diffusion from flooding paddy fields to upland rice in the major rice growing areas in italy has led to serious interference to the paddy field ecosystem on which some waterbird species depend ranghetti et al 2016 2018 analyzed the spatio temporal characteristics of irrigation management in italy providing an important basis for agricultural ecology research to promote farmers practices that favour the conservation of farmland ecosystems mor√© et al 2011 monitored and quantified the spatiotemporal variability of irrigation in paddy fields in the ebro delta of spain providing decision makers with a tool for monitoring farmers behavior these studies are of great significance for formulating effective public policies related to agricultural water management and paddy field ecosystem protection due to the differences of farmers behavior in flooding and rice transplanting the starting date ending date and duration of irrigation periods have significant spatial heterogeneity at different spatial scales xiao et al 2002 especially in areas with scattered farmland and complex planting structures xiao 2006 zheng 2008 it is inconvenient to carry out large scale monitoring in the direct investigation of the management of irrigation in paddy fields as a large number of samples are required remote sensing technology has proved to be an ideal tool for monitoring the flooding dynamics of irrigation status of paddy fields mor√© et al 2011 most detections on surface water bodies usually use medium resolution optical images such as landsat and modis images landsat data with a spatial resolution of 30 m zhou et al 2016 is very useful for mapping small water bodies or water bodies that change periodically such as rivers coastlines or lakes chormanski et al 2011 du et al 2012 feyisa et al 2014 hassani et al 2015 ouma and tateishi 2006 rokni et al 2014 tulbure et al 2013 while modis data with a 1 day temporal resolution has been widely used in monitoring the temporal and spatial changes of surface water bodies at regional or global scales boschetti et al 2014 ranghetti et al 2016 2018 however the temporal resolution of approximately 16 days provided by landsat limits the data further in terms of detecting ephemeral surface water bodies such as natural disaster flooding or agricultural irrigation and the coarse resolution 250 500 or 1000 m provides the application of modis in small areas with large errors therefore considering the limitation of spatial or temporal resolution it is difficult to monitor the agricultural irrigation dynamic at different spatial and temporal scales using a single remote sensing data source spatiotemporal fusion is a method for integrating the advantages of multi source remote sensing images to generate a joint dataset with high spatiotemporal resolution which can effectively make up for the lack of temporal or spatial resolution of a single data source the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 and enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm zhu et al 2010 are the most commonly used algorithms for realizing the spatiotemporal fusion of modis and landsat zhang and zeng 2015 g zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 previous studies demonstrated that the estarfm model was better than the starfm model in the overall prediction accuracy of time series data on complex heterogeneous regions shi et al 2015 wu et al 2014 to date studies mainly focused on the spatiotemporal fusion of modis and landsat images zhu et al 2018 the sentinel 2 satellite launched by the european space agency in 2016 is capable of providing multispectral images with a temporal resolution of five days and a spatial resolution of 10 m huang et al 2018 which significantly improves the detection performance of small surface water bodies chen et al 2020 however sentinel 2 has not been widely used in monitoring dynamic changes in agricultural irrigation ranghetti et al 2018 therefore this study aimed to combine sentinel 2 and modis data by the estarfm to analyze the spatio temporal dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields on a fine spatial scale with a resolution of 10 m in china the yellow river basin is not only an important agricultural production area but also an area with shortage of water resources zhang et al 2021 in 2019 president xi jinping proposed promote the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin then the chinese government upgraded the comprehensive management of the yellow river basin to a national strategy xiao et al 2020 the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river are located in the floods drought ecotone with a long history of wheat rice double crop in recent years most of the crops in the region have switched from rice to corn affected by the shortage of water resources which has caused the instability of the paddy field ecosystem in addition the water demand for irrigation has increased caused by the vigorous promotion of ecological agriculture models in this region such as rice fishing co cultivation of rice with fish shrimp crabs etc and rice planting cooperatives therefore studying the temporal and spatial dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river is of great significance for crop irrigation decision making and water resource management planning currently previous literature still lack extensive study by using high resolution remote sensing data to provide policy basis for promoting the high quality development of water resources utilization and alleviating regional water use conflicts we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields at the field scale using sentinel 2 and modis images this study was carried out in rice growing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china the main objectives are as follows 1 mapping the distribution of irrigated paddy fields on 10 m spatial scale using random forest algorithm 2 monitoring the dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields the start end and duration of irrigation period at field scales using water body index and vegetation index 3 analyzing the relationship between water demand water shortages and effective precipitation during the irrigation period 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in the irrigation area along the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china fig 1a this area was formed by alluvial deposits of the yellow river with a flat terrain and an altitude of about 50 100 m the climate is continental monsoon and the average annual rainfall ranges from 560 to 680 mm this area is a concentrated production base of high quality rice with a long history of wheat rice double crop at the present agricultural irrigation accounts for about 90 of the water diverted from the yellow river yang 2013 however the spatial and temporal differences of annual precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river vary significantly and the efficiency of water conservation and its intensive use is low this causes an imbalance between the supply and demand of irrigation for paddy fields in the irrigation areas along the yellow river leading to a dramatic decrease in the paddy field area in this study the rice planting areas where the paddy fields are mainly distributed on site a site b and site c were selected as the study area fig 1a direct seeding rice sowing rice seeds directly into the rice field eliminates the processes of seedling raising transplanting and planting of transplanting rice which saves considerable time and labor input costs with the transfer of the rural labor population to cities and the development of agricultural machinery and water saving technologies the rice planting pattern in the study area has gradually changed from the traditional artificial transplanted rice fig 1e to machine seeded rice fig 1f and direct seeded rice fig 1g to a certain extent the transformation of rice planting patterns has affected the management of agricultural irrigation according to the field survey the rice in the study area was planted as early as the end of may 2019 the period of rice planting was concentrated between the end of june to the beginning of july and the planting was basically completed in mid to late july we conducted field sampling in the study area from july 24th to july 25th 2019 and july 4th 2020 there are various types of paddy fields in the study area such as rice fishing co cultivation of rice with fish shrimp crabs etc rice planting bases and individual planting among them the paddy fields with the rice fishing pattern generally require a large amount of water in rice planting bases the rice seeds are usually excellent the degree of mechanization is high the management level is scientific and the paddy fields are concentrated and contiguous in the individual planting mode the rice varieties selected by farmers are not unified the growth cycle of rice is different the flooded paddy fields and upland rice are mixed the degree of mechanization is low and the rice planting is mostly artificial fig 1h i j k and l show the paddy fields at different growth stages and irrigation states indicating that there is a diversity of rice planting patterns in the study area and there were time differences in irrigation and transplanting of rice fig 1m and n show the two irrigation methods of groundwater irrigation and irrigation from the yellow river in the study area 2 2 data the data used in this paper included remote sensing data field data and meteorological data we collected relevant data from may to november because rice planting and harvest in the study area occurred during this period 2 2 1 remote sensing data a total 24 images of modis and 9 images of sentinel 2 table a 1 were used for the spatiotemporal fusion for modis 8 day composite reflectance products mod09a1 at 500 m resolution were used in this study which were acquired from https search earthdata nasa gov seven bands that have undergone atmospheric correction processing were included in mod09a1 sentinel 2 image is an advanced remote sensing data with 13 bands and a spatial resolution of 10 60 m which can be downloaded from https scihub copernicus eu among these 13 bands the resolution of the short wave infrared band is 20 m which needs to be resampled to 10 m first in addition the red green blue and near infrared bands with a resolution of 10 m are also considered in this study 2 2 2 field data field data with random sampling sorted divided into two types ground collection and google earth collection field data was collected on july 24 25 2019 and july 4 2020 the samples collected included rice samples and non rice samples construction land dry land waters beach land and bare land total 35 438 pixels were obtained through google earth and ground collection as training samples for classification total 4052 pixels were selected as test samples for accuracy verification after classification 2 2 3 meteorological data the meteorological data was adopted from the daily observation data of china s national meteorological observation stations http www resdc cn which was used to calculate the water demand of paddy fields the following seven meteorological data were employed in this paper atmospheric pressure temperature precipitation evaporation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours 3 methods the work flow of the methods in this paper mainly included three steps spatiotemporal fusion feature set construction and irrigation water dynamics monitoring in paddy fields fig 2 the estarfm random forest algorithm spectral index methods and irrigation model were conducted using arcgis10 7 idl8 5 and r version 4 0 2 the core methods were described as follows 3 1 estarfm the present evidence indicates that the fusion effect of the estarfm model was generally better than that of the starfm model on the whole shi et al 2015 wu et al 2014 hence estarfm was used for the spatiotemporal fusion of sentinel 2 and modis in this study the estarfm model improves the performance of spatiotemporal resolution reconstruction of multi source data in the heterogeneous surface environment zhu et al 2010 a more detailed description of the principle and usage of estarfm is provided by zhu et al 2010 for heterogeneous environments the core mathematical relationship of the estarfm can be expressed as 1 f x œâ 2 y œâ 2 t 2 b f x œâ 2 y œâ 2 t 1 b i 1 n w i v i c x i y i t 2 b c x i y i t 1 b where f and c represent the pixel value of a pixel in the high low spatial resolution image respectively x i and y i represent the coordinates of a pixel b represents the band name t k represents acquisition date of the image n is the number of pixels in the sliding window œâ is the size of the sliding window w i is the utilization weight of the similar pixel v i is the conversion factor for the decomposition of mixed pixels 3 2 random forest owing to its high operating efficiency strong fitting ability and high dimensional data capacity random forest rf has become one of the most popular machine learning algorithms li 2013 wang et al 2020 the main parameters of the rf include out of bag data oob the expected number of classification trees ntree and the number of features extracted when nodes are used to split mtry oob is an important parameter used to evaluate classification errors and perform feature optimization while ntree and mtry have a greater impact on the accuracy of the classification results wang et al 2020 all these parameters can automatically obtain the optimal value using the r software with packages randomforest and tunerf based on the construction of the optimal parameter of rf the r package predict can realize the classification of different features finally the extraction model of paddy fields based on the rf was completed in the r software environment 3 3 dynamic identification of irrigation in paddy fields 3 3 1 the start end and duration of irrigation period of paddy fields usually paddy fields must be irrigated in advance soaked fields to meet the large water demand of transplanted seedlings at this moment the water index in the paddy fields suddenly increases to the maximum value during the rice growing period when the seedlings are transplanted into the paddy fields the mixing of the seedlings and the water is the main characteristic of the paddy fields thereafter the value of the water body index decreases due to the infiltration and evaporation of surface water bodies in this study the occurrence of the first irrigation event in paddy fields is considered to be the starting of irrigation in paddy fields which is usually regarded as a sign of the rice planting start fisher et al 2016 created a water index wi2015 based on the bands of visible light nir and swir using linear discriminant analysis methods which achieved good results in surface water detection in this study the date corresponding to the maximum value of wi2015 was regarded as the start date of irrigation in paddy fields wi2015 is a combination of the bands of blue green red nir and swir2 and its calculation formula is as follows fisher et al 2016 2 w i 2015 1 7204 171 œÅ b l u e 3 œÅ g r e e n 70 œÅ re d 45 œÅ n i r 71 œÅ s w i r 2 where œÅ b l u e is the reflectance of blue band œÅ g r e e n is the reflectance of green band œÅ re d is the reflectance of red band œÅ n i r is the reflectance of nir band œÅ s w i r 2 is the reflectance of swir2 band at the heading stage the vegetative growth of rice reaches its peak and then the rice enters a stage dominated by reproductive growth rice demands less water at this stage and only discontinuous irrigation is required by paddy fields to keep the soil moist because the plants covered the entire paddy field during this stage the surface water of the paddy field can hardly be captured by remote sensing images therefore we assumed that the rice heading date is the ending date at which irrigation in paddy fields can be identified by remote sensing notably the end of the irrigation identification here does not imply that paddy fields no longer need to be irrigated generally the maximum value of evi can be used as an effective indicator of the rice heading stage xu et al 2012 in our study the date corresponding to the maximum value of evi was regarded as the rice heading stage which was the ending date of irrigation in paddy fields evi is a combination of the bands of blue red and nir and its calculation formula is as follows son et al 2014 3 e v i 2 5 œÅ n i r œÅ r e d œÅ n i r 6 0 œÅ r e d 7 5 œÅ b l u e 1 where œÅ b l u e is the reflectance of the blue band œÅ r e d is the reflectance of the red band œÅ n i r is the reflectance of the nir band we defined the period from the start to the end date of irrigation in paddy fields as the duration of the irrigation period during this period shallow water will continue to exist on the surface of paddy fields and can be effectively captured by remote sensing this period mainly includes the soaking transplanting tillering and booting stages 3 3 2 effective precipitation effective precipitation pe refers to the portion of precipitation retained in the root zone that can be exploited by plants hence representing the effective part of the total precipitation li et al 2011 pe is equal to the total precipitation subtracted the runoff evaporation and deep leakage the pe in this study is calculated based on the method recommended by the soil conservation bureau of the united states department of agriculture this method is one of the most recognized and popular methods for calculating pe the calculation formula is as follows 4 p e p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 3 m m d p e 4 17 0 1 p p 8 3 m m d where p e is the effective precipitation m m d p is the total precipitation m m d the total effective precipitation is the product of the accumulated daily effective precipitation and the area of the paddy field the calculation formula is as follows 5 p e n 1 n p e n a where p e is total effective precipitation m 3 n is the number of days for the irrigation period of paddy fields p e n is the cumulative daily effective precipitation m a is the area of the paddy field m 2 3 3 3 water demand crop water demand was characterized by crop evapotranspiration in this paper which depended on the reference crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficient the calculation formula for crop evapotranspiration is as follows 6 e t c k c e t 0 where e t c is the daily water demand of the crop m m d k c is the crop coefficient e t 0 is the reference evapotranspiration m m d among the numerous methods for calculating reference evapotranspiration one of the currently most popular ones is the penman monteith model p m li et al 2011 ren et al 2019 meteorological elements including temperature air pressure precipitation evaporation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours were carried out to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration with p m the main calculation of the p m model is as follows paul et al 2021 7 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e a e d Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation reaching the surface of the crop m j m 2 d g is the soil heat flux m j m 2 d t is the air temperature at 2 m of the crop canopy c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e d is saturated water pressure k p a e a is the actual water pressure k p a Œ¥ is the slope of the relationship between saturated water pressure and temperature k p a c Œ≥ is the wet and dry constant the total water demand of paddy fields refers to the actual amount of agricultural water consumed during the period from the first irrigation to the harvest the calculation formula is as follows 8 w d n 1 n e t c n a where w d is the total water demand of paddy fields m 3 n is the number of days for irrigation period of paddy fields e t c n is the cumulative daily water demand of paddy fields m d 1 a is the area of the paddy field m 2 3 3 4 water shortage water shortage refers to the water that must be supplied to crops after subtracting the total effective precipitation from the total water demand li 2011 ren et al 2019 the calculation formula is as follows 9 w s n 1 n e t c n a n 1 n p e n a where w s is the water shortage of paddy fields m 3 when w s 0 this means that the effective precipitation can meet the irrigation demand of the paddy field and no additional irrigation is needed when w s 0 it means that the effective precipitation cannot meet the irrigation demand of the paddy field and additional irrigation is required 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal fusion results a total of nine sentinel 2 images and twenty four mod09a1 images table a 1 were used by estarfm to generate 16 prediction images finally we obtained a high spatial resolution time series data set consisting of 9 real sentinel 2 images and 16 predicted images in this study the significance level p value and correlation strength r value of pearson correlation analysis regression equation coefficient and r2 were selected to evaluate the fusion accuracy of the estarfm model analyzing the whole image pixel by pixel is time costly and prone to information redundancy therefore 10 000 points were randomly selected by arcgis to evaluate the fusion effect of the bands of red green blue nir swir1 and swir2 fig 3 shows the fitting effect of the six bands of a real sentinel 2 image and prediction image fused by the estarfm in terms of the regression coefficients p value and r value the difference between the predicted and the real value was small with regard to r2 the values of blue fig 3 c green fig 3 d swir1 fig 3 e and swir2 fig 3 f are larger than those of red fig 3 a and nir fig 3 b this suggests that the fusion effects of blue fig 3 c green fig 3 d swir1 fig 3 e and swir2 fig 3 f bands were more ideal than those of red fig 3 a and nir fig 3 b consequently the predicted image retained the information of the bands of the real sentinel 2 image to a large extent and the prediction accuracy was high fig a 1 shows the reflectance of paddy field samples from the high spatial resolution time series images from the variation characteristics of reflectance the spectral responses of the visible bands of red blue and green all showed the trend of two peaks and one valley the peak the maximum reflectance represents the spectral reflectance of the bare soil in paddy fields and the valley the minimum reflectance represents the spectral response of paddy fields with the maximum biomass we found that paddy fields exhibited significant absorption characteristics for the bands of red green and blue with the increase of biomass in paddy fields and the absorption capacity was the strongest around the t15 period august 21st 2019 as the rice matures the biomass in paddy fields gradually decreases and the reflection ability of paddy fields to the visible bands of red blue and green gradually increases in contrast to the visible bands the spectral response characteristics of the band of nir showed a trend of two valleys and one peak indicating that the reflection ability of paddy fields in the nir band gradually increases the reflectance gradually increases with the increase of biomass the reflection ability was the strongest maximum reflectance around the t15 period august 21st 2019 subsequently the reflection ability of paddy fields to the nir band decreased gradually with the decrease in biomass paddy fields also showed slight absorption reflectance decreased of the bands of swir1 and swir2 with the increase in rice biomass fig 4 shows that an opposite trend exists between evi and wi2015 as the wheat matured the evi gradually decreased and reached the minimum value approximately in the t7 period june 18th during this period the wi2015 gradually increased with the occurrence of irrigation in paddy fields and reached the maximum value in the t9 period july 7th then the evi gradually increased and wi2015 gradually decreased around the t14 period august 16th evi reached the maximum and wi2015 reached the minimum with the beginning of the rice booting stage the evi gradually decreased as the biomass was reduced because the surface of the paddy field was completely covered by rice plants at this stage wi2015 mainly reflected the water content of the vegetation canopy 4 2 high resolution map of irrigated paddy fields accurate spatial distribution of paddy fields is the premise of spatiotemporal information research the spatial distribution of paddy fields at the field scale was extracted by the random forest algorithm based on the high spatial resolution time series data generated by the estarfm as shown in fig a 2 the paddy fields in the study area in 2019 were mainly distributed along the yellow river in three rice growing areas site a site b and site c in the east middle and west respectively the spatial distribution of paddy fields based on 10 m resolution was capable to better highlight the field information field roads were clearly visible which was conducive to analyzing the temporal and spatial information dynamics of paddy fields at the field scale table a 2 lists the paddy field areas of this study 12 455 92 hm2 for the entire study area while the site a site b and site c were 6790 43 1602 47 and 3944 06 hm2 respectively the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the classification by the rf algorithm were 97 85 and 0 9737 respectively indicating that the land use types in the study area were well separated the producer s and user s accuracies of paddy field extraction were both 100 indicating that the combination of the rf algorithm and time series high spatial resolution images was conducive to accurately extracting the spatial distribution of paddy fields 4 3 irrigation dynamics in paddy fields 4 3 1 start of irrigation in paddy fields and its spatial distribution we focused on the analysis of the irrigation dynamics in paddy fields in the three rice concentration areas of site a site b and site c fig 5 shows a significant time difference in the starting of irrigation water in each sample area at site a the flooding paddy fields have already existed the proportion of pixels in flooding paddy fields increased by about 6 89 from may 24th to june 2nd during the period from june 27th to july 7th the proportion of pixels of the increased flooding paddy fields was about 70 29 as of july 7th 93 98 of the total paddy fields had been irrigated at site a in terms of spatial distribution the flooding of paddy fields first occurred in the southeast of site a and covered almost the entire sample area from june 27th to july 7th at site b flooding paddy fields have increased significantly since may 24th and irrigation first occurred in the eastern part of the area compared with other periods the increase in the number of flooding paddy fields increased at site b from june 27th to july 7th was the largest the proportional increase of flooding paddy field pixels was about 37 29 on july 7th 84 11 of the total paddy fields had been irrigated at site b at site c the occurrence of flooding paddy fields presented a characteristic trend from north to south from may 24th to june 2nd flooding paddy fields have appeared in the northwestern part at site c during the period from june 27th to july 7th the flooding paddy fields increased by approximately 56 07 as of july 7th 76 76 of the total paddy fields had been irrigated at site c from the comparison of the three sites flooding paddy fields were clearly observed at the three sites from june 2nd the highest increasing proportion of flooding paddy fields in the three sites occurred from june 27th to july 7th the difference among the three sites was that the peak of irrigation at site a was more concentrated than that at site b and site c from june 27th to july 7th the increased proportion of flooding paddy fields at site a was about 70 29 which was significantly higher than the 37 29 observed at site b and 56 07 at site c in comparison with site a and site c the starting dates of irrigation in paddy fields are more scattered at site b in summary the starting date of irrigation in paddy fields occurred mainly from june 27th to july 7th indicating that this period was the concentrated period of rice planting in the study area and also the peak period of irrigation in paddy fields furthermore the spatial differences of the increased flooding paddy fields areas at site a site b and site c indicate significant temporal and spatial differences in the management patterns of paddy fields in the study area which have considerable impact on alleviating the regional water use contradiction and formulating agricultural water management measures 4 3 2 end of irrigation in paddy fields and its spatial distribution as shown in fig 6 from august 6th to 16th the irrigated paddy fields have been prominently presented at site a we argued that the likely ending date of irrigation in paddy fields was august 17th 21st as about 50 78 of the paddy fields ended irrigation during this period as of august 29th approximately 92 97 of paddy fields have ended irrigation in terms of spatial distribution the end of irrigation water in paddy fields in the southeast of site a was earlier than that in the northwest at site b the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred in the two periods from july 29th to august 5th and august 6th to 16th in these two periods there were 26 72 and 26 52 of the paddy field area reached the end of irrigation respectively which marked higher proportions than other periods spatially the paddy fields at site b presented the characteristics of gradually ending irrigation from east to west regarding site c the key period for the end of irrigation ranged from august 6th to 16th and from august 17th to 21th during these two periods 33 82 and 38 78 of the paddy fields ended irrigation respectively spatially the ending date of irrigation in paddy fields in the southwest of site c was earlier than that in the northeast in conclusion the occurrence of the end of irrigation in paddy fields in the study area had significant temporal and spatial differences for site a the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred after august 6th and reached the peak from august 17th to 21st only a small number of irrigation end events occurred after august 29th at site b the ending events of irrigation in paddy fields were mainly concentrated in two periods july 29th to august 5th and august 6th to 16th as far as site c was concerned the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred from august 6th to 16th and august 17th to 21st in spatial distribution the end of irrigation in paddy fields in the southeast of site a was earlier than that in the northwest the irrigation in paddy fields in the east of site b ended earlier than the west and for site c the ending dates of irrigation in paddy fields in the southwest were earlier than that in the northeast 4 3 3 duration of irrigation period of paddy fields and its spatial distribution fig 7a shows that the duration of irrigation period of paddy fields mostly ranged from 40 days to 65 days with an average of about 55 days we used the natural breaking point method provided by arcgis to classify the duration of the irrigation period as shown in fig 7b the irrigation period of paddy fields at site a was mostly 46 65 days whereas at site b and site c it was mostly 31 45 days the results suggested that the duration of the irrigation period of paddy fields in the study area had significant temporal and spatial differences due to the difference between the starting and ending dates of irrigation 4 3 4 balance of water supply and demand in paddy fields during the irrigation period understanding temporal and spatial characteristics of water demand effective precipitation and water shortage are essential for agricultural water irrigation decision making and water resources management in accordance with our previous study the earliest starting date of irrigation in paddy fields occurred from may 18th to may 23rd and the latest ending date of irrigation in paddy fields occurred from september 6th to 14th it was more appropriate to adopt may 23rd instead of may 18th as the earliest starting date of irrigation in paddy fields as the acquisition date of the real sentinel 2 image used in this study was may 23rd therefore only the water demand effective precipitation and water shortage of paddy fields from may 23rd to september 14th were estimated in this study fig 8a shows the daily precipitation monitored by the meteorological stations in the study area and the effective precipitation calculated by eq 4 a total of 30 days of precipitation events occurred from may 23rd to september 14th 2019 among them the daily accumulated precipitation 43 9 mm and effective precipitation 8 56 mm were the largest on august 10th during the irrigation period the accumulated precipitation was 212 1 mm and the daily average accumulated precipitation was 1 84 mm the accumulated effective precipitation is 83 80 mm and the daily average effective precipitation is 0 73 mm according to eq 5 the total effective precipitation in the study area in 2019 was 600 1556 104m¬≥ fig 8d the total daily water demand of the paddy fields during the irrigation period fig 8b indicated that the daily water consumption of paddy fields was relatively large from july 4th to august 21st the date of maximum daily water consumption was july 7th and the maximum water consumption was about 808 310 16 m¬≥ which was approximately three times the average 271 665 71 m¬≥ the daily accumulated water demand of the paddy fields fig 8c began to increase rapidly after july 2nd and hardly increased since august 21st in 2019 the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area was 3124 16 104m¬≥ fig 8d and the total daily average water demand was 1470 54 104m¬≥ the total water shortage of paddy fields in the study area was 2524 0001 104m¬≥ fig 8d in 2019 accounting for 80 79 of the total water demand fig 8d therefore the natural precipitation gap required for irrigation in the paddy fields in the study area was relatively large and a large amount of artificial water supply was needed for managers it is helpful to allocate and manage water resources in different areas by knowing where paddy fields with large water demand or large water shortage are located because the water shortage in the study area accounts for a high proportion of the water demand we inferred that the water shortage had a spatial distribution similar to it therefore only the spatial distribution of water demand in paddy fields was analyzed in this study using jenks natural breaking point method provided by arcgis the total water demand of paddy fields was categorized into four levels namely the low value area sub low value area sub high value area and high value area as shown in fig 9a the high value areas of total water demand presented agglomeration at site a and site c of which the high value areas at site a were mainly distributed in the south and northwest and the high value areas at site c were mainly distributed in the south regarding site b the total water demand of paddy fields took place mainly in low value areas in addition a hot spot analysis was employed to further explore the spatial agglomeration level of high and low values of the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area fig 9b for site a the hotspots were mainly distributed in the west and showed significant clustering at the 99 confidence level the hotspots of site c which were clustered in the southeast showed significant clustering at the 99 confidence level there was no hotspot at site b in terms of the cold spots there were significant cold spots at site b and site c at 90 and 95 confidence levels the cold spots at site b were clustered in the north while those at site c were clustered in the northwest on the whole the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area exhibited significant spatial agglomeration during the irrigation period 5 discussion 5 1 policy effect of spatiotemporal variations of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields currently the flooding signal of the paddy fields is widely used in remote sensing monitoring of rice distribution yield and phenology however research on the dynamic monitoring of irrigation in paddy fields using the flooding signal is rarely involved as traditional manual transplanting is gradually replaced by mechanical planting and direct seeded rice the hydrologic period of paddy fields such as the starting date and ending date of irrigation the duration of irrigation period etc is bound to change these changes may further lead to conflicts in water use among crops and affect the allocation and management of regional water resources ranghetti et al 2016 in this study we aimed to synergize the high spatial and temporal resolution advantages of sentinel 2 and modis to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields at the field scale hence this study is of great significance to the decision making of crop irrigation related studies have been carried out in several countries in the ebro delta of spain flooding paddy fields are the main habitat for birds to protect the farmland ecosystem the local government put forward the agri environmental measures to encourage farmers to maintain the surface of the paddy fields flooded to knowing where and when the flooding events of paddy fields were carried out mor√© et al 2011 monitored the flooding status of paddy fields in this region the flooding started earlier in the paddy fields close to the internal lagoons meanwhile some paddy fields dried up prematurely due to the problems in the irrigation technology these results provided a reference for the government to verify the actual situation of flooding paddy fields in the rice growing areas of northern italy the area of flooding paddy fields has been reduced due to changes in the farmers management of paddy fields which has affected the water management of reservoirs and the aquatic community dependent on flooding paddy fields ranghetti et al 2016 proposed a method to monitor and quantify the spatiotemporal variability of agronomic flooding in paddy fields using remote sensing data they found that the paddy fields in the northwest were the first to be flooded in mid to late april and the agronomic flooding spread to the southeast in may meanwhile in the eastern portion there were only a few flooding paddy fields during the entire growing season however most of the flooding signals were masked by vegetation since late june on this basis ranghetti et al 2018 assessed the dynamic changes of irrigation in paddy fields in northern italy from 2000 to 2016 the results indicated that the flooding paddy fields in northern italy have gradually turned to dry rice and the intensity of seasonal flood decreased with a delay in the starting date of flooding during the last 17 years these results are of great significance to reflect the changes of rice planting patterns and explain the reasons for the decrease of waterbirds in this region in summary these studies above showed that the monitoring of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at regional scales is essential for identifying the possible problems with water supply and alleviating water conflicts however these results are meaningful for guiding the irrigation decision making of paddy fields at a large scale but not suitable for the irrigation management in areas with scattered farmland and complex planting structures because there are significant temporal and spatial differences in irrigation management in paddy fields due to the diversity of rice planting patterns in this study the temporal advantage of modis synthetic products 8 days and the spatial advantage of sentinel 2 data 10 m were combined to generate time series remote sensing data with a high spatial resolution 10 m so as to improve the accuracy of the information extraction of paddy fields distribution and irrigation at the field scale in our tests the overall classification accuracy was 97 85 the kappa coefficient was 0 9737 and the producer s and user s accuracies of paddy fields were almost 100 in terms of classification accuracy therefore our studies carried out in china using the spatiotemporal fusion of sentinel 2 and modis images performed better in paddy fields extraction compared with those studies using modis images in other countries mor√© et al 2011 ranghetti et al 2016 2018 this makes the research in this paper have broad application prospects in small scale paddy fields or those with a high degree of fragmentation several interesting findings can be deduced from our results the peak of irrigation in paddy fields occurred from june 27th to july 7th during which the irrigation consumption was relatively large the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred approximately before august 21st there were significant temporal and spatial differences in irrigation management at the three rice concentration areas of site a site b and site c during the field survey we interviewed local rice growing farmers on their behavior of irrigation in paddy fields by means of questionnaire surveys among the 96 valid questionnaires obtained approximately 63 54 of the farmers interviewed reported that the starting dates of the first irrigation in paddy fields were conducted mainly in the period from june 27th to july 7th meanwhile about 15 63 of the interviewed farmers indicated that the first irrigation of the paddy fields occurred from may 18th to june 15th according to the farmers interviewed all transplanted paddy fields must be irrigated before planting rice to facilitate transplanting seedlings however the yield of crops is easily affected by topography part of the farmland in the study area is distributed in low lying areas due to the low terrain it is not suitable for growing wheat and only one season of rice is grown here therefore rice was planted earlier in this type of paddy field and transplanting began around mid to late may most of the farmland in this study area is located in wheat rice double cropped areas paddy rice winter wheat rice is transplanted around mid to late june and harvested in mid october in addition there is a pattern of rice fishing in wheat rice double cropped areas paddy fields in this pattern must consume a significant amount of water because fish crayfish and crabs need to survive in the water environment during the growth of rice thus the analysis of the irrigation dynamics in paddy fields was coherent with field surveyed data and with knowledge about paddy fields practices based on these interesting findings we put forward some measures for agricultural water resources first our study realized the monitoring of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at field scales hence we argued that a spatiotemporal database of agricultural irrigation information based on real time monitoring using high resolution remote sensing data must be constructed relying on the big data management and control platform it is possible to timely and accurately obtain water dispatch information such as the irrigation area of paddy fields water supply plan indicators and daily water supply these measures can strengthen the information exchange of agricultural water demand water distribution and water use and promote high quality development of water resources utilization in the irrigation areas along the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river furthermore the significant temporal and spatial divergence of irrigation dynamics of paddy fields illustrated the diversity of farmers irrigation management behavior these differences restrict the level of regional water resources management which easily leads to water conflicts with other irrigated crops therefore it is necessary to clarify the water management strategy of water saving priority and spatial balance to this end diversified water resources regulation measures must be adopted to effectively meet the irrigation demand of paddy fields in time and space finally due to the significant water shortage and spatial differences efforts must be made to develop agricultural water saving irrigation technology improve the irrigation efficiency of paddy fields build a sustainable water saving irrigation technology support system and promote the transformation of irrigation from extensive to intensive 5 2 uncertainty analysis when the bare soil is flooded the water index wi2015 is bound to suddenly increase due to the sharply enhanced water signal which can be used as a sign of the start of the first irrigation in paddy fields however rainfall may also cause a sudden increase in the wi2015 of paddy fields leading to the pseudo maximum of the water body index at certain times thus affecting the judgment result based on the maximum value of the wi2015 according to the results provided in section 4 3 1 the peak period of irrigation in paddy fields was from mid june to late july such that the daily monitoring data of meteorological stations during this period was collected to analyze the impact of rainfall as shown in fig a 3 from june 1st to august 1st 2019 the dates of rainfall events in the study area were june 3rd 4th 5th 6th 20th 23rd 27th 28th july 9th 10th 17th 26th 27th 28th and 30th therefore the water index wi2015 may be affected by rainfall during the irrigation period on the one hand a monitoring scheme based on fields must be established in the future to record the real situation of irrigation in paddy fields so as to verify the deviation of the research results on the other hand image data with higher time frequency such as daily must be used to monitor the occurrence of irrigation in paddy fields when calculating the water demand of paddy fields the crop coefficient kc is easily affected by the climate and environment yang et al 2011 hence it is necessary to correct the crop coefficient recommended by fao according to regional differences bergson et al 2012 sien et al 2008 tyagi et al 2000 according to fao 56 the crop coefficient of paddy fields must be between 1 10 and 1 19 in semi arid and arid areas the present literature recorded the crop coefficients of rice in different growth periods around the study area the kc of rice in the initial growth period rapid growth period mid growth period and mature period were 1 00 1 00 1 15 1 15 and 1 15 0 57 respectively duan et al 2004 the research period of this study mainly included the initial growth period and rapid growth period of paddy fields referring to a previous study han et al 2013 we took the average of the maximum and minimum kc of the initial growth period and the rapid growth period as the crop coefficient after calculation the kc of the water demand of paddy fields in the study area must be 1 15 in the future field monitoring must be carried out to determine the actual kc of evapotranspiration from paddy fields in the study area at different growth stages 6 conclusions currently the shortage of water resources in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china has caused an imbalance between the supply and demand of irrigation in paddy fields leading to a large reduction of the rice planting area therefore studying the spatiotemporal characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields in typical sample areas is essential for water resources management decisions and alleviating regional water use conflicts in this study we mapped the spatial distribution of paddy fields in the main planting areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china on 10 m spatial scale using time series remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms the high resolution paddy fields map provides a basis for monitoring the irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at the field scale finally policy suggestions for agricultural water resources management in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china were presented the results are as follows 1 the estarfm algorithm realized the spatiotemporal fusion of the bands of red green blue nir swir1 and swir2 of sentinel 2 and modis this is helpful to make up for the lack of temporal or spatial resolution of remote sensing images from a single data source and can provide high spatial resolution time series data for the research of spatio temporal information of paddy fields the predicted reflectance of the six bands had a strong fitting effect with the real reflectance of sentinel 2 and the spectral and texture information of the real sentinel 2 images was largely retained in the predicted image the combination of predicted data and real data can shorten the time interval between two adjacent images to three days 2 applying the rf algorithm to time series data with a resolution of 10 m is conducive to the separation of land features at field scales especially to distinguish between the paddy fields and non paddy fields the overall classification accuracy in this study was 97 85 the kappa coefficient was 0 9737 and the producer s and user s accuracies of paddy fields were both 100 meanwhile the farmland roads in the classification results were clearly visible which could better highlight the field information 3 the starting date ending date duration of irrigation period and their spatial distribution information of irrigation in paddy fields were extracted based on the maximum values of wi2015 and evi which truly reflected the temporal and spatial characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields of the study area this information exhibited significant temporal and spatial differences which reflected the different management patterns of paddy field managers 4 during the irrigation period the total water shortage of the paddy fields in the study area accounted for 80 79 of the total water demand which indicated that the natural precipitation gap required for irrigation in paddy fields in the study area was relatively large and a large amount of artificial water supply from the yellow river and groundwater was needed furthermore the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area has a certain spatial agglomeration forming spatial hot spots and cold spots 5 a spatiotemporal database of agricultural irrigation information based on real time monitoring using high resolution remote sensing data must be constructed to strengthen the information exchange of agricultural water demand water distribution and water use meanwhile diversified water management measures and agricultural water saving irrigation technologies should be introduced to effectively meet the irrigation demand of paddy fields in time and space this study is of great significance for monitoring the dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields at field scales based on the results obtained herein the spatiotemporal fusion of sentinel 2 and modis should be used to analyze the inter annual differences in irrigation dynamics of paddy fields in the future so as to provide scientific theoretical basis and data support to alleviate the water use conflict between

9644,rapid and accurate monitoring of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields the start end duration and irrigation peak etc at field scales is crucial to the fine management of agricultural water resources especially in typical areas with water shortages however there is still a lack of sufficient research to depict irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at high temporal and spatial levels to this end this study fused sentinel 2 and modis images to map the spatio temporal dynamics of irrigation events in paddy fields a popular spatiotemporal fusion algorithm enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm was used to generate 25 high spatial resolution 10 m remote sensing images based on 9 sentinel 2 images and 24 modis images random forest algorithm was used to extract the spatial distribution of irrigated paddy fields water body index and vegetation index were employed to identify the start end and duration of irrigation in paddy fields penman monteith model was used to estimate water surplus and deficit of irrigation during the critical irrigation period with daily observation data from meteorological stations this study was carried out in rice growing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china the results indicated that the spatial distribution difference of irrigation events in paddy fields with the shortest 3 day interval could be monitored in collaboration with sentinel 2 and modis images the start end and duration of irrigation in paddy fields presented significant spatial differences at field scales a large amount of water from groundwater and yellow river was needed because the total water shortage of irrigation in paddy fields in the study area was about 80 79 of the total water demand in addition paddy fields with higher water demand were more concentrated spatially as were paddy fields with lower water demand the feasibility of spatiotemporal fusion of multi source remote sensing data makes it possible to continuously monitor irrigation dynamics in paddy fields on high spatial resolution scales which is conducive to the construction of spatiotemporal database and big data platform of agricultural irrigation information this would not only help in promoting the high quality development of agricultural water resources management but also alleviating the contradiction of regional water resources graphical abstract ga1 keywords sentinel 2 spatiotemporal fusion paddy fields water dynamics yellow river basin 1 introduction eighty six percent of the world s rice grows in flooding paddy fields which require 25 33 of the world s developed freshwater resources ranghetti et al 2016 the high water demand for irrigation in paddy fields has brought attention to the management of agricultural water resources zhang and zeng 2015 g zhang et al 2015 in recent years freshwater resources for irrigation have become increasingly scarce due to population growth rapid economic development environmental pollution and resource depletion the traditional rice planting mode requires continuous irrigation to ensure that the paddy fields flooded during the rice growing period to effectively save freshwater resources the continuous irrigation is gradually changing to the discontinuous irrigation for the discontinuous irrigation mode the flooding status of the paddy field changes dynamically during the rice growing period however the discontinuous irrigation mode easily causes a loss of about 10 30 in the rice yield cesari de maria et al 2016 meanwhile changes in irrigation patterns of paddy fields may also cause freshwater resources to shift from the land surface and conflicts in water use by multiple crops ultimately these changes will affect the allocation of regional water resources and the balance of surface water teluguntla et al 2015 flooding paddy fields are often regarded as an important aquatic ecosystem with constructed wetland function as they contain a large number of terrestrial and aquatic organisms elphick et al 2010 tornos et al 2015 the dynamic change of irrigation in paddy fields will lead to the change in the ecological environment system in paddy fields niel and mcvicar 2004 for example with the popularization of direct seeding rice technology changes in the starting and ending date of irrigation in paddy fields can easily reduce the available habitat area for birds during nesting which will affect the birds reproduction and survival ranghetti et al 2016 paddy fields are also among the main sources of greenhouse gases such as methane and n2o and the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields significantly affects the emission of greenhouse gases denier 2000 ranghetti et al 2016 tornos et al 2015 wassmann et al 2000 for instance the greenhouse effect of discontinuous irrigation in paddy fields mainly emitting n2o is 30 45 times that of continuous flooding paddy fields mainly emitting methane kritee et al 2018 therefore monitoring the key temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields can better quantify the impact of the rice ecosystem on regional water resources management policies and sustainable development of the regional ecological environment irrigation events in paddy fields have significant seasonality the flooding signal after irrigation was first used to monitor the hydrological changes in the paddy field in the early stage of transplanting xiao et al 2002 believed that the significant increase of surface water before and after irrigation was sensitive to capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of hydrology in paddy fields during the transformation from non rice agriculture such as winter wheat to rice agriculture zheng 2008 argued that the flooding signal of paddy fields was capable to identify paddy fields and non paddy fields in the soaking and transplanting periods thereby providing useful information for estimating rice yield and distribution xiao et al 2006 identified the initial time and spatial distribution of irrigation in paddy fields and rice transplanting according to the abnormal increase of surface water and established a rice agricultural management database for 13 countries in south and southeast asia which was very useful for farmland irrigation food security and greenhouse gas emission estimation in these countries in recent years the diffusion from flooding paddy fields to upland rice in the major rice growing areas in italy has led to serious interference to the paddy field ecosystem on which some waterbird species depend ranghetti et al 2016 2018 analyzed the spatio temporal characteristics of irrigation management in italy providing an important basis for agricultural ecology research to promote farmers practices that favour the conservation of farmland ecosystems mor√© et al 2011 monitored and quantified the spatiotemporal variability of irrigation in paddy fields in the ebro delta of spain providing decision makers with a tool for monitoring farmers behavior these studies are of great significance for formulating effective public policies related to agricultural water management and paddy field ecosystem protection due to the differences of farmers behavior in flooding and rice transplanting the starting date ending date and duration of irrigation periods have significant spatial heterogeneity at different spatial scales xiao et al 2002 especially in areas with scattered farmland and complex planting structures xiao 2006 zheng 2008 it is inconvenient to carry out large scale monitoring in the direct investigation of the management of irrigation in paddy fields as a large number of samples are required remote sensing technology has proved to be an ideal tool for monitoring the flooding dynamics of irrigation status of paddy fields mor√© et al 2011 most detections on surface water bodies usually use medium resolution optical images such as landsat and modis images landsat data with a spatial resolution of 30 m zhou et al 2016 is very useful for mapping small water bodies or water bodies that change periodically such as rivers coastlines or lakes chormanski et al 2011 du et al 2012 feyisa et al 2014 hassani et al 2015 ouma and tateishi 2006 rokni et al 2014 tulbure et al 2013 while modis data with a 1 day temporal resolution has been widely used in monitoring the temporal and spatial changes of surface water bodies at regional or global scales boschetti et al 2014 ranghetti et al 2016 2018 however the temporal resolution of approximately 16 days provided by landsat limits the data further in terms of detecting ephemeral surface water bodies such as natural disaster flooding or agricultural irrigation and the coarse resolution 250 500 or 1000 m provides the application of modis in small areas with large errors therefore considering the limitation of spatial or temporal resolution it is difficult to monitor the agricultural irrigation dynamic at different spatial and temporal scales using a single remote sensing data source spatiotemporal fusion is a method for integrating the advantages of multi source remote sensing images to generate a joint dataset with high spatiotemporal resolution which can effectively make up for the lack of temporal or spatial resolution of a single data source the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 and enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm zhu et al 2010 are the most commonly used algorithms for realizing the spatiotemporal fusion of modis and landsat zhang and zeng 2015 g zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 previous studies demonstrated that the estarfm model was better than the starfm model in the overall prediction accuracy of time series data on complex heterogeneous regions shi et al 2015 wu et al 2014 to date studies mainly focused on the spatiotemporal fusion of modis and landsat images zhu et al 2018 the sentinel 2 satellite launched by the european space agency in 2016 is capable of providing multispectral images with a temporal resolution of five days and a spatial resolution of 10 m huang et al 2018 which significantly improves the detection performance of small surface water bodies chen et al 2020 however sentinel 2 has not been widely used in monitoring dynamic changes in agricultural irrigation ranghetti et al 2018 therefore this study aimed to combine sentinel 2 and modis data by the estarfm to analyze the spatio temporal dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields on a fine spatial scale with a resolution of 10 m in china the yellow river basin is not only an important agricultural production area but also an area with shortage of water resources zhang et al 2021 in 2019 president xi jinping proposed promote the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin then the chinese government upgraded the comprehensive management of the yellow river basin to a national strategy xiao et al 2020 the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river are located in the floods drought ecotone with a long history of wheat rice double crop in recent years most of the crops in the region have switched from rice to corn affected by the shortage of water resources which has caused the instability of the paddy field ecosystem in addition the water demand for irrigation has increased caused by the vigorous promotion of ecological agriculture models in this region such as rice fishing co cultivation of rice with fish shrimp crabs etc and rice planting cooperatives therefore studying the temporal and spatial dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river is of great significance for crop irrigation decision making and water resource management planning currently previous literature still lack extensive study by using high resolution remote sensing data to provide policy basis for promoting the high quality development of water resources utilization and alleviating regional water use conflicts we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields at the field scale using sentinel 2 and modis images this study was carried out in rice growing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china the main objectives are as follows 1 mapping the distribution of irrigated paddy fields on 10 m spatial scale using random forest algorithm 2 monitoring the dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields the start end and duration of irrigation period at field scales using water body index and vegetation index 3 analyzing the relationship between water demand water shortages and effective precipitation during the irrigation period 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in the irrigation area along the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china fig 1a this area was formed by alluvial deposits of the yellow river with a flat terrain and an altitude of about 50 100 m the climate is continental monsoon and the average annual rainfall ranges from 560 to 680 mm this area is a concentrated production base of high quality rice with a long history of wheat rice double crop at the present agricultural irrigation accounts for about 90 of the water diverted from the yellow river yang 2013 however the spatial and temporal differences of annual precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river vary significantly and the efficiency of water conservation and its intensive use is low this causes an imbalance between the supply and demand of irrigation for paddy fields in the irrigation areas along the yellow river leading to a dramatic decrease in the paddy field area in this study the rice planting areas where the paddy fields are mainly distributed on site a site b and site c were selected as the study area fig 1a direct seeding rice sowing rice seeds directly into the rice field eliminates the processes of seedling raising transplanting and planting of transplanting rice which saves considerable time and labor input costs with the transfer of the rural labor population to cities and the development of agricultural machinery and water saving technologies the rice planting pattern in the study area has gradually changed from the traditional artificial transplanted rice fig 1e to machine seeded rice fig 1f and direct seeded rice fig 1g to a certain extent the transformation of rice planting patterns has affected the management of agricultural irrigation according to the field survey the rice in the study area was planted as early as the end of may 2019 the period of rice planting was concentrated between the end of june to the beginning of july and the planting was basically completed in mid to late july we conducted field sampling in the study area from july 24th to july 25th 2019 and july 4th 2020 there are various types of paddy fields in the study area such as rice fishing co cultivation of rice with fish shrimp crabs etc rice planting bases and individual planting among them the paddy fields with the rice fishing pattern generally require a large amount of water in rice planting bases the rice seeds are usually excellent the degree of mechanization is high the management level is scientific and the paddy fields are concentrated and contiguous in the individual planting mode the rice varieties selected by farmers are not unified the growth cycle of rice is different the flooded paddy fields and upland rice are mixed the degree of mechanization is low and the rice planting is mostly artificial fig 1h i j k and l show the paddy fields at different growth stages and irrigation states indicating that there is a diversity of rice planting patterns in the study area and there were time differences in irrigation and transplanting of rice fig 1m and n show the two irrigation methods of groundwater irrigation and irrigation from the yellow river in the study area 2 2 data the data used in this paper included remote sensing data field data and meteorological data we collected relevant data from may to november because rice planting and harvest in the study area occurred during this period 2 2 1 remote sensing data a total 24 images of modis and 9 images of sentinel 2 table a 1 were used for the spatiotemporal fusion for modis 8 day composite reflectance products mod09a1 at 500 m resolution were used in this study which were acquired from https search earthdata nasa gov seven bands that have undergone atmospheric correction processing were included in mod09a1 sentinel 2 image is an advanced remote sensing data with 13 bands and a spatial resolution of 10 60 m which can be downloaded from https scihub copernicus eu among these 13 bands the resolution of the short wave infrared band is 20 m which needs to be resampled to 10 m first in addition the red green blue and near infrared bands with a resolution of 10 m are also considered in this study 2 2 2 field data field data with random sampling sorted divided into two types ground collection and google earth collection field data was collected on july 24 25 2019 and july 4 2020 the samples collected included rice samples and non rice samples construction land dry land waters beach land and bare land total 35 438 pixels were obtained through google earth and ground collection as training samples for classification total 4052 pixels were selected as test samples for accuracy verification after classification 2 2 3 meteorological data the meteorological data was adopted from the daily observation data of china s national meteorological observation stations http www resdc cn which was used to calculate the water demand of paddy fields the following seven meteorological data were employed in this paper atmospheric pressure temperature precipitation evaporation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours 3 methods the work flow of the methods in this paper mainly included three steps spatiotemporal fusion feature set construction and irrigation water dynamics monitoring in paddy fields fig 2 the estarfm random forest algorithm spectral index methods and irrigation model were conducted using arcgis10 7 idl8 5 and r version 4 0 2 the core methods were described as follows 3 1 estarfm the present evidence indicates that the fusion effect of the estarfm model was generally better than that of the starfm model on the whole shi et al 2015 wu et al 2014 hence estarfm was used for the spatiotemporal fusion of sentinel 2 and modis in this study the estarfm model improves the performance of spatiotemporal resolution reconstruction of multi source data in the heterogeneous surface environment zhu et al 2010 a more detailed description of the principle and usage of estarfm is provided by zhu et al 2010 for heterogeneous environments the core mathematical relationship of the estarfm can be expressed as 1 f x œâ 2 y œâ 2 t 2 b f x œâ 2 y œâ 2 t 1 b i 1 n w i v i c x i y i t 2 b c x i y i t 1 b where f and c represent the pixel value of a pixel in the high low spatial resolution image respectively x i and y i represent the coordinates of a pixel b represents the band name t k represents acquisition date of the image n is the number of pixels in the sliding window œâ is the size of the sliding window w i is the utilization weight of the similar pixel v i is the conversion factor for the decomposition of mixed pixels 3 2 random forest owing to its high operating efficiency strong fitting ability and high dimensional data capacity random forest rf has become one of the most popular machine learning algorithms li 2013 wang et al 2020 the main parameters of the rf include out of bag data oob the expected number of classification trees ntree and the number of features extracted when nodes are used to split mtry oob is an important parameter used to evaluate classification errors and perform feature optimization while ntree and mtry have a greater impact on the accuracy of the classification results wang et al 2020 all these parameters can automatically obtain the optimal value using the r software with packages randomforest and tunerf based on the construction of the optimal parameter of rf the r package predict can realize the classification of different features finally the extraction model of paddy fields based on the rf was completed in the r software environment 3 3 dynamic identification of irrigation in paddy fields 3 3 1 the start end and duration of irrigation period of paddy fields usually paddy fields must be irrigated in advance soaked fields to meet the large water demand of transplanted seedlings at this moment the water index in the paddy fields suddenly increases to the maximum value during the rice growing period when the seedlings are transplanted into the paddy fields the mixing of the seedlings and the water is the main characteristic of the paddy fields thereafter the value of the water body index decreases due to the infiltration and evaporation of surface water bodies in this study the occurrence of the first irrigation event in paddy fields is considered to be the starting of irrigation in paddy fields which is usually regarded as a sign of the rice planting start fisher et al 2016 created a water index wi2015 based on the bands of visible light nir and swir using linear discriminant analysis methods which achieved good results in surface water detection in this study the date corresponding to the maximum value of wi2015 was regarded as the start date of irrigation in paddy fields wi2015 is a combination of the bands of blue green red nir and swir2 and its calculation formula is as follows fisher et al 2016 2 w i 2015 1 7204 171 œÅ b l u e 3 œÅ g r e e n 70 œÅ re d 45 œÅ n i r 71 œÅ s w i r 2 where œÅ b l u e is the reflectance of blue band œÅ g r e e n is the reflectance of green band œÅ re d is the reflectance of red band œÅ n i r is the reflectance of nir band œÅ s w i r 2 is the reflectance of swir2 band at the heading stage the vegetative growth of rice reaches its peak and then the rice enters a stage dominated by reproductive growth rice demands less water at this stage and only discontinuous irrigation is required by paddy fields to keep the soil moist because the plants covered the entire paddy field during this stage the surface water of the paddy field can hardly be captured by remote sensing images therefore we assumed that the rice heading date is the ending date at which irrigation in paddy fields can be identified by remote sensing notably the end of the irrigation identification here does not imply that paddy fields no longer need to be irrigated generally the maximum value of evi can be used as an effective indicator of the rice heading stage xu et al 2012 in our study the date corresponding to the maximum value of evi was regarded as the rice heading stage which was the ending date of irrigation in paddy fields evi is a combination of the bands of blue red and nir and its calculation formula is as follows son et al 2014 3 e v i 2 5 œÅ n i r œÅ r e d œÅ n i r 6 0 œÅ r e d 7 5 œÅ b l u e 1 where œÅ b l u e is the reflectance of the blue band œÅ r e d is the reflectance of the red band œÅ n i r is the reflectance of the nir band we defined the period from the start to the end date of irrigation in paddy fields as the duration of the irrigation period during this period shallow water will continue to exist on the surface of paddy fields and can be effectively captured by remote sensing this period mainly includes the soaking transplanting tillering and booting stages 3 3 2 effective precipitation effective precipitation pe refers to the portion of precipitation retained in the root zone that can be exploited by plants hence representing the effective part of the total precipitation li et al 2011 pe is equal to the total precipitation subtracted the runoff evaporation and deep leakage the pe in this study is calculated based on the method recommended by the soil conservation bureau of the united states department of agriculture this method is one of the most recognized and popular methods for calculating pe the calculation formula is as follows 4 p e p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 3 m m d p e 4 17 0 1 p p 8 3 m m d where p e is the effective precipitation m m d p is the total precipitation m m d the total effective precipitation is the product of the accumulated daily effective precipitation and the area of the paddy field the calculation formula is as follows 5 p e n 1 n p e n a where p e is total effective precipitation m 3 n is the number of days for the irrigation period of paddy fields p e n is the cumulative daily effective precipitation m a is the area of the paddy field m 2 3 3 3 water demand crop water demand was characterized by crop evapotranspiration in this paper which depended on the reference crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficient the calculation formula for crop evapotranspiration is as follows 6 e t c k c e t 0 where e t c is the daily water demand of the crop m m d k c is the crop coefficient e t 0 is the reference evapotranspiration m m d among the numerous methods for calculating reference evapotranspiration one of the currently most popular ones is the penman monteith model p m li et al 2011 ren et al 2019 meteorological elements including temperature air pressure precipitation evaporation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours were carried out to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration with p m the main calculation of the p m model is as follows paul et al 2021 7 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e a e d Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation reaching the surface of the crop m j m 2 d g is the soil heat flux m j m 2 d t is the air temperature at 2 m of the crop canopy c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e d is saturated water pressure k p a e a is the actual water pressure k p a Œ¥ is the slope of the relationship between saturated water pressure and temperature k p a c Œ≥ is the wet and dry constant the total water demand of paddy fields refers to the actual amount of agricultural water consumed during the period from the first irrigation to the harvest the calculation formula is as follows 8 w d n 1 n e t c n a where w d is the total water demand of paddy fields m 3 n is the number of days for irrigation period of paddy fields e t c n is the cumulative daily water demand of paddy fields m d 1 a is the area of the paddy field m 2 3 3 4 water shortage water shortage refers to the water that must be supplied to crops after subtracting the total effective precipitation from the total water demand li 2011 ren et al 2019 the calculation formula is as follows 9 w s n 1 n e t c n a n 1 n p e n a where w s is the water shortage of paddy fields m 3 when w s 0 this means that the effective precipitation can meet the irrigation demand of the paddy field and no additional irrigation is needed when w s 0 it means that the effective precipitation cannot meet the irrigation demand of the paddy field and additional irrigation is required 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal fusion results a total of nine sentinel 2 images and twenty four mod09a1 images table a 1 were used by estarfm to generate 16 prediction images finally we obtained a high spatial resolution time series data set consisting of 9 real sentinel 2 images and 16 predicted images in this study the significance level p value and correlation strength r value of pearson correlation analysis regression equation coefficient and r2 were selected to evaluate the fusion accuracy of the estarfm model analyzing the whole image pixel by pixel is time costly and prone to information redundancy therefore 10 000 points were randomly selected by arcgis to evaluate the fusion effect of the bands of red green blue nir swir1 and swir2 fig 3 shows the fitting effect of the six bands of a real sentinel 2 image and prediction image fused by the estarfm in terms of the regression coefficients p value and r value the difference between the predicted and the real value was small with regard to r2 the values of blue fig 3 c green fig 3 d swir1 fig 3 e and swir2 fig 3 f are larger than those of red fig 3 a and nir fig 3 b this suggests that the fusion effects of blue fig 3 c green fig 3 d swir1 fig 3 e and swir2 fig 3 f bands were more ideal than those of red fig 3 a and nir fig 3 b consequently the predicted image retained the information of the bands of the real sentinel 2 image to a large extent and the prediction accuracy was high fig a 1 shows the reflectance of paddy field samples from the high spatial resolution time series images from the variation characteristics of reflectance the spectral responses of the visible bands of red blue and green all showed the trend of two peaks and one valley the peak the maximum reflectance represents the spectral reflectance of the bare soil in paddy fields and the valley the minimum reflectance represents the spectral response of paddy fields with the maximum biomass we found that paddy fields exhibited significant absorption characteristics for the bands of red green and blue with the increase of biomass in paddy fields and the absorption capacity was the strongest around the t15 period august 21st 2019 as the rice matures the biomass in paddy fields gradually decreases and the reflection ability of paddy fields to the visible bands of red blue and green gradually increases in contrast to the visible bands the spectral response characteristics of the band of nir showed a trend of two valleys and one peak indicating that the reflection ability of paddy fields in the nir band gradually increases the reflectance gradually increases with the increase of biomass the reflection ability was the strongest maximum reflectance around the t15 period august 21st 2019 subsequently the reflection ability of paddy fields to the nir band decreased gradually with the decrease in biomass paddy fields also showed slight absorption reflectance decreased of the bands of swir1 and swir2 with the increase in rice biomass fig 4 shows that an opposite trend exists between evi and wi2015 as the wheat matured the evi gradually decreased and reached the minimum value approximately in the t7 period june 18th during this period the wi2015 gradually increased with the occurrence of irrigation in paddy fields and reached the maximum value in the t9 period july 7th then the evi gradually increased and wi2015 gradually decreased around the t14 period august 16th evi reached the maximum and wi2015 reached the minimum with the beginning of the rice booting stage the evi gradually decreased as the biomass was reduced because the surface of the paddy field was completely covered by rice plants at this stage wi2015 mainly reflected the water content of the vegetation canopy 4 2 high resolution map of irrigated paddy fields accurate spatial distribution of paddy fields is the premise of spatiotemporal information research the spatial distribution of paddy fields at the field scale was extracted by the random forest algorithm based on the high spatial resolution time series data generated by the estarfm as shown in fig a 2 the paddy fields in the study area in 2019 were mainly distributed along the yellow river in three rice growing areas site a site b and site c in the east middle and west respectively the spatial distribution of paddy fields based on 10 m resolution was capable to better highlight the field information field roads were clearly visible which was conducive to analyzing the temporal and spatial information dynamics of paddy fields at the field scale table a 2 lists the paddy field areas of this study 12 455 92 hm2 for the entire study area while the site a site b and site c were 6790 43 1602 47 and 3944 06 hm2 respectively the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the classification by the rf algorithm were 97 85 and 0 9737 respectively indicating that the land use types in the study area were well separated the producer s and user s accuracies of paddy field extraction were both 100 indicating that the combination of the rf algorithm and time series high spatial resolution images was conducive to accurately extracting the spatial distribution of paddy fields 4 3 irrigation dynamics in paddy fields 4 3 1 start of irrigation in paddy fields and its spatial distribution we focused on the analysis of the irrigation dynamics in paddy fields in the three rice concentration areas of site a site b and site c fig 5 shows a significant time difference in the starting of irrigation water in each sample area at site a the flooding paddy fields have already existed the proportion of pixels in flooding paddy fields increased by about 6 89 from may 24th to june 2nd during the period from june 27th to july 7th the proportion of pixels of the increased flooding paddy fields was about 70 29 as of july 7th 93 98 of the total paddy fields had been irrigated at site a in terms of spatial distribution the flooding of paddy fields first occurred in the southeast of site a and covered almost the entire sample area from june 27th to july 7th at site b flooding paddy fields have increased significantly since may 24th and irrigation first occurred in the eastern part of the area compared with other periods the increase in the number of flooding paddy fields increased at site b from june 27th to july 7th was the largest the proportional increase of flooding paddy field pixels was about 37 29 on july 7th 84 11 of the total paddy fields had been irrigated at site b at site c the occurrence of flooding paddy fields presented a characteristic trend from north to south from may 24th to june 2nd flooding paddy fields have appeared in the northwestern part at site c during the period from june 27th to july 7th the flooding paddy fields increased by approximately 56 07 as of july 7th 76 76 of the total paddy fields had been irrigated at site c from the comparison of the three sites flooding paddy fields were clearly observed at the three sites from june 2nd the highest increasing proportion of flooding paddy fields in the three sites occurred from june 27th to july 7th the difference among the three sites was that the peak of irrigation at site a was more concentrated than that at site b and site c from june 27th to july 7th the increased proportion of flooding paddy fields at site a was about 70 29 which was significantly higher than the 37 29 observed at site b and 56 07 at site c in comparison with site a and site c the starting dates of irrigation in paddy fields are more scattered at site b in summary the starting date of irrigation in paddy fields occurred mainly from june 27th to july 7th indicating that this period was the concentrated period of rice planting in the study area and also the peak period of irrigation in paddy fields furthermore the spatial differences of the increased flooding paddy fields areas at site a site b and site c indicate significant temporal and spatial differences in the management patterns of paddy fields in the study area which have considerable impact on alleviating the regional water use contradiction and formulating agricultural water management measures 4 3 2 end of irrigation in paddy fields and its spatial distribution as shown in fig 6 from august 6th to 16th the irrigated paddy fields have been prominently presented at site a we argued that the likely ending date of irrigation in paddy fields was august 17th 21st as about 50 78 of the paddy fields ended irrigation during this period as of august 29th approximately 92 97 of paddy fields have ended irrigation in terms of spatial distribution the end of irrigation water in paddy fields in the southeast of site a was earlier than that in the northwest at site b the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred in the two periods from july 29th to august 5th and august 6th to 16th in these two periods there were 26 72 and 26 52 of the paddy field area reached the end of irrigation respectively which marked higher proportions than other periods spatially the paddy fields at site b presented the characteristics of gradually ending irrigation from east to west regarding site c the key period for the end of irrigation ranged from august 6th to 16th and from august 17th to 21th during these two periods 33 82 and 38 78 of the paddy fields ended irrigation respectively spatially the ending date of irrigation in paddy fields in the southwest of site c was earlier than that in the northeast in conclusion the occurrence of the end of irrigation in paddy fields in the study area had significant temporal and spatial differences for site a the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred after august 6th and reached the peak from august 17th to 21st only a small number of irrigation end events occurred after august 29th at site b the ending events of irrigation in paddy fields were mainly concentrated in two periods july 29th to august 5th and august 6th to 16th as far as site c was concerned the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred from august 6th to 16th and august 17th to 21st in spatial distribution the end of irrigation in paddy fields in the southeast of site a was earlier than that in the northwest the irrigation in paddy fields in the east of site b ended earlier than the west and for site c the ending dates of irrigation in paddy fields in the southwest were earlier than that in the northeast 4 3 3 duration of irrigation period of paddy fields and its spatial distribution fig 7a shows that the duration of irrigation period of paddy fields mostly ranged from 40 days to 65 days with an average of about 55 days we used the natural breaking point method provided by arcgis to classify the duration of the irrigation period as shown in fig 7b the irrigation period of paddy fields at site a was mostly 46 65 days whereas at site b and site c it was mostly 31 45 days the results suggested that the duration of the irrigation period of paddy fields in the study area had significant temporal and spatial differences due to the difference between the starting and ending dates of irrigation 4 3 4 balance of water supply and demand in paddy fields during the irrigation period understanding temporal and spatial characteristics of water demand effective precipitation and water shortage are essential for agricultural water irrigation decision making and water resources management in accordance with our previous study the earliest starting date of irrigation in paddy fields occurred from may 18th to may 23rd and the latest ending date of irrigation in paddy fields occurred from september 6th to 14th it was more appropriate to adopt may 23rd instead of may 18th as the earliest starting date of irrigation in paddy fields as the acquisition date of the real sentinel 2 image used in this study was may 23rd therefore only the water demand effective precipitation and water shortage of paddy fields from may 23rd to september 14th were estimated in this study fig 8a shows the daily precipitation monitored by the meteorological stations in the study area and the effective precipitation calculated by eq 4 a total of 30 days of precipitation events occurred from may 23rd to september 14th 2019 among them the daily accumulated precipitation 43 9 mm and effective precipitation 8 56 mm were the largest on august 10th during the irrigation period the accumulated precipitation was 212 1 mm and the daily average accumulated precipitation was 1 84 mm the accumulated effective precipitation is 83 80 mm and the daily average effective precipitation is 0 73 mm according to eq 5 the total effective precipitation in the study area in 2019 was 600 1556 104m¬≥ fig 8d the total daily water demand of the paddy fields during the irrigation period fig 8b indicated that the daily water consumption of paddy fields was relatively large from july 4th to august 21st the date of maximum daily water consumption was july 7th and the maximum water consumption was about 808 310 16 m¬≥ which was approximately three times the average 271 665 71 m¬≥ the daily accumulated water demand of the paddy fields fig 8c began to increase rapidly after july 2nd and hardly increased since august 21st in 2019 the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area was 3124 16 104m¬≥ fig 8d and the total daily average water demand was 1470 54 104m¬≥ the total water shortage of paddy fields in the study area was 2524 0001 104m¬≥ fig 8d in 2019 accounting for 80 79 of the total water demand fig 8d therefore the natural precipitation gap required for irrigation in the paddy fields in the study area was relatively large and a large amount of artificial water supply was needed for managers it is helpful to allocate and manage water resources in different areas by knowing where paddy fields with large water demand or large water shortage are located because the water shortage in the study area accounts for a high proportion of the water demand we inferred that the water shortage had a spatial distribution similar to it therefore only the spatial distribution of water demand in paddy fields was analyzed in this study using jenks natural breaking point method provided by arcgis the total water demand of paddy fields was categorized into four levels namely the low value area sub low value area sub high value area and high value area as shown in fig 9a the high value areas of total water demand presented agglomeration at site a and site c of which the high value areas at site a were mainly distributed in the south and northwest and the high value areas at site c were mainly distributed in the south regarding site b the total water demand of paddy fields took place mainly in low value areas in addition a hot spot analysis was employed to further explore the spatial agglomeration level of high and low values of the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area fig 9b for site a the hotspots were mainly distributed in the west and showed significant clustering at the 99 confidence level the hotspots of site c which were clustered in the southeast showed significant clustering at the 99 confidence level there was no hotspot at site b in terms of the cold spots there were significant cold spots at site b and site c at 90 and 95 confidence levels the cold spots at site b were clustered in the north while those at site c were clustered in the northwest on the whole the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area exhibited significant spatial agglomeration during the irrigation period 5 discussion 5 1 policy effect of spatiotemporal variations of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields currently the flooding signal of the paddy fields is widely used in remote sensing monitoring of rice distribution yield and phenology however research on the dynamic monitoring of irrigation in paddy fields using the flooding signal is rarely involved as traditional manual transplanting is gradually replaced by mechanical planting and direct seeded rice the hydrologic period of paddy fields such as the starting date and ending date of irrigation the duration of irrigation period etc is bound to change these changes may further lead to conflicts in water use among crops and affect the allocation and management of regional water resources ranghetti et al 2016 in this study we aimed to synergize the high spatial and temporal resolution advantages of sentinel 2 and modis to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields at the field scale hence this study is of great significance to the decision making of crop irrigation related studies have been carried out in several countries in the ebro delta of spain flooding paddy fields are the main habitat for birds to protect the farmland ecosystem the local government put forward the agri environmental measures to encourage farmers to maintain the surface of the paddy fields flooded to knowing where and when the flooding events of paddy fields were carried out mor√© et al 2011 monitored the flooding status of paddy fields in this region the flooding started earlier in the paddy fields close to the internal lagoons meanwhile some paddy fields dried up prematurely due to the problems in the irrigation technology these results provided a reference for the government to verify the actual situation of flooding paddy fields in the rice growing areas of northern italy the area of flooding paddy fields has been reduced due to changes in the farmers management of paddy fields which has affected the water management of reservoirs and the aquatic community dependent on flooding paddy fields ranghetti et al 2016 proposed a method to monitor and quantify the spatiotemporal variability of agronomic flooding in paddy fields using remote sensing data they found that the paddy fields in the northwest were the first to be flooded in mid to late april and the agronomic flooding spread to the southeast in may meanwhile in the eastern portion there were only a few flooding paddy fields during the entire growing season however most of the flooding signals were masked by vegetation since late june on this basis ranghetti et al 2018 assessed the dynamic changes of irrigation in paddy fields in northern italy from 2000 to 2016 the results indicated that the flooding paddy fields in northern italy have gradually turned to dry rice and the intensity of seasonal flood decreased with a delay in the starting date of flooding during the last 17 years these results are of great significance to reflect the changes of rice planting patterns and explain the reasons for the decrease of waterbirds in this region in summary these studies above showed that the monitoring of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at regional scales is essential for identifying the possible problems with water supply and alleviating water conflicts however these results are meaningful for guiding the irrigation decision making of paddy fields at a large scale but not suitable for the irrigation management in areas with scattered farmland and complex planting structures because there are significant temporal and spatial differences in irrigation management in paddy fields due to the diversity of rice planting patterns in this study the temporal advantage of modis synthetic products 8 days and the spatial advantage of sentinel 2 data 10 m were combined to generate time series remote sensing data with a high spatial resolution 10 m so as to improve the accuracy of the information extraction of paddy fields distribution and irrigation at the field scale in our tests the overall classification accuracy was 97 85 the kappa coefficient was 0 9737 and the producer s and user s accuracies of paddy fields were almost 100 in terms of classification accuracy therefore our studies carried out in china using the spatiotemporal fusion of sentinel 2 and modis images performed better in paddy fields extraction compared with those studies using modis images in other countries mor√© et al 2011 ranghetti et al 2016 2018 this makes the research in this paper have broad application prospects in small scale paddy fields or those with a high degree of fragmentation several interesting findings can be deduced from our results the peak of irrigation in paddy fields occurred from june 27th to july 7th during which the irrigation consumption was relatively large the end of irrigation in paddy fields mainly occurred approximately before august 21st there were significant temporal and spatial differences in irrigation management at the three rice concentration areas of site a site b and site c during the field survey we interviewed local rice growing farmers on their behavior of irrigation in paddy fields by means of questionnaire surveys among the 96 valid questionnaires obtained approximately 63 54 of the farmers interviewed reported that the starting dates of the first irrigation in paddy fields were conducted mainly in the period from june 27th to july 7th meanwhile about 15 63 of the interviewed farmers indicated that the first irrigation of the paddy fields occurred from may 18th to june 15th according to the farmers interviewed all transplanted paddy fields must be irrigated before planting rice to facilitate transplanting seedlings however the yield of crops is easily affected by topography part of the farmland in the study area is distributed in low lying areas due to the low terrain it is not suitable for growing wheat and only one season of rice is grown here therefore rice was planted earlier in this type of paddy field and transplanting began around mid to late may most of the farmland in this study area is located in wheat rice double cropped areas paddy rice winter wheat rice is transplanted around mid to late june and harvested in mid october in addition there is a pattern of rice fishing in wheat rice double cropped areas paddy fields in this pattern must consume a significant amount of water because fish crayfish and crabs need to survive in the water environment during the growth of rice thus the analysis of the irrigation dynamics in paddy fields was coherent with field surveyed data and with knowledge about paddy fields practices based on these interesting findings we put forward some measures for agricultural water resources first our study realized the monitoring of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at field scales hence we argued that a spatiotemporal database of agricultural irrigation information based on real time monitoring using high resolution remote sensing data must be constructed relying on the big data management and control platform it is possible to timely and accurately obtain water dispatch information such as the irrigation area of paddy fields water supply plan indicators and daily water supply these measures can strengthen the information exchange of agricultural water demand water distribution and water use and promote high quality development of water resources utilization in the irrigation areas along the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river furthermore the significant temporal and spatial divergence of irrigation dynamics of paddy fields illustrated the diversity of farmers irrigation management behavior these differences restrict the level of regional water resources management which easily leads to water conflicts with other irrigated crops therefore it is necessary to clarify the water management strategy of water saving priority and spatial balance to this end diversified water resources regulation measures must be adopted to effectively meet the irrigation demand of paddy fields in time and space finally due to the significant water shortage and spatial differences efforts must be made to develop agricultural water saving irrigation technology improve the irrigation efficiency of paddy fields build a sustainable water saving irrigation technology support system and promote the transformation of irrigation from extensive to intensive 5 2 uncertainty analysis when the bare soil is flooded the water index wi2015 is bound to suddenly increase due to the sharply enhanced water signal which can be used as a sign of the start of the first irrigation in paddy fields however rainfall may also cause a sudden increase in the wi2015 of paddy fields leading to the pseudo maximum of the water body index at certain times thus affecting the judgment result based on the maximum value of the wi2015 according to the results provided in section 4 3 1 the peak period of irrigation in paddy fields was from mid june to late july such that the daily monitoring data of meteorological stations during this period was collected to analyze the impact of rainfall as shown in fig a 3 from june 1st to august 1st 2019 the dates of rainfall events in the study area were june 3rd 4th 5th 6th 20th 23rd 27th 28th july 9th 10th 17th 26th 27th 28th and 30th therefore the water index wi2015 may be affected by rainfall during the irrigation period on the one hand a monitoring scheme based on fields must be established in the future to record the real situation of irrigation in paddy fields so as to verify the deviation of the research results on the other hand image data with higher time frequency such as daily must be used to monitor the occurrence of irrigation in paddy fields when calculating the water demand of paddy fields the crop coefficient kc is easily affected by the climate and environment yang et al 2011 hence it is necessary to correct the crop coefficient recommended by fao according to regional differences bergson et al 2012 sien et al 2008 tyagi et al 2000 according to fao 56 the crop coefficient of paddy fields must be between 1 10 and 1 19 in semi arid and arid areas the present literature recorded the crop coefficients of rice in different growth periods around the study area the kc of rice in the initial growth period rapid growth period mid growth period and mature period were 1 00 1 00 1 15 1 15 and 1 15 0 57 respectively duan et al 2004 the research period of this study mainly included the initial growth period and rapid growth period of paddy fields referring to a previous study han et al 2013 we took the average of the maximum and minimum kc of the initial growth period and the rapid growth period as the crop coefficient after calculation the kc of the water demand of paddy fields in the study area must be 1 15 in the future field monitoring must be carried out to determine the actual kc of evapotranspiration from paddy fields in the study area at different growth stages 6 conclusions currently the shortage of water resources in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china has caused an imbalance between the supply and demand of irrigation in paddy fields leading to a large reduction of the rice planting area therefore studying the spatiotemporal characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields in typical sample areas is essential for water resources management decisions and alleviating regional water use conflicts in this study we mapped the spatial distribution of paddy fields in the main planting areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china on 10 m spatial scale using time series remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms the high resolution paddy fields map provides a basis for monitoring the irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at the field scale finally policy suggestions for agricultural water resources management in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in china were presented the results are as follows 1 the estarfm algorithm realized the spatiotemporal fusion of the bands of red green blue nir swir1 and swir2 of sentinel 2 and modis this is helpful to make up for the lack of temporal or spatial resolution of remote sensing images from a single data source and can provide high spatial resolution time series data for the research of spatio temporal information of paddy fields the predicted reflectance of the six bands had a strong fitting effect with the real reflectance of sentinel 2 and the spectral and texture information of the real sentinel 2 images was largely retained in the predicted image the combination of predicted data and real data can shorten the time interval between two adjacent images to three days 2 applying the rf algorithm to time series data with a resolution of 10 m is conducive to the separation of land features at field scales especially to distinguish between the paddy fields and non paddy fields the overall classification accuracy in this study was 97 85 the kappa coefficient was 0 9737 and the producer s and user s accuracies of paddy fields were both 100 meanwhile the farmland roads in the classification results were clearly visible which could better highlight the field information 3 the starting date ending date duration of irrigation period and their spatial distribution information of irrigation in paddy fields were extracted based on the maximum values of wi2015 and evi which truly reflected the temporal and spatial characteristics of irrigation in paddy fields of the study area this information exhibited significant temporal and spatial differences which reflected the different management patterns of paddy field managers 4 during the irrigation period the total water shortage of the paddy fields in the study area accounted for 80 79 of the total water demand which indicated that the natural precipitation gap required for irrigation in paddy fields in the study area was relatively large and a large amount of artificial water supply from the yellow river and groundwater was needed furthermore the total water demand of paddy fields in the study area has a certain spatial agglomeration forming spatial hot spots and cold spots 5 a spatiotemporal database of agricultural irrigation information based on real time monitoring using high resolution remote sensing data must be constructed to strengthen the information exchange of agricultural water demand water distribution and water use meanwhile diversified water management measures and agricultural water saving irrigation technologies should be introduced to effectively meet the irrigation demand of paddy fields in time and space this study is of great significance for monitoring the dynamics of irrigation in paddy fields at field scales based on the results obtained herein the spatiotemporal fusion of sentinel 2 and modis should be used to analyze the inter annual differences in irrigation dynamics of paddy fields in the future so as to provide scientific theoretical basis and data support to alleviate the water use conflict between
