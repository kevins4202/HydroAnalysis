9295,optimizing irrigation scheduling is vital in maintaining high crop yield and sustainable water use in water limited regions worldwide in this study a 4 year field experiment 2016 2020 was conducted to evaluate the effect of six irrigation schedules on the grain yield performance soil water content plant evapotranspiration and irrigation water use efficiency of typical winter wheat production system in the north china plain the six irrigation schedules involved irrigation at different growth stages including one critical growth stage 60 mm per stage i60 two stages i120 three stages i180 four stages i240 and five stages i300 no irrigation was performed in the control field i0 the results showed that the plant height and yield components of winter wheat spike number per hectare kernels per spike thousand kernel weight increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount the grain yield in each study year increased quadratically p 0 05 with the annual irrigation amount the soil water content in the 0 90 cm soil layer where the wheat roots are mainly distributed increased significantly during the growing season with the increase in annual irrigation amount in i240 the mean soil water content 0 90 cm during the growing seasons 17 3 22 6 was 61 7 80 8 of the field water holding capacity sufficiently favoring wheat growth the average soil water storage 0 90 cm during the wheat growing season ranged from 241 1 to 283 2 mm in the irrigation applied treatments which were 21 7 63 8 mm 9 9 29 1 higher than in no irrigation treatment i0 219 4 mm the 4 year averages of wheat grain yield did not differ significantly between i240 7909 1 kg ha 1 and i300 7868 6 kg ha 1 however the average irrigation water use efficiency decreased from 33 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 in i240 to 26 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 in i300 therefore we recommend an irrigation scheduling at the regreening jointing flowering and filling stages i240 60 mm per stage 240 mm in total to maintain high grain yield and sustainable soil water use for winter wheat production in the north china plain and similar semi arid regions keywords grain yield soil water dynamics evapotranspiration irrigation water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important crops worldwide in terms of production and consumption accounting for about 21 of the world s food supply fu et al 2021 gu et al 2021 the north china plain is the biggest alluvial plain in china approximately 300 000 km2 zheng et al 2010 covering about 40 of the total cultivated area and accounts for about 50 of entire wheat production in china national bureau of statistics of china 2019 xu et al 2018 winter wheat is one of the main cereal crops cultivated in the north china plain and is highly sensitive to soil moisture deficiency lu and fan 2013 wei et al 2018 water shortages highly constrain the wheat production in the north china plain because of the uneven distribution of the annual precipitation which ranges from 500 to 600 mm and only 20 30 less than 200 mm occurs during the winter wheat growth season september to july cao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 consequently winter wheat cultivation in the north china plain typically suffers from a severe water deficit of 200 300 mm accounting for 70 of its water demand 400 500 mm li et al 2010 yang et al 2022 water deficit is widely reported for winter wheat production worldwide li et al 2005 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 tomaz et al 2021 for example the average precipitation received during the winter wheat growing season october june in the semi arid region of the texas high plains is approximately 250 mm which is below the water requirements of wheat for achieving optimum water use efficiency and grain yield water scarcity is the major constraint influencing winter wheat production in arid and semi arid regions of iran mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 winter wheat planted in the u s southern great plains 32 40 n 96 104 w also encounters prolonged periods of drought thapa et al 2020 the seasonal precipitation 250 mm in the area meets only one third of the evapotranspiration requirement 700 950 mm under full irrigation of winter wheat for maximum grain yield musick et al 1994 thus irrigation is needed to meet the water deficit of winter wheat worldwide to pursue high grain yield the local farmers in the north china plain usually apply three or four times flood irrigation more than 300 mm during the winter growing season li et al 2012 which generally exceeds the water demand of wheat resulting in deep percolation yang et al 2022 low water productivity li et al 2012 zeng et al 2021 and low water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2017 similarly five to six irrigations at different growth stages are typically applied in sindh one of the principal winter wheat growing provinces in pakistan to improve the grain yield of winter wheat memon et al 2021 the irrigation water for winter wheat in the north china plain is pumped from groundwater and accounts for 62 70 of the region s total water usage in the past four decades china water resources bulletin 2019 this has attracted global attention especially in light of the rapid decline in groundwater tables wang et al 2009 han et al 2016 davis et al 2017 notably the north china plain is currently one of the deepest groundwater cones of depression worldwide pei et al 2015 data from the past four decades indicate that the groundwater table declining rate in the north china plain is approximately 1 m yr 1 min et al 2015 kong et al 2016 the ogallala aquifer the primary groundwater source in the u s southern great plain has been depleting because the withdrawals from the aquifer for irrigation have far exceeded the recharge rate colaizzi et al 2008 moreover water allocation for agriculture irrigation is discouraged by other economic sectors because of its low per capita profit zhang et al 2021 indeed increasing global population and food demand will likely constrain water use by agriculture in the near future benavides et al 2021 therefore optimal water saving irrigation modifications are urgently needed in the north china plain and similar water shortage regions to address the balance between water supply and crop water demand and alleviate the over exploitation of groundwater rational irrigation amount could improve crop yield and wue by applying a limited amount of water at critical crop growth stages oweis et al 2004 most previous studies have mainly focused on optimizing irrigation measures to improve wheat yield wue and nutrient use efficiency li et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 schulthess et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 si et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 however under different irrigation scheduling management high time resolution data of soil water content every 7 days about 17 21 measurements per year in the wheat root zone is still underrepresented in the literature moreover the optimal irrigation schedules to maximize crop yield while maintaining high efficient water use for winter wheat still need exploring through long term field positioning experiments this is essential for optimizing irrigation management in the north china plain and providing valuable guidance for sustainable water use in winter wheat production worldwide in this study we conducted a 4 year successive field experiment 2017 2020 in the north china plain to optimize irrigation management for winter wheat production this study aimed 1 to explore the effects of different irrigation schedules on real time dynamics of soil water content and soil water storage and 2 to determine the optimal irrigation schedule for maintaining high grain yield and efficient water use in winter wheat production system our findings provide important guidance for formulating rational irrigation measures to ensure sustainable water use for winter wheat production in the north china plain and similar semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area a 4 year field experiment oct 2016 jun 2020 was conducted at the hengshui experimental irrigation station 37 59 n 115 38 e altitude 24 m in hebei province china fig 1 to evaluate the effect of different irrigation schedules on the performance of grain yield and water productivity of a typical winter wheat production system this site is representative of the agricultural production and climate conditions in the northern part of the north china plain the area belongs to a semi arid continental monsoon climate with annual mean precipitation of 486 3 mm the precipitation is characterized by uneven distribution in which 70 80 occurs between june and september the annual average temperature is 12 6 annual average sunshine hours is 2633 5 h and frost free period is 185 days the annual average pan evaporation is 1920 3 mm the soil type in the study area is calcareous eum orthic anthrosol udic haplustalf in the usda soil taxonomy the bulk density core method and field water holding capacity retention curve method was 1 38 g cm 3 and 0 25 g g 1 for 0 20 cm 1 56 g cm 3 and 0 31 g g 1 for 20 40 cm 1 48 g cm 3 and 0 36 g g 1 for 40 60 cm 1 46 g cm 3 and 0 29 g g 1 for 60 80 cm 1 51 g cm 3 and 0 22 g g 1 for 80 100 cm the topsoil layer 0 20 cm of the experimental field contained 11 2 g kg 1 organic matter k2cr2o7 h2so4 method 56 8 mg kg 1 alkaline nitrogen kjeldahl method 28 3 mg kg 1 available phosphate olsen p method and 121 9 mg kg 1 available potassium nh4oac extraction the soil ph 0 20 cm is 7 98 1 2 5 in water with a ph meter all the determining methods for the soil sample were as described by sparks et al 1996 2 2 experimental design six irrigation schedule treatments were used for typical winter wheat production table 1 the irrigation water was pumped from a deep well of 500 m deep by a submersible pump extraction efficiency of 40 m3 h 1 the experiment plots in this study were flood irrigated through buried pipelines and ground soft water pipes just as the local farmers typically do the irrigation amount for each time was 60 mm which was precisely controlled by a water meter with an accuracy of 0 01 m3 local farmers usually change wheat varieties every year to improve the guiding value of this study in the irrigation of winter wheat for local farmers we kept the cultivars seeding and fertilization of winter wheat the same as those of the local farmers and only changed them according to their preferences over time table 2 the same varieties of winter wheat were used in all the six irrigation treatments within the same year winter wheat was planted in late october at a seeding rate of 295 300 kg ha 1 and row space of 16 cm the growing period of winter wheat was from late october to mid june of the following year the basal fertilizers were broadcasted and incorporated into the soil and 141 156 kg n ha 1 was top dressed at the jointing stage late march either with irrigation or with a rainfall event detailed information on cultivars planting harvesting and fertilization of winter wheat are provided in table 2 each treatment had three replicated plots 28 m in length and 7 3 m in width 204 4 m2 and followed a completely random design each experimental plot had a 1 8 m wide buffer area to avoid horizontal movement of soil water 2 3 field and laboratory measurements 2 3 1 plant height and yield components three representative rows of winter wheat each 1 m long were selected and labeled in each experimental plot to measure the plant height every 7 days every year a sample block 2 m long and 2 m wide sample block 4 m2 was randomly selected in each experimental plot at the harvesting stage to harvest wheat subsequently the harvested wheat samples were naturally dried manually threshed and weighed to estimate the grain yield per hectare kg ha 1 meanwhile 30 spikes were randomly collected from each experimental plot to measure panicle length kernel per spike and thousand kernel weight 2 3 2 profile of soil water content and soil water storage profile soil samples from 0 to 90 cm soil layer the main distribution zone of wheat roots were randomly collected every 7 days approximately 17 21 times per year from three locations of each experimental plot the samples were collected using an auger at 20 cm intervals during the growing period gravimetric soil water content was measured by oven drying the soil sample at 105 to a constant weight ma et al 2015 the soil water storage of the 0 90 cm soil depth at any moment was calculated as follows lai et al 2022 1 soil water storage 0 90 cm sw c i bd i d where swc i is the mass water content of soil at the ith soil depth as measured by the traditional stoving method bd g cm 3 is the bulk density of soil at the ith soil depth and d cm is the depth of soil layer 2 3 3 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the growing season of each year mm was calculated using the water balance equation lai et al 2022 2 evapotranspiration p i sw s s sw s h cr dp sr where p is the total precipitation input during the growing season of winter wheat mm i is the total irrigation amount during the growing season mm sws s and sws h is the soil water storage mm in the 0 90 cm soil layer at the sowing and harvesting stage respectively cr is the capillary rise of water into the root zone mm dp is the deep percolation of soil water mm and sr is surface runoff mm the deep percolation dp mm was estimated using the method proposed by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 as below 3 dp 0 if sws sws fc sws sws fc if sws sws fc where sws is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm and sws fc is the soil water storage for the same depth at field water holding capacity mm we calculated dp using the buck density and the field water holding capacity data for the whole 0 90 cm depth and found that it was zero for the 4 year study because the high time resolution data of soil water storage in the range of 107 9 368 3 mm was less than sws fc 390 2 mm this is consistent with the reported zero value of dp in the same study area fan et al 2018 si et al 2020 possibly due to the minor irrigation input for each time 60 mm and scarce rainfall during the wheat growing season notably a few exceptions were made in this study regarding evapotranspiration calculation specifically cr was ignored in this study because of the deep groundwater table 30 m also cr has been reported to be of negligible rate in the same area yang et al 2022 finally sr was not observed during the 4 year experimental period because of the flat terrain of the experimental plots of note daily precipitation mm and air temperatures from 2016 to 2020 fig 2 were obtained from an automatic weather station near the experimental plots 2 3 4 water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency the water productivity of winter wheat kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows lai et al 2022 4 water productivity gy et where gy is the grain yield of winter wheat at the harvest stage and et is the water consumption evapotranspiration of wheat during the growing season the irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows liu et al 2021 5 irrigation water use efficiency gy i where gy is the grain yield of winter wheat at the harvest stage kg ha 1 and i is the annual irrigation amount during the growing season mm 2 4 statistical analysis data analysis was performed using spss 21 0 for windows ibm inc armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova was performed to test the differences in plant height grain yield spike number average spike length kernels per spike thousand kernel weight soil water storage evapotranspiration water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency among various irrigation treatments and means were separated by lsd test at p 0 05 significance level the figures were drawn using origin 9 0 software for windows originlab usa 3 results 3 1 dynamics in wheat height the height of winter wheat under various irrigation treatments increased rapidly after reaching the jointing stage approximately 150 days after sowing fig 3 the plant height generally increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount at the harvesting stage wheat height was significantly higher under i240 73 0 cm and i300 74 1 cm than in the other treatments 42 1 60 3 cm in 2016 2017 p 0 05 fig 3a while in 2018 2019 the height was significantly higher in i240 68 6 cm and i300 66 5 cm than in i0 39 9 cm i60 57 8 cm and i120 56 9 cm treatments fig 3c at the harvesting stage in 2019 2020 the plant height was significantly higher under i240 63 9 cm and i300 71 7 cm than under i0 36 2 cm and i60 45 4 cm treatments fig 3d notably data on wheat height at the harvesting stage is not available for 2017 2018 fig 3b 3 2 grain yield performance the grain yield of winter wheat increased notably with the increase in annual irrigation amount during the 4 year study period fig 4a in 2016 2017 the grain yield under i240 8608 0 kg ha 1 and i300 8241 0 kg ha 1 were significantly higher than under i0 3779 0 kg ha 1 i60 4748 5 kg ha 1 and i120 5927 0 kg ha 1 the grain yield under the irrigation treatments 6282 0 6771 5 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under i0 5331 5 kg ha 1 in 2017 2018 however no significant difference was detected among the various irrigation treatments in 2018 2019 the grain yield under i240 9528 5 kg ha 1 and i300 8887 0 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under other treatments 2312 0 7512 5 kg ha 1 in 2019 2020 the grain yield under i240 7060 0 kg ha 1 and i300 7575 0 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under i0 1490 0 kg ha 1 i60 4655 0 kg ha 1 and i120 4370 0 kg ha 1 regression analysis further revealed that the grain yield of winter wheat increased quadratically with annual irrigation amount fig 4b d e except in 2017 2018 fig 4c 3 3 grain yield components the annual irrigation amount significantly affected the yield components of winter wheat during the study period fig 5 the spike number per hectare fluctuated in 2016 2017 fig 5a but tended to increase with annual irrigation amounts in 2017 2018 fig 5b 2018 2019 fig 5c and 2019 2020 fig 5d the average spike length fig 5e h and kernels per spike fig 5i l were significantly higher under the irrigation treatments than i0 except in 2017 2018 the average spike length and kernels per spike increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount in 2016 2017 fig 5e i 2018 2019 fig 5g k and 2019 2020 fig 5h l but remained unchanged in 2017 2018 fig 5f j the thousand kernel weights of winter wheat tended to increase quadratically with the increase in annual irrigation amount except in 2017 2018 which showed a decreasing trend fig 5m p 3 4 dynamics of soil water content and soil water storage compared with i0 the irrigation treatments significantly enhanced soil water content at the 0 90 cm soil layer during the 4 year study period fig 6 this was especially evident at 0 60 cm soil depth when the wheat plants reached the jointing stage mostly after march notably soil water content increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount specifically the average soil water content at 0 90 cm soil layer in i0 i60 i120 i180 i240 and i300 treatments during the wheat growing season were 14 9 16 3 17 1 17 6 19 2 and 18 5 during the 4 study years the total soil water storage at the 0 90 cm soil layer slightly decreased during the seeding and tillering stages from october to february of the following year then increased gradually with increasing water input by precipitation and irrigation and decreased because of the increased water consumption by winter wheat after the jointing stage fig 7 the average soil water storage 0 90 cm varied significantly among the irrigation treatments in each of the study years the average soil water storage 0 90 cm under i240 260 7 mm was significantly higher than under i0 i60 and i120 in 2016 2017 meanwhile the average soil water storage under i240 333 9 mm was significantly higher than under i0 i60 i120 and i180 in 2017 2018 in 2018 2019 the average soil water storage was significantly higher under i240 283 2 mm and i300 280 7 mm than under other treatments in 2019 2020 the average soil water storage under i240 254 9 mm and i300 252 3 mm were significantly higher than under i0 and i60 3 5 evapotranspiration water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the growing season generally increased with the increase in the annual irrigation amount during the study period fig 8 the evapotranspiration under i300 483 4 mm and i240 436 9 mm were significantly higher than under i0 204 6 mm i60 316 6 mm and i120 277 7 mm in 2016 2017 fig 8a in 2017 2018 the evapotranspiration of winter wheat were significantly different among the treatments in the following order i300 407 6 mm i240 368 5 mm i180 280 1 mm i120 199 7 mm i60 155 0 mm i0 65 9 mm fig 8b in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the plant evapotranspiration under i180 i240 and i300 treatments did not differ significantly but were significantly higher than under i0 i60 and i120 fig 8c d regression analysis further indicated that the grain yield of winter wheat increased linearly with evapotranspiration during the study period water productivity of winter wheat tended to decrease with irrigation amount in 2017 2018 but fluctuated in the remaining years table 3 however the irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat generally decreased with the increase in annual irrigation amount table 3 in 2016 2017 and 2019 2020 the irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat was significantly higher under i60 than under the other treatments the irrigation water use efficiency varied significantly among i60 i120 i180 and i240 in 2017 2018 and among i60 i120 and i180 treatments in 2018 2019 the 4 year averages of irrigation water use efficiency decreased from 33 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 under i240 to 26 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 under i300 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation schedules on grain yield water shortage restricts crop growth and grain yield in arid and semi arid regions worldwide colaizzi et al 2008 mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 yang et al 2019 irrigation is widely used to offset the yield loss due to severe water stress li et al 2005 zhang et al 2006 guo et al 2014 cavero et al 2016 tomaz et al 2021 optimal irrigation scheduling significantly promoted crop growth and increased grain yield of winter wheat in the north china plain and other regions worldwide chen et al 2015 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 in this study the grain yield of winter wheat at the harvesting stage increased quadratically with the annual irrigation amount indicating that a moderate amount of irrigation is essential in increasing grain yield of winter wheat production in the north china plain the annual rainfall in the north china plain is unevenly distributed and can only meet part of the crop s water demand li et al 2010 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2022 notably annual irrigation amount did not influence grain yield and the yield components of winter wheat in 2017 2018 possibly because the precipitation during the winter wheat growing season was much higher during this period 133 2 mm than in the other years 55 2 93 0 mm thus reducing the irrigation effect the effects of the irrigation schedule were closely related to inter annual variation of the rainfall input during the crop growth stages zeng et al 2021 in this study compared with i180 additional irrigation 60 mm at the jointing stage i240 notably increased the average grain yield of winter wheat in the successive 4 years fig 9 this is because soil water typically encounters severe drought as revealed by the notable dry zone within 0 60 cm layer occurring after the wheat jointing stage mostly after march and irrigation at this critical stage could meet the rapidly increased water requirement for wheat this is consistent with the findings of zhao et al 2020 who reported that additional irrigation at stem elongation could significantly increase the grain yield of winter wheat compared to one in season irrigation at anthesis however the grain yield did not differ significantly between the i240 and i300 treatments regression analysis further indicated a significant quadratic increasing pattern in winter wheat yield with increasing annual irrigation amount in the successive four years collectively these results indicate that low annual irrigation amounts significantly promote the grain yield of winter wheat compared to high annual irrigation amounts this is possible because the water supply under high annual irrigation amounts exceeded crop water demand and thus exerted adverse or no significant effects on crop yield zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 similarly reported that the grain yield of winter wheat did not increase under low deficit irrigation adequate water supply conditions in wet normal and dry years additionally we observed that the grain components of winter wheat i e spike number per hectare kernels per spike thousand kernel weight increased linearly or quadratically with the increase in annual irrigation amounts in the four year successive study which explains the dynamics of grain yield of winter wheat under increasing annual irrigation amounts the observed increasing tendency in spike number per hectare with annual irrigation times amount in this study especially in 2019 and 2020 is consistent with the finding of foulkes et al 2011 that wheat grain yield enhancement is highly associated with spike number per hectare similarly the results of this study agree with a previous report that thousand kernel weight increased significantly with an increasing number of irrigations for winter wheat grown in north china plain zhang et al 2018 4 2 optimal irrigation scheduling for high crop yield and efficient soil water use the four year study period experienced wet and dry seasons covering inter annual variation in precipitation and thus provides more reliable data than short term studies in the present study in cases where no irrigation was applied during the growing season i0 soil water content at 0 90 cm depth decreased considerably and severe soil drought occurred especially at the 0 60 cm soil layer the red shaded area in fig 6 during the regreening jointing booting flowering and filling stages from february to june the interannual variations in precipitation triggered apparent variations in the soil water content distribution 0 90 cm during the study years however each year the depth of the dry soil layer and the duration of drought shrank gradually with increasing annual irrigation amounts fig 6 this is because high amount of irrigated water infiltrated into the soil with increasing annual irrigation amounts thus enhancing soil water content at 0 60 cm depth similar results were reported previously in winter wheat cultivated in the north china plain li et al 2005 furthermore guo et al 2014 indicated that the soil water content in the 200 cm soil depth increased with increasing irrigation amount fang et al 2018 reported that soil water content along the top 2 m soil profile increased in two irrigation 90 mm at jointing stage and 60 mm at anthesis stage treatments compared to no irrigation and one irrigation 90 mm at jointing stage treatments despite the irrigations applied to winter wheat the upper soil layers about 0 60 cm depth remained dry at the wheat jointing stage after march this is due to the increased plant evapotranspiration with rising air temperature and the rapid growth of winter wheat the dry zone and wet zone were especially obvious for the no irrigation i0 and low amount irrigation treatments i e i60 i120 i180 as a result a water potential gradient existed between the upper dry and deeper wet layers the soil water in the wet soil layers could exude into the upper dry zone during the nights when evapotranspiration decreases through a hydraulic lift effect which could promote water uptake by shallow roots and results in high water use efficiency han et al 2016 li et al 2010 in this study during the four year study period the average sws of the 0 90 cm soil depth increased remarkably with the increase in annual irrigation amounts however the average soil water storage did not differ significantly between the i240 and i300 treatments during the study period possibly due to the increased soil evaporation loss under the excessive annual irrigation amount 300 mm previous studies have shown that rational irrigation can improve crop yield and irrigation water productivity by supplying a limited amount of water at critical crop growth stages oweis et al 2004 li et al 2010 as discussed earlier in this section the grain yield and water consumption of winter wheat increased with the increase in the annual irrigation amount however the annual and the 4 year average grain yield of winter wheat peaked under i240 treatment 7909 1 kg ha 1 and did not increase further when the annual irrigation amount exceeded 240 mm indicating that the additional irrigation amount of 60 mm at the booting stage did not contribute to yield increase but enhanced crop water use and decreased irrigation water use efficiency fig 9 generally recommended irrigation schedules including amounts and timing for winter wheat depend highly on the target yield level li et al 2005 zeng et al 2021 in this study application of irrigation at 240 mm annually was optimal for high grain yield 7909 1 kg ha 1 on average sufficient soil moisture during the growing season an average of 76 8 of field water holding capacity and high irrigation water use efficiency 33 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 on average for winter wheat production in the north china plain this value is comparable with the recommended irrigation amount 225 mm for a similar yield level of winter wheat in the north china plain li et al 2005 zhao et al 2020 however a full life cycle assessment of different irrigation management systems and water saving irrigation technologies e g micro sprinkling irrigation and fertigation should be conducted in the future to achieve high grain yield and efficient water use for winter wheat production in north china plain 5 conclusion the findings of this study indicate that a moderate amount of irrigation can increase spike number per hectare kernels per spike and thousand kernel weight contributing to the increase in grain yield of winter wheat in a semi arid climate increasing irrigation times at different critical growth stages accompanied by increased annual irrigation amount significantly enhanced the soil water content of the 0 90 cm soil layer the main distribution area of wheat roots the dry zone in the 0 60 cm soil layer of winter wheat significantly shrank with increasing irrigation times amount the mean soil water content 0 90 cm during the growing season under four irrigation schedules at the regreening jointing flowering and filling stages represented 61 7 80 8 of the field water holding capacity 0 28 g g 1 on average for 0 90 cm soil layer creating a sufficient and suitable soil water environment for wheat growth during the study period the grain yields of winter wheat increased quadratically with the annual irrigation times amount and peaked under the irrigation amount of 240 mm meanwhile water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat decreased with the annual irrigation times amount due to the increased evapotranspiration and stagnant grain yield therefore we recommend four times irrigation 60 mm each at the regreening jointing flowering and filling stages to maximize grain yield and maintain sustainable and high efficient soil water use for winter wheat production in north china plain the present study will be instructive for optimization of irrigation scheduling for winter wheat to maximize yield and maintain high efficient water use in a semi arid environment

9295,optimizing irrigation scheduling is vital in maintaining high crop yield and sustainable water use in water limited regions worldwide in this study a 4 year field experiment 2016 2020 was conducted to evaluate the effect of six irrigation schedules on the grain yield performance soil water content plant evapotranspiration and irrigation water use efficiency of typical winter wheat production system in the north china plain the six irrigation schedules involved irrigation at different growth stages including one critical growth stage 60 mm per stage i60 two stages i120 three stages i180 four stages i240 and five stages i300 no irrigation was performed in the control field i0 the results showed that the plant height and yield components of winter wheat spike number per hectare kernels per spike thousand kernel weight increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount the grain yield in each study year increased quadratically p 0 05 with the annual irrigation amount the soil water content in the 0 90 cm soil layer where the wheat roots are mainly distributed increased significantly during the growing season with the increase in annual irrigation amount in i240 the mean soil water content 0 90 cm during the growing seasons 17 3 22 6 was 61 7 80 8 of the field water holding capacity sufficiently favoring wheat growth the average soil water storage 0 90

averages of wheat grain yield did not differ significantly between i240 7909 1 kg ha 1 and i300 7868 6 kg ha 1 however the average irrigation water use efficiency decreased from 33 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 in i240 to 26 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 in i300 therefore we recommend an irrigation scheduling at the regreening jointing flowering and filling stages i240 60 mm per stage 240 mm in total to maintain high grain

efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important crops worldwide in terms of production and consumption accounting for about 21 of the world s food supply fu et al 2021 gu et al 2021 the north china plain is the biggest alluvial plain in china approximately 300 000 km2 zheng et al 2010 covering about 40 of the total cultivated area and accounts for about 50 of entire wheat production in china national bureau of statistics of china 2019 xu et al 2018 winter wheat is one of the main cereal crops cultivated in the north china plain and is highly sensitive to soil moisture deficiency lu and fan 2013 wei et al 2018 water shortages highly constrain the wheat production in the north china plain because of the uneven distribution of the annual precipitation which ranges from 500 to 600 mm and only 20 30 less than 200 mm occurs during the winter wheat growth season september to july cao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 consequently winter wheat cultivation in the north china plain typically suffers from a severe water deficit of 200 300 mm accounting for 70 of its water demand 400 500 mm li et al 2010 yang et al 2022 water deficit is widely reported for winter wheat production worldwide li et al 2005 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 tomaz et al 2021 for example the average precipitation received during the winter wheat growing season october june in the semi arid region of the texas high plains is approximately 250 mm which is below the water requirements of wheat for achieving optimum water use efficiency and grain yield water scarcity is the major constraint influencing winter wheat production in arid and semi arid regions of iran mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 winter wheat planted in the u s southern great plains 32 40 n 96 104 w also encounters prolonged periods of drought thapa et al 2020 the seasonal precipitation 250 mm in the area meets only one third of the evapotranspiration requirement 700 950 mm under full irrigation of winter wheat for maximum grain yield musick et al 1994 thus irrigation is needed to meet the water deficit of winter wheat worldwide to pursue high grain yield the local farmers in the north china plain usually apply three or four times flood irrigation more than 300 mm during the winter growing season li et al 2012 which generally exceeds the water demand of wheat resulting in deep percolation yang et al 2022 low water productivity li et al 2012 zeng et al 2021 and low water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2017 similarly five to six irrigations at different growth stages are typically applied in sindh one of the principal winter wheat growing provinces in pakistan to improve the grain yield of winter wheat memon et al 2021 the irrigation water for winter wheat in the north china plain is pumped from groundwater and accounts for 62 70 of the region s total water usage in the past four decades china water resources bulletin 2019 this has attracted global attention especially in light of the rapid decline in groundwater tables wang et al 2009 han et al 2016 davis et al 2017 notably the north china plain is currently one of the deepest groundwater cones of depression worldwide pei et al 2015 data from the past four decades indicate that the groundwater table declining rate in the north china plain is approximately 1 m yr 1 min et al 2015 kong et al 2016 the ogallala aquifer the primary groundwater source in the u s southern great plain has been depleting because the withdrawals from the aquifer for irrigation have far exceeded the recharge rate colaizzi et al 2008 moreover water allocation for agriculture irrigation is discouraged by other economic sectors because of its low per capita profit zhang et al 2021 indeed increasing global population and food demand will likely constrain water use by agriculture in the near future benavides et al 2021 therefore optimal water saving irrigation modifications are urgently needed in the north china plain and similar water shortage regions to address the balance between water supply and crop water demand and alleviate the over exploitation of groundwater rational irrigation amount could improve crop yield and wue by applying a limited amount of water at critical crop growth stages oweis et al 2004 most previous studies have mainly focused on optimizing irrigation measures to improve wheat yield wue and nutrient use efficiency li et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 schulthess et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 si et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 however under different irrigation scheduling management high time resolution data of soil water content every 7 days about 17 21 measurements per year in the wheat root zone is still underrepresented in the literature moreover the optimal irrigation schedules to maximize crop yield while maintaining high efficient water use for winter wheat still need exploring through long term field positioning experiments this is essential for optimizing irrigation management in the north china plain and providing valuable guidance for sustainable water use in winter wheat production worldwide in this study we conducted a 4 year successive field experiment 2017 2020 in the north china plain to optimize irrigation management for winter wheat production this study aimed 1 to explore the effects of different irrigation schedules on real time dynamics of soil water content and soil water storage and 2 to determine the optimal irrigation schedule for maintaining high grain yield and efficient water use in winter wheat production system our findings provide important guidance for formulating rational irrigation measures to ensure sustainable water use for winter wheat production in the north china plain and similar semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area a 4 year field experiment oct 2016 jun 2020 was conducted at the hengshui experimental irrigation station 37 59 n 115 38 e altitude 24 m in hebei province china fig 1 to evaluate the effect of different irrigation schedules on the performance of grain yield and water productivity of a typical winter wheat

20 cm is 7 98 1 2 5 in water with a ph meter all the determining methods for the soil sample were as described by sparks et al 1996 2 2 experimental design six irrigation schedule treatments were used for typical winter wheat production table 1 the irrigation water was pumped from a deep well of 500 m deep by a submersible pump extraction efficiency of 40 m3 h 1 the experiment plots in this study were flood irrigated through buried pipelines and ground soft water pipes just as the local farmers typically do the irrigation amount for each time was 60 mm which was precisely controlled by a water meter with an accuracy of 0 01 m3 local farmers usually change wheat varieties every year to improve the guiding value of this study in the irrigation of winter wheat for local farmers we kept the cultivars seeding and fertilization of winter wheat the same as those of the local farmers and only changed them according to their preferences over time table 2 the same varieties of winter wheat were used in all the six irrigation treatments within the same year winter wheat was planted in late october at a seeding rate of 295 300 kg ha 1 and row space of 16 cm the growing period of winter wheat was from late october to mid june of the following year the basal fertilizers were broadcasted and incorporated into the soil and 141 156 kg n ha 1 was top dressed at the jointing stage late march either with irrigation or with a rainfall event detailed information on cultivars planting harvesting and fertilization of winter wheat are provided in table 2 each treatment had three replicated plots 28 m in length and 7 3 m in width 204 4 m2 and followed a completely random design each experimental plot had a 1 8 m wide buffer area to avoid horizontal movement of soil water 2 3 field and laboratory measurements 2 3 1 plant height and yield components three representative rows of winter wheat each 1 m long were selected and labeled in each experimental plot to measure the plant height every 7 days every year a sample block 2 m long and 2 m wide sample block 4 m2 was randomly selected in each experimental plot at the harvesting stage to harvest wheat subsequently the harvested wheat samples were naturally dried manually threshed and weighed to estimate the grain yield per hectare kg ha 1 meanwhile 30 spikes were randomly collected from each experimental plot to measure panicle length kernel per spike and thousand kernel weight 2 3 2 profile of soil water content and soil water storage profile soil samples from 0 to 90 cm soil layer the main distribution zone of wheat roots were randomly collected every 7 days approximately 17 21 times per year from three locations of each experimental plot the samples were collected using an auger at 20 cm intervals during the growing period gravimetric soil water content was measured by oven drying the soil sample at 105 to a constant weight ma et al 2015 the soil water storage of the 0 90 cm soil depth at any moment was calculated as follows lai et al 2022 1 soil water storage 0 90 cm sw c i bd i d where swc i is the mass water content of soil at the ith soil depth as measured by the traditional stoving method bd g cm 3 is the bulk density of soil at the ith soil depth and d cm is the depth of soil layer 2 3 3 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the growing season of each year mm was calculated using the water balance equation lai et al 2022 2 evapotranspiration p i sw s s sw s h cr dp sr where p is the total precipitation input during the growing season of winter wheat mm i is the total irrigation amount during the growing season mm sws s and sws h is the soil water storage mm in the 0 90 cm soil layer at the sowing and harvesting stage respectively cr is the capillary rise of water into the root zone mm dp is the deep percolation of soil water mm and sr is surface runoff mm the deep percolation dp mm was estimated using the method proposed by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 as below 3 dp 0 if sws sws fc sws sws fc if sws sws fc where sws is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm and sws fc is the soil water storage for the same depth at field water holding capacity mm we calculated dp using the buck density and the field water holding capacity data for the whole 0 90 cm depth and found that it was zero for the 4 year study because the high time resolution data of soil water storage in the range of 107 9 368 3 mm was less than sws fc 390 2 mm this is consistent with the reported zero value of dp in the same study area fan et al 2018 si et al 2020 possibly due to the minor irrigation input for each time 60 mm and scarce rainfall during the wheat growing season notably a few exceptions were made in this study regarding evapotranspiration calculation specifically cr was ignored in this study because of the deep groundwater table 30 m also cr has been reported to be of negligible rate in the same area yang et al 2022 finally sr was not observed during the 4 year experimental period because of the flat terrain of the experimental plots of note daily precipitation mm and air temperatures from 2016 to 2020 fig 2 were obtained from an automatic weather station near the experimental plots 2 3 4 water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency the water productivity of winter wheat kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows lai et al 2022 4 water productivity gy et where gy is the grain yield of winter wheat at the harvest stage and et is the water consumption evapotranspiration of wheat during the growing season the irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows liu et al 2021 5 irrigation water use efficiency gy i where gy is the grain yield of winter wheat at the harvest stage kg ha 1 and i is the annual irrigation amount during the growing season mm 2 4 statistical analysis data analysis was performed using spss 21 0 for windows ibm inc armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova was performed to test the differences in plant height grain yield spike number average spike length kernels per spike thousand kernel weight soil water storage evapotranspiration water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency among various irrigation treatments and means were separated by lsd test at p 0 05 significance level the figures were drawn using origin 9 0 software for windows originlab usa 3 results 3 1 dynamics in wheat height the height of winter wheat under various irrigation treatments increased rapidly after reaching the jointing stage approximately 150 days after sowing fig 3 the plant height generally increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount at the harvesting stage wheat height was significantly higher under i240 73 0 cm and i300 74 1 cm than in the other treatments 42 1 60 3 cm in 2016 2017 p 0 05 fig 3a while in 2018 2019 the height was significantly higher in i240 68 6 cm and i300 66 5 cm than in i0 39 9 cm i60 57 8 cm and i120 56 9 cm treatments fig 3c at the harvesting stage in 2019 2020 the plant height was significantly higher under i240 63 9 cm and i300 71 7 cm than under i0 36 2 cm and i60 45 4 cm treatments fig 3d notably data on wheat height at the harvesting stage is not available for 2017 2018 fig 3b 3 2 grain yield performance the grain yield of winter wheat increased notably with the increase in annual irrigation amount during the 4 year study period fig 4a in 2016 2017 the grain yield under i240 8608 0 kg ha 1 and i300 8241 0 kg ha 1 were significantly higher than under i0 3779 0 kg ha 1 i60 4748 5 kg ha 1 and i120 5927 0 kg ha 1 the grain yield under the irrigation treatments 6282 0 6771 5 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under i0 5331 5 kg ha 1 in 2017 2018 however no significant difference was detected among the various irrigation treatments in 2018 2019 the grain yield under i240 9528 5 kg ha 1 and i300 8887 0 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under other treatments 2312 0 7512 5 kg ha 1 in 2019 2020 the grain yield under i240 7060 0 kg ha 1 and i300 7575 0 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under i0 1490 0 kg ha 1 i60 4655 0 kg ha 1 and i120 4370 0 kg ha 1 regression analysis further revealed that the grain yield of winter wheat increased quadratically with annual irrigation amount fig 4b d e except in 2017 2018 fig 4c 3 3 grain yield components the annual irrigation amount significantly affected the yield components of winter wheat during the study period fig 5 the spike number per hectare fluctuated in 2016 2017 fig 5a but tended to increase with annual irrigation amounts in 2017 2018 fig 5b 2018 2019 fig 5c and 2019 2020 fig 5d the average spike length fig 5e h and kernels per spike fig 5i l were significantly higher under the irrigation treatments than i0 except in 2017 2018 the average spike length and kernels per spike increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount in 2016 2017 fig 5e i 2018 2019 fig 5g k and 2019 2020 fig 5h l but remained unchanged in 2017 2018 fig 5f j the thousand kernel weights of winter wheat tended to increase quadratically with the increase in annual irrigation amount except in 2017 2018 which showed a decreasing trend fig 5m p 3 4 dynamics of soil water content and soil water storage compared with i0 the irrigation treatments significantly enhanced soil water content at the 0 90 cm soil layer during the 4 year study period fig 6 this was especially evident at 0 60 cm soil depth when the wheat plants reached the jointing stage mostly after march notably soil water content increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount specifically the average soil water content at 0 90 cm soil layer in i0 i60 i120 i180 i240 and i300 treatments during the wheat growing season were 14 9 16 3 17 1 17 6 19 2 and 18 5 during the 4 study years the total soil water storage at the 0 90 cm soil layer slightly decreased during the seeding and tillering stages from october to february of the following year then increased gradually with increasing water input by precipitation and irrigation and decreased because of the increased water consumption by winter wheat after the jointing stage fig 7 the average soil water storage 0 90 cm varied significantly among the irrigation treatments in each of the study years the average soil water storage 0 90 cm under i240 260 7 mm was significantly higher than under i0 i60 and i120 in 2016 2017 meanwhile the average soil water storage under i240 333 9 mm was significantly higher than under i0 i60 i120 and i180 in 2017 2018 in 2018 2019 the average soil water storage was significantly higher under i240 283 2 mm and i300 280 7 mm than under other treatments in 2019 2020 the average soil water storage under i240 254 9 mm and i300 252 3 mm were significantly higher than under i0 and i60 3 5 evapotranspiration water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the growing season generally increased with the increase in the annual irrigation amount during the study period fig 8 the evapotranspiration under i300 483 4 mm and i240 436 9 mm were significantly higher than under i0 204 6 mm i60 316 6 mm and i120 277 7 mm in 2016 2017 fig 8a in 2017 2018 the evapotranspiration of winter wheat were significantly different among the treatments in the following order i300 407 6 mm i240 368 5 mm i180 280 1 mm i120 199 7 mm i60 155 0 mm i0 65 9 mm fig 8b in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the plant evapotranspiration under i180 i240 and i300 treatments did not differ significantly but were significantly higher than under i0 i60 and i120 fig 8c d regression analysis further indicated that the grain yield of winter wheat increased linearly with evapotranspiration during the study period water productivity of winter wheat tended to decrease with irrigation amount in 2017 2018 but fluctuated in the remaining years table 3 however the irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat generally decreased with the increase in annual irrigation amount table 3 in 2016 2017 and 2019 2020 the irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat was significantly higher under i60 than under the other treatments the irrigation water use efficiency varied significantly among i60 i120 i180 and i240 in 2017 2018 and among i60 i120 and i180 treatments in 2018 2019 the 4 year averages of irrigation water use efficiency decreased from 33 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 under i240 to 26 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 under i300 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation schedules on grain yield water shortage restricts crop growth and grain yield in arid and semi arid regions worldwide colaizzi et al 2008 mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 yang et al 2019 irrigation is widely used to offset the yield loss due to severe water stress li et al 2005 zhang et al 2006 guo et al 2014 cavero et al 2016 tomaz et al 2021 optimal irrigation scheduling significantly promoted crop growth and increased grain yield of winter wheat in the north china plain and other regions worldwide chen et al 2015 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 in this study the grain yield of winter wheat at the harvesting stage increased quadratically with the annual irrigation amount indicating that a moderate amount of irrigation is essential in increasing grain yield of winter wheat production in the north china plain the annual rainfall in the north china plain is unevenly distributed and can only meet part of the crop s water demand li et al 2010 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2022 notably annual irrigation amount did not influence grain yield and the yield components of winter wheat in 2017 2018 possibly because the precipitation during the winter wheat growing season was much higher during this period 133 2 mm than in the other years 55 2 93 0 mm thus reducing the irrigation effect the effects of the irrigation schedule were closely related to inter annual variation of the rainfall input during the crop growth stages zeng et al 2021 in this study compared with i180 additional irrigation 60 mm at the jointing stage i240 notably increased the average grain yield of winter wheat in the successive 4 years fig 9 this is because soil water typically encounters severe drought as revealed by the notable dry zone within 0 60 cm layer occurring after the wheat jointing stage mostly after march and irrigation at this critical stage could meet the rapidly increased water requirement for wheat this is consistent with the findings of zhao et al 2020 who reported that additional irrigation at stem elongation could significantly increase the grain yield of winter wheat compared to one in season irrigation at anthesis however the grain yield did not differ significantly between the i240 and i300 treatments regression analysis further indicated a significant quadratic increasing pattern in winter wheat yield with increasing annual irrigation amount in the successive four years collectively these results indicate that low annual irrigation amounts significantly promote the grain yield of winter wheat compared to high annual irrigation amounts this is possible because the water supply under high annual irrigation amounts exceeded crop water demand and thus exerted adverse or no significant effects on crop yield zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 similarly reported that the grain yield of winter wheat did not increase under low deficit irrigation adequate water supply conditions in wet normal and dry years additionally we observed that the grain components of winter wheat i e spike number per hectare kernels per spike thousand kernel weight increased linearly or quadratically with the increase in annual irrigation amounts in the four year successive study which explains the dynamics of grain yield of winter wheat under increasing annual irrigation amounts the observed increasing tendency in spike number per hectare with annual irrigation times amount in this study especially in 2019 and 2020 is consistent with the finding of foulkes et al 2011 that wheat grain yield enhancement is highly associated with spike number per hectare similarly the results of this study agree with a previous report that thousand kernel weight increased significantly with an increasing number of irrigations for winter wheat grown in north china plain zhang et al 2018 4 2 optimal irrigation scheduling for high crop yield and efficient soil water use the four year study period experienced wet and dry seasons covering inter annual variation in precipitation and thus provides more reliable data than short term studies in the present study in cases where no irrigation was applied during the growing season i0 soil water content at 0 90 cm depth decreased considerably and severe soil drought occurred especially at the 0 60 cm soil layer the red shaded area in fig 6 during the regreening jointing booting flowering and filling stages from february to june the interannual variations in precipitation triggered apparent variations in the soil water content distribution 0 90 cm during the study years however each year the depth of the dry soil layer and the duration of drought shrank gradually with increasing annual irrigation amounts fig 6 this is because high amount of irrigated water infiltrated into the soil with increasing annual irrigation amounts thus enhancing soil water content at 0 60 cm depth similar results were reported previously in winter wheat cultivated in the north china plain li et al 2005 furthermore guo et al 2014 indicated that the soil water content in the 200 cm soil depth increased with increasing irrigation amount fang et al 2018 reported that soil water content along the top 2 m soil profile increased in two irrigation 90 mm at jointing stage and 60 mm at anthesis stage treatments compared to no irrigation and one irrigation 90 mm at jointing stage treatments despite the irrigations applied to winter wheat the upper soil layers about 0 60 cm depth remained dry at the wheat jointing stage after march this is due to the increased plant evapotranspiration with rising air temperature and the rapid growth of winter wheat the dry zone and wet zone were especially obvious for the no irrigation i0 and low amount irrigation treatments i e i60 i120 i180 as a result a water potential gradient existed between the upper dry and deeper wet layers the soil water in the wet soil layers could exude into the upper dry zone during the nights when evapotranspiration decreases through a hydraulic lift effect which could promote water uptake by shallow roots and results in high water use efficiency han et al 2016 li et al 2010 in this study during the four year study period the average sws of the 0 90 cm soil depth increased remarkably with the increase in annual irrigation amounts however the average soil water storage did not differ significantly between the i240 and i300 treatments during the study period possibly due to the increased soil evaporation loss under the excessive annual irrigation amount 300 mm previous studies have shown that rational irrigation can improve crop yield and irrigation water productivity by supplying a limited amount of water at critical crop growth stages oweis et al 2004 li et al 2010 as discussed earlier in this section the grain yield and water consumption of winter wheat increased with the increase in the annual irrigation amount however the annual and the 4 year average grain yield of winter wheat peaked under i240 treatment 7909 1 kg ha 1 and did not increase further when the annual irrigation amount exceeded 240 mm indicating that the additional irrigation amount of 60 mm at the booting stage did not contribute to yield increase but enhanced crop water use and decreased irrigation water use efficiency fig 9 generally recommended irrigation schedules including amounts and timing for winter wheat depend highly on the target yield level li et al 2005 zeng et al 2021 in this study application of irrigation at 240 mm annually was optimal for high grain yield 7909 1 kg ha 1 on average sufficient soil moisture during the growing season an average of 76 8 of field water holding capacity and high irrigation water use efficiency 33 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 on average for winter wheat production in the north china plain this value is comparable with the recommended irrigation amount 225 mm for a similar yield level of winter wheat in the north china plain li et al 2005 zhao et al 2020 however a full life cycle assessment of different irrigation management systems and water saving irrigation technologies e g micro sprinkling irrigation and fertigation should be conducted in the future to achieve high grain yield and efficient water use for winter wheat production in north china plain 5 conclusion the findings of this study indicate that a moderate amount of irrigation can increase spike number per hectare kernels per spike and thousand kernel weight contributing to the increase in grain yield of winter wheat in a semi arid climate increasing irrigation times at different critical growth stages accompanied by increased annual irrigation amount significantly enhanced the soil water content of the 0 90 cm soil layer the main distribution area of wheat roots the dry zone in the 0 60 cm soil layer of winter wheat significantly shrank with increasing irrigation times amount the mean soil water content 0 90 cm during the growing season under four irrigation schedules at the regreening jointing flowering and filling stages represented 61 7 80 8 of the field water holding capacity 0 28 g g 1 on average for 0 90 cm soil layer creating a sufficient and suitable soil water environment for wheat growth during the study period the grain yields of winter wheat increased quadratically with the annual irrigation times amount and peaked under the irrigation amount of 240 mm meanwhile water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency of winter wheat decreased with the annual irrigation times amount due to the increased evapotranspiration and stagnant grain yield therefore we recommend four times irrigation 60 mm each at the regreening jointing flowering and filling stages to maximize grain yield and maintain sustainable and high efficient soil water use for winter wheat production in north china plain the present study will be instructive for optimization of irrigation scheduling for winter wheat to maximize yield and maintain high efficient water use in a semi arid environment

irrigation regimes limited photosynthetic capacity of faba bean by depressing apparent quantum yield and increasing light compensation point yet biochar addition did not it was concluded that biochar produced at high temperatures might not be conducive in improving wue of faba ban ryegrass intercropping instead prd could be a prospective option to offset the adverse effect of biochar on plant under water scarcity conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords alternate partial root zone drying irrigation high temperature biochar intercropping system soil water storage biomass production crop water use efficiency 1 introduction intercropping such as legume based grass system has been proposed as a viable agronomic practice for climate change mitigation and sustainable agriculture construction due to the highly stable productivity compared to mono cropping patterns suter et al 2015 de notaris et al 2021 legumes can meet their own nitrogen n demand by biological fixation nyfeler et al 2011 they also transfer certain amounts of n to an accompanying or subsequent grass thereby increasing the size and the availability of the soil n pool suter et al 2015 ultimately yielding more biomass with less n input dhamala et al 2018 nevertheless the metabolic functioning in the plant soil system will be disrupted with decreasing soil moisture and fertility liu et al 2015 also interspecies competition processes in intercropping systems zhao et al 2019 may further restrict the growth of the legume such as faba bean that already is sensitive to drought stress these adverse effects will undoubtedly be exacerbated by increasing drought and soil fertility degradation caused by global climate change and inappropriate fertilizer application ipcc 2021 singh et al 2019 there is a need to design strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of water and nutrient deficiencies on crop production farhangi abriz et al 2021 deficit irrigation di and alternate partial root zone drying irrigation prd are advanced and effective water saving techniques for enhancing crop water use efficiency wue under water limited conditions kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 deficit irrigation with an amount of water below potential evapotranspiration induces mild drought stress and has a minimal effect on crop yield dodd et al 2009 prd refines di spatio temporarily by exposing one part of the root system to soil water deficit while the other part is sufficiently watered to sustain shoot hydration yang et al 2021 studies have shown that given a similar irrigation volume prd outperforms di in maintaining yield and enhancing wue for many crops such as green bean gencoglan et al 2006 the principal mechanism for improved wue under prd involves root sensing of dry conditions and subsequent signaling to the shoot with abscisic acid aba to trigger partial stomatal closure thereby increasing wue liu et al 2006 2021b wei et al 2018 furthermore the prd induced wetting drying cycles in the soil profile could cause the birch effect birch 1958 wang et al 2017b improving mineralization of nutrients and optimizing elements stoichiometry in plant organs consequently sustaining high carbon assimilation wang et al 2010 liu et al 2021c therefore prd could be a feasible tool for achieving high yielding and water saving agriculture under water limited conditions it however remains unknown how reduced irrigation regimes especially prd impact the crop wue in intercropping system consisting of legume and non legume plants biochar a carbon c rich soil amendment is recognized as a promising instrument for addressing the multifaceted challenges of soil quality deterioration and water scarcity and maintaining crop yield stability in the ever changing environments lehmann and joseph 2009 oladele et al 2019 chen et al 2019 alongside sequestrating soil c meng et al 2019 reducing soil related greenhouse gas emissions borchard et al 2019 and improving soil properties oladele et al 2019 biochar has been also reported to enhance soil water holding capacity and plant available water content ahmed et al 2018 liu et al 2021a due to its high specific surface area and extensive microchannels and more surface hydrophilic functional groups oh and cooh li and tan 2021 these enhancements may directly improve plant growth and yield by optimizing plant water status stomatal conductance and hormonal balance akhtar et al 2015 liu et al 2021a b some legume based studies have reported that biochar could alleviate the drought stress induced adverse effects on wue e g of soybean zhang et al 2020 however neutral and negative effects of biochar on crop growth and wue have also been reported ahmed et al 2018 for instance the application of special biochar may introduce some low molecular weight acids and neutrals into soil with ecotoxic risk to crop growth and physiology joseph et al 2021 particularly biochars prepared at high temperatures 500 wang et al 2017a therefore desired benefits may not be achieved unless detailed knowledge about the interaction between biochar characteristics soil types and plant species is available gul et al 2015 moreover it is not entirely clear how the effects of reduced irrigation regimes methods co vary with biochar amendment on crop yield and wue especially in intercropping system therefore this study aimed to explore the interactive effects of reduced irrigation regimes and biochar prepared at either low or high temperature on growth biomass accumulation and wue of plants in a faba bean ryegrass intercropping system the plants were grown on a sandy loam soil amended with two different biochars and subjected to three irrigation treatments the main hypothesis was that biochar addition enhances the water holding capacity of the sandy soil promoting plants growth and biomass accumulation of the whole intercrops combined with prd that will further improve biomass yield and wue however within the intercropping system the biomass responses to biochar and reduced irrigation might differ due to the competition for resources among different species to evaluate the n use efficiency of the legume grass intercropping systems 15n isotope composition was also measured in all treatments and will be reported in follow up paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a mesocosm pot experiment in the semi field facility of research centre foulum aarhus university denmark n 56 30 e 9 34 was conducted from may to september 2020 cylindrical plastic pots of 10 liter 16 cm inner diameter 50 cm depth were filled with sandy loam soil that was collected from the topsoil 0 25 cm depth and the subsoil 25 50 cm depth in an agricultural field the field capacity and the wilting point of the soil mean value of top and subsoil were 22 and 5 vol respectively and the water retention curve is shown in fig 1a wheat straw biochar wsbc produced by pyrolyzing at a nominal peak temperature of 550 using wheat triticum aestivum l straw and was supplied by the biochar research centre university of edinburgh school of geosciences uk the cleaning residues biochar crbc was obtained from skånefrö ab sweden and produced at 800 from residual products of a seed cleaning facility producing grain and forage turf grass seeds the soils were sieved through a 1 cm mesh and the pelletized biochars were manually ground into a fine powder the basic properties of the soil and the biochar are shown in table 1 prior to filling the pots soil water content swc vol was measured to determine the desired dry weight based ratio and the top and subsoil were mixed thoroughly with biochars at a 1 5 w w ratio in a mechanical mixer the soils with or without biochars were filled into the pots with a bulk density of 1 2 and 1 3 g cm3 for the topsoil and subsoil respectively each with 22 5 cm depth the pots then were irrigated to allow the soil to settle the swc at soil water holding capacity in the pot whc of each soil type was determined using a time domain reflectometer tdr 100 campbell ut usa with 40 cm probes installed in the middle of each soil compartment according to ahmed et al 2018 as shown in fig 1b briefly the filled pots were placed on a surface with moist and loose soil to create hydraulic contact with the soil inside the pots through the holes at the bottom 1 5 mm nylon mesh all pots then were irrigated with water in excess of whc followed by drainage for 72 h while preventing evaporation when swc was measured seeds of faba bean vicia faba l var lynx and ryegrass lolium perenne l var mathilde were pre germinated in april 2020 the faba bean seedlings ca 10 cm height were transplanted into the middle of each pot at bbch growth stages of mono and dicotyledonous plants stage 13 15 weber and bleiholder 1990 i e 3 5 leaves with one plant per pot subsequently ten ryegrass seedlings ca 5 cm height at bbch growth stage 11 p with one leaf were transplanted evenly in each pot as such one faba bean main crop and ten ryegrasses accompanying crop were established in each pot as faba bean ryegrass intercropping system ten days after transplanting mineral fertilizer was supplied into the pots according to the recommendation for faba bean of 800 kg p k ha 1 i e 1 6 g p k per pot nitrogen fertilizer was not applied since most if not all of the faba bean n requirement can be met through biological fixation during the experiment micronutrients were supplied by spraying 2 3 times to alleviate any deficiency a mobile roof system automatically covered the semi field when raining so that soil water content was controlled throughout the season to minimize soil evaporation a 0 5 1 cm layer of quartz sand was applied to cover the surface the meteorological conditions during the experiment period are shown in fig 2 2 2 experimental treatments the pot experiment was arranged in a factorial complete randomized design involving nine treatments with six replicates i e three biochar amendments 0bc control without biochar wsbc and crbc and three irrigation regimes all plants were kept well watered at 95 whc during the first 30 days after transplanting to meet the water requirements of the initial crop growth thereafter the plants were subjected to full fi deficit di and alternate partial root zone drying prd irrigation in the case of fi the plants were irrigated to 95 whc while in di and prd the 70 volume of the water applied in fi was irrigated to either the entire or one side of the soil compartments respectively the prd pots were evenly separated into two vertical sections by plastic sheets before soil filling to avoid water exchange between the two soil compartments in prd one soil compartment was irrigated while the other was allowed to dry to a swc at approximately pf 2 8 according to liu et al 2008 then irrigation switched between both compartments irrigation was applied by a drip system to ensure uniform water supply and avoid leaching losses all pots were watered at the same time with tap water when 30 40 of the plant available water content was consumed by fi plants and the irrigation treatments lasted for 72 days until final harvest of the faba bean plants the swc in the pots was monitored by tdr tdr 100 campbell ut usa and the dynamic changes of swc during the irrigation period are shown in fig 3 2 3 leaf physiological measurements in the intercropped faba bean at 15 20 27 31 38 and 45 days after initiation of the irrigation treatment dat i e during the floral initiation to the pod development stage for faba bean plants the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter fv fm and the relatively chlorophyll content spad value were measured on the functional and fully expanded leaf

a mini pam fluorometer walz germany following jiao et al 2017 and spad value reflecting chlorophyll i e n content was measured with a spad 502 chlorophyll meter hydro japan midday leaf water potential lwp of faba bean was measured on the same fully expanded leaves as spad measuring from 12 00 14 00 h with a pressure chamber soil moisture corp santa barbara ca but only at 20 31 and 45 dat following ahmed et al 2018 leaf hydraulic conductance kl mmol m 2 s 1 mpa 1 was calculated as tr lwp tr is leaf transpiration rate of faba bean that was measured at the same leaves and dates as lwp using a ciras 2 portable photosynthesis system pp system inc ma usa at a leaf cuvette environments of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 photon flux density ppfd and co2 concentrations of 400 ppm the cuvette temperature and humidity were set to match the outside environment and the airflow rate during measurements was 300 μmol m 2 s 1 the mean values of fv fm spad lwp and kl of faba bean across the different measurement dates were used for comparison between treatments in order to reveal integrated treatment effects 2 4 determination of the photosynthetic light response curve of faba bean the photosynthetic light

plants the co2 concentration in the leaf cuvette was 400 ppm and the temperature was set to 25 c during the measuring briefly the leaves were first acclimatized to 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 ppfd until an stabilized and then the ppfd in the cuvette was decreased in twelve steps 1500 1200 1000 800 600 400 300 200 150 100 50 and 20 μmol m 2 s 1 the an for each ppfd was logged after value had stabilized typically after two minutes the a q curves were fitted by non rectangular hyperbola model by marshall and biscoe 1980 with the utility tool light response curve fitting 1 0 available at http landflux

intercropping system at onset of the irrigation treatments three pots from each soil biochar combination 9 in total were harvested to determine the baseline aboveground biomass of the faba bean and the ryegrass after oven drying at 75 c to constant weight at 72 dat when almost all faba bean seeds had reached maturity plant height number of pods and seeds were measured manually hereafter the aboveground organs of faba bean and ryegrass were harvested from all treatments oven dried to constant weight at 75 c and weighed total aboveground biomass of faba bean fdm was calculated as the sum of all aboveground organs dry mass and the dry weight of seeds was considered as seed yield for faba bean fgy whereas the biomass accumulation of ryegrass gdm was all aboveground organs dry mass the total biomass accumulation tdm of the faba bean and ryegrass mixtures was calculated as the sum of fdm and gdm 2 6 plant water consumption and water use efficiency the total amount of water consumed by the crops pwu in the faba bean ryegrass intercropping system during the irrigation treatments was calculated with the water balance method based on the amount of irrigation and changes of swc in the pots crop wue of the total aboveground biomass in the faba bean ryegrass intercropping system during the irrigation period wuef g were calculated using the following formula fernández et al 2020 3 wue f g dm pwu where the δdm is total dry biomass produced by faba bean and ryegrass mixtures during the whole irrigation period pwu is the total amount of water consumed by the crops in the intercropping system during the irrigation period 2 7 data analyses and statistics the data collected on all parameters were checked for normality with shapiro wilks and levene s tests followed by log transformation if needed to obtain variance homogeneity data were then subjected to two way analysis of variance anova to assess the effects of the fixed factors i e biochar bc irrigation irri and their interactions bc irri on the independent variables in addition one way anova and duncan s multiple range test at 5 confidence level were further used when there were significant interactions between independent variables to test for significant differences between treatments the anova analyses were performed in ibm spss statistics ver 23 0 spss inc new york usa all differences between treatments were considered significant when p 0 05 furthermore principal component analysis pca was performed on the measured variables to assess the most relevant treatment effects on crop performance using canoco 5 0 software for ordination microcomputer power ithaca ny usa 3 results 3 1 soil water status compared to no biochar controls crbc significantly increased whc by 15 0 while wsbc had minor effect fig 1b in fi and di swc changed steadily over time and reflected the watering events fig 3a in prd pattern swc depended on wetting drying cycles and was kept ca 20 on the watering side while decreased to a swc corresponding to field capacity pf 2 8 on the drying side figs 1a and 3b the mean swc during the whole irrigation period swcmean was significantly affected by the main treatments as well as their interaction fig 4a where di and particularly prd significantly decreased swcmean by 6 8 and 13 5 respectively compared to fi the application of crbc significantly increased the swcmean within each irrigation treatment relative to the no biochar controls while wsbc did not crbc fi treatment possessed the highest swcmean followed by crbc di and 0 bce prd the lowest fig 4a 3 2 fv fm and spad value of the intercropped faba bean the fv fm and spad value were significantly affected by irrigation fig 4b c being lower under reduced irrigation regimes than fi compared to fi fv fm was significantly decreased by prd only under 0 bce and crbc and di plants had slightly higher fv fm than prd plants fig 4b for spad value there was a significant effect of irrigation under wsbc fig 4c where the fi plants had the highest spad value followed by prd plants and di plants the lowest 3 3 leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance of intercropped faba bean compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes significantly decreased faba bean lwp more negative and prd maintained a relatively higher lwp than di fig 5a biochar marginally increased lwp p 0 064 compared to the non biochar controls especially within the prd compared to fi kl was significantly lowered by 35 5 and 38 0 by di and prd respectively wsbc and especially crbc significantly increased kl by 24 4 and 46 2 respectively compared to the without biochar controls fig 5b moreover compared to the no biochar plants fi and prd plants had higher kl when grown under biochar especially under crbc fig 5b where the crbc fi had the highest kl followed by wsbc fi and 0 bce prd the lowest 3 4 photosynthetic characteristics of intercropped faba bean the a q curves show important photosynthetic characteristics including α asat rdark lcp and θ table 2 and they varied among the treatments fig 6 application of crbc and reduced irrigation tended to decrease α reduced irrigation significantly lowered asat p 0 033 compared to fi yet biochar addition tended to increase it p 0 05 compared to 0 bce and fi biochar and reduced irrigation regimes slightly increased rdark and lcp but decreased θ and the effect was more pronounced under crbc and prd 3 5 plant growth and biomass accumulation compared to the without biochar controls wsbc increased plant height of faba bean while crbc lowered it compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes decreased plant height and prd had lower value than di table 3 the number of pods and seeds of faba bean responded similarly to the treatments as plant height table 3 compared to the without biochar controls crbc slightly reduced fdm and fgy but significantly increased gdm by 16 1 p 0 048 table 3 similarly reduced irrigation regimes decreased fdm and fgy but increased gdm compared to fi within reduced irrigation regimes prd had relatively higher fdm fgy and gdm than di wsbc and particularly crbc overall reduced tdm compared to 0 bce and reduced irrigation also decreased tdm relative to fi but prd plants had higher tdm than di table 3 3 6 crop water consumption and water use efficiency of the intercropping system compared to fi di and particularly prd significantly lowered pwu by 17 and 22 respectively while there was no significant difference in pwu among biochar treatments table 3 compared to the no biochar controls wsbc and especially crbc tended to decrease wuef g compared to fi the reduced irrigation regimes increased wuef g though the differences were not statistically significant table 3 within the reduced irrigation regimes prd overall possessed higher wuef g than di table 3 3 7 pca analysis of plants growth and physiological traits the pca results for the growth variables showed that pc1 explained 58 8 of the variation and pc2 explained 26 7 of the variation fig 7a with mostly positive but weak correlations between many parameters small angles between short vectors the fdm fgy tdm and pwu positively clustered under fi reduced irrigation treatments clustered more for gdm and wuef g for the main photosynthetic parameters derived from the a q curves pc1 and pc2 explained 56 0 and 20 3 of the variation respectively fig 7b correlations were not that evident except between lcp amax and rdark 4 discussion 4 1 plants growth and biomass accumulation as affected by biochar addition the effectiveness of biochar application in agricultural systems is variable and soil biochar plant dependent faloye et al 2019 joseph et al 2021 in this study biochar affected the intercropped faba bean and ryegrass growth differently for instance crbc adversely influenced faba bean as exemplified by the reduced plant height pods and seeds number total aboveground biomass and seed yield table 3 despite improved plant water relations fig 5a b this is contrary to gavili et al 2019 who stated that biochar application at 15 t ha 1 enhanced sole soybean biomass and seed yield in this study the pca plot showed that decreased fdm and fgy under crbc could be attributed to the lowered wuef g rather than pwu fig 7a moreover other potential mechanisms are also involved in the adverse effects of this biochar on plant growth joseph et al 2021 biochar can release salt ions into the soil solution joseph et al 2021 causing osmotic and toxic stresses munns and tester 2008 and nutritional disorders grattan and grieve 1998 eventually leading to a loss of yield also some low molecular weight compounds in biochar can negatively affect cellular development and plant metabolism smith et al 2016 wang et al 2017a the crbc produced at high temperature of 800 formed higher molecular weight pahs 1 0 mg kg 1 compared to wsbc 0 4 mg kg 1 pyrolyzed at 550 table 1 posing an ecotoxicology risk to the soil environment hilber et al 2017 and damaging the faba bean jensen et al 2010 however crbc significantly enhanced the total aboveground biomass of ryegrass table 3 most likely due to a temporary and short term character of a biochar soil interaction until stabilization it is also possible that there exists a trade off in biomass accumulation between two crop species in the intercropping system fig 7a due to the competition for resources such as light water fertilizer etc zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the much larger roots system of perennial rhizomatous ryegrass kørup et al 2018 than faba bean fig a1 can create a more stable environment for ryegrass to extract water and nutrients liu et al 2020 this in turn resulted in depletion of soil water and nutrients in the root zone of intercropped faba bean thereby restricting its growth furthermore the increased gdm under crbc may be attributed to the improvement in soil hydro physical properties faloye et al 2019 liu et al 2021a this was mirrored well in the positive correlation between gdm with swcmean fig 7a compared to the no biochar treatments crbc significantly enhanced whc fig 1b and swc figs 3 and 4a due to the higher specific surface area table 1 faloye et al 2019 liu et al 2021a moreover the higher content of n p and k in crbc table 1 may serve as a direct nutrient source for plants liu et al 2021c especially for plants with abundant root systems however considering the whole intercropping system crbc lowered the tdm in comparison to the no biochar controls table 3 the reduction of tdm under crbc was mainly related to the reduced fdm and fgy fig 7a however wsbc had a negligible effect on the intercropping system table 3 which may be due to its specific characteristics farhangi abriz et al 2021 indeed low temperature biochars can be hydrophobic initially due to the accumulation of aliphatic compounds in pores and on the surface joseph et al 2021 which can inhibit water uptake by biochar particles thereby restricting plants growth in good agreement with this the wsbc had marginal effects on soil hydro physical properties figs 1b and 3 4 2 reduced irrigation regimes effects on plants growth and biomass production drought stress can reduce carbon assimilation capacity by inhibiting biochemical and diffusive components of photosynthesis and other physiological traits wei et al 2018 liu et al 2021a in this study the reduced irrigation regimes di and prd lowered fdm and fgy compared to fi table 3 which is likely related to the changes in plant hydraulic signaling induced by soil water dynamics liu et al 2008 wang et al 2017b as expected di and particularly prd significantly decreased swc figs 1 and 3a and consequently lowered lwp and kl of faba bean fig 5a b the decreases in plant water status under water stress inhibits leaf cell expansion decreases leaf area and leaf turgor liu et al 2006 and hence depresses co2 assimilation thereby resulting in declines in biomass and seed yield of faba bean a legume highly sensitive to drought stress jensen et al 2010 however compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes enhanced gdm table 3 which might be due to ryegrass greater tolerance to soil water deficits kørup et al 2018 studies have reported that perennial grasses are considered as drought tolerant crops and can be used as suitable fodder for biofuels and bioenergy or for biorefining under water scarce environment jones et al 2015 kørup et al 2018 nevertheless the total aboveground biomass of the whole mixtures tdm was decreased under reduced irrigation treatments table 3 as the increased gdm could not offset the reduction of fdm table 3 therefore replacing faba bean with drought tolerant n fixation crops in the intercropping systems including perennial grasses is imperative to obtain more biomass under water limited conditions intriguingly within the reduced irrigation regimes prd produced higher biomass across the intercropping system than di table 3 despite the former having lower soil moisture figs 3 and 4a this effect was more pronounced under biochar addition especially with wsbc table 3 such advantages might be attributed to the better coordination among soil water dynamics and plant physiology wang et al 2017b liu et al 2021a c the recurrent wetting drying cycles in the soil profile under prd could trigger the birch effect birch 1958 that stimulates mineralization of soil organic matter thereby improving n nutrition in photosynthetic components wang et al 2010 liu et al 2021a and ultimately enhanced carbon assimilation rates wei et al 2018 consistent with this here the higher spad value of faba bean under prd than di fig 4c may partially explain the increase in biomass as revealed by their correlation fig 7a moreover the higher biomass under prd could be related to the improved water status within plant liu et al 2006 wei et al 2018 this complies well with higher lwp and kl in prd than di particularly with biochar application fig 5a b the reason behind may be that the prd induced repetitive soil wetting drying cycles generated more robust aba based chemical signaling in the drying roots that effectively triggers partial stomatal closure to minimize water loss and thus maintain a better water status in shoot kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 additionally prd induced rhizosphere processes particularly upon biochar addition could improve root growth strategy to engage the plant in acquisitive strategy for resources thereby optimizing water and nutrient status abrisqueta et al 2008 liu et al 2021c overall prd could be a promising practice to maintain biomass yield in water limited agriculture by regulating soil biochemical cycling and plant physiology and is expected to mitigate the adverse effects of biochar on crop growth 4 3 photosynthetic characteristics of intercropped faba bean as affected by biochar and reduced irrigation regimes photosynthetic characteristics directly determine crop productivity and are regulated by many biotic and abiotic factors wang et al 2021 early studies found the improved photosynthetic capacity of intercropped tall statured crops by altering their light environment gong et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however the impact of agricultural management e g irrigation and fertilization on light dependent processes in intercropping systems remains unclear thus we determined the photosynthetic light response a q curves of faba bean responding to reduced irrigation regimes and biochar addition fig 6 biochar addition reduced the light use efficiency lue of prd plants but increased that of di plants by modifying the position of the a q curves fig 6 which might be associated with the changes in soil moisture status zhang et al 2007 moreover the reduced irrigation treatments significantly decreased asat by slightly lowering α table 2 consistent with han and zhang 2010 the reduction in α reflects the lower capacity of plants to absorb convert and utilize light energy under low light zhang et al 2007 the slightly increased rdark under reduced irrigation regimes table 2 would further exacerbate the consumption of photosynthate zhang et al 2007 thus the reduced photosynthetic characteristics of faba bean grown under reduced irrigations led to the decline in biomass accumulation table 3 and could be supported by the relationship between fdm and fgy with asat by the pca analysis fig 7 indeed the reduction of light use mediated the decline in asat under reduced irrigation treatments aligns well with the lowered fv fm figs 4b and 7 rashid et al 2018 however asat remained unrestricted with biochar addition despite a slightly lowered α and an increased lcp compared to the no biochar controls table 2 signifying that the photosynthetic capacity was not limited by light use it is possible that the calvin cycle may be the dominant contributor to the present case as exemplified by the changes in spad under biochar addition fig 4c in agreement with rashid et al 2018 4 4 crop water use efficiency in the faba bean ryegrass intercropping system in this study and across all irrigation treatments wsbc and particularly crbc tended to decrease wuef g compared to the non biochar controls table 3 despite increased whc and swc figs 1b and 4a as also observed by liu et al 2021a presumably crbc was more hydrophilic due to its higher surface area and polar bonding with the functional groups at the surfaces table 1 lowering the availability of water stored in the biochar pores due to the more negative water potential cha et al 2016 additionally drought sensitive faba bean plants in intercropping system might have encountered abiotic stresses due to biochar related increase in salt and low molecular weight organic compounds tanure et al 2019 mannan et al 2021 this was partly confirmed by the higher ec and pahs within crbc in this study table 1 the pca plot showed that the decreased wuef g under biochar could be directly attributed to the lowered tdm fig 7a since pwu remained almost unchanged table 3 these results suggest that freshly prepared biochar at high temperature might not be effective in improving crop water use efficiency when applied to a sandy soil in faba bean ryegrass intercropping system as in other studies kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 wei et al 2018 yang et al 2021 we found that reduced irrigation regimes di and prd significantly enhanced wuef g compared to fi table 3 which could be attributed to the significantly decreased pwu table 3 when plants are exposed to soil water deficits aba chemical signaling is synthesized in the roots and exported to leaves through xylem triggering partial stomatal closure and curtailing transpirational water loss liu et al 2006 2021b the significantly lowered lwp and kl under reduced irrigation fig 5a b would suggest that hydraulic regulation on pwu also exist since pwu was closely associated with lwp and kl by the pca analysis fig 7a most interestingly prd had higher wuef g than di table 3 despite both treatments supplying a similar irrigation water volume prd plants consumed relatively less water table 3 similar findings have also been reported in other crops e g liu et al 2006 wei et al 2018 such advantages of the prd could due to prd induced physiological responses in plants such as stronger and more endogenous aba kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 2021b and optimized stomatal morphology liu et al 2021b thereby maintaining better water status in plant this complies well with a higher lwp in prd treatments than di figs 4b and 5a overall in considering water conservation reduced irrigation particularly prd could be a prospective option to offset the negative effects of biochar on wue under water scarce conditions fig 8 5 conclusions this study investigated growth physiology crop water use efficiency in faba bean ryegrass intercropping system on a sandy loam soil amended with different biochar under reduced irrigation regimes application of crbc negatively affected the growth and biomass parameters and seed yield of the faba bean despite improved soil water status and plant water relations whereas total aboveground biomass of ryegrass increased yet with overall decline in total aboveground biomass of the intercropping system interestingly compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes especially prd significantly increased crop wue of the intercropping system despite decreased biomass for biochar prepared at high temperatures adverse effects due to toxicity related to low molecular weight compounds should be considered e g by mixing and resting the biochar with the soil for certain time prior planting further research should unearth the full agricultural benefits of biochar especially for high temperature in faba bean ryegrass intercropping system for achieving a win win goal of increasing yield and saving water by joint application of reduced irrigation especially prd

9296,intercropping is advantageous for optimizing crop productivity and resources utilization efficiency compared to monocultures yet the effects of water fertilizer management on crop growth and water use efficiency wue in intercropping systems composed of legumes and non legumes remain largely elusive biochar as a soil amendment could increase soil water storage and crop yield but its interaction with soil water deficit and response of wue are ambiguous we investigated the growth biomass and wue in faba bean ryegrass intercropping system amended with 550 pyrolyzed wheat straw wsbc and 800 pyrolyzed cleaning residues biochar crbc under different irrigation treatments compared to the no biochar controls crbc decreased aboveground biomass fdm and seed yield fgy of intercropped faba bean despite improved soil water holding capacity leaf water potential lwp and leaf hydraulic conductance kl of faba bean in contrast crbc significantly increased ryegrass aboveground biomass gdm although reduced the total aboveground biomass tdm and wue wuef g of faba bean ryegrass mixtures these effects were not evident under wsbc compared to full irrigation deficit di and partial root zone drying prd irrigation enhanced gdm and wuef g but lowered lwp and kl fdm and fgy and pwu plant water consumption and tdm despite lower maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii prd outperformed di in improving biomass and wue the principal component analysis showed that pwu rather than biomass contributed significantly to the enhanced wuef g under di and particularly prd moreover reduced irrigation regimes limited photosynthetic capacity of faba bean by depressing apparent quantum yield and increasing light compensation point yet biochar addition did not it was concluded that biochar produced at high temperatures might not be conducive in improving wue of faba ban ryegrass intercropping instead prd could be a prospective option to offset the adverse effect of biochar on plant under water scarcity conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords alternate partial root zone drying irrigation high temperature biochar intercropping system soil water storage biomass production crop water use efficiency 1 introduction intercropping such as legume based grass system has been proposed as a viable agronomic practice for climate change mitigation and sustainable agriculture construction due to the highly stable productivity compared to mono cropping patterns suter et al 2015 de notaris et al 2021 legumes can meet their own nitrogen n demand by biological fixation nyfeler et al 2011 they also transfer certain amounts of n to an accompanying or subsequent grass thereby increasing the size and the availability of the soil n pool suter et al 2015 ultimately yielding more biomass with less n input dhamala et al 2018 nevertheless the metabolic functioning in the plant soil system will be disrupted with decreasing soil moisture and fertility liu et al 2015 also interspecies competition processes in intercropping systems zhao et al 2019 may further restrict the growth of the legume such as faba bean that already is sensitive to drought stress these adverse effects will undoubtedly be exacerbated by increasing drought and soil fertility degradation caused by global climate change and inappropriate fertilizer application ipcc 2021 singh et al 2019 there is a need to design strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of water and nutrient deficiencies on crop production farhangi abriz et al 2021 deficit irrigation di and alternate partial root zone drying irrigation prd are advanced and effective water saving techniques for enhancing crop water use efficiency wue under water limited conditions kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 deficit irrigation with an amount of water below potential evapotranspiration induces mild drought stress and has a minimal effect on crop yield dodd et al 2009 prd refines di spatio temporarily by exposing one part of the root system to soil water deficit while the other part is sufficiently watered to sustain shoot hydration yang et al 2021 studies have shown that given a similar irrigation volume prd outperforms di in maintaining yield and enhancing wue for many crops such as green bean gencoglan et al 2006 the principal mechanism for improved wue under prd involves root sensing of dry conditions and subsequent signaling to the shoot with abscisic acid aba to trigger partial stomatal closure thereby increasing wue liu et al 2006 2021b wei et al 2018 furthermore the prd induced wetting drying cycles in the soil profile could cause the birch effect birch 1958 wang et al 2017b improving mineralization of nutrients and optimizing elements stoichiometry in plant organs consequently sustaining high carbon assimilation wang et al 2010 liu et al 2021c therefore prd could be a feasible tool for achieving high yielding and water saving agriculture under water limited conditions it however remains unknown how reduced irrigation regimes especially prd impact the crop wue in intercropping system consisting of legume and non legume plants biochar a carbon c rich soil amendment is recognized as a promising instrument for addressing the multifaceted challenges of soil quality deterioration and water scarcity and maintaining crop yield stability in the ever changing environments lehmann and joseph 2009 oladele et al 2019 chen et al 2019 alongside sequestrating soil c meng et al 2019 reducing soil related greenhouse gas emissions borchard et al 2019 and improving soil properties oladele et al 2019 biochar has been also reported to enhance soil water holding capacity and plant available water content ahmed et al 2018 liu et al 2021a due to its high specific surface area and extensive microchannels and more surface hydrophilic functional groups oh and cooh li and tan 2021 these enhancements may directly improve plant growth and yield by optimizing plant water status stomatal conductance and hormonal balance akhtar et al 2015 liu et al 2021a b some legume based studies have reported that biochar could alleviate the drought stress induced adverse effects on wue e g of soybean zhang et al 2020 however neutral and negative effects of biochar on crop growth and wue have also been reported ahmed et al 2018 for instance the application of special biochar may introduce some low molecular weight acids and neutrals into soil with ecotoxic risk to crop growth and physiology joseph et al 2021 particularly biochars prepared at high temperatures 500 wang et al 2017a therefore desired benefits may not be achieved unless detailed knowledge about the interaction between biochar characteristics soil types and plant species is available gul et al 2015 moreover it is not entirely clear how the effects of reduced irrigation regimes methods co vary with biochar amendment on crop yield and wue especially in intercropping system therefore this study aimed to explore the interactive effects of reduced irrigation regimes and biochar prepared at either low or high temperature on growth biomass accumulation and wue of plants in a faba bean ryegrass intercropping system the plants were grown on a sandy loam soil amended with two different biochars and subjected to three irrigation treatments the main hypothesis was that biochar addition enhances the water holding capacity of the sandy soil promoting plants growth and biomass accumulation of the whole intercrops combined with prd that will further improve biomass yield and wue however within the intercropping system the biomass responses to biochar and reduced irrigation might differ due to the competition for resources among different species to evaluate the n use efficiency of the legume grass intercropping systems 15n isotope composition was also measured in all treatments and will be reported in follow up paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a mesocosm pot experiment in the semi field facility of research centre foulum aarhus university denmark n 56 30 e 9 34 was conducted from may to september 2020 cylindrical plastic pots of 10 liter 16 cm inner diameter 50 cm depth were filled with sandy loam soil that was collected from the topsoil 0 25 cm depth and the subsoil 25 50 cm depth in an agricultural field the field capacity and the wilting point of the soil mean value of top and subsoil were 22 and 5 vol respectively and the water retention curve is shown in fig 1a wheat straw biochar wsbc produced by pyrolyzing at a nominal peak temperature of 550 using wheat triticum aestivum l straw and was supplied by the biochar research centre university of edinburgh school of geosciences uk the cleaning residues biochar crbc was obtained from skånefrö ab sweden and produced at 800 from residual products of a seed cleaning facility producing grain and forage turf grass seeds the soils were sieved through a 1 cm mesh and the pelletized biochars were manually ground into a fine powder the basic properties of the soil and the biochar are shown in table 1 prior to filling the pots soil water content swc vol was measured to determine the desired dry weight based ratio and the top and subsoil were mixed thoroughly with biochars at a 1 5 w w ratio in a mechanical mixer the soils with or without biochars were filled into the pots with a bulk density of 1 2 and 1 3 g cm3 for the topsoil and subsoil respectively each with 22 5 cm depth the pots then were irrigated to allow the soil to settle the swc at soil water holding capacity in the pot whc of each soil type was determined using a time domain reflectometer tdr 100 campbell ut usa with 40 cm probes installed in the middle of each soil compartment according to ahmed et al 2018 as shown in fig 1b briefly the filled pots were placed on a surface with moist and loose soil to create hydraulic contact with the soil inside the pots through the holes at the bottom 1 5 mm nylon mesh all pots then were irrigated with water in excess of whc followed by drainage for 72 h while preventing evaporation when swc was measured seeds of faba bean vicia faba l var lynx and ryegrass lolium perenne l var mathilde were pre germinated in april 2020 the faba bean seedlings ca 10 cm height were transplanted into the middle of each pot at bbch growth stages of mono and dicotyledonous plants stage 13 15 weber and bleiholder 1990 i e 3 5 leaves with one plant per pot subsequently ten ryegrass seedlings ca 5 cm height at bbch growth stage 11 p with one leaf were transplanted evenly in each pot as such one faba bean main crop and ten ryegrasses accompanying crop were established in each pot as faba bean ryegrass intercropping system ten days after transplanting mineral fertilizer was supplied into the pots according to the recommendation for faba bean of 800 kg p k ha 1 i e 1 6 g p k per pot nitrogen fertilizer was not applied since most if not all of the faba bean n requirement can be met through biological fixation during the experiment micronutrients were supplied by spraying 2 3 times to alleviate any deficiency a mobile roof system automatically covered the semi field when raining so that soil water content was controlled throughout the season to minimize soil evaporation a 0 5 1 cm layer of quartz sand was applied to cover the surface the meteorological conditions during the experiment period are shown in fig 2 2 2 experimental treatments the pot experiment was arranged in a factorial complete randomized design involving nine treatments with six replicates i e three biochar amendments 0bc control without biochar wsbc and crbc and three irrigation regimes all plants were kept well watered at 95 whc during the first 30 days after transplanting to meet the water requirements of the initial crop growth thereafter the plants were subjected to full fi deficit di and alternate partial root zone drying prd irrigation in the case of fi the plants were irrigated to 95 whc while in di and prd the 70 volume of the water applied in fi was irrigated to either the entire or one side of the soil compartments respectively the prd pots were evenly separated into two vertical sections by plastic sheets before soil filling to avoid water exchange between the two soil compartments in prd one soil compartment was irrigated while the other was allowed to dry to a swc at approximately pf 2 8 according to liu et al 2008 then irrigation switched between both compartments irrigation was applied by a drip system to ensure uniform water supply and avoid leaching losses all pots were watered at the same time with tap water when 30 40 of the plant available water content was consumed by fi plants and the irrigation treatments lasted for 72 days until final harvest of the faba bean plants the swc in the pots was monitored by tdr tdr 100 campbell ut usa and the dynamic changes of swc during the irrigation period are shown in fig 3 2 3 leaf physiological measurements in the intercropped faba bean at 15 20 27 31 38 and 45 days after initiation of the irrigation treatment dat i e during the floral initiation to the pod development stage for faba bean plants the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter fv fm and the relatively chlorophyll content spad value were measured on the functional and fully expanded leaf

a mini pam fluorometer walz germany following jiao et al 2017 and spad value reflecting chlorophyll i e n content was measured with a spad 502 chlorophyll meter hydro japan midday leaf water potential lwp of faba bean was measured on the same fully expanded leaves as spad measuring from 12 00 14 00 h with a pressure chamber soil moisture corp santa barbara ca but only at 20 31 and 45 dat following ahmed et al 2018 leaf hydraulic conductance kl mmol m 2 s 1 mpa 1 was calculated as tr lwp tr is leaf transpiration rate of faba bean that was measured at the same leaves and dates as lwp using a

humidity were set to match the outside environment and the airflow rate during measurements was 300 μmol m 2 s 1 the mean values of fv fm spad lwp and kl of faba bean across the different measurement dates were used for comparison between treatments in order to reveal integrated treatment effects 2 4 determination of the photosynthetic light response curve of faba bean the photosynthetic light

plants the co2 concentration in the leaf cuvette was 400 ppm and the temperature was set to 25 c during the measuring briefly the leaves were first acclimatized to 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 ppfd until an stabilized and then the ppfd in the cuvette was decreased in twelve steps 1500 1200 1000 800 600 400 300 200 150 100 50 and 20 μmol m 2 s 1 the an for each ppfd was logged after value had stabilized typically after two minutes the a q curves were fitted by non rectangular hyperbola model by marshall and biscoe 1980 with the utility tool light response curve fitting 1 0 available at http landflux

intercropping system at onset of the irrigation treatments three pots from each soil biochar combination 9 in total were harvested to determine the baseline aboveground biomass of the faba bean and the ryegrass after oven drying at 75 c to constant weight at 72 dat when almost all faba bean seeds had reached maturity plant height number of pods and seeds were measured manually hereafter the aboveground organs of faba bean and ryegrass were harvested from all treatments oven dried to constant weight at 75 c and weighed total aboveground biomass of faba bean fdm was calculated as the sum of all aboveground organs dry mass and the dry weight of seeds was considered as seed yield for faba bean fgy whereas the biomass accumulation of ryegrass gdm was all aboveground organs dry mass the total biomass accumulation tdm of the faba bean and ryegrass mixtures was calculated as the sum of fdm and gdm 2 6 plant water consumption and water use efficiency the total amount of water consumed by the crops pwu in the faba bean ryegrass intercropping system during the irrigation treatments was calculated with the water balance method based on the amount of irrigation and changes of swc in the pots crop wue of the total aboveground biomass in the faba bean ryegrass intercropping system during the irrigation period wuef g were calculated using the following formula fernández et al 2020 3 wue f g dm pwu where the δdm is total dry biomass produced by faba bean and ryegrass mixtures during the whole irrigation period pwu is the total amount of water consumed by the crops in the intercropping system during the irrigation period 2 7 data analyses and statistics the data collected on all parameters were checked for normality with shapiro wilks and levene s tests followed by log transformation if needed to obtain variance homogeneity data were then subjected to two way analysis of variance anova to assess the effects of the fixed factors i e biochar bc irrigation irri and their interactions bc irri on the independent variables in addition one way anova and duncan s multiple range test at 5 confidence level were further used when there were significant interactions between independent variables to test for significant differences between treatments the anova analyses were performed in ibm spss statistics ver 23 0 spss inc new york usa all differences between treatments were considered significant when p 0 05 furthermore principal component analysis pca was performed on the measured variables to assess the most relevant treatment effects on crop performance using canoco 5 0 software for ordination microcomputer power ithaca ny usa 3 results 3 1 soil water status compared to no biochar controls crbc significantly increased whc by 15 0 while wsbc had minor effect fig 1b in fi and di swc changed steadily over time and reflected the watering events fig 3a in prd pattern swc depended on wetting drying cycles and was kept ca 20 on the watering side while decreased to a swc corresponding to field capacity pf 2 8 on the drying side figs 1a and 3b the mean swc during the whole irrigation period swcmean was significantly affected by the main treatments as well as their interaction fig 4a where di and particularly prd significantly decreased swcmean by 6 8 and 13 5 respectively compared to fi the application of crbc significantly increased the swcmean within each irrigation treatment relative to the no biochar controls while wsbc did not crbc fi treatment possessed the highest swcmean followed by crbc di and 0 bce prd the lowest fig 4a 3 2 fv fm and spad value of the intercropped faba bean the fv fm and spad value were significantly affected by irrigation fig 4b c being lower under reduced irrigation regimes than fi compared to fi fv fm was significantly decreased by prd only under 0 bce and crbc and di plants had slightly higher fv fm than prd plants fig 4b for spad value there was a significant effect of irrigation under wsbc fig 4c where the fi plants had the highest spad value followed by prd plants and di plants the lowest 3 3 leaf water potential and leaf hydraulic conductance of intercropped faba bean compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes significantly decreased faba bean lwp more negative and prd maintained a relatively higher lwp than di fig 5a biochar marginally increased lwp p 0 064 compared to the non biochar controls especially within the prd compared to fi kl was significantly lowered by 35 5 and 38 0 by di and prd respectively wsbc and especially crbc significantly increased kl by 24 4 and 46 2 respectively compared to the without biochar controls fig 5b moreover compared to the no biochar plants fi and prd plants had higher kl when grown under biochar especially under crbc fig 5b where the crbc fi had the highest kl followed by wsbc fi and 0 bce prd the lowest 3 4 photosynthetic characteristics of intercropped faba bean the a q curves show important photosynthetic characteristics including α asat rdark lcp and θ table 2 and they varied among the treatments fig 6 application of crbc and reduced irrigation tended to decrease α reduced irrigation significantly lowered asat p 0 033 compared to fi yet biochar addition tended to increase it p 0 05 compared to 0 bce and fi biochar and reduced irrigation regimes slightly increased rdark and lcp but decreased θ and the effect was more pronounced under crbc and prd 3 5 plant growth and biomass accumulation compared to the without biochar controls wsbc increased plant height of faba bean while crbc lowered it compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes decreased plant height and prd had lower value than di table 3 the number of pods and seeds of faba bean responded similarly to the treatments as plant height table 3 compared to the without biochar controls crbc slightly reduced fdm and fgy but significantly increased gdm by 16 1 p 0 048 table 3 similarly reduced irrigation regimes decreased fdm and fgy but increased gdm compared to fi within reduced irrigation regimes prd had relatively higher fdm fgy and gdm than di wsbc and particularly crbc overall reduced tdm compared to 0 bce and reduced irrigation also decreased tdm relative to fi but prd plants had higher tdm than di table 3 3 6 crop water consumption and water use efficiency of the intercropping system compared to fi di and particularly prd significantly lowered pwu by 17 and 22 respectively while there was no significant difference in pwu among biochar treatments table 3 compared to the no biochar controls wsbc and especially crbc tended to decrease wuef g compared to fi the reduced irrigation regimes increased wuef g though the differences were not statistically significant table 3 within the reduced irrigation regimes prd overall possessed higher wuef g than di table 3 3 7 pca analysis of plants growth and physiological traits the pca results for the growth variables showed that pc1 explained 58 8 of the variation and pc2 explained 26 7 of the variation fig 7a with mostly positive but weak correlations between many parameters small angles between short vectors the fdm fgy tdm and pwu positively clustered under fi reduced irrigation treatments clustered more for gdm and wuef g for the main photosynthetic parameters derived from the a q curves pc1 and pc2 explained 56 0 and 20 3 of the variation respectively fig 7b correlations were not that evident except between lcp amax and rdark 4 discussion 4 1 plants growth and biomass accumulation as affected by biochar addition the effectiveness of biochar application in agricultural systems is variable and soil biochar plant dependent faloye et al 2019 joseph et al 2021 in this study biochar affected the intercropped faba bean and ryegrass growth differently for instance crbc adversely influenced faba bean as exemplified by the reduced plant height pods and seeds number total aboveground biomass and seed yield table 3 despite improved plant water relations fig 5a b this is contrary to gavili et al 2019 who stated that biochar application at 15 t ha 1 enhanced sole soybean biomass and seed yield in this study the pca plot showed that decreased fdm and fgy under crbc could be attributed to the lowered wuef g rather than pwu fig 7a moreover other potential mechanisms are also involved in the adverse effects of this biochar on plant growth joseph et al 2021 biochar can release salt ions into the soil solution joseph et al 2021 causing osmotic and toxic stresses munns and tester 2008 and nutritional disorders grattan and grieve 1998 eventually leading to a loss of yield also some low molecular weight compounds in biochar can negatively affect cellular development and plant metabolism smith et al 2016 wang et al 2017a the crbc produced at high temperature of 800 formed higher molecular weight pahs 1 0 mg kg 1 compared to wsbc 0 4 mg kg 1 pyrolyzed at 550 table 1 posing an ecotoxicology risk to the soil environment hilber et al 2017 and damaging the faba bean jensen et al 2010 however crbc significantly enhanced the total aboveground biomass of ryegrass table 3 most likely due to a temporary and short term character of a biochar soil interaction until stabilization it is also possible that there exists a trade off in biomass accumulation between two crop species in the intercropping system fig 7a due to the competition for resources such as light water fertilizer etc zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the much larger roots system of perennial rhizomatous ryegrass kørup et al 2018 than faba bean fig a1 can create a more stable environment for ryegrass to extract water and nutrients liu et al 2020 this in turn resulted in depletion of soil water and nutrients in the root zone of intercropped faba bean thereby restricting its growth furthermore the increased gdm under crbc may be attributed to the improvement in soil hydro physical properties faloye et al 2019 liu et al 2021a this was mirrored well in the positive correlation between gdm with swcmean fig 7a compared to the no biochar treatments crbc significantly enhanced whc fig 1b and swc figs 3 and 4a due to the higher specific surface area table 1 faloye et al 2019 liu et al 2021a moreover the higher content of n p and k in crbc table 1 may serve as a direct nutrient source for plants liu et al 2021c especially for plants with abundant root systems however considering the whole intercropping system crbc lowered the tdm in comparison to the no biochar controls table 3 the reduction of tdm under crbc was mainly related to the reduced fdm and fgy fig 7a however wsbc had a negligible effect on the intercropping system table 3 which may be due to its specific characteristics farhangi abriz et al 2021 indeed low temperature biochars can be hydrophobic initially due to the accumulation of aliphatic compounds in pores and on the surface joseph et al 2021 which can inhibit water uptake by biochar particles thereby restricting plants growth in good agreement with this the wsbc had marginal effects on soil hydro physical properties figs 1b and 3 4 2 reduced irrigation regimes effects on plants growth and biomass production drought stress can reduce carbon assimilation capacity by inhibiting biochemical and diffusive components of photosynthesis and other physiological traits wei et al 2018 liu et al 2021a in this study the reduced irrigation regimes di and prd lowered fdm and fgy compared to fi table 3 which is likely related to the changes in plant hydraulic signaling induced by soil water dynamics liu et al 2008 wang et al 2017b as expected di and particularly prd significantly decreased swc figs 1 and 3a and consequently lowered lwp and kl of faba bean fig 5a b the decreases in plant water status under water stress inhibits leaf cell expansion decreases leaf area and leaf turgor liu et al 2006 and hence depresses co2 assimilation thereby resulting in declines in biomass and seed yield of faba bean a legume highly sensitive to drought stress jensen et al 2010 however compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes enhanced gdm table 3 which might be due to ryegrass greater tolerance to soil water deficits kørup et al 2018 studies have reported that perennial grasses are considered as drought tolerant crops and can be used as suitable fodder for biofuels and bioenergy or for biorefining under water scarce environment jones et al 2015 kørup et al 2018 nevertheless the total aboveground biomass of the whole mixtures tdm was decreased under reduced irrigation treatments table 3 as the increased gdm could not offset the reduction of fdm table 3 therefore replacing faba bean with drought tolerant n fixation crops in the intercropping systems including perennial grasses is imperative to obtain more biomass under water limited conditions intriguingly within the reduced irrigation regimes prd produced higher biomass across the intercropping system than di table 3 despite the former having lower soil moisture figs 3 and 4a this effect was more pronounced under biochar addition especially with wsbc table 3 such advantages might be attributed to the better coordination among soil water dynamics and plant physiology wang et al 2017b liu et al 2021a c the recurrent wetting drying cycles in the soil profile under prd could trigger the birch effect birch 1958 that stimulates mineralization of soil organic matter thereby improving n nutrition in photosynthetic components wang et al 2010 liu et al 2021a and ultimately enhanced carbon assimilation rates wei et al 2018 consistent with this here the higher spad value of faba bean under prd than di fig 4c may partially explain the increase in biomass as revealed by their correlation fig 7a moreover the higher biomass under prd could be related to the improved water status within plant liu et al 2006 wei et al 2018 this complies well with higher lwp and kl in prd than di particularly with biochar application fig 5a b the reason behind may be that the prd induced repetitive soil wetting drying cycles generated more robust aba based chemical signaling in the drying roots that effectively triggers partial stomatal closure to minimize water loss and thus maintain a better water status in shoot kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 additionally prd induced rhizosphere processes particularly upon biochar addition could improve root growth strategy to engage the plant in acquisitive strategy for resources thereby optimizing water and nutrient status abrisqueta et al 2008 liu et al 2021c overall prd could be a promising practice to maintain biomass yield in water limited agriculture by regulating soil biochemical cycling and plant physiology and is expected to mitigate the adverse effects of biochar on crop growth 4 3 photosynthetic characteristics of intercropped faba bean as affected by biochar and reduced irrigation regimes photosynthetic characteristics directly determine crop productivity and are regulated by many biotic and abiotic factors wang et al 2021 early studies found the improved photosynthetic capacity of intercropped tall statured crops by altering their light environment gong et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however the impact of agricultural management e g irrigation and fertilization on light dependent processes in intercropping systems remains unclear thus we determined the photosynthetic light response a q curves of faba bean responding to reduced irrigation regimes and biochar addition fig 6 biochar addition reduced the light use efficiency lue of prd plants but increased that of di plants by modifying the position of the a q curves fig 6 which might be associated with the changes in soil moisture status zhang et al 2007 moreover the reduced irrigation treatments significantly decreased asat by slightly lowering α table 2 consistent with han and zhang 2010 the reduction in α reflects the lower capacity of plants to absorb convert and utilize light energy under low light zhang et al 2007 the slightly increased rdark under reduced irrigation regimes table 2 would further exacerbate the consumption of photosynthate zhang et al 2007 thus the reduced photosynthetic characteristics of faba bean grown under reduced irrigations led to the decline in biomass accumulation table 3 and could be supported by the relationship between fdm and fgy with asat by the pca analysis fig 7 indeed the reduction of light use mediated the decline in asat under reduced irrigation treatments aligns well with the lowered fv fm figs 4b and 7 rashid et al 2018 however asat remained unrestricted with biochar addition despite a slightly lowered α and an increased lcp compared to the no biochar controls table 2 signifying that the photosynthetic capacity was not limited by light use it is possible that the calvin cycle may be the dominant contributor to the present case as exemplified by the changes in spad under biochar addition fig 4c in agreement with rashid et al 2018 4 4 crop water use efficiency in the faba bean ryegrass intercropping system in this study and across all irrigation treatments wsbc and particularly crbc tended to decrease wuef g compared to the non biochar controls table 3 despite increased whc and swc figs 1b and 4a as also observed by liu et al 2021a presumably crbc was more hydrophilic due to its higher surface area and polar bonding with the functional groups at the surfaces table 1 lowering the availability of water stored in the biochar pores due to the more negative water potential cha et al 2016 additionally drought sensitive faba bean plants in intercropping system might have encountered abiotic stresses due to biochar related increase in salt and low molecular weight organic compounds tanure et al 2019 mannan et al 2021 this was partly confirmed by the higher ec and pahs within crbc in this study table 1 the pca plot showed that the decreased wuef g under biochar could be directly attributed to the lowered tdm fig 7a since pwu remained almost unchanged table 3 these results suggest that freshly prepared biochar at high temperature might not be effective in improving crop water use efficiency when applied to a sandy soil in faba bean ryegrass intercropping system as in other studies kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 wei et al 2018 yang et al 2021 we found that reduced irrigation regimes di and prd significantly enhanced wuef g compared to fi table 3 which could be attributed to the significantly decreased pwu table 3 when plants are exposed to soil water deficits aba chemical signaling is synthesized in the roots and exported to leaves through xylem triggering partial stomatal closure and curtailing transpirational water loss liu et al 2006 2021b the significantly lowered lwp and kl under reduced irrigation fig 5a b would suggest that hydraulic regulation on pwu also exist since pwu was closely associated with lwp and kl by the pca analysis fig 7a

reduced irrigation regimes application of crbc negatively affected the growth and biomass parameters and seed yield of the faba bean despite improved soil water status and plant water relations whereas total aboveground biomass of ryegrass increased yet with overall decline in total aboveground biomass of the intercropping system interestingly compared to fi reduced irrigation regimes especially prd significantly increased crop wue of the intercropping system despite decreased biomass for biochar prepared at high temperatures adverse effects due to toxicity related to low molecular weight compounds should be considered e g by mixing and resting the biochar with the soil for certain time prior planting further research should unearth the full agricultural benefits of biochar

9297,grass pea is one of the oldest native crops grown in vast geographical regions of iran however little is known about its tolerance to water shortage during post flowering period we conducted field experiments in 2018 and 2019 to study the effects of terminal drought on growth yield and some physiological characteristics of grass pea lathyrus sativus l ecotypes nine local grass pea ecotypes baft 1 baft 2 bardsir dehbakri kuhbanan rabor sirjan shiraz and torbat heydarieh collected from different climatic regions in the east southeast and south of iran were exposed to either normal irrigation or terminal drought water withholding after flowering normal irrigation was applied after 60 mm water evaporation from class a evaporation pan for the whole growing season terminal drought decreased seed and biological yields relative to normal irrigation with baft 2 and rabor the superior ecotypes in both treatments among yield traits pod number per plant had very high correlation with seed and biological yields in either irrigation regime and was the highest in high yielding ecotypes leaf surface area relative water content rwc and starch content decreased while soluble sugars and proline content increased by terminal drought the highest yielding ecotypes baft 2 and rabor had not the highest leaf area and rwc though they had the highest starch content under normal and sugars content under terminal drought also they had the greatest water use efficiency in both years and watering regimes proline content rwc and sugar contents did not significantly correlate with seed or biological yield under terminal drought our results suggest that drought tolerance in grass pea is closely associated with better utilization of water and plant photosynthetic capacity as reflected in high starch accumulation and conversion to sugars perhaps as an osmotic adjustment factor also high yielding ecotypes allocated higher dry matter to reproductive tissues

grass pea lathyrus sativus l is an annual plant belonging to the family fabaceae and tribe vicieae this plant has favorable characteristics including very high nutritional value solovyeva et al 2020 nitrogen fixation ability lambein et al 2019 tolerance to temperature extremes dixit et al 2016 and moderate water logging solaiman et al 2007 and poor soil fertility kumar et al 2021 grass pea with its high seed protein content 20 32 is used for human consumption while the straw is used as an animal feed grela et al 2010 and bio ethanol tesfaw et al 2021 grass pea offers an alternative to other high protein legumes such as peas and beans that require better growing conditions piwowarczyk et al 2017 when plowed into the soil grass pea is an excellent green manure that produces great amounts of biomass and returns considerable amounts of nitrogen to the soil jeromela et al 2017 compared to other legumes grass pea has some morphological and physiological drought tolerance traits including narrow leaves stems with winged margins deep and extensive root system lambein et al 2019 and high water use efficiency biederbeck and bouman 1994 siddique et al 2001 these characteristics enable the plant to extract substantial amounts of water from various soils and tolerate terminal drought calderón et al 2012 over all grass pea may be considered as an important plant species in dryland systems calderón et al 2012 despite these favorable xerophytic characteristics water shortage especially during post flowering period can significantly reduce grass pea growth and seed yield gusmao et al 2012 kong et al 2015 however our knowledge about physiological mechanisms involving in grass pea drought tolerance is limited some morphological and physiological alterations including reduced leaf area bangar et al 2019 maintaining higher water content anyia and herzog 2004 accumulation of osmotic adjustment metabolites like soluble sugar and proline talukdar 2013 nadeem et al 2019 prathap et al 2019 tokarz et al 2020 in response to water limitation have been reported in different plant species since considerable genetic variation exists both between and within plant species in mechanisms of water stress tolerance obata et al 2015 relevance of such these responses and their association with growth and yield parameters have not been well investigated for example higher proline content was weekly associated with agronomic traits in wheat mwadzingeni et al 2016 also transgenic chickpea cicer arietinum lines with over expression of proline gene did not exhibit higher shoot biomass mathur et al 2009 although grass pea has a long history of cultivation and widespread growth across regions and climates in iran no study regarding the extent of drought tolerance among native accessions has been done so far this research aimed to evaluate the effects of terminal drought on variation in growth and yield of some local grass pea ecotypes and to explore possible association between major physiological and agronomic traits 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth condition and treatments two split plot experiments using a randomized complete block design with two factors irrigation regime and grass pea ecotype and four replicates were undertaken from march june in 2018 and 2019 at the agricultural research field of vali e asr university of rafsanjan rafsanjan iran irrigation regimes were 1 normal irrigation irrigation after 60 mm water evaporation from class a evaporation pan over the growing season and 2 terminal drought water withheld after flowering until harvest nine local grass pea ecotypes were collected from a range of locations in the south southeast and northeast of iran bidkerdoiyeh baft 1 kiskan baft 2 bardsir dehbakri sirjan rabor kuhbanan shiraz and torbat heydariyeh torbat the seeds were purchased from local stores in each place some geographical and climatic characteristics of locations are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental method sowing occurred on 6 march 2018 and 8 march 2019 two rows of seeds were sown 10 cm apart and 4 cm deep on both sides of a ridge in rows 60 cm apart for a final density of 30 plants m2 each plot consisted of four 6 meter long rows some physiochemical characteristics of the soil are shown in table 2 no fertilizer was applied in this experiment since this crop is usually cultivated in marginal lands in iran with no subsidiary management the main weather parameters during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons of grass pea in rafsanjan are represented in table 3 irrigation was done as furrow ridge method in which water flow was directed to all furrows within each plot until water height reached to approximately 30 cm for control treatment normal irrigation corresponding plots were irrigated regularly after 60 mm water evaporation from class a evaporation pan from sowing to maturity for terminal drought treatment at 50 flowering of each ecotype watering was stopped until harvest plant growth and some physiological characteristics were measured during post flowering period and hand weeding was undertaken if necessary 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 sampling and measurements total leaf surface area of five randomly plants taken from each plot was measured using a leaf area meter delta t wd3 uk 14 days after flowering and expressed as cm2 per plant leaf relative water content rwc was measured as per barrs and weatherley 1962 fourteen days after the onset of flowering at 12 00 am two of the youngest expanded leaves from each randomly selected plant from each plot were removed and weighed immediately fresh weight fw and then hydrated to full turgidity in a closed petri dish for 24 h in the dark at room temperature after 24 h the samples were removed from the petri dish dried well with filter paper and immediately weighed to obtain fully turgid weight tw the samples were then oven dried at 70 c and weighed to determine dry weight dw rwc was calculated as follows rwc fw dw tw dw 100 soluble sugars and starch contents were determined using the anthrone method chow and landhäusser 2004 first 5 ml of 80 hot ethanol was mixed with 500 mg of dried ground leaf tissue in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 min the supernatant was transferred into a tube containing 12 5 ml of 80 ethanol next 1 ml of 0 2 anthrone was added to 1 ml of this solution and heated in a water bath at 100 c for 10 min the reaction was terminated by incubating the mixture on ice for 5 min total soluble sugars content was measured with a spectrophotometer at 620 nm shimadzu uv 1800 japan and determined from a standard glucose curve expressed in mili grams per gram fresh weight mg g fw for starch extraction 0 2 ml of distilled water was added to the solid tissue residue at the bottom of tubes after centrifugation from the extraction of soluble sugars then 0 26 ml of 52 perchloric acid was added and the solution kept on ice for 15 min after adding 0 4 ml distilled water the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min the upper phase was transferred to a test tube and the above steps repeated once then 0 2 ml of the extract was mixed with 3 ml of the anthrone reagent and kept at 100 c for 20 min in water bath after cooling the tubes the absorbance of the samples was read at 620 nm with spectrophotometer same as above starch contents were calculated from the standard glucose graph proline content was measured using the method of bates et al 1973 first 100 mg of leaf tissue was homogenized in 5 ml of 3 aqueous sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged at 4800 g at 4 c for 15 min next 2 ml of extract was mixed with 2 ml of acid ninhydrin and 2 ml of glacial acetic acid in test tubes the samples were kept at 100 c for 1 h in water bath the reaction was terminated in an ice bath by adding 4 ml of toluene to this solution the absorbance of the colored reaction solution was measured at 520 nm using toluene as a blank in spectrophotometer proline concentrations were determined from a calibration curve expressed in micro mols per gram fresh weight μmol g fw calibrations were made with l proline sigma aldrich chemie gmbh steinheim germany as a standard at harvest plants within a 1 m2 quadrat from the 2 middle rows of each plot were cut from the collar and oven dried at 70 c for 48 h pod number per plant and seed number per pod were counted for five randomly selected dried plants from each quadrat seed and biological yields were measured as dry weight of seed and total aboveground biomass leaves stems and pods of each plot also 100 seed weight was measured after weighing random seed lots from the whole plot counting the number of seeds and converting to 100 seed weight to calculate water use efficiency total volume of applied water for each plot was determined as irrigation numbers volume of water per each irrigation water use efficiency based on grain yield was calculated as wuegr gy w gusmao et al 2012 where gy is seed yield g plot and w is total volume of water for any given plot m3 2 3 2 statistical analyses a two way analysis of variance anova was undertaken using sas software statistical analysis system v 8 1 nc usa since the interaction effect of irrigation regime ecotype was significant for all traits the lsmeans procedure p 0 05 was used to establish the differences among the ecotypes within each irrigation regime treatment normal or terminal drought as well as the difference between irrigation regimes within each ecotype pearson s correlation coefficients r were calculated to determine the magnitude of the relationships among agronomic and physiological traits with their significance expressed at the 0 05 or 0 01 level 3 results 3 1 seed yield terminal drought no irrigation after flowering until harvest significantly reduced seed yield in all ecotypes and both years except kuhbanan in 2018 but the magnitude of the decline differed among ecotypes table 4 the weather data records revealed a wet season in 2019 with higher total monthly rainfall especially in march and may and more rainy days than 2018 table 3 in addition 2019 had lower mean temperatures except in may than 2018 six of the nine ecotypes dehbakri sirjan baft 2 shiraz rabor and kuhbanan had higher seed yields under terminal drought in the wet season 2019 than the dry season 2018 particularly for dehbakri 180 13 1 vs 4 7 g m2 and shiraz 81 27 vs 14 9 g m2 table 4 baft 2 and rabor had the highest seed yields both in normal irrigation and terminal drought treatments in both seasons bardsir was the most sensitive ecotype to drought with seed yields declining by 90 and 88 relative to normal irrigation in 2018 and 2019 respectively indeed seed yield in bardsir was very low and under terminal drought was close to zero in the wet season 2019 sirjan was the second highest yielding ecotype after baft 2 under normal irrigation but terminal drought decreased its yield by 65 the second highest decline among ecotypes after bardsir 3 2 biological yield similar to seed yield terminal drought significantly decreased shoot biomass per m2 biological yield in all ecotypes in 2018 except bardsir table 4 however in 2019 wet season biological yields in five of nine ecotypes baft 1 bardsir dehbakri kuhbanan and torbat did not differ under normal irrigation and terminal drought indeed the difference between the normal irrigation and terminal drought for the biological yield of each ecotype was lower than the corresponding values for seed yield for example 10 7 vs 32 0 for baft 1 in 2019 and 57 9 vs 87 0 for dehbakri in 2018 baft 2 and rabor produced the highest biological yields under terminal drought in both seasons table 4 however shiraz sirjan and dehbakri produced higher biological yields than rabor under normal irrigation in 2019 interestingly bardsir with the lowest seed yields produced moderate biological yields 3 3 mean seed weight terminal drought reduced the mean seed weight expressed as 100 seed weight of all ecotypes but the magnitude of their response varied albeit to a lesser degree than seed yield bardsir produced the lowest 100 seed weights under normal irrigation 4 92 g in 2018 and 7 09 g in 2019 table 4 in the dry season 2018 the difference between the highest and lowest mean seed weight ecotypes kuhbanan and dehbakri was almost 140 7 2 vs 3 g much less than the 5500 difference between the highest and lowest seed yield ecotypes rabor 33 8 g m2 and bardsir 0 6 g m2 table 4 mean seed weight did not correlate with seed or biological yield in either year or irrigation regime however it had a positive correlation with proline content under terminal drought in 2018 r 0 74 table 6 3 4 pod number per plant and seed number per pod terminal drought decreased pod number per plant in both years and all ecotypes except for kuhbanan table 4 baft 2 and rabor had the most pods per plant under normal irrigation and terminal drought interestingly six of the nine ecotypes dehbakri baft 2 baft 1 shiraz rabor and bardsir had fewer pods per plant in 2019 wet season than 2018 dry season the differences between normal and drought treatment for seed number per pod in each ecotype were not as high as those for pod number per plant bardsir the lowest yielding ecotype produced the most seeds per pod in both years and irrigation regimes for three of the nine ecotypes dehbakri sirjan and kuhbanan terminal drought in the wet season 2019 significantly decreased seed number per pod pod number per plant and seed number per pod had strong correlations with seed and biological yield table 6 more so for pod number per plant 3 5 water use efficiency wuegr interaction effect of irrigation regime ecotype year was significant for wuegr p 0 01 under terminal drought in 2018 dry season wuegr decreased in dehbakri sirjan torbat and baft 2 while increased in baft 1 and kuhbanan and remained unchanged in shiraz in 2019 however wuegr was not significantly changed by terminal drought in six of the eight ecotypes and decreased only in baft 2 and sirjan fig 1 among ecotypes high yielding baft 2 and rabor had the highest wuegr values both under normal and terminal drought treatments in either year the difference between rabor and kuhbanan under terminal drought is not significant in 2019 also the lowest yielding ecotypes under terminal drought dehbakri and baft 1 showed the lowest wuegr in both years it should be noted that ecotypes varied considerably in terms of time to flowering and time to maturity as baft 2 shiraz and rabor being late flowering averaged 45 days and late maturity averaged 84 days while baft 1 kuhbanan sirjan and torbat being early flowering averaged 32 days and early maturity averaged 72 days dehbakri was late flowering but moderate maturity thus total volume of applied irrigation water differed significantly among ecotypes in a given watering regime data for phenology and irrigation numbers are not shown since seed yield in bardsir under drought was very low and close to zero this ecotype was not included in wuegr calculations wuegr correlated well with seed and biological yield under normal irrigation in both years while under terminal drought it was correlated with seed yield only in 2019 wet season table 6 3 6 leaf area terminal drought significantly decreased leaf area la in baft 1 baft 2 bardsir dehbakri rabor and shiraz in 2018 table 4 relative to normal irrigation more so in shiraz and dehbakri by 61 3 and 54 9 respectively in 2019 wet season the decrease in la caused by terminal drought was not significant in five of the nine ecotypes baft 1 baft 2 rabor shiraz and torbat bardsir the lowest yielding ecotype table 4 had the largest la in both years and irrigation regimes leaf area had significant positive correlations with seed and biological yield under terminal drought in both years and under normal irrigation in the dry season 2018 table 6 3 7 relative water content rwc in both seasons and all ecotypes except torbat in 2018 terminal drought significantly decreased leaf rwc torbat had the highest rwc in both years and irrigation regimes and the smallest decrease induced by terminal drought in both years 10 in 2018 and 13 in 2019 table 5 in both years and irrigation regimes rwc did not correlate with seed yield biological yield or 100 seed weight table 6 however under normal irrigation in 2018 rwc had a significant positive correlation with la r 0 64 p 0 05 3 8 soluble sugars content water withholding after flowering substantially increased soluble sugars content in all ecotypes and both years baft 2 a high yielding ecotype had the highest sugars content in both irrigation regimes and years table 5 interestingly torbat a low moderate yielding ecotype table 4 exhibited the second highest increase in sugars content under terminal drought soluble sugars content had significant positive correlations with seed and biological yield under terminal drought in both years and normal irrigation only in dry season 2018 table 6 soluble sugars content also had a significant positive correlation with pod number per plant under both irrigation regimes r 0 71 and 0 70 p 0 01 in 2018 dry season table 6 3 9 starch content terminal drought significantly decreased starch content in all ecotypes table 5 baft 2 had the highest starch content in both years and irrigation regimes torbat and shiraz in the wet season 2019 and rabor shiraz and sirjan in the dry season 2018 had the lowest starch content under terminal drought table 5 starch content had not significant correlation with seed and biological yield under terminal drought but under normal irrigation and in dry season it was positively correlated with seed and biological yield table 6 starch content also had a significant positive correlation with soluble sugars content in both years and irrigation regimes table 6 3 10 proline content in all ecotypes and both years terminal drought significantly increased proline content relative to normal irrigation the lowest seed yielding ecotype bardsir had the greatest increase in proline content 379 in 2019 and second highest increase 349 in 2018 after sirjan 378 table 5 proline content did not correlate with seed or biological yield under terminal drought in 2018 however it correlated with seed and biological yield under normal irrigation table 6 proline content also had significant positive correlations with soluble sugars content only under normal irrigation 4 discussion grass pea ecotypes investigated in this study varied substantially in terms of growth yield and physiological characteristics responses to terminal drought we used covariance analysis to find the relationship among the traits and to explore possible drought tolerance mechanism baft 2 and rabor two superior ecotypes in terms of seed and biological yield under normal irrigation were also the best under terminal drought on the contrary low yielding ecotypes showed different sensitivity to drought over the two years of the study according to the data higher seed yields were probably due to higher pod number per plant as baft 2 and rabor had the highest pod number per plant both under normal irrigation and terminal drought also pod number per plant had very high correlation coefficients with seed and biological yield high pod number per plant in legumes has been reported as a desirable yield component contributing more than 100 seed weight to final seed yield talukdar 2013 siddique et al 2001 found that pod and seed set before the onset of terminal drought are major adaptation traits for cool season seed legumes in mediterranean environments on the other hand the differences among ecotypes in terms of pod number per plant were much greater than those for seed number per pod and mean seed weight the only exception was bardsir the lowest seed yielding ecotype with very high seed per pod number gusmao et al 2012 suggested that under the condition of terminal drought resource are concentrated to small number of surviving pod and seeds thus less seed weight decrease caused by drought occurs as compared to seed or pod number the weather data recordings showed a more humid and cooler climate for 2019 with most ecotypes producing higher seed yields under terminal drought than in 2018 this observation is most likely due to higher soil water content and less evapotranspiration in 2019 in march april and especially june notably the two lowest yielding ecotypes under terminal drought in 2018 dehbakri and shiraz yielded much higher under the same condition in 2019 we might speculate that drought sensitive ecotypes were more dependent on water availability during seed filling period accordingly high yielding ecotypes were able to survive terminal drought because of less reliance on water for pod and seed set from flowering till maturity variation in water use efficiency wuegr among ecotypes and watering regimes revealed a close relationship between plant productivity and efficiency of water consumption in grass pea terminal drought did not decrease wuegr in most of the ecotypes in wet season 2019 probably due to higher seed yields as compared to 2018 discussed above as well as less evapotranspiration and less number of irrigations before flowering on the other hand high yielding ecotypes baft 2 and rabor had the highest wuegr both under normal irrigation and terminal drought interestingly these were the latest flowering and maturity ecotypes being irrigated two or three times more than early maturity ecotypes therefore higher wuegr in our study is probably due to efficient utilization of water for carbohydrates synthesis and remobilization of stored assimilates to developing seeds and not because of less demand for water based on this we assume that drought tolerance of grass pea is of water spending type and not water saving this hypothesis is confirmed with siddique et al 2001 findings in which grass pea was shown to consume substantial amounts of water during pre flowering period leading to low wue as compared to some other legumes such as field pea pisum sativum and faba bean vicia faba similarly calderón et al 2012 reported that grass pea substantially dried out the soil more than field pea during the two driest years of the experiment gusmao et al 2012 and kong et al 2015 reported a significant decrease in grass pea wue by terminal drought probably due to lower seed and pod number per plant caused by water deficit kong et al 2015 indicated that higher remobilization of stored assimilates during seed filling may assist plants to maintain higher wue under drought the results for leaf relative water content rwc agreed with wue findings and showed another aspect of drought tolerance in grass pea the highest yielding ecotype baft 2 had the lowest rwc in 2019 and the low yielding ecotype torbat had the highest rwc under terminal drought in both years no considerable association between rwc and seed or biological yield was observed under either irrigation regime our results are in accordance with those of bhat et al 2020 who did not find significant difference in terms of rwc in a range of grass pea landraces differing in drought tolerance also in cowpea vigna unguiculata no difference in rwc was observed between the control variety and landraces under water deficit nunes et al 2022 oukarroum et al 2007 suggested that maintaining high rwc may be one of the mechanisms of plants to cope with drought however association of plant water content and drought tolerance needs to be further explored the results from experiments with short drought periods and controlled growth conditions can differ from those in the field or near to natural growth conditions where several factors like wind speed and air turbulence changes rapidly plant water status similar to the results of rwc high yielding ecotypes baft 2 and rabor had not the highest leaf area in both seasons and under either irrigation regime though leaf area was closely correlated with seed and biological yield under terminal drought interestingly baft 2 exhibited one of the least leaf surface areas under terminal drought in the dry season 2018 therefore plant productivity in superior grass pea ecotypes investigated in this study did not necessitate an expanded leaf area that may cause substantial water loss the reduced leaf area under water stress may be a morphological adaptation to drought in some plant species to reduce water loss cullis and kunert 2017 bangar et al 2019 since cell enlargement and growth requires water it is expected that rwc and leaf area are related to each other in our experiment however leaf area did not correlate with rwc under terminal drought either positively or negatively this observation is probably due to xerophytic nature of grass pea by which cell growth undergoes even under low water content there is almost no study in the literature regarding grass pea leaf area changes in response to varying water availability anyia and herzog 2004 found a drought avoidance mechanism in cowpea with maintaining high leaf water content which had a negative association with leaf area relatively low leaf area and water content in high yielding grass pea ecotypes indicates an efficient photosynthetic system capable of producing high amounts of carbohydrates even under drought stress baft 2 and rabor had the highest starch content under normal irrigation also they had the highest sugar content along with torbat under terminal drought interestingly leaf starch content tended to decrease by terminal drought and associated well with seed and biological yield only under normal irrigation while soluble sugars increased and had significant correlation with seed and biological yield under terminal drought in 2019 coefficient correlation for seed yield was close to significant these findings suggest that decreased starch content and a concomitant increase in sugars may serve as an osmotic adjustment mechanism inhibiting a critical drop in cell water potential soluble sugars can assist in maintaining membrane integrity ramanjulu and bartels 2002 and avoiding irreversible changes to the three dimensional structure of crucial macro molecules nadeem et al 2019 many sensitive plant species to drought are unable to synthesize these compounds valliyodan and nguyen 2006 starch content reduction may also be due to its conversion to sucrose and remobilization to developing seeds which took place more in the tolerant cultivar of rice oryza sativa prathap et al 2019 nonetheless the magnitude of sugars accumulation and its effect on final yield varies among plant species nunes et al 2022 found that five cowpea landraces did not differ in amount of sugars under terminal drought also sugar content did not increase in all of the landraces turner et al 2006 suggested that accumulation of solutes in chickpea is a passive consequence of assimilates accumulating faster than they are required during early seed growth and that these solutes are remobilized during late seed filling when osmotic adjustment has been observed to decrease we hypothesize that in our study soluble sugars accumulation had a dual role osmotic adjustment and seed filling similar to the results for starch and soluble sugars terminal drought substantially increased proline content nonetheless the greatest increase was observed in the lowest yielding ecotype bardsir additionally proline content did not correlate with either seed or biological yield under terminal drought interestingly proline content correlated well with soluble sugars content only under normal irrigation and not terminal drought based on these findings we speculate that the role of proline in drought tolerance of grass pea if any is not clear and may be in collaboration with other factors like soluble sugars proline is well known for its function as an osmo protectant and mitigating oxidative stress damage to cell membranes by decreasing lipid oxidation and scavenging free radicals shinde et al 2016 however the role of proline and other osmolytes in drought tolerance is contentious and varies among plant species and even varieties obata et al 2015 talukdar 2013 found that grass pea leaf proline content increases with increasing exposure to water stress and is associated with drought tolerance on the contrary high yielding polish grass pea ecotype had higher proline content than low yielding only under the highest water shortage treatment piwowarczyk et al 2017 bhat et al 2020 found that the highest drought tolerant grass pea landrace had moderate and not the highest proline content also selection for drought tolerant wheat triticum aestivum l cultivars based on proline content may not be associated with favorable agronomic traits mwadzingeni et al 2016 mathur et al 2009 found that introducing a proline biosynthesis gene to chickpea for proline did not enhance biomass 5 conclusion taken together drought tolerance plant productivity and water use efficiency of grass pea ecotypes investigated in this study were closely related high yielding ecotypes performed better as compared to low yielding ones both under normal and terminal drought which was probably due to greater allocation of biomass to pods and seeds higher starch content followed by higher soluble sugars accumulation occurred more in high yielding ecotypes on the contrary increased proline content did not associate with seed or biological yield our results suggest that carbohydrate synthesis capacity as well as water management within plants may control plant perfprmace under different water availability funding source this research did not

9297,grass pea is one of the oldest native crops grown in vast geographical regions of iran however little is known about its tolerance to water shortage during post flowering period we conducted

correlation with seed and biological yields in either irrigation regime and was the highest in high yielding ecotypes leaf surface area relative water content rwc and starch content decreased while soluble sugars and proline content increased by terminal drought the highest yielding ecotypes baft 2 and rabor had not the highest leaf area and rwc though they had the highest starch content under normal and sugars content under terminal drought also they had the greatest water use efficiency in both years and watering regimes proline content rwc and sugar contents did not significantly correlate with seed or biological yield under terminal drought our results suggest that drought tolerance in grass pea is closely associated with better utilization of water and plant photosynthetic

its high seed protein content 20 32 is used for human consumption while the straw is used as an animal feed grela et al 2010 and bio ethanol tesfaw et al 2021 grass pea offers an alternative to other high protein legumes such as peas and beans that require better growing conditions piwowarczyk et al 2017 when plowed into the soil grass pea is an excellent green manure that produces great amounts of biomass and returns considerable amounts of nitrogen to the soil jeromela et al 2017 compared to other legumes grass pea has some morphological and physiological drought tolerance traits including narrow leaves stems with winged margins deep and extensive root system lambein et al 2019 and high water use efficiency biederbeck and bouman 1994 siddique et al 2001 these characteristics enable the plant to extract substantial amounts of water from various soils and tolerate terminal drought calderón et al 2012 over all grass pea may be considered as an important plant species in dryland systems calderón et al 2012 despite these favorable xerophytic characteristics water shortage especially during post flowering period can significantly reduce grass pea growth and seed yield gusmao et al 2012 kong et al 2015 however our knowledge about physiological mechanisms involving in grass pea drought tolerance is limited some morphological and physiological alterations including reduced leaf area bangar et al 2019 maintaining higher water content anyia and herzog 2004 accumulation of osmotic adjustment metabolites like soluble sugar and proline talukdar 2013 nadeem et al 2019 prathap et al 2019 tokarz et al 2020 in response to water limitation have been reported in different plant species since considerable genetic variation exists both between and within plant species in mechanisms of water stress tolerance obata et al 2015 relevance of such these responses and their association with growth and yield parameters have not been well investigated for example higher proline content was weekly associated with agronomic traits in wheat mwadzingeni et al 2016 also transgenic chickpea cicer arietinum lines with over expression of proline gene did not exhibit higher shoot biomass mathur et al 2009 although grass pea has a long history of cultivation and widespread growth across regions and climates in iran no study regarding the extent of drought tolerance among native accessions has been done so far this research aimed to evaluate the effects of terminal drought on variation in growth and yield of some local grass pea ecotypes and to explore possible association between major physiological and agronomic traits 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth condition and treatments two split plot experiments using a randomized complete block design with two factors irrigation regime and grass pea ecotype and four replicates were undertaken from march june in 2018 and 2019 at the agricultural research field of vali e asr university of rafsanjan rafsanjan iran irrigation regimes were 1 normal irrigation irrigation after 60 mm water evaporation from class a evaporation pan over the growing season and 2 terminal drought water withheld after flowering until harvest nine local grass pea ecotypes were collected from a range of locations in the south southeast and northeast of iran bidkerdoiyeh baft 1 kiskan baft 2 bardsir dehbakri sirjan rabor kuhbanan shiraz and torbat heydariyeh torbat the seeds were purchased from local stores in each place some geographical and climatic characteristics of locations are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental method sowing occurred on 6 march 2018 and 8 march 2019 two rows of seeds were sown 10 cm apart and 4 cm deep on both sides of a ridge in rows 60 cm apart for a final density of 30 plants m2 each plot consisted of four 6 meter long rows some physiochemical characteristics of the soil are shown in table 2 no fertilizer was applied in this experiment since this crop is usually cultivated in marginal lands in iran with no subsidiary management the main weather parameters during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons of grass pea in rafsanjan are represented in table 3 irrigation was done as furrow ridge method in which water flow was directed to all furrows within each plot until water height reached to approximately 30 cm for control treatment normal irrigation corresponding plots were irrigated regularly after 60 mm water evaporation from class a evaporation pan from sowing to maturity for terminal drought treatment at 50 flowering of each ecotype watering was stopped until harvest plant growth and some physiological characteristics were measured during post flowering period and hand weeding was undertaken if necessary 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 sampling and measurements total leaf surface area of five randomly plants taken from each plot was measured using a leaf area meter delta t wd3 uk 14 days after flowering and expressed as cm2 per plant leaf relative water content rwc was measured as per barrs and weatherley 1962 fourteen days after the onset of flowering at 12 00 am two of the youngest expanded leaves from each randomly selected plant from each plot were removed and weighed immediately fresh weight fw and then hydrated to full turgidity in a closed petri dish for 24 h in the dark at room temperature after 24 h the samples were removed from the petri dish dried well with filter paper and immediately weighed to obtain fully turgid weight tw the samples were then oven dried at 70 c and weighed to determine dry weight dw rwc was calculated as follows rwc fw dw tw dw 100 soluble sugars and starch contents were determined using the anthrone method chow and landhäusser 2004 first 5 ml of 80 hot ethanol was mixed with 500 mg of dried ground leaf tissue in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 min the supernatant was transferred into a tube containing 12 5 ml of 80 ethanol next 1 ml of 0 2 anthrone was added to 1 ml of this solution and heated in a water bath at 100 c for 10 min the reaction was terminated by incubating the mixture on ice for 5 min total soluble sugars content was measured with a spectrophotometer at 620 nm shimadzu

concentrations were determined from a calibration curve expressed in micro mols per gram fresh weight μmol g fw calibrations were made with l proline sigma aldrich chemie gmbh steinheim germany as a standard at harvest plants within a 1 m2 quadrat from the 2 middle rows of each plot were cut from the collar and oven dried at 70 c for 48 h pod number per plant and seed number per pod were counted for five randomly selected dried plants from each quadrat seed and biological yields were measured as dry weight of seed and total aboveground biomass leaves stems and pods of each plot also 100 seed weight was measured after weighing random seed lots from the whole plot counting the number of seeds and converting to 100 seed weight to calculate water use efficiency total volume of applied water for each plot was determined as irrigation numbers volume of water per each irrigation water use efficiency based on grain yield was calculated as wuegr gy w gusmao et al 2012 where gy is seed yield g plot and w is total volume of water for any given plot m3 2 3 2 statistical analyses a two way analysis of variance anova was undertaken using sas software statistical analysis system v 8 1 nc usa since the interaction effect of irrigation regime ecotype was significant for all traits the lsmeans procedure p 0 05 was used to establish the differences among the ecotypes within each irrigation regime treatment normal or terminal drought as well as the difference between irrigation regimes within each ecotype pearson s correlation coefficients r were calculated to determine the magnitude of the relationships among agronomic and physiological traits with their significance expressed at the 0 05 or 0 01 level 3 results 3 1 seed yield terminal drought no irrigation after flowering until harvest significantly reduced seed yield in all ecotypes and both years except kuhbanan in 2018 but the magnitude of the decline differed among ecotypes table 4 the weather data records revealed a wet season in 2019 with higher total monthly rainfall especially in march and may and more rainy days than 2018 table 3 in addition 2019 had lower mean temperatures except in may than 2018 six of the nine ecotypes dehbakri sirjan baft 2 shiraz rabor and kuhbanan had higher seed yields under terminal drought in the wet season 2019 than the dry season 2018 particularly for dehbakri 180 13 1 vs 4 7 g m2 and shiraz 81 27 vs 14 9 g m2 table 4 baft 2 and rabor had the highest seed yields both in normal irrigation and terminal drought treatments in both seasons bardsir was the most sensitive ecotype to drought with seed yields declining by 90 and 88 relative to normal irrigation in 2018 and 2019 respectively indeed seed yield in bardsir was very low and under terminal drought was close to zero in the wet season 2019 sirjan was the second highest yielding ecotype after baft 2 under normal irrigation but terminal drought decreased its yield by 65 the second highest decline among ecotypes after bardsir 3 2 biological yield similar to seed yield terminal drought significantly decreased shoot biomass per m2 biological yield in all ecotypes in 2018 except bardsir table 4 however in 2019 wet season biological yields in five of nine ecotypes baft 1 bardsir dehbakri kuhbanan and torbat did not differ under normal irrigation and terminal drought indeed the difference between the normal irrigation and terminal drought for the biological yield of each ecotype was lower than the corresponding values for seed yield for example 10 7 vs 32 0 for baft 1 in 2019 and 57 9 vs 87 0 for dehbakri in 2018 baft 2 and rabor produced the highest biological yields under terminal drought in both seasons table 4 however shiraz sirjan and dehbakri produced higher biological yields than rabor under normal irrigation in 2019 interestingly bardsir with the lowest seed yields produced moderate biological yields 3 3 mean seed weight terminal drought reduced the mean seed weight expressed as 100 seed weight of all ecotypes but the magnitude of their response varied albeit to a lesser degree than seed yield bardsir produced the lowest 100 seed weights under normal irrigation 4 92 g in 2018 and 7 09 g in 2019 table 4 in the dry season 2018 the difference between the highest and lowest mean seed weight ecotypes kuhbanan and dehbakri was almost 140 7 2 vs 3 g much less than the 5500 difference between the highest and lowest seed yield ecotypes rabor 33 8 g m2 and bardsir 0 6 g m2 table 4 mean seed weight did not correlate with seed or biological yield in either year or irrigation regime however it had a positive correlation with proline content under terminal drought in 2018 r 0 74 table 6 3 4 pod number per plant and seed number per pod terminal drought decreased pod number per plant in both years and all ecotypes except for kuhbanan table 4 baft 2 and rabor had the most pods per plant under normal irrigation and terminal drought interestingly six of the nine ecotypes dehbakri baft 2 baft 1 shiraz rabor and bardsir had fewer pods per plant in 2019 wet season than 2018 dry season the differences between normal and drought treatment for seed number per pod in each ecotype were not as high as those for pod number per plant bardsir the lowest yielding ecotype produced the most seeds per pod in both years and irrigation regimes for three of the nine ecotypes dehbakri sirjan and kuhbanan terminal drought in the wet season 2019 significantly decreased seed number per pod pod number per plant and seed number per pod had strong correlations with seed and biological yield table 6 more so for pod number per plant 3 5 water use efficiency wuegr interaction effect of irrigation regime ecotype year was significant for wuegr p 0 01 under terminal drought in 2018 dry season wuegr decreased in dehbakri sirjan torbat and baft 2 while increased in baft 1 and kuhbanan and remained unchanged in shiraz in 2019 however wuegr was not significantly changed by terminal drought in six of the eight ecotypes and decreased only in baft 2 and sirjan fig 1 among ecotypes high yielding baft 2 and rabor had the highest wuegr values both under normal and terminal drought treatments in either year the difference between rabor and kuhbanan under terminal drought is not significant in 2019 also the lowest yielding ecotypes under terminal drought dehbakri and baft 1 showed the lowest wuegr in both years it should be noted that ecotypes varied considerably in terms of time to flowering and time to maturity as baft 2 shiraz and rabor being late flowering averaged 45 days and late maturity averaged 84 days while baft 1 kuhbanan sirjan and torbat being early flowering averaged 32 days and early maturity averaged 72 days dehbakri was late flowering but moderate maturity thus total volume of applied irrigation water differed significantly among ecotypes in a given watering regime data for phenology and irrigation numbers are not shown since seed yield in bardsir under drought was very low and close to zero this ecotype was not included in wuegr calculations wuegr correlated well with seed and biological yield under normal irrigation in both years while under terminal drought it was correlated with seed yield only in 2019 wet season table 6 3 6 leaf area terminal drought significantly decreased leaf area la in baft 1 baft 2 bardsir dehbakri rabor and shiraz in 2018 table 4 relative to normal irrigation more so in shiraz and dehbakri by 61 3 and 54 9 respectively in 2019 wet season the decrease in la caused by terminal drought was not significant in five of the nine ecotypes baft 1 baft 2 rabor shiraz and torbat bardsir the lowest yielding ecotype table 4 had the largest la in both years and irrigation regimes leaf area had significant positive correlations with seed and biological yield under terminal drought in both years and under normal irrigation in the dry season 2018 table 6 3 7 relative water content rwc in both seasons and all ecotypes except torbat in 2018 terminal drought significantly decreased leaf rwc torbat had the highest rwc in both years and irrigation regimes and the smallest decrease induced by terminal drought in both years 10 in 2018 and 13 in 2019 table 5 in both years and irrigation regimes rwc did not correlate with seed yield biological yield or 100 seed weight table 6 however under normal irrigation in 2018 rwc had a significant positive correlation with la r 0 64 p 0 05 3 8 soluble sugars content water withholding after flowering substantially increased soluble sugars content in all ecotypes and both years baft 2 a high yielding ecotype had the highest sugars content in both irrigation regimes and years table 5 interestingly torbat a low moderate yielding ecotype table 4 exhibited the second highest increase in sugars content under terminal drought soluble sugars content had significant positive correlations with seed and biological yield under terminal drought in both years and normal irrigation only in dry season 2018 table 6 soluble sugars content also had a significant positive correlation with pod number per plant under both irrigation regimes r 0 71 and 0 70 p 0 01 in 2018 dry season table 6 3 9 starch content terminal drought significantly decreased starch content in all ecotypes table 5 baft 2 had the highest starch content in both years and irrigation regimes torbat and shiraz in the wet season 2019 and rabor shiraz and sirjan in the dry season 2018 had the lowest starch content under terminal drought table 5 starch content had not significant correlation with seed and biological yield under terminal drought but under normal irrigation and in dry season it was positively correlated with seed and biological yield table 6 starch content also had a significant positive correlation with soluble sugars content in both years and irrigation regimes table 6 3 10 proline content in all ecotypes and both years terminal drought significantly increased proline content relative to normal irrigation the lowest seed yielding ecotype bardsir had the greatest increase in proline content 379 in 2019 and second highest increase 349 in 2018 after sirjan 378 table 5 proline content did not correlate with seed or biological yield under terminal drought in 2018 however it correlated with seed and biological yield under normal irrigation table 6 proline content also had significant positive correlations with soluble sugars content only under normal irrigation 4 discussion grass pea ecotypes investigated in this study varied substantially in terms of growth yield and physiological characteristics responses to terminal drought we used covariance analysis to find the relationship among the traits and to explore possible drought tolerance mechanism baft 2 and rabor two superior ecotypes in terms of seed and biological yield under normal irrigation were also the best under terminal drought on the contrary low yielding ecotypes showed different sensitivity to drought over the two years of the study according to the data higher seed yields were probably due to higher pod number per plant as baft 2 and rabor had the highest pod number per plant both under normal irrigation and terminal drought also pod number per plant had very high correlation coefficients with seed and biological yield high pod number per plant in legumes has been reported as a desirable yield component contributing more than 100 seed weight to final seed yield talukdar 2013 siddique et al 2001 found that pod and seed set before the onset of terminal drought are major adaptation traits for cool season seed legumes in mediterranean environments on the other hand the differences among ecotypes in terms of pod number per plant were much greater than those for seed number per pod and mean seed weight the only exception was bardsir the lowest seed yielding ecotype with very high seed per pod number gusmao et al 2012 suggested that under the condition of terminal drought resource are concentrated to small number of surviving pod and seeds thus less seed weight decrease caused by drought occurs as compared to seed or pod number the weather data recordings showed a more humid and cooler climate for 2019 with most ecotypes producing higher seed yields under terminal drought than in 2018 this observation is most likely due to higher soil water content and less evapotranspiration in 2019 in march april and especially june notably the two lowest yielding ecotypes under terminal drought in 2018 dehbakri and shiraz yielded much higher under the same condition in 2019 we might speculate that drought sensitive ecotypes were more dependent on water availability during seed filling period accordingly high yielding ecotypes were able to survive terminal drought because of less reliance on water for pod and seed set from flowering till maturity variation in water use efficiency wuegr among ecotypes and watering regimes revealed a close relationship between plant productivity and efficiency of water consumption in grass pea terminal drought did not decrease wuegr in most of the ecotypes in wet season 2019 probably due to higher seed yields as compared to 2018 discussed above as well as less evapotranspiration and less number of irrigations before flowering on the other hand high yielding ecotypes baft 2 and rabor had the highest wuegr both under normal irrigation and terminal drought interestingly these were the latest flowering and maturity ecotypes being irrigated two or three times more than early maturity ecotypes therefore higher wuegr in our study is probably due to efficient utilization of water for carbohydrates synthesis and remobilization of stored assimilates to developing seeds and not because of less demand for water based on this we assume that drought tolerance of grass pea is of water spending type and not water saving this hypothesis is confirmed with siddique et al 2001 findings in which grass pea was shown to consume substantial amounts of water during pre flowering period leading to low wue as compared to some other legumes such as field pea pisum sativum and faba bean vicia faba similarly calderón et al 2012 reported that grass pea substantially dried out the soil more than field pea during the two driest years of the experiment gusmao et al 2012 and kong et al 2015 reported a significant decrease in grass pea wue by terminal drought probably due to lower seed and pod number per plant caused by water deficit kong et al 2015 indicated that higher remobilization of stored assimilates during seed filling may assist plants to maintain higher wue under drought the results for leaf relative water content rwc agreed with wue findings and showed another aspect of drought tolerance in grass pea the highest yielding ecotype baft 2 had the lowest rwc in 2019 and the low yielding ecotype torbat had the highest rwc under terminal drought in both years no considerable association between rwc and seed or biological yield was observed under either irrigation regime our results are in accordance with those of bhat et al 2020 who did not find significant difference in terms of rwc in a range of grass pea landraces differing in drought tolerance also in cowpea vigna unguiculata no difference in rwc was observed between the control variety and landraces under water deficit nunes et al 2022 oukarroum et al 2007 suggested that maintaining high rwc may be one of the mechanisms of plants to cope with drought however association of plant water content and drought tolerance needs to be further explored the results from experiments with short drought periods and controlled growth conditions can differ from those in the field or near to natural growth conditions where several factors like wind speed and air turbulence changes rapidly plant water status similar to the results of rwc high yielding ecotypes baft 2 and rabor had not the highest leaf area in both seasons and under either irrigation regime though leaf area was closely correlated with seed and biological yield under terminal drought interestingly baft 2 exhibited one of the least leaf surface areas under terminal drought in the dry season 2018 therefore plant productivity in superior grass pea ecotypes investigated in this study did not necessitate an expanded leaf area that may cause substantial water loss the reduced leaf area under water stress may be a morphological adaptation to drought in some plant species to reduce water loss cullis and kunert 2017 bangar et al 2019 since cell enlargement and growth requires water it is expected that rwc and leaf area are related to each other in our experiment however leaf area did not correlate with rwc under terminal drought either positively or negatively this observation is probably due to xerophytic nature of grass pea by which cell growth undergoes even under low water content there is almost no study in the literature regarding grass pea leaf area changes in response to varying water availability anyia and herzog 2004 found a drought avoidance mechanism in cowpea with maintaining high leaf water content which had a negative association with leaf area relatively low leaf area and water content in high yielding grass pea ecotypes indicates an efficient photosynthetic system capable of producing high amounts of carbohydrates even under drought stress baft 2 and rabor had the highest starch content under normal irrigation also they had the highest sugar content along with torbat under terminal drought interestingly leaf starch content tended to decrease by terminal drought and associated well with seed and biological yield only under normal irrigation while soluble sugars increased and had significant correlation with seed and biological yield under terminal drought in 2019 coefficient correlation for seed yield was close to significant these findings suggest that decreased starch content and a concomitant increase in sugars may serve as an osmotic adjustment mechanism inhibiting a critical drop in cell water potential soluble sugars can assist in maintaining membrane integrity ramanjulu and bartels 2002 and avoiding irreversible changes to the three dimensional structure of crucial macro molecules nadeem et al 2019 many sensitive plant species to drought are unable to synthesize these compounds valliyodan and nguyen 2006 starch content reduction may also be due to its conversion to sucrose and remobilization to developing seeds which took place more in the tolerant cultivar of rice oryza sativa prathap et al 2019 nonetheless the magnitude of sugars accumulation and its effect on final yield varies among plant species nunes et al 2022 found that five cowpea landraces did not differ in amount of sugars under terminal drought also sugar content did not increase in all of the landraces turner et al 2006 suggested that accumulation of solutes in chickpea is a passive consequence of assimilates accumulating faster than they are required during early seed growth and that these solutes are remobilized during late seed filling when osmotic adjustment has been observed to decrease we hypothesize that in our study soluble sugars accumulation had a dual role osmotic adjustment and seed filling similar to the results for starch and soluble sugars terminal drought substantially increased proline content nonetheless the greatest increase was observed in the lowest yielding ecotype bardsir additionally proline content did not correlate with either seed or biological yield under terminal drought interestingly proline content correlated well with soluble sugars content only under normal irrigation and not terminal drought based on these findings we speculate that the role of proline in drought tolerance of grass pea if any is not clear and may be in collaboration with other factors like soluble sugars proline is well known for its function as an osmo protectant and mitigating oxidative stress damage to cell membranes by decreasing lipid oxidation and scavenging free radicals shinde et al 2016 however the role of proline and other osmolytes in drought tolerance is contentious and varies among plant species and even varieties obata et al 2015 talukdar 2013 found that grass pea leaf proline content increases with increasing exposure to water stress and is associated with drought tolerance on the contrary high yielding polish grass pea ecotype had higher proline content than low yielding only under the highest water shortage treatment piwowarczyk et al 2017 bhat et al 2020 found that the highest drought tolerant grass pea landrace had moderate and not the highest proline content also selection for drought tolerant wheat triticum aestivum l cultivars based on proline content may not be associated with favorable agronomic traits mwadzingeni et al 2016 mathur et al 2009 found that introducing a proline biosynthesis gene to chickpea for proline did not enhance biomass 5 conclusion taken together drought tolerance plant productivity and water use efficiency of grass pea ecotypes investigated in this study were closely related high yielding ecotypes performed better as compared to low yielding ones both under normal and terminal drought which was probably due to greater allocation of biomass to pods and seeds higher starch content followed by higher soluble sugars accumulation occurred more in high yielding ecotypes on the contrary increased proline content did not associate with seed or biological yield our results suggest that carbohydrate synthesis capacity as well as water management within plants may control plant perfprmace under different water availability funding source this research did not

9298,reliable short term forecasts of irrigation water demand iwd can provide useful information to help water supply system operators with day to day operating decisions forecasting iwd is a complex task due to different natural soil water crop and climate interactions and behavioral farmers decision making components of the irrigation process so far various approaches have been developed to estimate iwd values in different contexts one common approach is the application of data driven methods to map the relationship between the main influential factors and iwd data driven approaches often do not consider any conceptual understanding of the system in modeling iwd which has been found to be effective in improving the predictive performance when considered in this study a hybrid framework has been introduced and developed by incorporating existing physical knowledge of the system into a data driven model to predict iwd this framework consists of two modules in the first module a simple conceptual approach was implemented to model the understood factors leading to crop water needs using observation data in the second module a data driven model was used to capture the remaining relationships between inputs and the output in the irrigation process the proposed hybrid framework was then applied to estimate daily iwd up to 7 days ahead for an irrigation district in victoria australia results show that the integration of physical system understanding into data driven models can improve the performance of iwd forecasting models particularly during the high demand period in addition the hybrid framework provides improved system understanding and thus leads to increased capacity to support operational decisions keywords irrigation demand forecasting short term water demand hybrid modeling artificial neural networks lower murray water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction short term irrigation water demand iwd fluctuates due to a wide range of factors from weather variations hot periods or rainfall events to different pressures or opportunities that farmers may face in the real world therefore iwd forecasts can provide helpful insights into daily operational decisions for not only water suppliers but also agricultural businesses perera et al 2016 for example iwd forecasts will allow decision makers to distribute water optimally considering variable electricity tariffs and thus minimize energy costs perea et al 2015 iwd forecasts can also be useful in designing new irrigation systems or rehabilitating existing systems liao et al 2021 peng et al 2009 iwd forecasting is a challenging task mainly due to the uncertainty of the climate variables determining the demand for irrigation water such as evapotranspiration temperature and precipitation du et al 2017 meempatta et al 2019 therefore forecasts of different weather variables have been used as the principal inputs of the iwd forecasting models different modeling methods have been utilized to estimate iwd for various applications paul et al 2000 perea et al 2019 prasad et al 2006 pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 rao et al 1990 these methods can be classified into two categories conceptual and data driven models perera et al 2015 conceptual iwd models are developed by modeling key elements of the irrigation process e g soil water content balance or crop water needs and the relationships between them these models have been employed for different spatial from farm to system and temporal from lead times of 1 2 days to weeks scales conceptual models estimate the timing and amount of irrigation water by maximizing the production or benefit with different irrigation criteria such as broner 2005 srinivasan 2006 1 farmer s estimates of crop water needs which results in non optimal irrigation scheduling irrigating less or more than crop needs during some crop stages or in other words lower production or benefit levidow et al 2014 2 estimates of crop water needs using historical climate data perea et al 2017 3 estimates of irrigation water based on climate data and soil water balance garcã a et al 2018 gonzã lez perea et al 2014 4 estimates of irrigation water based on soil water data collected from soil moisture sensors ramadan et al 2018 soulis and elmaloglou 2018 a broad spectrum of modeling techniques has been used to calculate daily crop water requirements within the conceptual models from empirical or functional allen et al 1998 doorenbos et al 1979 doorenbos and agriculture organization rome 1975 to mechanistic approaches van aelst et al 1988 various items such as soil data crop characteristics crop patterns and weather forecasts have been used as the inputs of these models cai et al 2011 wang et al 2009 the primary drawback of the conceptual models is the narrow physical understanding of the system and irrigation process therefore the performance of these models is impacted by the way the irrigation process is represented by the model structure and input data cai et al 2011 ejieji and gowing 2000 wang et al 2009 wilks et al 1998 since not all the interactions between system elements are fully understood or can be modeled the conceptual models mainly consider irrigation water equivalent to crop water needs and do not incorporate any finer details calculated water needs do not necessarily provide acceptable estimates of actual water use or in other words consumer demand because other factors like local irrigation practices also affect the demand in addition the development of these models is often constrained by limited specific observation data in many irrigation systems increasing data availability specifically in the last two decades has led to the emergence of data driven approaches to simulate complex processes such as iwd fernandez garcia et al 2020 data driven models directly map the relationship between the driving factors of the irrigation water mainly weather variables and iwd without requiring any knowledge about the physical processes within the system pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 ticlavilca et al 2013 tikhamarine et al 2020 tung and yaseen 2020 data driven approaches employ a range of different statistical techniques from artificial intelligence to multivariate time series artificial intelligence based models have been the most popular in the context of short term iwd forecasting in some studies artificial intelligence has been used in combination with tools such as genetic algorithm or fuzzy logic to get better forecasts or address the limitations related to the quality or quantity of input data perea et al 2015 2019 pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 although data driven models have often successfully improved the predictive performance of iwd forecasting there are some concerns about these models because interactions in the system are modeled implicitly overfitting is a common problem for data driven models wu et al 2014 in addition it has been found in some studies that data driven models perform worse during periods of extreme higher or lower demand when it would be more beneficial for operators this is mainly due to the over generalization of these models when they are developed perea et al 2015 pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 conceptual and data driven approaches for iwd forecasting have advantages and disadvantages as explained above there are potential benefits to combining these two approaches so they can complement each other and improve the overall modeling performance hu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 these benefits have been explored and reported in different areas of water resources management hunter et al 2018 kraft et al 2022 mekonnen et al 2015 however in the context of iwd modeling very few studies have used hybrid approaches to improve the performance of the data driven models perera et al 2015 2016 and the majority of existing studies have applied data driven and conceptual approaches independently this study proposes a generic hybrid framework for forecasting irrigation water demand by combining two conventional modeling approaches and integrating understanding of the physical system with data driven techniques the hybrid model framework consists of two modules one conceptual and one data driven in the conceptual module daily crop needs are estimated using reference crop evapotranspiration rainfall and annual cropping pattern and area in the data driven module the remaining residual information between the previously mentioned conceptual module outputs and the observed pumped volumes is captured this framework is then tested on a real world case study in red cliffs irrigation district of lower murray water lmw area of operations in victoria australia to predict daily irrigation demand in addition the performance of this hybrid modeling framework is compared with a benchmarking model developed using data driven techniques only this study demonstrates that the hybrid modeling framework leads to improved performance compared to a data driven modeling approach on its own this study introduces a new perspective to other researchers working on short term forecasting of irrigation water the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows the study area is introduced in the next section followed by the details of the proposed model in the third section in section 4 the corresponding results are presented and discussed and lastly a summary of the paper and conclusions are provided 2 study area and data red cliffs irrigation district with 32 km2 of irrigated area is located in lower murray water lmw area of operations victoria australia fig 1 agriculture in this district is dominated by wine grape plantings table grapes and dried grapes with drip irrigation as the most widely used irrigation method the current irrigation efficiency in the area is approximately 85 automated connections of this modernized system provide daily pumped flow values from 1979 the daily value of pumped water to the irrigation district is used as a surrogate for iwd in this study lmw also provides data on crop types development of permanent crops planting trends irrigation developments and irrigation methods in the study area from 1997 to 2018 every three years however in this paper eight years of data from sep 2012 to aug 2020 were chosen as the study period this was because the cropping pattern almost remained the same during this time daily values of weather variables were obtained from the bureau of meteorology bom for mildura airport station for the study period sep 2012 to aug 2020 these variables include daily rainfall r mm daily maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin c daily relative humidity rh bright sunshine hours se in the 24 h midnight to midnight local time h wind speed ws km h 1 and daily mean sea level pressure mslp hpa furthermore fao penman monteith method was used to calculate the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 mm using air temperature c humidity radiation mj m 2 day 1 and wind speed data km h 1 et0 indicates the evaporating power of the atmosphere at a particular place and time of the year and does not include any crop characteristics and soil factors apart from the mentioned cropping data and daily climate variables seven lags of daily pumped water volumes pv ml to the irrigation district prior to the day of prediction were used as the inputs of the iwd forecasting models in this study as well 3 methodology 3 1 hybrid model development the hybrid modeling framework as illustrated in fig 2 consists of two modules 1 conceptual and 2 data driven daily crop water needs cwn were calculated using the conceptual module based on daily weather variables and annual cropping area in first reference evapotranspiration et0 was estimated based on climate variables such as temperature humidity radiation and wind speed then together with daily rainfall and cropping area et0 values were used to estimate cwn throughout the growing season details of the conceptual module are discussed in section 3 1 1 apart from crop water needs irrigation demand also depends on a range of other factors such as farmers irrigation strategies different interpretations of uncertain weather forecasts and a degree of randomness that cannot be included in the conceptual module mentioned above therefore an ann model was used in the data driven module to capture the remaining information in the irrigation process that the conceptual module could not capture the details of the ann based data driven module are provided in section 3 1 2 3 1 1 conceptual module in the conceptual module daily crop water needs cwns were estimated cwns are mainly driven by weather conditions throughout the growing season considered in reference evapotranspiration and rainfall and cropping area and pattern in the study area the most important factor affecting crop water needs in a unit of area is reference evapotranspiration et0 which was estimated based on penman monteith equation recommended by fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e

c 1 in addition rainfall can act as irrigation water and hence decreases iwd however the relationship between iwd and rainfall is more complex heavy rainfalls after soil saturation often represented using a rainfall threshold can lead to runoff and deep percolation allen et al 1998 therefore a rainfall threshold has been defined to simulate runoff generation in reaction to rainfall in the conceptual module in other words only when rainfall reaches the threshold value runoff will be generated the equations below represent the formulation of the conceptual module 2 cwn i α s et 0 i a y β

season δ s θ s seasonal intercepts s 1 2 3 for spring summer non growing period the parameters of the conceptual module were calibrated by minimizing the mean squared error mse between the estimated cwns and the observed pumped volumes knowing there would be relatively large errors since not all the factors affecting iwd are represented in the conceptual module however this error will be corrected by the data driven module as explained above to avoid getting stuck in local minimum points patternsearch was employed from the global optimization toolbox in matlab unlike more traditional optimization algorithms this method does not require any information about the gradient of the objective function 3 1 2 data driven module in the data driven module an ann was utilized to correct the error between cwns and pumped water values an extensive range of variables can influence short term iwd directly or indirectly based on the interview with the farmers in the study area soil moisture levels a result of irrigation during past days and weather forecasts for the next days are the two substantial factors affecting water ordering decisions since farmers can order water from 1 to 7 day s prior to irrigation within certain volumetric limits due to equitable access to water seven lags of all the prospective inputs variables reference evapotranspiration et0 precipitation r maximum temperature tmax solar exposure se wind speed ws mean sea level pressure mslp and the output variable the pumped volumes pv were considered as input candidates furthermore forecasts of the mentioned weather variables over the next seven days have been included as candidate inputs given that farmers consider weather forecasts before placing an order in this study the perfect weather forecast assumption has been made by adopting observation values of the weather variables this way weather uncertainties can be avoided in the modeling process input and model structure selection are two of the main steps of data driven module development input selection include two stages 1 ranking inputs based on the degree of numerical association with daily demand values based on partial correlation and 2 determining the optimum number of inputs the partial correlation value quantifies the degree of association between two variables considering the effect of a set of controlling variables removed quantifying the numerical relationship between two variables based on the normal correlation coefficient could lead to misleading results if a third variable is numerically related to both variables therefore only the first input variable of the conceptual module of the hybrid framework was selected based on the correlation coefficient and the remaining inputs were selected based on partial correlation table below lists the first thirty ranked variables for the data driven module inputs based on the partial correlation analysis table 1 as mentioned earlier it is possible to improve the performance by adding more inputs when fitting a model this may however result in redundancy noise and therefore overfitting and bic reflects this by introducing a penalty term for the number of inputs in the model in the figure below bic values are presented for the calibration period of the models fitted with different numbers of inputs in total 11 variables including pvt 1 et0t pvt 7 et0t 7 pvt 2 rt 2 pvt 3 pvt 4 rt 4 et0t 1 and rt 1 are selected as the final set of predictors for the data driven module based on partial correlation analyses and the bayesian information criterion bic it should be noted that t i shows the ith lag of the variable where i ranges from 7 to 1 similarly t i shows the forecast of ith day after the current time step where i ranges from 1 to 7 fig 3 artificial neural network toolbox of matlab was employed to generate the data driven module following the steps of the ann model development process outlined in wu et al 2014 a multi layer perceptron mlp with one hidden layer was used in this study this is because mlp is one of the most widely used network architectures for water resources management and it has been proven to be effective in modeling most environmental systems wu et al 2014 model structure selection has two stages selecting the transfer functions and the number of nodes for the hidden layer since the number of nodes for the hidden layer affects the number of model parameters it is optimized using bic the training algorithm and transfer function were finalized by evaluating different combinations of training algorithms transfer functions and the number of hidden nodes based on the averaged mean squared error across 20 random seeds the training algorithms tested include levenberg marquardt bfgs quasi newton resilient backpropagation scaled conjugate gradient conjugate gradient with powell beale restarts fletcher powell conjugate gradient polak ribiére conjugate gradient one step secant and variable learning rate backpropagation the tested transfer functions for the hidden layer include log sigmoid hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and linear the numbers tested for the hidden layer nodes range from 5 to 20 the network weights and biases are initialized randomly based on specified distributions foresee and hagan 1997 the learning rate and momentum used are 0 01 and 0 9 the final model structure includes one hidden layer with five nodes and log sigmoid as the transfer function finally like any data driven model an mlp model can overfit the calibration data to avoid overfitting 75 of the calibration data was used for training and the remaining 25 was used as the testing data for early stopping 3 2 ann benchmarking model development for the benchmarking model the same data driven method as the hybrid model was used to map the candidate inputs to daily iwd values to evaluate the predictive performance of the hybrid model all the benchmarking model development details are the same as the data driven module of the hybrid model however there are two main differences the data driven module of the hybrid model was trained to produce residuals between the conceptual model not pumped volume values and observations as mentioned earlier because et0 and precipitation variables had already been used in the conceptual part of the model they were not included in the potential input set of the data driven module because crop need translated through et0 and rainfall of the day to be predicted are the most important information that farmers use for making irrigation decisions these two variables were preselected as input variables in the benchmarking model for the rest of the candidate inputs partial correlation analysis has been done to determine the level of association of each variable with other predictors table below lists the first thirty inputs of the benchmarking model finally seven variables were selected as the optimum number of inputs for the data driven benchmarking model because of the lowest bic value fig 4 these variables are et0t rt pvt 1 pvt 7 et0t 7 pvt 2 and pvt 3 also log sigmoid transfer function five neurons in the hidden layer and levenberg marquardt training algorithm were selected table 2 3 3 model evaluation the most important aspect of a forecasting model is the predictive ability during an independent testing period hence a leave one year out cross validation loocv technique was applied in this way available data was split into eight one year periods with one year being omitted from the calibration in turn and the omitted year used to evaluate the estimations re calibrating the model step by step gave the entire data a chance to be reflected in the independent validation periods in this study four different measures of root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse anomaly correlation coefficient acc and mean square skill score msss were applied to quantify the predictive performance rmse aggregates the magnitudes of errors difference between modeled values and observations for several data points into a single measure rmse measures accuracy by comparing different models for a particular dataset not between datasets as it is scale dependent nse equivalent to the coefficient of determination r2 is used to assess the predictive skill of hydrological models nse values closer to 1 suggest a model with more predictive skill acc is used to estimate the sharpness of forecasting or in better words the ability to forecast extreme values moreover msss shows the forecast skill in another way by quantifying accuracy relative to the long term monthly averaged irrigation demand in the equations below m i and o i are model output and observation of the ith day while c is long term mean monthly observation 2012 2020 and n is the number of observations 4 r m s e m i o i 2 n 5 n s e 1 m i o i 2 o i o i 2 6 a c c m i c o i c m i c 2 o i c 2 7 m s s s 1 m i c 2 n n 1 2 o i c 2 3 4 application of the models to produce iwd forecasts the hybrid and benchmarking models introduced above were applied one time step at a time over n n 1 2 7 days into the future to produce iwd forecasts up to 7 days ahead as shown in fig 5 this means forecasts of iwd for the next days were generated using modeled values from the previous time steps the process of predicting the first three lead times of the data driven benchmarking model has been depicted in fig 5 as we go forward in time because there is no observation for the pumped volume values after day t 1 the outputs of the previous lead days are used for the coming days as shown below 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration of the conceptual module calibrated values of the conceptual module parameters were summarized in the table below table 3 α and β values are the evapotranspiration and rainfall coefficients for early season sep to nov or stage 1 which is spring in victoria mid season dec to feb or stage 2 and non growing season mar to aug or stage 3 respectively as can be seen α has its highest value during the mid season period summer this was more or less expected because α acts like crop coefficients in a way that has its maximum value in the summer for the study area based on chalmers 2012 also rainfall plays a more significant role in compensating for irrigation water during the summer this is because soil moisture drops quicker during higher air temperatures in fig 6 the number of rainy days with different magnitudes of rainfall and optimized rainfall threshold are shown according to calibration results rainfalls heavier than 6 1 mm had the same effect as this threshold in reducing irrigation demand 4 2 hybrid model performance 4 2 1 overall model performance predictive ability during an independent testing period is the most important feature of a model that is why validation results provide more reliable knowledge about the model s predictive capacity fig 7 summarizes the calculated values of the four evaluation measures for seven lead times during validation these graphs show almost similar performance of the data driven and hybrid models in the first two lead times however this changes after the third lead time and the hybrid model starts to perform slightly better than the data driven model across all metrics the most interesting point is that the difference between the performance of the two models constantly grows with increasing lead times until 7 days when the performance of the hybrid model deteriorates and the difference in modelling error between the hybrid and the benchmarking model becomes smaller this diminishing benefits of the hybrid model at a long lead time of 7 days is most likely due to the fact that after a few days the benefits from including additional knowledge of the physical system represented by the conceptual module is no longer significant therefore the performance of the hybrid and benchmarking models become similar 4 2 2 model performance for the high demand period to explore the capacity of the two approaches in forecasting high demand values another analysis has been done on the top 10 demand values of the validation period fig 8 it shows consistent results with the findings on overall performance and slightly better forecasts of the hybrid model compared to the data driven model for the high season period this implies that the ability of the data driven model depends to a degree on the similarity of the input data to the training data therefore including even a small amount of system understanding could add to the reliability of the iwd forecasting models in addition the diminishing benefits of the hybrid model compared to the data driven benchmarking model at a long lead time of 7 days is more pronounced for the high demand periods this implies that high demand is not only driven by theoretical crop water needs represented by the conceptual module high irrigation demand is also likely driven by other factors that cannot be represented using a conceptual crop water need models e g farmers irrigation decision making behavior for example farmers are likely to water significantly more than what the crops actually needs when a hot and dry day is expected this highlights the importance to consider other including factors other than crop water needs in irrigation water demand forecast and further demonstrates the potential benefits of the hybrid model 4 2 3 model performance for the high rainfall days daily observed pumped volumes clearly show seasonality in demand behavior in the early season days demand starts to grow and during summer demand reaches its highest value where the role of modeling becomes more critical in informing system operators fig 9 shows how the hybrid and data driven benchmarking models perform during a high demand period 100 days of the validation period from oct 2017 to dec 2018 specifically when the system faces fluctuations in demand due to rainfall events according to this figure both models could produce demand variations during rainfall events to an acceptable degree the data driven benchmarking model sometimes has underestimated part of the rainfall compensating for irrigation water in contrast the hybrid model has overestimated this part during heavy rainfall events this kind of underestimation of high and overestimation of low values of observations is typical of models not just water demand models that rely on data fitting using objective functions that minimizes say sum squared errors this issue can potentially be addressed by using some other objective functions such as the kling gupta efficiency keg in addition the conceptual model data driven model and hybrid model are all simplified representations of the real system it is assumed that the system is stationary in input and output relationships but this assumption may not be valid for the data period moreover the performance of the two models is worse in general for the lead time of 7 days this is mainly due to the way the data driven module or benchmarking model is structured to produce irrigation demand forecast for a forecast period of 7 days because a traditional mlp model can only produce one point prediction at a time a recursive process as shown in fig 5 is used to produce predictions up to 7 days ahead in other words the prediction of day 7 will be based on predictions of day 6 as one of the input variables and prediction of day 6 will be based on predictions from day 5 etc therefore the modeling error of each lead time can accumulate and become larger as the lead time becomes longer this is one of the limitations of using a traditional ann model structure such as mlp this limitation can be addressed when more data are available for the development of more complicated data driven models such as recurrent neural networks that can better handle time series data 5 summary short term irrigation water demand iwd forecasts with high levels of accuracy can be very helpful in operational decisions of water supply systems iwd forecasting is challenging because of the biophysical and behavioral complexities involved in the irrigation process early studies have conceptualized the irrigation process based on underlying causes leading to water demand to model iwd however many recent studies have applied data driven techniques to map the relationship between these factors and water demand considering weather variables as the main influential factors of iwd to simplify the modeling process conceptual and data driven approaches have their advantages and disadvantages in this study a hybrid model was developed by combining the system understanding with data driven methods of forecasting short term irrigation demand the hybrid model consists of two modules one conceptual and the other data driven in the conceptual module daily crop needs were estimated using reference crop evapotranspiration rainfall and annual cropping pattern and area then in the data driven module residuals between the previously mentioned conceptual module outputs and the observed pumped volumes were trained to capture the remaining information between the inputs and the output the performance of the hybrid model was evaluated against that of a benchmarking model based on data driven technique only for an irrigation district in victoria australia the performance of these models was evaluated under the assumption of perfect weather forecasts for lead times 1 7 days ahead it has been found in this study that the hybrid model provided better outcomes for the validation period than the data driven benchmarking model an interesting finding was that the difference between the performance of the two models constantly grew with increasing lead times this implies that the ability of the data driven model depends to a degree on the similarity of the input set to training data therefore including even a basic amount of system understanding could improve the performance of iwd forecasts 6 conclusions this paper demonstrates the potential of improving short term irrigation demand forecasting by combining the system understanding with data driven methods in this study uncertainty associated with weather variables has not included one future research direction is to study how the uncertainty in weather forecasts will impact the performance of the hybrid model in many real world cases there are often limited data available which limits the type of data driven methods that can be used in the hybrid model with improved data collection practice more data will become available when more complicated data driven techniques that can better handle time series data can be investigated for the development of the hybrid model in addition given that the reliability of these models is highly dependent on data availability another future direction can be to evaluate the modeling results under different calibration time periods to examine how sensitive the outcomes are to data availability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9298,reliable short term forecasts of irrigation water demand iwd can provide useful information to help water supply system operators with day to day operating decisions forecasting iwd is a complex task due to different natural soil water crop and climate interactions and behavioral farmers decision making components of the irrigation process so far various approaches have been developed to estimate iwd values in different contexts one common approach is the application of data driven methods to map the relationship between the main influential factors and iwd data driven approaches often do not consider any conceptual understanding of the system in modeling iwd which has been found to be effective in improving the predictive performance when considered in this study a hybrid framework has been introduced and developed by incorporating existing physical knowledge of the system into a data driven model to predict iwd this framework consists of two modules in the first module a simple conceptual approach was implemented to model the understood factors leading to crop water needs using observation data in the second module a data driven model was used to capture the remaining relationships between inputs and the output in the irrigation process the proposed hybrid framework was then applied to estimate daily iwd up to 7 days ahead for an irrigation district in victoria australia results show that the integration of physical system understanding into data driven models can improve the performance of iwd forecasting models particularly during the high demand period in addition the hybrid framework provides improved system understanding and thus leads to increased capacity to support operational decisions keywords irrigation demand forecasting short term water demand hybrid modeling artificial neural networks lower murray water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction short term irrigation water demand iwd fluctuates due to a wide range of factors from weather variations hot periods or rainfall events to different pressures or opportunities that farmers may face in the real world therefore iwd forecasts can provide helpful insights into daily operational decisions for not only water suppliers but also agricultural businesses perera et al 2016 for example iwd forecasts will allow decision makers to distribute water optimally considering variable electricity tariffs and thus minimize energy costs perea et al 2015 iwd forecasts can also be useful in designing new irrigation systems or rehabilitating existing systems liao et al 2021 peng et al 2009 iwd forecasting is a challenging task mainly due to the uncertainty of the climate variables determining the demand for irrigation water such as evapotranspiration temperature and precipitation du et al 2017 meempatta et al 2019 therefore forecasts of different weather variables have been used as the principal inputs of the iwd forecasting models different modeling methods have been utilized to estimate iwd for various applications paul et al 2000 perea et al 2019 prasad et al 2006 pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 rao et al 1990 these methods can be classified into two categories conceptual and data driven models perera et al 2015 conceptual iwd models are developed by modeling key elements of the irrigation process e g soil water content balance or crop water needs and the relationships between them these models have been employed for different spatial from farm to system and temporal from lead times of 1 2 days to weeks scales conceptual models estimate the timing and amount of irrigation water by maximizing the production or benefit with different irrigation criteria such as broner 2005 srinivasan 2006 1 farmer s estimates of crop water needs which results in non optimal irrigation scheduling irrigating less or more than crop needs during some crop stages or in other words lower production or benefit levidow et al 2014 2 estimates of crop water needs using historical climate data perea et al 2017 3 estimates of irrigation water based on climate data and soil water balance garcã a et al 2018 gonzã lez perea et al 2014 4 estimates of irrigation water based on soil water data collected from soil moisture sensors ramadan et al 2018 soulis and elmaloglou 2018 a broad spectrum of modeling techniques has been used to calculate daily crop water requirements within the conceptual models from empirical or functional allen et al 1998 doorenbos et al 1979 doorenbos and agriculture organization rome 1975 to mechanistic approaches van aelst et al 1988 various items such as soil data crop characteristics crop patterns and weather forecasts have been used as the inputs of these models cai et al 2011 wang et al 2009 the primary drawback of the conceptual models is the narrow physical understanding of the system and irrigation process therefore the performance of these models is impacted by the way the irrigation process is represented by the model structure and input data cai et al 2011 ejieji and gowing 2000 wang et al 2009 wilks et al 1998 since not all the interactions between system elements are fully understood or can be modeled the conceptual models mainly consider irrigation water equivalent to crop water needs and do not incorporate any finer details calculated water needs do not necessarily provide acceptable estimates of actual water use or in other words consumer demand because other factors like local irrigation practices also affect the demand in addition the development of these models is often constrained by limited specific observation data in many irrigation systems increasing data availability specifically in the last two decades has led to the emergence of data driven approaches to simulate complex processes such as iwd fernandez garcia et al 2020 data driven models directly map the relationship between the driving factors of the irrigation water mainly weather variables and iwd without requiring any knowledge about the physical processes within the system pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 ticlavilca et al 2013 tikhamarine et al 2020 tung and yaseen 2020 data driven approaches employ a range of different statistical techniques from artificial intelligence to multivariate time series artificial intelligence based models have been the most popular in the context of short term iwd forecasting in some studies artificial intelligence has been used in combination with tools such as genetic algorithm or fuzzy logic to get better forecasts or address the limitations related to the quality or quantity of input data perea et al 2015 2019 pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 although data driven models have often successfully improved the predictive performance of iwd forecasting there are some concerns about these models because interactions in the system are modeled implicitly overfitting is a common problem for data driven models wu et al 2014 in addition it has been found in some studies that data driven models perform worse during periods of extreme higher or lower demand when it would be more beneficial for operators this is mainly due to the over generalization of these models when they are developed perea et al 2015 pulido calvo and gutierrez estrada 2009 conceptual and data driven approaches for iwd forecasting have advantages and disadvantages as explained above there are potential benefits to combining these two approaches so they can complement each other and improve the overall modeling performance hu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 these benefits have been explored and reported in different areas of water resources management hunter et al 2018 kraft et al 2022 mekonnen et al 2015 however in the context of iwd modeling very few studies have used hybrid approaches to improve the performance of the data driven models perera et al 2015 2016 and the majority of existing studies have applied data driven and conceptual approaches independently this study proposes a generic hybrid framework for forecasting irrigation water demand by combining two conventional modeling approaches and integrating understanding of the physical system with data driven techniques the hybrid model framework consists of two modules one conceptual and one data driven in the conceptual module daily crop needs are estimated using reference crop evapotranspiration rainfall and annual cropping pattern and area in the data driven module the remaining residual information between the previously mentioned conceptual module outputs and the observed pumped volumes is captured this framework is then tested on a real world case study in red cliffs irrigation district of lower murray water lmw area of operations in victoria australia to predict daily irrigation demand in addition the performance of this hybrid modeling framework is compared with a benchmarking model developed using data driven techniques only this study demonstrates that the hybrid modeling framework leads to improved performance compared to a data driven modeling approach on its own this study introduces a new perspective to other researchers working on short term forecasting of irrigation water the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows the study area is introduced in the next section followed by the details of the proposed model in the third section in section 4 the corresponding results are presented and discussed and lastly a summary of the paper and conclusions are provided 2 study area and data red cliffs irrigation district with 32 km2 of irrigated area is located in lower murray water lmw area of operations victoria australia fig 1 agriculture in this district is dominated by wine grape plantings table grapes and dried grapes with drip irrigation as the most widely used irrigation method the current irrigation efficiency in the area is approximately 85 automated connections of this modernized system provide daily pumped flow values from 1979 the daily value of pumped water to the irrigation district is used as a surrogate for iwd in this study lmw also provides data on crop types development of permanent crops planting trends irrigation developments and irrigation methods in the study area from 1997 to 2018 every three years however in this paper eight years of data from sep 2012 to aug 2020 were chosen as the study period this was because the cropping pattern almost remained the same during this time daily values of weather variables were obtained from the bureau of meteorology bom for mildura airport station for the study period sep 2012 to aug 2020 these variables include daily rainfall r mm daily maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin c daily relative humidity rh bright sunshine hours se in the 24 h midnight to midnight local time h wind speed ws km h 1 and daily mean sea level pressure mslp hpa furthermore fao penman monteith method was used to

particular place and time of the year and does not include any crop characteristics and soil factors apart from the mentioned cropping data and daily climate variables seven lags of daily pumped water volumes pv ml to the irrigation district prior to the day of prediction were used as the inputs of the iwd forecasting models in this study as well 3 methodology 3 1 hybrid model development the hybrid modeling framework as illustrated in fig 2 consists of two modules 1 conceptual and 2 data driven daily crop water needs cwn were calculated using the conceptual module based on daily weather variables and annual cropping area in first reference evapotranspiration et0 was estimated based on climate variables such as temperature humidity radiation and wind speed then together with daily rainfall and cropping area et0 values were used to estimate cwn throughout the growing season details of the conceptual module are discussed in section 3 1 1 apart from crop water needs irrigation demand also depends on a range of other factors such as farmers irrigation strategies different interpretations of uncertain weather forecasts and a degree of randomness that cannot be included in the conceptual module mentioned above therefore an ann model was used in the data driven module to capture the remaining information in the irrigation process that the conceptual module could not capture the details of the ann based data driven module are provided in section 3 1 2 3 1 1 conceptual module in the conceptual module daily crop water needs cwns were estimated cwns are mainly driven by weather conditions throughout the growing season considered in reference evapotranspiration and rainfall and cropping area and pattern in the study area the most important factor affecting crop water needs in a unit of area is reference evapotranspiration et0 which was estimated based on penman monteith equation recommended by fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e

c 1 in addition rainfall can act as irrigation water and hence decreases iwd however the relationship between iwd and rainfall is more complex heavy rainfalls after soil saturation often represented using a rainfall threshold can lead to runoff and deep percolation allen et al 1998 therefore a rainfall threshold has been defined to simulate runoff generation in reaction to rainfall in the conceptual module in other words only when rainfall reaches the threshold value runoff will be generated the equations below represent the formulation of the conceptual module 2 cwn i α s et 0 i a y β

cwns and the observed pumped volumes knowing there would be relatively large errors since not all the factors affecting iwd are represented in the conceptual module however this error will be corrected by the data driven module as explained above to avoid getting stuck in local minimum points patternsearch was employed from the global optimization toolbox in matlab unlike more traditional optimization algorithms this method does not require any information about the gradient of the objective function 3 1 2 data driven module in the data driven module an ann was utilized to correct the error between cwns and pumped water values an extensive range of variables can influence short term iwd directly or indirectly based on the interview with the farmers in the study area soil moisture levels a result of irrigation during past days and weather forecasts for the next days are the two substantial factors affecting water ordering decisions since farmers can order water from 1 to 7 day s prior to irrigation within certain volumetric limits due to equitable access to water seven lags of all the prospective inputs variables reference evapotranspiration et0 precipitation r maximum temperature tmax solar exposure se wind speed ws mean sea level pressure mslp and the output variable the pumped volumes pv were considered as input candidates furthermore forecasts of the mentioned weather variables over the next seven days have been included as candidate inputs given that farmers consider weather forecasts before placing an order in this study the perfect weather forecast assumption has been made by adopting observation values of the weather variables this way weather uncertainties can be avoided in the modeling process input and model structure selection are two of the main steps of data driven module development input selection include two stages 1 ranking inputs based on the degree of numerical association with daily demand values based on partial correlation and 2 determining the optimum number of inputs the partial correlation value quantifies the degree of association between two variables considering the effect of a set of controlling variables removed quantifying the numerical relationship between two variables based on the normal correlation coefficient could lead to misleading results if a third variable is numerically related to both variables therefore only the first input variable of the conceptual module of the hybrid framework was selected based on the correlation coefficient and the remaining inputs were selected based on partial correlation table below lists the first thirty ranked variables for the data driven module inputs based on the partial correlation analysis table 1 as mentioned earlier it is possible to improve the performance by adding more inputs when fitting a model this may however result in redundancy noise and therefore overfitting and bic reflects this by introducing a penalty term for the number of inputs in the model in the figure below bic values are presented for the calibration period of the models fitted with different numbers of inputs in total 11 variables including pvt 1 et0t pvt 7 et0t 7 pvt 2 rt 2 pvt 3 pvt 4 rt 4 et0t 1 and rt 1 are selected as the final set of predictors for the data driven module based on partial correlation analyses and the bayesian information criterion bic it should be noted that t i shows the ith lag of the variable where i ranges from 7 to 1 similarly t i shows the forecast of ith day after the current time step where i ranges from 1 to 7 fig 3 artificial neural network toolbox of matlab was employed to generate the data driven module following the steps of the ann model development process outlined in wu et al 2014 a multi layer perceptron mlp with one hidden layer was used in this study this is because mlp is one of the most widely used network architectures for water resources management and it has been proven to be effective in modeling most environmental systems wu et al 2014 model structure selection has two stages selecting the transfer functions and the number of nodes for the hidden layer since the number of nodes for the hidden layer affects the number of model parameters it is optimized using bic the training algorithm and transfer function were finalized by evaluating different combinations of training algorithms transfer functions and the number of hidden nodes based on the averaged mean squared error across 20 random seeds the training algorithms tested include levenberg marquardt bfgs quasi newton resilient backpropagation scaled conjugate gradient conjugate gradient with powell beale restarts fletcher powell conjugate gradient polak ribiére conjugate gradient one step secant and variable learning rate backpropagation the tested transfer functions for the hidden layer include log sigmoid hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and linear the numbers tested for the hidden layer nodes range from 5 to 20 the network weights and biases are initialized randomly based on specified distributions foresee and hagan 1997 the learning rate and momentum used are 0 01 and 0 9 the final model structure includes one hidden layer with five nodes and log sigmoid as the transfer function finally like any data driven model an mlp model can overfit the calibration data to avoid overfitting 75 of the calibration data was used for training and the remaining 25 was used as the testing data for early stopping 3 2 ann benchmarking model development for the benchmarking model the same data driven method as the hybrid model was used to map the candidate inputs to daily iwd values to evaluate the predictive performance of the hybrid model all the benchmarking model development details are the same as the data driven module of the hybrid model however there are two main differences the data driven module of the hybrid model was trained to produce residuals between the conceptual model not pumped volume values and observations as mentioned earlier because et0 and precipitation variables had already been used in the conceptual part of the model they were not included in the potential input set of the data driven module because crop need translated through et0 and rainfall of the day to be predicted are the most important information that farmers use for making irrigation decisions these two variables were preselected as input variables in the benchmarking model for the rest of the candidate inputs partial correlation analysis has been done to determine the level of association of each variable with other predictors table below lists the first thirty inputs of the benchmarking model finally seven variables were selected as the optimum number of inputs for the data driven benchmarking model because of the lowest bic value fig 4 these variables are et0t rt pvt 1 pvt 7 et0t 7 pvt 2 and pvt 3 also log sigmoid transfer function five neurons in the hidden layer and levenberg marquardt training algorithm were selected table 2 3 3 model evaluation the most important aspect of a forecasting model is the predictive ability during an independent testing period hence a leave one year out cross validation loocv technique was applied in this way available data was split into eight one year periods with one year being omitted from the calibration in turn and the omitted year used to evaluate the estimations re calibrating the model step by step gave the entire data a chance to be reflected in the independent validation periods in this study four different measures of root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse anomaly correlation coefficient acc and mean square skill score msss were applied to quantify the predictive performance rmse aggregates the magnitudes of errors difference between modeled values and observations for several data points into a single measure rmse measures accuracy by comparing different models for a particular dataset not between datasets as it is scale dependent nse equivalent to the coefficient of determination r2 is used to assess the predictive skill of hydrological models nse values closer to 1 suggest a model with more predictive skill acc is used to estimate the sharpness of forecasting or in better words the ability to forecast extreme values moreover msss shows the forecast skill in another way by quantifying accuracy relative to the long term monthly averaged irrigation demand in the equations below m i and o i are model output and observation of the ith day while c is long term mean monthly observation 2012 2020 and n is the number of observations 4 r m s e m i o i 2 n 5 n s e 1 m i o i 2 o i o i 2 6 a c c m i c o i c m i c 2 o i c 2 7 m s s s 1 m i c 2 n n 1 2 o i c 2 3 4 application of the models to produce iwd forecasts the hybrid and benchmarking models introduced above were applied one time step at a time over n n 1 2 7 days into the future to produce iwd forecasts up to 7 days ahead as shown in fig 5 this means forecasts of iwd for the next days were generated using modeled values from the previous time steps the process of predicting the first three lead times of the data driven benchmarking model has been depicted in fig 5 as we go forward in time because there is no observation for the pumped volume values after day t 1 the outputs of the previous lead days are used for the coming days as shown below 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration of the conceptual module calibrated values of the conceptual module parameters were summarized in the table below table 3 α and β values are the evapotranspiration and rainfall coefficients for early season sep to nov or stage 1 which is spring in victoria mid season dec to feb or stage 2 and non growing season mar to aug or stage 3 respectively as can be seen α has its highest value during the mid season period summer this was more or less expected because α acts like crop coefficients in a way that has its maximum value in the summer for the study area based on chalmers 2012 also rainfall plays a more significant role in compensating for irrigation water during the summer this is because soil moisture drops quicker during higher air temperatures in fig 6 the number of rainy days with different magnitudes of rainfall and optimized rainfall threshold are shown according to calibration results rainfalls heavier than 6 1 mm had the same effect as this threshold in reducing irrigation demand 4 2 hybrid model performance 4 2 1 overall model performance predictive ability during an independent testing period is the most important feature of a model that is why validation results provide more reliable knowledge about the model s predictive capacity fig 7 summarizes the calculated values of the four evaluation measures for seven lead times during validation these graphs show almost similar performance of the data driven and hybrid models in the first two lead times however this changes after the third lead time and the hybrid model starts to perform slightly better than the data driven model across all metrics the most interesting point is that the difference between the performance of the two models constantly grows with increasing lead times until 7 days when the performance of the hybrid model deteriorates and the difference in modelling error between the hybrid and the benchmarking model becomes smaller this diminishing benefits of the hybrid model at a long lead time of 7 days is most likely due to the fact that after a few days the benefits from including additional knowledge of the physical system represented by the conceptual module is no longer significant therefore the performance of the hybrid and benchmarking models become similar 4 2 2 model performance for the high demand period to explore the capacity of the two approaches in forecasting high demand values another analysis has been done on the top 10 demand values of the validation period fig 8 it shows consistent results with the findings on overall performance and slightly better forecasts of the hybrid model compared to the data driven model for the high season period this implies that the ability of the data driven model depends to a degree on the similarity of the input data to the training data therefore including even a small amount of system understanding could add to the reliability of the iwd forecasting models in addition the diminishing benefits of the hybrid model compared to the data driven benchmarking model at a long lead time of 7 days is more pronounced for the high demand periods this implies that high demand is not only driven by theoretical crop water needs represented by the conceptual module high irrigation demand is also likely driven by other factors that cannot be represented using a conceptual crop water need models e g farmers irrigation decision making behavior for example farmers are likely to water significantly more than what the crops actually needs when a hot and dry day is expected this highlights the importance to consider other including factors other than crop water needs in irrigation water demand forecast and further demonstrates the potential benefits of the hybrid model 4 2 3 model performance for the high rainfall days daily observed pumped volumes clearly show seasonality in demand behavior in the early season days demand starts to grow and during summer demand reaches its highest value where the role of modeling becomes more critical in informing system operators fig 9 shows how the hybrid and data driven benchmarking models perform during a high demand period 100 days of the validation period from oct 2017 to dec 2018 specifically when the system faces fluctuations in demand due to rainfall events according to this figure both models could produce demand variations during rainfall events to an acceptable degree the data driven benchmarking model sometimes has underestimated part of the rainfall compensating for irrigation water in contrast the hybrid model has overestimated this part during heavy rainfall events this kind of underestimation of high and overestimation of low values of observations is typical of models not just water demand models that rely on data fitting using objective functions that minimizes say sum squared errors this issue can potentially be addressed by using some other objective functions such as the kling gupta efficiency keg in addition the conceptual model data driven model and hybrid model are all simplified representations of the real system it is assumed that the system is stationary in input and output relationships but this assumption may not be valid for the data period moreover the performance of the two models is worse in general for the lead time of 7 days this is mainly due to the way the data driven module or benchmarking model is structured to produce irrigation demand forecast for a forecast period of 7 days because a traditional mlp model can only produce one point prediction at a time a recursive process as shown in fig 5 is used to produce predictions up to 7 days ahead in other words the prediction of day 7 will be based on predictions of day 6 as one of the input variables and prediction of day 6 will be based on predictions from day 5 etc therefore the modeling error of each lead time can accumulate and become larger as the lead time becomes longer this is one of the limitations of using a traditional ann model structure such as mlp this limitation can be addressed when more data are available for the development of more complicated data driven models such as recurrent neural networks that can better handle time series data 5 summary short term irrigation water demand iwd forecasts with high levels of accuracy can be very helpful in operational decisions of water supply systems iwd forecasting is challenging because of the biophysical and behavioral complexities involved in the irrigation process early studies have conceptualized the irrigation process based on underlying causes leading to water demand to model iwd however many recent studies have applied data driven techniques to map the relationship between these factors and water demand considering weather variables as the main influential factors of iwd to simplify the modeling process conceptual and data driven approaches have their advantages and disadvantages in this study a hybrid model was developed by combining the system understanding with data driven methods of forecasting short term irrigation demand the hybrid model consists of two modules one conceptual and the other data driven in the conceptual module daily crop needs were estimated using reference crop evapotranspiration rainfall and annual cropping pattern and area then in the data driven module residuals between the previously mentioned conceptual module outputs and the observed pumped volumes were trained to capture the remaining information between the inputs and the output the performance of the hybrid model was evaluated against that of a benchmarking model based on data driven technique only for an irrigation district in victoria australia the performance of these models was evaluated under the assumption of perfect weather forecasts for lead times 1 7 days ahead it has been found in this study that the hybrid model provided better outcomes for the validation period than the data driven benchmarking model an interesting finding was that the difference between the performance of the two models constantly grew with increasing lead times this implies that the ability of the data driven model depends to a degree on the similarity of the input set to training data therefore including even a basic amount of system understanding could improve the performance of iwd forecasts 6 conclusions this paper demonstrates the potential of improving short term irrigation demand forecasting by combining the system understanding with data driven methods in this study uncertainty associated with weather variables has not included one future research direction is to study how the uncertainty in weather forecasts will impact the performance of the hybrid model in many real world cases there are often limited data available which limits the type of data driven methods that can be used in the hybrid model with improved data collection practice more data will become available when more complicated data driven techniques that can better handle time series data can be investigated for the development of the hybrid model in addition given that the reliability of these models is highly dependent on data availability another future direction can be to evaluate the modeling results under different calibration time periods to examine how sensitive the outcomes are to data availability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9299,controlled drainage is an important measure to improve salinized soil in arid and semi arid areas however free drainage during the growth period leads to excessive water loss and crops lack water in the later growth period resulting in crop yield reduction therefore in arid and semi arid areas soil salts should be leached during the non growing period and drainage should be controlled during the growing period to ensure that crops have adequate water absorption and utilization improve soil water availability for optimal water supply and salinity control in this study through field trials in 2020 and 2021 3 treatments were set up the depth of free drainage fd is common subsurface pipe drainage and the controlled drainage in the growth period were 40 cm cwt1 and 70 cm cwt2 respectively and the drainage depth in the non growing period was 100 cm using the hydrus 2d model to simulate the dynamic changes of soil water and salts in the 0 100 cm range the calibration and validation of the hydrus 2d model were performed using the measured soil water and salt content values of 2020 and 2021 the results showed that the simulated soil water and salt contents agreed well with the measured contents controlled drainage cd is a new agricultural drainage management practice that involves periodically increasing the outlet elevation of subsurface drainage pipes cd significantly increased the water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer especially at 0 40 cm depth after growth stage irrigation under fd cwt1 and cwt2 the 2 year mean soil water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer after growth stage irrigation in 2020 and 2021 was respectively 0 263 0 278 and 0 267 cm3 cm 3 with the latter two values being higher by 5 70 and 1 52 than the former value respectively soil water uptake by sunflower after irrigation mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm soil layer which contributed 55 88 78 51 of the total soil water uptake soil re salinization occurred in the late growth stage the flowering stage under different treatments with a mean re salinization rate relative to the period before spring irrigation of 29 29 33 48 and 30 34 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively although the re salinization rate was relatively high under cwt1 and cwt2 it had a low effect on crop growth as well as crop yield hydrus 2d simulation was performed to compare different drain depths in the growth stage in order to determine the optimal drain depth for sunflower in moderately saline soils to this end the following metrics were considered for the main root zone 0 40 cm soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate in the late growth stage reduce soil salt content during spring irrigation increase soil water content after irrigation during growth period and minimize soil salt return rate in late growth stage that is to provide suitable water conditions for crop growth and minimize salt stress the optimal drain depth during the growth stage was ultimately determined to be 50 cm keywords water and salt transport saline irrigation area controlled drainage sunflower hydrus 2d data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil salinization is an important constraint to sustainable agricultural development singh 2015 srivastava et al 2019 and is a global agro environmental problem inhibiting crop growth reducing crop yields and quality and decreasing fertilizer use efficiency liu et al 2021 the hetao irrigation district a typical saline irrigation area is affected by soil salinization mao et al 2017 2022 wei et al 2021 the area of soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia is about 333 300 ha accounting for 63 8 of the total cultivated land and it will continue to spread dou et al 2022 subsurface pipe drainage has recently been widely adopted in this area to improve the saline soils mainly in combination with soil leaching to remove soil salts in the non growth stage of crops which not only accelerates soil de salination but also effectively lowers the groundwater table so as to inhibit soil re salination dou et al 2021 meanwhile this area is also subject to water shortage stress and thus it is extremely important to achieve the rational and efficient use of water resources for farmlands in this region kang et al 2016 however the use of subsurface pipes for free drainage fd is prone to excessive drainage and thus the rapid loss of water from farmlands resulting in crop drought stress between two irrigation cycles chi et al 2021 by contrast controlled drainage cd in the growth stage can improve water availability retain soil moisture and improve water use efficiency he et al 2019 negm et al 2017 ng et al 2002 therefore it is desirable to conduct fd in the non growth stage to reduce soil salt content but cd in the growth stage to improve water availability and reduce water loss which is important for improving saline soils and mitigating drought stress in the hetao irrigation district and potentially even in the northwest arid zone dou et al 2021 cd also known as drainage water management dwm is a new agricultural drainage management practice that involves periodically increasing the outlet elevation of subsurface drainage pipes skaggs et al 2012 to reduce drainage water volume he et al 2019 and nitrogen n and phosphorous p losses king et al 2022 ross et al 2016 it can adequately regulate soil water content williams et al 2015 and improve the use efficiency of irrigation water and nutrients while reducing environmental pollution wang 2010 the underlying idea of cd is to drain water not only as needed but also as precisely as possible skaggs et al 2012 cd has evolved through several stages luo et al 2013 from the earliest stage focusing on soil moisture conservation and crop yield enhancement ayars et al 2006a to the latest stage focusing on pollutant reduction hornbuckle et al 2005 luo et al 2010 and irrigation water conservation tian et al 2006 as the research and applications of cd have become more extensive cd has emerged as the best water management practice for achieving sustainable agricultural development and production in areas facing drainage problems in arid zones subsurface pipe drainage plays a crucial role in controlling the soil salt content in the root zone of crops and preventing salt accumulation in the soil profile sietan 2005 zhang et al 2018 however subsurface pipe drainage systems are usually designed for continuous drainage without considering water and nutrient losses nor their impacts on crop production ayars et al 2006b cd is a subsurface pipe drainage based management measure that achieves crop production sustainability it represents a reasonable measure for improving agricultural water management and reducing subsurface drainage induced environmental pollution while neither decreasing crop yields nor increasing costs youssef et al 2018 recently cd has increasingly drawn attention and has been implemented globally this measure is generally considered to be able to reduce the volume of drainage water ingrid et al 2003 adjust the groundwater table davoodi et al 2019 improve water availability tolomio and borin 2019 and delay the onset of water stress on crops in arid zones ayars et al 2006a while achieving water conservation skaggs et al 2010 it also can reduce n and p loads to reduce environmental pollution wesström and messing 2007 while increasing crop yields jouni et al 2018 nevertheless some studies have shown that cd has little or no effect on crop yields wang et al 2020 he et al 2014 showed that cd slowed the rate of groundwater table decline in farmland within the first week after irrigation and fertilizer application which increased soil water availability in the farmland moreover the groundwater table could be maintained at relatively high levels by using a cd structure so as to reduce the hydraulic gradient decrease root zone leakage and increase potential crop water use from groundwater as groundwater is relatively rich in salts ayars et al 2006b and crops in the growth stage are less subject to salt stress than in the non growth stage it is desirable to decrease the soil salt content in the non growth stage but perform cd during the growth stage to ensure sufficient water uptake by the crops thus it is necessary to adjust the drain depth of a cd structure or the spacing of subsurface pipes as appropriate and determine the appropriate drainage timing according to local conditions so as to improve both economic and environmental performance a combination of field experiments with numerical simulations may serve as a more convenient and effective approach to obtain predict and validate the dynamics of various drainage indicators in farmlands to date the main models on subsurface pipe drainage are hydrus 2d 3d drainmod swat and rzwqm2 all of which can well simulate farmland drainage processes solute transport mechanisms and crop yields with drainmod swat and rzwqm2 being widely applied to the simulation of farmland hydrological processes soil nitrogen dynamics and crop yields luo et al 2001 addab and bailey 2022 bailey et al 2022 fang et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 in particular hydrus 2d 3d performs well in simulating soil water and salt contents in agricultural soils and has flexible boundary conditions for the accurate simulation of water and salt transport processes in 2 d unsaturated soils castanheira and serralheiro 2010 liu et al 2021 some studies li et al 2016a 2016b used hydrus 2d to calibrate and validate soil water salt transport parameters under subsurface pipe drainage and showed that the model can sufficiently accurately simulate soil water salt dynamics ebrahimian and noory 2014 showed that hydrus 2d is a powerful tool for subsurface drainage design in farmlands and provided a theoretical basis for how to identify suitable drainage schemes in farmlands through the simulation of burial depth subsurface pipe spacing and soil texture qian et al 2019 showed that hydrus 2d can well simulate soil water salt transport processes in arid zones where both irrigation and subsurface pipe drainage are conducted in a coordinated manner the authors also proposed an empirical relationship between the drainage to irrigation ratio and the subsurface pipe layout parameters in arid zones to calculate the suitable combination of pipe spacing and burial depth so as to develop an economical and reasonable layout for subsurface pipes in arid zones the hydrus 2d model is widely used in hetao irrigation area this model can better simulate soil moisture salinity and nutrients and provide theoretical basis for local farmland water saving salt control and nutrient utilization chen et al 2019 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 although the hetao irrigation district is a typical saline irrigation area both the crop and soil water salt statuses under subsurface controlled drainage remain to be systematically investigated in order to gain a thorough understanding of the regulatory effect of subsurface controlled drainage on both crop growth and soil water salt contents the hetao irrigation district currently faces severe soil salinization which results in poor soil permeability generally irrigation is not carried out in the middle and late growth stages of sunflower as it would cause severe seedling death however sunflower in the late growth stage is in a water deficit state and thus it necessary to conduct cd to provide a suitable amount of water for the sunflower plants and minimize soil re salination in this period given the above context this study aimed to explore the effects of drainage method on soil water content and soil salt transport processes in the moderately saline soils of the hetao irrigation district specifically cd was conducted in the growth stage after spring irrigation and consequent soil salt leaching in order to optimize water supply and salt control moreover a hydrus 2d model was used to provide deeper insights into the dynamics of the soil crop system in response to various drainage methods and identify the optimal drain depth for sunflower farmlands in the growth stage for achieving efficient water use 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the test field 40 45 28 n 108

three replicates per plot and a total of nine plots the three treatments were an fd treatment and two cd treatments cwt1 and cwt2 the latter two were conducted only in the growth stage having a drain depth of 40 cm and 70 cm respectively during the spring irrigation a drain depth of 100 cm was used for all plots fig 2 in the test area of the subsurface pipe drainage two subsurface pipes were buried at a depth of 100 cm in each with a pipe spacing of 20 m a pipe diameter of 80 mm and a pipe slope of 0 1 each plot was 40 m long and 30 m wide with 10 m spacing between the two plots a protection zone was set up around each plot where pvc plastic sheets were buried at a depth of 1 m as isolation materials to prevent mutual interference the test area was subjected to laser controlled

this study 2 3 4 soil de salination rate soil de salination rate is defined as the percent decrease in soil salt content relative to the initial soil salt content which is an indicator of the joint performance of irrigation and subsurface pipe drainage in desalination a given soil layer in a given plot the soil de salination rate was calculated according to the following formula 6 n s 1 s 2 s 1

standard plants were chosen in the rows other than the side rows of each plot and their height leaf width and leaf length were measured every 7 10 days using a measuring tape accurate to 0 1 cm the leaf area index was calculated as 0 75 leaf width leaf length fig 4 allen et al 1998 when the sunflower matured 20 standard plants in the non side rows of each plot were chosen and harvested for seed testing and yield measurement crop water productivity wp c ratio between the marketable yield produced by a crop and the water consumed by the crop or crop evapotranspiration et c fernández et al 2020 2 3 6 sample collection and determination of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes for collecting water samples from soils a 0 100 cm soil profile was collected using a soil auger divided into six layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm and stored in self sealing bags separately the xylem water from sunflower was collected from the chlorophyll free basal stem where isotopic fractionation due to plant transpiration was absent specifically the sunflower stem 5 cm below the ground surface was cut at 12 00 14 00 on sunny days during the growth stage and stored in self sealing bags irrigation water was collected in sampling bottles and filtered the soil water and xylem water were extracted by vacuum low temperature distillation using a plant soil moisture vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica china the extracted water was sealed and quickly refrigerated to prevent evaporation and isotopic fractionation sampling was carried out 1 day before growth stage irrigation 5 days and 10 days after growth stage irrigation the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of the water samples were determined according to the following formula using a liquid isotope analyzer lgr drt 100 7 δ 18 o or δ d r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard represent the molar ratio between the two hydrogen or oxygen isotopes 18o 16o or d h of the sample and the standard respectively with a measurement standard deviation 0 1 for δ 18o and 0 2 for δd a bayesian model mixsiar model was used to calculate the depth of water uptake by the crops and the amount of water extracted from each soil layer to determine the contribution of each soil layer to the total water uptake bayesian mixed models have advantages over simple linear mixing models in estimating the probability distributions of source contributions which combines multiple sources of uncertainty isotopic characteristics and isotopic fractionation moore and semmens 2008 zhu et al 2021 written in the r language the mixsiar model estimates a posterior probability density function by using markov chain monte carlo mcmc to incorporate fractionation parameters with a large number of observation data for a series of maximizations or simulations wu et al 2019 before running the bayesian model mixsiar model some data files need to be edited as follows mix data txt file containing

model fundamentals soil water salt transport in a subsurface pipe drainage system of sunflower farmland was simulated using the hydrus 2d model šimůnek et al 2008 based on a finite element equation

hydrus 2d database šimůnek et al 2016 the reduction in rwu due to salt stress was simulated using two salt stress factors one being a salt content threshold and the other being the slope of a salt stress function that describes the fractional decline in rwu per unit increase in salt content below the threshold the two salt stress factors were set to 2 2 g kg 1 above which rwu did not continue to decrease and 14 respectively karandish and šimůnek 2018 2 4 3 initial and boundary conditions the simulation area was a rectangle shape 120 cm wide and 170 cm deep where the maximum groundwater table depth was measured to be 167 cm as illustrated in fig 2 the simulation area had the following boundary conditions 1 the upper boundary was comprised of a mulched zone and a non mulched zone with the former zone set to have no flow boundary condition and the latter zone set to atmosphere to apply precipitation irrigation and potential evaporation ep boundary condition 2 the left and right boundaries were assigned a no flow bc 3 a variable pressure head boundary was used at the bottom where the pressure head was set to a specific value on a daily basis and 4 the subsurface pipe boundary was used as the seepage boundary the simulation area was discretized in time and space using a non uniform finite element mesh generated by the hydrus 2d model the soil water and salt contents measured before the start of the test in a given year were used as the initial conditions for simulation the volumetric soil water content at the top and bottom of the simulation area was 0 29 and 0 38 cm3 cm 3 respectively where the salt content was 6 24 and 0 45 g kg 1 respectively for solute transport the following boundary conditions were further set up 1 a third type boundary condition was imposed on the non mulched zone the lower boundary and the subsurface pipe boundary and 2 the left and right boundaries were considered as flux free boundaries for cd the simulation results at all nodes in a given simulation step were used as the initial inputs at the same nodes for the next simulation step while adjusting the time step according to the number of iterations required for convergence 2 4 4 model parameters soil hydraulic parameters θ s θ r n m α k s table 2 were predicted using the pedotransfer function rosetta based on the dry bulk density sand content silt content and clay content of the soil and then calibrated by comparing the simulated vs monitored values of soil water and salt contents the longitudinal dispersity of the soil was set to 30 70 cm while the lateral dispersity was set to one tenth of the former radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 given that molecular diffusivity is usually negligible the molecular diffusion coefficient was set to zero in this study 2 4 5 model performance evaluation model parameters were first calibrated using the 2020 data of soil water and salt contents and then validated using the 2021 data with the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r 2 as the calibration and validation metrics 15 mre 1 n i 1 n s i m i m i 100 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 17 r 2 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 here s i is the i th simulated value m i is the i th measured value n is the number of observation points and m is the mean of all measured values 3 results and analysis 3 1 model evaluation the calibration and validation of the hydrus 2d model were performed using the measured soil water and salt content values of 2020 and 2021 respectively as shown by the mre rmse and r 2 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 table 3 the prediction was in good agreement with the measurement indicating that the model performance met the requirements of the soil water and salt content simulation for the model calibration of soil water content and soil salt content the model had an mre of 8 45 11 22 and 10 28 12 48 an rmse of 0 03 0 06 cm3 cm 3 and 0 04 0 07 g kg 1 and an r 2 of 0 80 0 92 and 0 76 0 88 respectively for the model validation of soil water content and soil salt content the model had an mre of 8 44 12 78 and 10 41 13 44 an rmse of 0 02 0 07 cm3 cm 3 and 0 03 0 08 g kg 1 and an r 2 of 0 78 0 85 and 0 78 0 82 respectively model simulation performance was better for fd than for cd likely because the simulation results during the spring irrigation period were later used as the inputs for the simulation during the cd period moreover soil water and salt contents were more subject to irrigation and precipitation for the 0 20 cm soil layer than for the 20 100 cm soil layer and therefore the simulation results for the former layer were subject to higher errors however the errors were still within the acceptable range in summary the hydrus 2d model can well simulate soil water and salt contents under cd conditions 3 2 effect of drainage method on soil water content as each farm plot was wide each plot was 40 m long and 30 m wide the soil water content at a horizontal distance of 0 2 5 5 and 10 m from the subsurface pipe was averaged to represent the overall soil water content of the plot fig 5 the entire crop growth period was divided into three stages to distinguish the effect of the soil water content of irrigated farmland the first stage was the spring irrigation period doy 131 152 in 2020 and doy 134 155 in 2021 when there was no significant difference among the three treatments because they all had the same drain depth of 100 cm the second stage spanned from sowing to before growth stage irrigation doy153 199 in 2020 and doy156 207 in 2021 when the difference in soil water content among the different treatments was small because of the joint influence of cd and precipitation in the period of doy153 199 in 2020 the soil water content was higher by only 0 91 and 0 20 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd in the 0 20 cm soil layer respectively it was higher by 0 51 and 0 12 in the 20 40 cm soil layer and by 0 22 and 0 08 in the 40 60 cm soil layer while it was basically identical in the 60 100 cm soil layer a similar trend was observed for the second stage of 2021 as well with the soil water content being higher by only 0 46 and 0 11 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd in the 0 60 cm soil layer respectively the third stage spanned from the end of growth stage irrigation to harvest doy200 274 in 2020 and doy208 276 in 2021 when there was a significant difference in soil water content among the different treatments due to the significant performance of the cd system in the third stage of 2020 the soil water content was higher by 7 49 3 56 2 44 and 2 34 under cwt1 than fd in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers respectively as well as by 3 81 1 96 1 64 and 1 29 under cwt2 than fd in the same soil layers respectively in the third stage of 2021 soil water content was higher by 4 16 and 2 67 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd in the whole 0 100 cm soil layer respectively as shown above cd led to significant changes in soil water content in the middle and late stages of crop growth in particular cd after growth stage irrigation led to significant changes in soil water content at 0 100 cm depth especially at 0 40 cm depth the 2 year mean soil water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer was 0 263 0 278 and 0 267 cm3 cm 3 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively with the latter two values being higher by 5 70 and 1 52 than the former value respectively these findings demonstrate that cd ensures sufficient water uptake by crops and improves soil water availability 3 3 effect of drainage method on water uptake in irrigated farmland given the small differences between 2020 and 2021 in the effects of irrigation and precipitation on water uptake in farmland only the results for 2021 are addressed below in 2021 the variability in water uptake by sunflower was significant among the different soil layers with δ18 o being significantly higher in shallow soils 0 40 cm than in deep soils 40 100 cm and δ18 o changing significantly in surface soils after irrigation compared to deep soils fig 6b the soil water content was relatively low before irrigation and water uptake by sunflower mostly occurred in the deep soils before irrigation doy152 the 40 60 cm soil layer was the main soil layer where water uptake by sunflower roots occurred contributing 30 24 31 11 of the total water uptake table 4 after irrigation root water uptake shifted from the deep soils to the shallow soils in particular growth stage irrigation was conducted in the budding stage a stage when the main root system of sunflower was at a depth of 40 cm and growing five days after irrigation fig 6b root water uptake mainly occurred in the 20 40 cm soil layer which contributed 38 12 40 00 and 39 11 of the total water uptake over the whole 0 100 cm layer under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively in other words the 20 40 cm soil layer contributed significantly to the growth of sunflower ten days after irrigation fig 6c root water uptake shifted towards deeper soil layers which included mainly the 40 60 cm soil layer under fd contributing 28 12 of the total water uptake in contrast to the 20 40 cm soil layer with a contribution of 27 45 but still mainly the 20 40 cm soil layer under cwt1 and cwt2 contributing 34 54 and 33 00 of the total water uptake respectively as shown above water uptake by sunflower roots within 10 days after irrigation mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm deep soils contributing 55 88 78 51 of the total water uptake while cd led to a significant increase in soil water content within this depth range thus cd can create favorable conditions for crop growth by providing sufficient soil water to be extracted and used by sunflower 3 4 effect of drainage method on the soil salt content in the farmland fig 7 illustrates the dynamics of the soil salt content under fd and cd cwt1 cwt2 the results showed that irrigation and precipitation had a great effect on the salt content of surface soils 0 40 cm yet a small effect on the salt content of deep soils 40 100 cm the spring irrigation was mainly intended to leach away excessive soil salts so as to provide better conditions for the seedling emergence of sunflower the drain depth of each treatment was 100 cm and there was no significant difference in the soil salt content among treatments after spring irrigation the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 0 20 cm soil layer under the three treatments was 2 37 2 36 and 2 35 g kg 1 respectivley which was suitable for sowing sunflower seeds from sowing to before growth stage irrigation the soil salt content varied little due to precipitation 1 for 2020 and 2021 the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer was higher by 1 15 and 0 32 under cwt1 than under fd and cwt2 respectivley 2 the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 40 100 cm soil layer was higher by 1 58 and 0 53 under cwt1 than under fd and cwt2 respectivley by contrast there was a large difference in soil salt content among the treatments after reproducitve irrigation reproducitve irrigation was conducted only once thereby leading to a gradual increase in soil salt content in the late growth stage the mean soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer under fd cwt1 and cwt2 was respectively 6 01 6 30 and 6 17 g kg 1 in 2020 and 5 69 5 97 and 5 79 g kg 1 in 2021 compared to the 0 40 cm soil layer the soil salt content of the 40 100 cm soil layer differed to a smaller degree among the treatments being 2 71 2 80 and 2 76 g kg 1 in 2020 and 2 70 2 79 2 72 g kg 1 in 2021 respectively compared to fd and cwt2 the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer as well as the 40 100 cm soil layer under cwt1 was higher by 2 65 and 0 42 and 3 33 and 2 01 respectively farmland soils usually undergo serious re salination in the late stages of the growth period due to the high salt content of groundwater leading to a reduction of 10 25 in crop yields compared to non saline soils fao29 1976 3 5 effect of drainage method on the distribution of soil salt content the effects of irrigation and precipitation on the dynamics of soil salt content were similar in 2020 vs 2021 and thus only the results for 2021 are addressed below moreover the dynamics under cd in the second year would be more representative fig 8 presents the depth profile of soil salt content at different horizontal distances under various drainage treatments soil salts before spring irrigation showed significant surface accumulation mainly in the 0 60 cm soil layer after two irrigation cycles the soil de salination rate decreased from top to bottom in the soil profile the mean de salination rate over the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased in the order of fd cwt1 cwt2 being 29 00 28 29 and 28 55 respectively spring irrigation had a good effect on soil salt leaching and significantly reduced the soil salt content under various treatments as they all had the same drain depth of 100 cm in this period specifically the mean de salination rate under fd cwt1 and cwt2 was 48 45 48 00 and 48 35 respectively fig 8b g l with no significant differences among treatments in the meantime the de salination rate was inversely related to the horizontal distance from the subsurface pipe the mean de salination rate at a horizontal distance of 0 m i e right above the subsurface pipe was as high as 52 97 52 93 and 52 64 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively by contrast the mean de salination rate was lowest at a horizontal distance half the pipe spacing which was 43 77 43 11 and 42 63 under the three treatments respectively de salination rate showed large spatial variation under subsurface pipe drainage for example the de salination rate in areas far from the pipe differed by 8 52 10 1 from that in areas close to the pipe whereas there was no significant inter treatment difference the soil salts changed from surface accumulation to homogeneous distribution in the soil profile after spring irrigation with soil salt content ranging from 0 93 to 2 61 g kg 1 from 0 98 to 2 4 g kg 1 and from 1 00 to 2 43 g kg 1 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively the main purpose of growth stage irrigation is to provide sufficient water and nutrients to meet the conditional requirements for crop growth in a timely manner and to avoid yield loss due to long term water stress during the crop growth period however the crop growth stage is very sensitive to water shortage and thus soil salt leaching was weak in this period moreover the volume of growth stage irrigation water was small leading to a relatively small volume of soil water drainage as a result the maximum de salination rate under fd during growth stage irrigation was only 9 55 by contrast salts migrated towards deeper soils under cwt1 and cwt2 during growth stage irrigation due to the small drain depth which led to an increase of 3 53 and 3 12 in soil salt content in the 60 100 cm soil layer under the two treatments respectively as the sunflower plants continued to grow and their demand for water and nutrients continued to increase their salt tolerance gradually increased as well leading to a varying degree of soil re salination in the late reproductive stage flowering stage under various treatments relative to the soil salt content before spring irrigation the mean re salination rate in the late growth stage was 29 29 33 48 and 30 34 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively fig 8e j o in particular soils underwent a higher degree of re salination under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd 3 6 effect of drainage method on the water salt balance drainage method had a large effect on the soil water salt balance during the sunflower growth period from sowing to harvest as shown in table 5 specifically the 2 year mean et c was higher by 7 24 mm and 4 28 mm under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively fd led to lower et and yields while cd significantly increased sunflower yields with cwt1 and cwt2 leading to an increase of 4 52 and 3 04 in mean crop yield compared to fd p 0 05 respectively meanwhile cwt1 led to the highest crop water productivity wp c among treatments which was higher by 2 72 and 5 37 p 0 05 than that under cwt2 and fd respectively in addition the volume of soil water drainage during growth stage irrigation was lower by 24 2 and 13 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively which was attributed to the high elevation of subsurface pipe outlet in this period this indicates that cd can provide favorable soil moisture conditions and thus groundwater use by crops will be low specifically groundwater use by sunflower plants was lower by 3 9 and 1 11 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd p 0 05 respectively cd led to less leaching of soil salts than fd the mean de salination rate was lower by 10 5 and 5 49 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively after growth stage irrigation the re salination rate was higher by 6 09 and 3 37 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively while there was no significant difference between the two cd treatments the soil content at crop harvest was 77 19 79 94 and 78 67 t ha 1 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively with the latter two being higher by 3 57 and 1 92 than the former given the relatively high content of soil salts at harvest it is necessary to conduct autumn irrigation or winter irrigation for soil leaching in combination with subsurface pipe drainage so as to remove excessive soil salts and reduce soil salinization 3 7 optimization of the drain depth of a cd structure in terms of soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate and soil re salting rate a good agreement between the hydrus 2d simulation results and measured values was observed for each treatment demonstrating good model performance in predicting soil water and salt contents therefore the soil water and salt contents were simulated at different drain depths of 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm cwt1 50 cm 60 cm 70 cm cwt2 80 cm 90 cm and 100 cm fd during the growth stage while keeping all other conditions the same the soil water and salt contents did not show significant variation before growth stage irrigation but a different phenomenon was observed after growth stage irrigation specifically the mean soil water content and soil salt content of the main root zone 0 40 cm of sunflower after growth stage irrigation are presented in fig 9a while the de salination rate during spring irrigation and the re salination rate in the late growth stage relative to the period before spring irrigation of the main root zone are presented in fig 9b the results showed that under cd treatments growth stage irrigation did not lead to a significant change in the soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer with a change in drain depth 40 100 cm by contrast a drain depth of 20 cm and 30 cm in the cd structure would allow more water to be drained from the 0 40 cm soil layer through the subsurface pipes than a greater drain depth after growth stage irrigation thereby leading to relatively high soil salt content in this soil layer higher by 2 68 8 44 than the counterpart with a drain depth of 40 100 cm meanwhile the soil water content was higher by 3 91 19 92 with a drain depth of 20 cm and 30 cm in the cd structure than with a drain depth of 40 100 cm when the drain depth was adjusted to 40 cm and 50 cm the soil water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer was respectively 0 278 and 0 275 cm3 cm 3 higher by 5 37 13 95 than the counterpart with a drain depth of 60 100 cm providing favorable soil moisture conditions for crop growth given that the drain depth during spring irrigation was fixed at 100 cm a drain depth of 20 100 cm in the cd structure during growth stage irrigation would not significantly affect the soil de salination rate which was 51 13 51 33 for the soil re salination rate relative to the period before spring irrigation it was higher by 6 08 32 31 with a drain depth of 20 40 cm than with a drain depth of 50 100 cm while it was higher by only 1 81 8 38 with a drain depth of 50 cm than with a drain depth of 60 100 cm as shown above compared to a drain depth of 40 cm a drain depth of 50 cm would provide better soil moisture conditions for crop growth while reducing soil salt content moreover the 0 100 cm soil layer showed a similar trend in soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate and soil re salination rate to the 0 40 cm soil layer while the overall changes in these parameters were smaller for the former layer than for the latter layer when identifying the optimal drain depth for sunflower planted in moderately saline soils the following metrics were considered for the main root zone 0 40 cm soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the following two irrigation scenarios were also considered 1 spring irrigation to reduce soil salt content and 2 growth stage irrigation to not only increase soil water content but also to possibly minimize the soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the optimal drain depth during the growth stage was finally determined to be 50 cm which would not only provide a suitable water condition for crop growth but also minimize salt stress 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cd on soil water content cd is an important farm drainage management measure and most studies have shown that cd benefits agricultural production by reducing the volume of farmland drainage water and increasing the soil water content jouni et al 2018 tan and zhang 2017 ng et al 2002 ng et al 2002 showed that the soil water content of the 0 120 cm soil layer was higher by 21 under cd than under fd while the groundwater table depth was higher by 59 or 49 cm under fd than under cd tolomio and borin 2019 reported that cd improved the surface soil moisture condition by making it more uniform and stable and that the improvement was especially significant in dry summer seasons cd was also shown to effectively improve the moisture conditions of deep soils leading to larger differences in soil water content after precipitation and irrigation during the growth stage the study also demonstrated that summer crops with deeper root systems respond more sensitively to cd induced changes in soil water content jouni et al 2018 showed that cd has the advantages of not only improving wue and water productivity wp but also increasing irrigation efficiency and can thereby serve as an important measure for greatly conserving water resources and alleviating water shortage the present findings are consistent with the above reports when sunflower is in a water deficit state at the late growth stage in arid and semi arid zones cd can help to increase crop yields by alleviating drought stress improving water productivity and increasing crop evapotranspiration moreover cd can slow the rate of groundwater table decline after growth stage irrigation which is consistent with the finding of he et al 2019 these findings demonstrate that cd can provide good conditions for groundwater recharge while providing sufficient water for crop growth 4 2 effect of cd on soil salt content in arid and semi arid zones where saline soils are widespread the effect of soil salt content on crop growth should be considered when conducting cd to provide favorable soil moisture conditions for crop growth cd leads to changes in the horizontal and vertical transport processes of soil water which in turn leads to changes in soil salt distribution studies have shown that cd leads to inadequate leaching of salts during the growth stage resulting in more severe soil re salination in the late growth stage jouni et al 2018 although the increase in soil salt content is a disadvantage of cd hornbuckle et al 2005 the soil salt content can be reduced by leaching the soils during the non growth stage of crops alternatively the elevation of the drainage outlet can be adjusted to achieve soil water salt balance these findings differ from those of chi et al 2021 which may be attributed to differences in multiple factors such as subsurface pipe layout outer packing material and soil texture the present results were consistent with previous findings jouni et al 2018 hornbuckle et al 2005 our findings revealed that cd leads to a higher soil re salination rate than fd in the late growth stage of crops growth stage irrigation in arid zones is intended to provide sufficient water and nutrients for crops despite the relatively high soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the salt tolerance of crops will increase as the crops grow and mature moreover hydrus 2d simulation was performed to compare different drain depths of a cd structure in terms of the following four metrics soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate after growth stage irrigation the simulation results indicated that the drain depth of the cd structure should be optimized to be 50 cm in order to ensure suitable soil water and salt contents after irrigation in the present study soil salts were leached through irrigation as spring irrigation is useful for reducing salt stress on crops such sunflower that are planted late especially in arid and semi arid zones with severe farmland soil salinization meanwhile cd was conducted in the farmland which led to a relatively high soil de salination rate and thereby relatively low salt stress on the sunflower seedlings thereby increasing the seedling emergence rate thus the combination of spring irrigation and cd provided suitable salt conditions for crop growth 5 conclusion the soil water content and salinity content of free drainage fd controlled drainage of 40 cm in growth period cwt1 and controlled drainage of 70 cm in growth period cwt2 were calibrated and verified using hydrus 2d 3d the results showed that the model could accurately simulate the dynamics of soil water and salt contents the model had an mre 8 44 12 78 and 10 41 13 44 in predicting soil water content and soil salt content respectively corresponding to an rmse of 0 02 0 07 cm3 cm 3 and 0 03 0 08 g kg 1 as well as an r2 of 0 78 0 85 and 0 78 0 82 cd led to a significant increase in water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the middle and late stage of crop growth especially in the 0 40 cm soil layer the 2 year mean soil water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer under fd cwt1 and cwt2 after growth stage irrigation was 0 263 0 278 and 0 267 cm3 cm 3 respectively with the latter two being higher respectively by 5 70 and 1 52 than the former after irrigation sunflower water uptake mainly occurred in the 0 40 soil layer which contributed 55 88 78 51 of the total water uptake spring irrigation significantly reduced the soil salt content leading to a mean de salination rate of 48 45 48 00 and 48 35 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively with no significant differences among treatments the soils underwent a varying degree of re salination in the late growth stage flowering stage when the mean re salination rate relative to the period before spring irrigation under fd cwt1 and cwt2 was 29 29 33 48 and 30 34 respectively this indicated that soil re salination was relatively more severe under cwt1 and cwt2 but it had little effect on crop growth and yields when identifying the optimal drain depth for sunflower planted in moderately saline soils the following metrics were considered for the main root zone 0 40 cm soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the following two irrigation scenarios were also considered 1 spring irrigation to reduce soil salt content and 2 growth stage irrigation to not only increase soil water content but also to possibly minimize the soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the optimal drain depth during the growth stage was ultimately determined to be 50 cm which would not only provide suitable water conditions for crop growth but would also minimize salt stress declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

9299,controlled drainage is an important measure to improve salinized soil in arid and semi arid areas however free drainage during the growth period leads to excessive water loss and crops lack water in the later growth period resulting in crop yield reduction therefore in arid and semi arid areas soil salts should be leached during the non growing period and drainage should be controlled during the growing period to ensure that crops have adequate water absorption and utilization improve soil water availability for optimal water supply and salinity control in this study through field trials in 2020 and 2021 3 treatments were set up the depth of free drainage fd is common subsurface pipe drainage and the controlled drainage in the growth period were 40 cm cwt1 and 70 cm cwt2 respectively and the drainage depth in the non growing period was 100 cm using the hydrus 2d model to simulate the dynamic changes of soil water and salts in the 0 100 cm range the calibration and validation of the hydrus 2d model were performed using the measured soil water and salt content values of 2020 and 2021 the results showed that the simulated soil water and salt contents agreed well with the measured contents controlled drainage cd is a new agricultural drainage management practice that involves periodically increasing the outlet elevation of subsurface drainage pipes cd significantly increased the water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer especially at 0 40 cm depth after growth stage irrigation under fd cwt1 and cwt2 the 2 year mean soil water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer after growth stage irrigation in 2020 and 2021 was respectively 0 263 0 278 and 0 267 cm3 cm 3 with the latter two values being higher by 5 70 and 1 52 than the former value respectively soil water uptake by sunflower after irrigation mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm soil layer which contributed 55 88 78 51 of the total soil water uptake soil re salinization occurred in the late growth stage the flowering stage under different treatments with a mean re salinization rate relative to the period before spring irrigation of 29 29 33 48 and 30 34 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively although the re salinization rate was relatively high under cwt1 and cwt2 it had a low effect on crop growth as well as crop yield hydrus 2d simulation was performed to compare different drain depths in the growth stage in order to determine the optimal drain depth for sunflower in moderately saline soils to this end the following metrics were considered for the main root zone 0 40 cm soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate in the late growth stage reduce soil salt content during spring irrigation increase soil water content after irrigation during growth period and minimize soil salt return rate in late growth stage that is to provide suitable water conditions for crop growth and minimize salt stress the optimal drain depth during the growth stage was ultimately determined to be 50 cm keywords water and salt transport saline irrigation area controlled drainage sunflower hydrus 2d data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil salinization is an important constraint to sustainable agricultural development singh 2015 srivastava et al 2019 and is a global agro environmental problem inhibiting crop growth reducing crop yields and quality and decreasing fertilizer use efficiency liu et al 2021 the hetao irrigation district a typical saline irrigation area is affected by soil salinization mao et al 2017 2022 wei et al 2021 the area of soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia is about 333 300 ha accounting for 63 8 of the total cultivated land and it will continue to spread dou et al 2022 subsurface pipe drainage has recently been widely adopted in this area to improve the saline soils mainly in combination with soil leaching to remove soil salts in the non growth stage of crops which not only accelerates soil de salination but also effectively lowers the groundwater table so as to inhibit soil re salination dou et al 2021 meanwhile this area is also subject to water shortage stress and thus it is extremely important to achieve the rational and efficient use of water resources for farmlands in this region kang et al 2016 however the use of subsurface pipes for free drainage fd is prone to excessive drainage and thus the rapid loss of water from farmlands resulting in crop drought stress between two irrigation cycles chi et al 2021 by contrast controlled drainage cd in the growth stage can improve water availability retain soil moisture and improve water use efficiency he et al 2019 negm et al 2017 ng et al 2002 therefore it is desirable to conduct fd in the non growth stage to reduce soil salt content but cd in the growth stage to improve water availability and reduce water loss which is important for improving saline soils and mitigating drought stress in the hetao irrigation district and potentially even in the northwest arid zone dou et al 2021 cd also known as drainage water management dwm is a new agricultural drainage management practice that involves periodically increasing the outlet elevation of subsurface drainage pipes skaggs et al 2012 to reduce drainage water volume he et al 2019 and nitrogen n and phosphorous p losses king et al 2022 ross et al 2016 it can adequately regulate soil water content williams et al 2015 and improve the use efficiency of irrigation water and nutrients while reducing environmental pollution wang 2010 the underlying idea of cd is to drain water not only as needed but also as precisely as possible skaggs et al 2012 cd has evolved through several stages luo et al 2013 from the earliest stage focusing on soil moisture conservation and crop yield enhancement ayars et al 2006a to the latest stage focusing on pollutant reduction hornbuckle et al 2005 luo et al 2010 and irrigation water conservation tian et al 2006 as the research and applications of cd have become more extensive cd has emerged as the best water management practice for achieving sustainable agricultural development and production in areas facing drainage problems in arid zones subsurface pipe drainage plays a crucial role in controlling the soil salt content in the root zone of crops and preventing salt accumulation in the soil profile sietan 2005 zhang et al 2018 however subsurface pipe drainage systems are usually designed for continuous drainage without considering water and nutrient losses nor their impacts on crop production ayars et al 2006b cd is a subsurface pipe drainage based management measure that achieves crop production sustainability it represents a reasonable measure for improving agricultural water management and reducing subsurface drainage induced environmental pollution while neither decreasing crop yields nor increasing costs youssef et al 2018 recently cd has increasingly drawn attention and has been implemented globally this measure is generally considered to be able to reduce the volume of drainage water ingrid et al 2003 adjust the groundwater table davoodi et al 2019 improve water availability tolomio and borin 2019 and delay the onset of water stress on crops in arid zones ayars et al 2006a while achieving water conservation skaggs et al 2010 it also can reduce n and p loads to reduce environmental pollution wesström and messing 2007 while increasing crop yields jouni et al 2018 nevertheless some studies have shown that cd has little or no effect on crop yields wang et al 2020 he et al 2014 showed that cd slowed the rate of groundwater table decline in farmland within the first week after irrigation and fertilizer application which increased soil water availability in the farmland moreover the groundwater table could be maintained at relatively high levels by using a cd structure so as to reduce the hydraulic gradient decrease root zone leakage and increase potential crop water use from groundwater as groundwater is relatively rich in salts ayars et al 2006b and crops in the growth stage are less subject to salt stress than in the non growth stage it is desirable to decrease the soil salt content in the non growth stage but perform cd during the growth stage to ensure sufficient water uptake by the crops thus it is necessary to adjust the drain depth of a cd structure or the spacing of subsurface pipes as appropriate and determine the appropriate drainage timing according to local conditions so as to improve both economic and environmental performance a combination of field experiments with numerical simulations may serve as a more convenient and effective approach to obtain predict and validate the dynamics of various drainage indicators in farmlands to date the main models on subsurface pipe drainage are hydrus 2d 3d drainmod swat and rzwqm2 all of which can well simulate farmland drainage processes solute transport mechanisms and crop yields with drainmod swat and rzwqm2 being widely applied to the simulation of farmland hydrological processes soil nitrogen dynamics and crop yields luo et al 2001 addab and bailey 2022 bailey et al 2022 fang et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 in particular hydrus 2d 3d performs well in simulating soil water and salt contents in agricultural soils and has flexible boundary conditions for the accurate simulation of water and salt transport processes in 2 d unsaturated soils castanheira and serralheiro 2010 liu et al 2021 some studies li et al 2016a 2016b used hydrus 2d to calibrate and validate soil water salt transport parameters under subsurface pipe drainage and showed that the model can sufficiently accurately simulate soil water salt dynamics ebrahimian and noory 2014 showed that hydrus 2d is a powerful tool for subsurface drainage design in farmlands and provided a theoretical basis for how to identify suitable drainage schemes in farmlands through the simulation of burial depth subsurface pipe spacing and soil texture qian et al 2019 showed that hydrus 2d can well simulate soil water salt transport processes in arid zones where both irrigation and subsurface pipe drainage are conducted in a coordinated manner the authors also proposed an empirical relationship between the drainage to irrigation ratio and the subsurface pipe layout parameters in arid zones to calculate the suitable combination of pipe spacing and burial depth so as to develop an economical and reasonable layout for subsurface pipes in arid zones the hydrus 2d model is widely used in hetao irrigation area this model can better simulate soil moisture salinity and nutrients and provide theoretical basis for local farmland water saving salt control and nutrient utilization chen et al 2019 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 although the hetao irrigation district is a typical saline irrigation area both the crop and soil water salt statuses under subsurface controlled drainage remain to be systematically investigated in order to gain a thorough understanding of the regulatory effect of subsurface controlled drainage on both crop growth and soil water salt contents the hetao irrigation district currently faces severe soil salinization which results in poor soil permeability generally irrigation is not carried out in the middle and late growth stages of sunflower as it would cause severe seedling death however sunflower in the late growth stage is in a water deficit state and thus it necessary to conduct cd to provide a suitable amount of water for the sunflower plants and minimize soil re salination in this period given the above context this study aimed to explore the effects of drainage method on soil water content and soil salt transport processes in the moderately saline soils of the hetao irrigation district specifically cd was conducted in the growth stage after spring irrigation and consequent soil salt leaching in order to optimize water supply and salt control moreover a hydrus 2d model was used to provide deeper insights into the dynamics of the soil crop system in response to various drainage methods and identify the optimal drain depth for sunflower farmlands in the growth stage for achieving efficient water use 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the test field 40 45 28 n 108

table depth was measured to be 167 cm as illustrated in fig 2 the simulation area had the following boundary conditions 1 the upper boundary was comprised of a mulched zone and a non mulched zone with the former zone set to have no flow boundary condition and the latter zone set to atmosphere to apply precipitation irrigation and potential evaporation ep boundary condition 2 the left and right

78 0 85 and 0 78 0 82 respectively model simulation performance was better for fd than for cd likely because the simulation results during the spring irrigation period were later used as the inputs for the simulation during the cd period moreover soil water and salt contents were more subject to irrigation and precipitation for the 0 20 cm soil layer than for the 20 100 cm soil layer and therefore the simulation results for the former layer were subject to higher errors however the errors were still within the acceptable range in summary the hydrus 2d model can well simulate soil water and salt contents under cd conditions 3 2 effect of drainage method on soil water content as each farm plot was wide each plot was 40 m long and 30 m wide the soil water content at a horizontal distance of 0 2 5 5 and 10 m from the subsurface pipe was averaged to represent the overall soil water content of the plot fig 5 the entire crop growth period was divided into three stages to distinguish the effect of the soil water content of irrigated farmland the first stage was the spring irrigation period doy 131 152 in 2020 and doy 134 155 in 2021 when there was no significant difference among the three treatments because they all had the same drain depth of 100 cm the second stage spanned from sowing to before growth stage irrigation doy153 199 in 2020 and doy156 207 in 2021 when the difference in soil water content among the different treatments was small because of the joint influence of cd and precipitation in the period of doy153 199 in 2020 the soil water content was higher by only 0 91 and 0 20 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd in the 0 20 cm soil layer respectively it was higher by 0 51 and 0 12 in the 20 40 cm soil layer and by 0 22 and 0 08 in the 40 60 cm soil layer while it was basically identical in the 60 100 cm soil layer a similar trend was observed for the second stage of 2021 as well with the soil water content being higher by only 0 46 and 0 11 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd in the 0 60 cm soil layer respectively the third stage spanned from the end of growth stage irrigation to harvest doy200 274 in 2020 and doy208 276 in 2021 when there was a significant difference in soil water content among the different treatments due to the significant performance of the cd system in the third stage of 2020 the soil water content was higher by 7 49 3 56 2 44 and 2 34 under cwt1 than fd in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers respectively as well as by 3 81 1 96 1 64 and 1 29 under cwt2 than fd in the same soil layers respectively in the third stage of 2021 soil water content was higher by 4 16 and 2 67 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd in the whole 0 100 cm soil layer respectively as shown above cd led to significant changes in soil water content in the middle and late stages of crop growth in particular cd after growth stage irrigation led to significant changes in soil water content at 0 100 cm depth especially at 0 40 cm depth the 2 year mean soil water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer was 0 263 0 278 and 0 267 cm3 cm 3 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively with the latter two values being higher by 5 70 and 1 52 than the former value respectively these findings demonstrate that cd ensures sufficient water uptake by crops and improves soil water availability 3 3 effect of drainage method on water uptake in irrigated farmland given the small differences between 2020 and 2021 in the effects of irrigation and precipitation on water uptake in farmland only the results for 2021 are addressed below in 2021 the variability in water uptake by sunflower was significant among the different soil layers with δ18 o being significantly higher in shallow soils 0 40 cm than in deep soils 40 100 cm and δ18 o changing significantly in surface soils after irrigation compared to deep soils fig 6b the soil water content was relatively low before irrigation and water uptake by sunflower mostly occurred in the deep soils before irrigation doy152 the 40 60 cm soil layer was the main soil layer where water uptake by sunflower roots occurred contributing 30 24 31 11 of the total water uptake table 4 after irrigation root water uptake shifted from the deep soils to the shallow soils in particular growth stage irrigation was conducted in the budding stage a stage when the main root system of sunflower was at a depth of 40 cm and growing five days after irrigation fig 6b root water uptake mainly occurred in the 20 40 cm soil layer which contributed 38 12 40 00 and 39 11 of the total water uptake over the whole 0 100 cm layer under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively in other words the 20 40 cm soil layer contributed significantly to the growth of sunflower ten days after irrigation fig 6c root water uptake shifted towards deeper soil layers which included mainly the 40 60 cm soil layer under fd contributing 28 12 of the total water uptake in contrast to the 20 40 cm soil layer with a contribution of 27 45 but still mainly the 20 40 cm soil layer under cwt1 and cwt2 contributing 34 54 and 33 00 of the total water uptake respectively as shown above water uptake by sunflower roots within 10 days after irrigation mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm deep soils contributing 55 88 78 51 of the total water uptake while cd led to a significant increase in soil water content within this depth range thus cd can create favorable conditions for crop growth by providing sufficient soil water to be extracted and used by sunflower 3 4 effect of drainage method on the soil salt content in the farmland fig 7 illustrates the dynamics of the soil salt content under fd and cd cwt1 cwt2 the results showed that irrigation and precipitation had a great effect on the salt content of surface soils 0 40 cm yet a small effect on the salt content of deep soils 40 100 cm the spring irrigation was mainly intended to leach away excessive soil salts so as to provide better conditions for the seedling emergence of sunflower the drain depth of each treatment was 100 cm and there was no significant difference in the soil salt content among treatments after spring irrigation the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 0 20 cm soil layer under the three treatments was 2 37 2 36 and 2 35 g kg 1 respectivley which was suitable for sowing sunflower seeds from sowing to before growth stage irrigation the soil salt content varied little due to precipitation 1 for 2020 and 2021 the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer was higher by 1 15 and 0 32 under cwt1 than under fd and cwt2 respectivley 2 the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 40 100 cm soil layer was higher by 1 58 and 0 53 under cwt1 than under fd and cwt2 respectivley by contrast there was a large difference in soil salt content among the treatments after reproducitve irrigation reproducitve irrigation was conducted only once thereby leading to a gradual increase in soil salt content in the late growth stage the mean soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer under fd cwt1 and cwt2 was respectively 6 01 6 30 and 6 17 g kg 1 in 2020 and 5 69 5 97 and 5 79 g kg 1 in 2021 compared to the 0 40 cm soil layer the soil salt content of the 40 100 cm soil layer differed to a smaller degree among the treatments being 2 71 2 80 and 2 76 g kg 1 in 2020 and 2 70 2 79 2 72 g kg 1 in 2021 respectively compared to fd and cwt2 the 2 year mean soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer as well as the 40 100 cm soil layer under cwt1 was higher by 2 65 and 0 42 and 3 33 and 2 01 respectively farmland soils usually undergo serious re salination in the late stages of the growth period due to the high salt content of groundwater leading to a reduction of 10 25 in crop yields compared to non saline soils fao29 1976 3 5 effect of drainage method on the distribution of soil salt content the effects of irrigation and precipitation on the dynamics of soil salt content were similar in 2020 vs 2021 and thus only the results for 2021 are addressed below moreover the dynamics under cd in the second year would be more representative fig 8 presents the depth profile of soil salt content at different horizontal distances under various drainage treatments soil salts before spring irrigation showed significant surface accumulation mainly in the 0 60 cm soil layer after two irrigation cycles the soil de salination rate decreased from top to bottom in the soil profile the mean de salination rate over the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased in the order of fd cwt1 cwt2 being 29 00 28 29 and 28 55 respectively spring irrigation had a good effect on soil salt leaching and significantly reduced the soil salt content under various treatments as they all had the same drain depth of 100 cm in this period specifically the mean de salination rate under fd cwt1 and cwt2 was 48 45 48 00 and 48 35 respectively fig 8b g l with no significant differences among treatments in the meantime the de salination rate was inversely related to the horizontal distance from the subsurface pipe the mean de salination rate at a horizontal distance of 0 m i e right above the subsurface pipe was as high as 52 97 52 93 and 52 64 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively by contrast the mean de salination rate was lowest at a horizontal distance half the pipe spacing which was 43 77 43 11 and 42 63 under the three treatments respectively de salination rate showed large spatial variation under subsurface pipe drainage for example the de salination rate in areas far from the pipe differed by 8 52 10 1 from that in areas close to the pipe whereas there was no significant inter treatment difference the soil salts changed from surface accumulation to homogeneous distribution in the soil profile after spring irrigation with soil salt content ranging from 0 93 to 2 61 g kg 1 from 0 98 to 2 4 g kg 1 and from 1 00 to 2 43 g kg 1 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively the main purpose of growth stage irrigation is to provide sufficient water and nutrients to meet the conditional requirements for crop growth in a timely manner and to avoid yield loss due to long term water stress during the crop growth period however the crop growth stage is very sensitive to water shortage and thus soil salt leaching was weak in this period moreover the volume of growth stage irrigation water was small leading to a relatively small volume of soil water drainage as a result the maximum de salination rate under fd during growth stage irrigation was only 9 55 by contrast salts migrated towards deeper soils under cwt1 and cwt2 during growth stage irrigation due to the small drain depth which led to an increase of 3 53 and 3 12 in soil salt content in the 60 100 cm soil layer under the two treatments respectively as the sunflower plants continued to grow and their demand for water and nutrients continued to increase their salt tolerance gradually increased as well leading to a varying degree of soil re salination in the late reproductive stage flowering stage under various treatments relative to the soil salt content before spring irrigation the mean re salination rate in the late growth stage was 29 29 33 48 and 30 34 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively fig 8e j o in particular soils underwent a higher degree of re salination under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd 3 6 effect of drainage method on the water salt balance drainage method had a large effect on the soil water salt balance during the sunflower growth period from sowing to harvest as shown in table 5 specifically the 2 year mean et c was higher by 7 24 mm and 4 28 mm under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively fd led to lower et and yields while cd significantly increased sunflower yields with cwt1 and cwt2 leading to an increase of 4 52 and 3 04 in mean crop yield compared to fd p 0 05 respectively meanwhile cwt1 led to the highest crop water productivity wp c among treatments which was higher by 2 72 and 5 37 p 0 05 than that under cwt2 and fd respectively in addition the volume of soil water drainage during growth stage irrigation was lower by 24 2 and 13 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively which was attributed to the high elevation of subsurface pipe outlet in this period this indicates that cd can provide favorable soil moisture conditions and thus groundwater use by crops will be low specifically groundwater use by sunflower plants was lower by 3 9 and 1 11 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd p 0 05 respectively cd led to less leaching of soil salts than fd the mean de salination rate was lower by 10 5 and 5 49 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively after growth stage irrigation the re salination rate was higher by 6 09 and 3 37 under cwt1 and cwt2 than under fd respectively while there was no significant difference between the two cd treatments the soil content at crop harvest was 77 19 79 94 and 78 67 t ha 1 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively with the latter two being higher by 3 57 and 1 92 than the former given the relatively high content of soil salts at harvest it is necessary to conduct autumn irrigation or winter irrigation for soil leaching in combination with subsurface pipe drainage so as to remove excessive soil salts and reduce soil salinization 3 7 optimization of the drain depth of a cd structure in terms of soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate and soil re salting rate a good agreement between the hydrus 2d simulation results and measured values was observed for each treatment demonstrating good model performance in predicting soil water and salt contents therefore the soil water and salt contents were simulated at different drain depths of 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm cwt1 50 cm 60 cm 70 cm cwt2 80 cm 90 cm and 100 cm fd during the growth stage while keeping all other conditions the same the soil water and salt contents did not show significant variation before growth stage irrigation but a different phenomenon was observed after growth stage irrigation specifically the mean soil water content and soil salt content of the main root zone 0 40 cm of sunflower after growth stage irrigation are presented in fig 9a while the de salination rate during spring irrigation and the re salination rate in the late growth stage relative to the period before spring irrigation of the main root zone are presented in fig 9b the results showed that under cd treatments growth stage irrigation did not lead to a significant change in the soil salt content of the 0 40 cm soil layer with a change in drain depth 40 100 cm by contrast a drain depth of 20 cm and 30 cm in the cd structure would allow more water to be drained from the 0 40 cm soil layer through the subsurface pipes than a greater drain depth after growth stage irrigation thereby leading to relatively high soil salt content in this soil layer higher by 2 68 8 44 than the counterpart with a drain depth of 40 100 cm meanwhile the soil water content was higher by 3 91 19 92 with a drain depth of 20 cm and 30 cm in the cd structure than with a drain depth of 40 100 cm when the drain depth was adjusted to 40 cm and 50 cm the soil water content of the 0 40 cm soil layer was respectively 0 278 and 0 275 cm3 cm 3 higher by 5 37 13 95 than the counterpart with a drain depth of 60 100 cm providing favorable soil moisture conditions for crop growth given that the drain depth during spring irrigation was fixed at 100 cm a drain depth of 20 100 cm in the cd structure during growth stage irrigation would not significantly affect the soil de salination rate which was 51 13 51 33 for the soil re salination rate relative to the period before spring irrigation it was higher by 6 08 32 31 with a drain depth of 20 40 cm than with a drain depth of 50 100 cm while it was higher by only 1 81 8 38 with a drain depth of 50 cm than with a drain depth of 60 100 cm as shown above compared to a drain depth of 40 cm a drain depth of 50 cm would provide better soil moisture conditions for crop growth while reducing soil salt content moreover the 0 100 cm soil layer showed a similar trend in soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate and soil re salination rate to the 0 40 cm soil layer while the overall changes in these parameters were smaller for the former layer than for the latter layer when identifying the optimal drain depth for sunflower planted in moderately saline soils the following metrics were considered for the main root zone 0 40 cm soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the following two irrigation scenarios were also considered 1 spring irrigation to reduce soil salt content and 2 growth stage irrigation to not only increase soil water content but also to possibly minimize the soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the optimal drain depth during the growth stage was finally determined to be 50 cm which would not only provide a suitable water condition for crop growth but also minimize salt stress 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cd on soil water content cd is an important farm drainage management measure and most studies have shown that cd benefits agricultural production by reducing the volume of farmland drainage water and increasing the soil water content jouni et al 2018 tan and zhang 2017 ng et al 2002 ng et al 2002 showed that the soil water content of the 0 120 cm soil layer was higher by 21 under cd than under fd while the groundwater table depth was higher by 59 or 49 cm under fd than under cd tolomio and borin 2019 reported that cd improved the surface soil moisture condition by making it more uniform and stable and that the improvement was especially significant in dry summer seasons cd was also shown to effectively improve the moisture conditions of deep soils leading to larger differences in soil water content after precipitation and irrigation during the growth stage the study also demonstrated that summer crops with deeper root systems respond more sensitively to cd induced changes in soil water content jouni et al 2018 showed that cd has the advantages of not only improving wue and water productivity wp but also increasing irrigation efficiency and can thereby serve as an important measure for greatly conserving water resources and alleviating water shortage the present findings are consistent with the above reports when sunflower is in a water deficit state at the late growth stage in arid and semi arid zones cd can help to increase crop yields by alleviating drought stress improving water productivity and increasing crop evapotranspiration moreover cd can slow the rate of groundwater table decline after growth stage irrigation which is consistent with the finding of he et al 2019 these findings demonstrate that cd can provide good conditions for groundwater recharge while providing sufficient water for crop growth 4 2 effect of cd on soil salt content in arid and semi arid zones where saline soils are widespread the effect of soil salt content on crop growth should be considered when conducting cd to provide favorable soil moisture conditions for crop growth cd leads to changes in the horizontal and vertical transport processes of soil water which in turn leads to changes in soil salt distribution studies have shown that cd leads to inadequate leaching of salts during the growth stage resulting in more severe soil re salination in the late growth stage jouni et al 2018 although the increase in soil salt content is a disadvantage of cd hornbuckle et al 2005 the soil salt content can be reduced by leaching the soils during the non growth stage of crops alternatively the elevation of the drainage outlet can be adjusted to achieve soil water salt balance these findings differ from those of chi et al 2021 which may be attributed to differences in multiple factors such as subsurface pipe layout outer packing material and soil texture the present results were consistent with previous findings jouni et al 2018 hornbuckle et al 2005 our findings revealed that cd leads to a higher soil re salination rate than fd in the late growth stage of crops growth stage irrigation in arid zones is intended to provide sufficient water and nutrients for crops despite the relatively high soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the salt tolerance of crops will increase as the crops grow and mature moreover hydrus 2d simulation was performed to compare different drain depths of a cd structure in terms of the following four metrics soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate after growth stage irrigation the simulation results indicated that the drain depth of the cd structure should be optimized to be 50 cm in order to ensure suitable soil water and salt contents after irrigation in the present study soil salts were leached through irrigation as spring irrigation is useful for reducing salt stress on crops such sunflower that are planted late especially in arid and semi arid zones with severe farmland soil salinization meanwhile cd was conducted in the farmland which led to a relatively high soil de salination rate and thereby relatively low salt stress on the sunflower seedlings thereby increasing the seedling emergence rate thus the combination of spring irrigation and cd provided suitable salt conditions for crop growth 5 conclusion the soil water content and salinity content of free drainage fd controlled drainage of 40 cm in growth period cwt1 and controlled drainage of 70 cm in growth period cwt2 were calibrated and verified using hydrus 2d 3d the results showed that the model could accurately simulate the dynamics of soil water and salt contents the model had an mre 8 44 12 78 and 10 41 13 44 in predicting soil water content and soil salt content respectively corresponding to an rmse of 0 02 0 07 cm3 cm 3 and 0 03 0 08 g kg 1 as well as an r2 of 0 78 0 85 and 0 78 0 82 cd led to a significant increase in water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the middle and late stage of crop growth especially in the 0 40 cm soil layer the 2 year mean soil water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer under fd cwt1 and cwt2 after growth stage irrigation was 0 263 0 278 and 0 267 cm3 cm 3 respectively with the latter two being higher respectively by 5 70 and 1 52 than the former after irrigation sunflower water uptake mainly occurred in the 0 40 soil layer which contributed 55 88 78 51 of the total water uptake spring irrigation significantly reduced the soil salt content leading to a mean de salination rate of 48 45 48 00 and 48 35 under fd cwt1 and cwt2 respectively with no significant differences among treatments the soils underwent a varying degree of re salination in the late growth stage flowering stage when the mean re salination rate relative to the period before spring irrigation under fd cwt1 and cwt2 was 29 29 33 48 and 30 34 respectively this indicated that soil re salination was relatively more severe under cwt1 and cwt2 but it had little effect on crop growth and yields when identifying the optimal drain depth for sunflower planted in moderately saline soils the following metrics were considered for the main root zone 0 40 cm soil water content soil salt content soil de salination rate during spring irrigation and soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the following two irrigation scenarios were also considered 1 spring irrigation to reduce soil salt content and 2 growth stage irrigation to not only increase soil water content but also to possibly minimize the soil re salination rate in the late growth stage the optimal drain depth during the growth stage was ultimately determined to be 50 cm which would not only provide suitable water conditions for crop growth but would also
