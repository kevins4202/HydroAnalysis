11125,this paper assessed the potential impacts of climate change on maize productivity in the brazilian northeast to achieve this objective bias corrected regional downscaled scenarios from three global models for the representative emission pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the periods 1980 2005 2007 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 were used as input data for a crop productivity model because increased temperatures are likely to shorten the crop cycle length thus reducing productivity we investigated the lengthening of the growing cycle as an adaptation strategy to cope with the reduction of rainfall projected by future climate scenarios we analyzed the potential impact of irrigation on productivity the results showed that climate change effects would be mostly negative for maize rainfed agriculture particularly for the worst case scenario rcp8 5 2071 2099 in which losses were expected to reach more than 60 however productivity losses were limited to a maximum of 30 for all rcp4 5 scenarios and before 2070 for the rcp8 5 scenario the use of maize cultivars with a longer crop cycle for rainfed agriculture was likely to increase the average productivity in all scenarios although it came at the expense of increasing the risk of crop failure regarding the use of irrigation there was an improvement in productivity for both the short and long cycle cultivars although longer crop cycle cultivars had a decisive advantage with a drop in yield of less than 20 for all rcp4 5 scenarios and for the rcp8 5 scenario until 2070 compared to the present climate we estimated the total production and the increase in water demand based on the existing and projected irrigated areas in the region and concluded that it is possible to avoid significant losses in total maize production in the region for all scenarios with the exception of the 2071 2099 rcp8 5 scenario however sustaining such levels of production requires a significant increase in water consumption up to 140 key words aquacrop regional climate scenarios water requirements 1 introduction according to the fifth ipcc report ipcc 2014 the projected increases in atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature changes in rainfall patterns and water availability and the intensification of climate extremes are likely to affect the economy environment and societal sectors regarding crop yield those changes might result in a wide variety of impacts asseng et al 2013 porter et al 2014 trnka et al 2014 with productivity increasing in many regions and declining in others challinor et al 2014 ipcc 2014 wheeler and von braun 2013 it is expected that climate changes will affect the sustainability of agricultural systems in many regions and the populations who depend on local food production will be most vulnerable wheeler and von braun 2013 müller et al 2011 asante and mensah 2015 in this context food security will face significant challenges particularly in semiarid environments and cropping technologies will be essential to sustaining production levels for an increasing population in the stressed environment due to global warming in the context of climate change the northeast region of brazil is considered to be one of the most vulnerable regions in the country marengo et al 2016 simões et al 2010 due to its high population exposure high poverty rates and low adaptive capacity the inner region of northeast brazil is largely semiarid characterized by relatively low and high variability in space and time of the rainfall combined with high evaporation rates the region is affected by periodic droughts with severe socioeconomic impacts on the local population and substantial impacts on the public expenditure on mitigation actions recent studies brito et al 2017 marengo et al 2017 suggest that there has been an intensification of both the duration and frequency of severe droughts agricultural production depends on smallholder farmers that cultivate under rainfed conditions with low technological resources farming methods in the region include fire fallow and shifting cultivation which has resulted in increased deforestation rates of the shrublands locally known as caatinga in addition livestock has become the main economic activity since the 19th century inadequate management practices and overexploitations of natural resources has resulted in increased desertification of the area vieira et al 2015 tomasella et al 2018 the most widely produced grain in the brazilian northeast is maize zea mays l which not only is an important staple food of the local population but also is used to feed animals although maize is one of the most versatile cereal crops previous studies showed that its growth and productivity are likely be affected by increased atmospheric co2 and higher temperatures while higher temperature negatively affects the growth yield and quality of maize the effects of elevated co2 on the yield of maize are contradictory from little positive effect leakey et al 2004 to no effect kim et al 2007 to an increase of yield by 50 vanaja et al 2015 a recent study by abebe et al 2016 in northwest india revealed that maize responded positively to higher atmospheric co2 concentrations and negatively to higher temperature the study also indicated that elevated co2 was able to reduce the negative effect of elevated temperature on maize yield however the reduction of average precipitation the increased frequency of extreme events such as drought and the increase of temperature in northeast brazil marengo et al 2017 might have counterbalancing effects therefore understanding the combined effects of increased co2 and the unfavorable climate conditions for agricultural is crucial for ensuring preparedness and for developing adaptation strategies due to the uncertainties of climate change projections impact assessments should use multimodel climate projections rather than single model approaches to generate a range of plausible scenarios taylor et al 2009 for this reason the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 provides estimates of future climate change around the world based on data from more than 40 global climate models gcms with a grid size ranging from 100 to 200 km since this spatial resolution is inadequate for studies that focus on small scale climate change impacts there is a reliance on the use of regional atmospheric models that allow for horizontal resolutions at the level of tens of kilometers that enable explicit simulations of mesoscale processes with a better representation of local climatic characteristics tavares et al 2018 in the case of brazil chou et al 2014a b showed that dynamic downscaling techniques provide more accurate climate simulations particularly in terms of the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events consequently in this study downscaled climate scenarios for northeast brazil of the regional climate model eta mesinger et al 2012 nested in three cmip5 gcms models were used as input for the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 stetuto et al 2009 to assess the potential impacts of climate change on maize in terms of yield biomass water use efficiency planting dates and crop cycle length input datasets included the representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as the climate change drivers previous studies for instance xiao et al 2015 have shown that under warmer climate conditions maize yield might also be reduced due to early flowering and maturity and consequently shorten reproductive growth stage this is particularly relevant in the semiarid northeast brazil where the need to cope with water shortage and the large intraseasonal rainfall variability have promoted the development of short crop cycle maize varieties therefore we investigated whether potential adaptation measurements specifically the lengthening of the crop cycle mueller et al 2015 could minimize adverse climate change effects since field studies concluded that irrigated maize under elevated co2 levels have a positive effect on water use efficiency resulting in higher yields meng et al 2014 araya et al 2017 we also estimated the attainable productivity of irrigated maize for both short and extended crop cycle varieties and the impacts of the expansion of irrigated areas on water demand for the baseline and future scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study region the study region is located in northeast brazil and covers an area of approximately 1 5 million km² which is 20 of the total brazilian territory fig 1 due to its extension rainfall is modulated by multiple atmospheric systems such as the intertropical convergence zone in the northern part of the region the upper cyclonic vortex the easterly wave disturbances squall lines in the central part frontal systems and the south atlantic convergence zone in the southern part of the region see details in oliveira et al 2017 the annual rainfall is less than 500 mm in the semiarid inner areas and more than 1500 mm in the coastland and in the northwest part of the region which has resulted in various köppen climate types fig 1 the climate of the whole area alternates between a wet season for which timing and characteristics vary throughout the region but generally last between 2 5 months and a dry season for the remainder of the year rainfall is characterized by high spatial variability combined with large intraseasonal to interannual variations cunha et al 2015 based on the frequency of rainy days over a four month period cunha et al 2015 divided the area into five sub regions which are entirely consistent with the different rainfall regimes fig 1 with more than 50 million inhabitants 26 living in rural areas ibge 2010 a large part of the population of the study area depends on agriculture in the classic model of subsistence agriculture ipea 2018 in this context agricultural production in neb is a meaningful source of income especially for family farming 1 1 the definition by the brazilian family farming act law n 11 326 is that it is an agricultural producer that is directly responsible for farm management uses mainly family labor and earns a substantial part of the total family s income from agricultural activities brazil 2006 which is responsible for 82 6 of the jobs in rural areas and 50 of the value of marketed production in addition agriculture and livestock sectors contribute to almost 30 of neb s gross domestic product gdp ipea 2012 maize production mainly by rainfed production systems and modest livestock rearing are the mainstays of household livelihoods in the area the government private companies and social organizations have invested in water infrastructure to promote mitigation actions in neb and to improve traditional agricultural management practices successful initiatives in the são francisco river valley involve irrigated fruit cultivation ipea 2018 obermaier et al 2014 have shown examples of pilot irrigation projects that used small dams in the region to store water although these reservoirs are often sufficient for irrigated agriculture carvalho and egler 2003 inefficient irrigation practices are still in use at small properties positive actions have contributed to mitigate the drought effects on agricultural production although more efficient water management is needed ipea 2018 2 2 meteorological data we integrated rain gauge data from different sources including the brazilian water agency ana and the brazilian national weather service inmet resulting in a database with daily data from approximately 4000 rain gauges as described in souza et al 2001 see figure a1 in supplementary material in addition observations from more than 300 meteorological stations from inmet were used to calculate the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration according to allen et al 1998 the station data was then interpolated to a spatial resolution of 5 km using the inverse of the squared distance and for the period 1980 2005 for the following variables rainfall reference evapotranspiration and maximum and minimum temperature the same spatial resolution has been adopted in previous studies for an adequate representation of the spatial variability of rainfall souza et al 2001 considering the size of the region and the grid resolution the number of pixels use to represent the study area was 57 504 valid points these datasets were used to validate the climate projections for the present climate baseline scenario over the period 1980 2005 2 3 crop and irrigation area data crop productivity data used in this work were those compiled by martins et al 2018 those data sets include 45 experiments from 20 locations those experiments include a mix of maize cultivars 3 4 months from planting to harvest used in the semiarid area which were tolerant of water deficit and the high temporal variability of the rainfall during the growing season we also explored the use of irrigation on maize productivity and the overall regional production to achieve this goal the total planted area of maize for each municipality of the study region was extracted from the municipal agricultural production pam ibge 2016 because not all of the available agricultural land is appropriate for irrigation we used estimations based on the data from the brazilian atlas of irrigation ana 2017 which quantified the irrigated area in 2015 and the potential expansion of irrigated areas in 2030 for each municipality of the study region figure a2 in the supplementary material the expansion takes into account the water availability crop requirements available areas for agriculture considering environmental restrictions infrastructure and logistics land tenure and agricultural aptitude based on soil and topography the current irrigated area in neb is approximately 1 3 million ha and the potential irrigated agricultural expansion is approximately 11 ana 2017 2 4 soil database the soil database used in this study includes approximately 1200 brazilian pits from conventional soil surveys conducted by the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa and are reported in souza et al 2001 data were obtained on the soil type horizon description and depths the physical characteristics texture and stoniness and chemical data for each horizon see figure a1 in supplementary material we used the pedotransfer functions proposed by tomasella et al 2003 to estimate i water contents at field capacity saturation and wilting point ii the saturated hydraulic conductivity and iii the amount of gravel for 10 different depths 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 60 0 80 1 00 1 60 m at each soil pit location to take into account the spatial variability of soil types we used the soil map of vieira et al 2015 to group the soil pits included in each map unit the soil hydraulic properties of each horizon were interpolated to a 5 km grid for each soil map unit separately and then were merged for the whole area although this interpolating technique has limitations for representing the whole range of spatial variability of soils it should be considered that the resulting soil hydraulic map represents the averaged properties over a 5 km squared grid in addition the density of the soil sampling of the available soil surveys is relatively scarce in relation to the size of the study area 2 5 climate projections we used six sets of 20 km spatial resolution downscaled simulations of the eta regional climate model rcm forced by three global cmip5 climate models for two representative concentration pathways rcp for carbon emissions the canesm2 hadgem2 es and miroc5 arora et al 2011 collins et al 2011 watanabe et al 2010 those global models were previously evaluated by chou et al 2014a b 2018 in a study on south america and showed better performance in representing the current climate for this reason the models were used to support the brazilian third national communication to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc brazil 2016b according to the 5th ipcc report 2014 the rcp4 5 and the rcp8 5 scenarios represent optimistic and pessimistic emission scenarios respectively in the present study time slices for the periods 1980 2005 2007 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 were used to represent the baseline and future climate respectively daily maximum and minimum temperatures dew point temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed at 10 m height and solar radiation of the downscaled scenarios were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration using the penman monteith method according to allen et al 1998 to match the interpolated soil hydraulic and meteorological data maps the eta regional scenarios were further refined from a 20 km grid to a 5 km grid using bilinear transformation climate projections were bias corrected to eliminate systematic errors using the method proposed by bárdossy and pegram 2011 which has been successfully used in the region by martins et al 2018 this method assumes that the bias is determined by displacement for the same level of experimental frequency of the cumulative distribution functions derived from observations and from model simulations therefore cumulative distribution functions were determined for each grid cell and for each month based on observations described in item 2 2 and climate model simulations for the baseline scenario 1980 2005 which were afterwards used to eliminate the systematic errors of all regional scenarios 2 6 crop productivity model in a previous study in the same area martins et al 2018 showed that the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 stetuto et al 2009 had good performance in predicting the attainable maize yield the aquacrop model takes into account the impacts of water stress caused not only by stomatal closure but also by reductions in leaf expansion and premature canopy senescence in addition aquacrop accounts for the effects of temperature on crop growth and the impacts of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on crop productivity which makes it suitable for this study given the large spatial domain and the number of evaluations required we used the open source version of the fao aquacrop model foster et al 2017 the aquacrop model is capable of estimating crop productivity based on either fixed length of the crop cycle calendar days cad or on growing degree days gdd simulation runs produced the daily outputs of several variables such as yield t ha 1 biomass t ha 1 transpiration mm water productivity kg m 3 planting date crop cycle day and irrigation mm in addition to the climate described in item 2 2 and soil data indicated in item 2 4 aquacrop requires information about the crop parameters that needs to be calibrated for use in field data as well as the initial soil moisture conditions of the crop cycle in addition the model requires a time series of co2 concentrations to run projections 2 7 maize scenario simulations we used two sets of aquacrop calibrated crop parameters for maize yield simulations those parameters calibrated by martins et al 2018 using a fixed calendar of 120 days hereafter referred to as cad where this length cycle represents most of the cultivars in that area and provides enough accurate results see details in martins et al 2018 crop parameters calibrated for growing degree days using the crop data set of item 2 3 hereafter referred to as gdd these different sets of crop parameters were used to examine adaptation strategies as described in section 2 8 in addition simulations used a time series of co2 atmospheric concentrations extracted from the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ipcc scenarios although the original version of aquacrop raes et al 2009 stetuto et al 2009 considered the effects of soil fertility and salinity stresses these features were not included in the current version of aquacrop os foster et al 2017 therefore maize yield simulations conducted in this study include all physiological stresses related to elevated temperature co2 concentration and water deficit but did not consider conditions of limited soil fertility or elevated soil salinity this simplification is further justified by the fact that the calibration parameters derived by martins et al 2018 are based on controlled field experiments where both fertility and salinity levels are within the recommended ranges bias corrected maximum and minimum temperatures and the reference evapotranspiration and rainfall for both the baseline period and projections for the near future middle and end century of the three cmip5 global models dynamically downscaled over the study area were used as the input for the aquacrop os model using the calibrated crop parameters and soil hydraulic characteristics at 5 km spatial resolutions we estimated maize crop productivity by observing the wettest four month period of each of the five subregions considered in fig 1 planting dates for each simulation were not fixed but were determined by 5 consecutive days with at least 30 mm cumulative rainfall this approximation mimics the traditional management practices of smallholder farmers of the region that wait for the rainfall to plant rather than following a fixed calendar and it allows for variations in the onset of the wet season under future climatic conditions in addition we verified that the adopted amount of rainfall provides enough initial moisture in the soil profile to ensure germination due to the high interannual rainfall variability we assumed that there was complete crop failure whenever the amount of rainfall for triggering planting was not achieved in the first two months of the wet period of each subregion to evaluate the ability of downscaled scenarios to predict crop productivity we compared the crop productivity by using interpolated observations as inputs against the productivity derived by using the bias corrected climate scenarios the quality of the agreement was assessed in terms of the pixel to pixel correlation index and the root square error of the averaged productivity over the baseline period 1980 2005 for both estimations for the whole study area finally crop productivity projections for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the periods 2007 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 were compared to the baseline scenario 1980 2005 results were grouped according to the five subregions considered in fig 1 2 8 cropping system adaptation alternatives although the increase in co2 concentration typically leads to higher plant water use efficiencies that positively influence maize productivity rolla et al 2018 the shortening of the growing season is associated with higher air temperatures to reduce the grain filling period huang et al 2017 lizaso et al 2018 which causes a reduction of yield in addition the decrease of precipitation can negatively affect the transpiration and biomass accumulation further reducing crop yield based on the mutual interactions of those effects and considering the need to adapt to irreversible climate change effects the identification of the most effective combination of strategies and technologies for each regional context remains the main challenge of the agriculture sector burney et al 2014 because the increase in temperature and decrease in water availability are generally the most important causes of yield loss due to climate change adaptation strategies tested in this study were based on the length of the crop cycle and on water demand according to tao et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 cultivars with a longer growing period can increase the use of potential thermal time as well as improve grain yield therefore we compared the productivity of existent varieties and fixed the length of the crop cycle to 120 days which can be achieved using the crop parameters calibrated for cad against the productivity using crop parameters calibrated for the gdd which reflects the effects of warmer climate on the length of the crop cycle it is important to mention that aquacrop uses thermal time gdd as the default option when the alternative calendar time is used cad aquacrop internally estimates gdd taking into account the upper temperature threshold above which crop development no longer increases with increase in air temperature steduto et al 2009 therefore the use of the fixed crop calendar cad in warmer conditions implies that the length of the crop cycle will not change for future climate since aquacrop calculations are performed in gdd fixing the length cycle of the simulations for a warmer climate will implicitly increase the thermal time gdd to a magnitude sufficient to fit within the fixed crop cycle mimicking the behavior of a variety with higher gdd in addition all stress coefficients related to temperature and water availability are recalculated to reflect a higher gdd in other words because the growing period of the gdd simulations becomes shorter due to rising temperature the adaptation option using the cad parameters implicitly assumes that the length of the growing period remains the same as in 2015 which is equivalent to use varieties with a higher temperature sum that suppress the shortening of the growing period due to warming a similar approach was used by van oort and zwart 2017 to assess the impacts of climate change on rice production in africa it might be argued that the same effect could be achieved simply by increasing the thermal time of gdd simulations however genetic variation among cultivars includes not only the variation in timing and duration of the various stages but also in the initial canopy size per seedling canopy growth and decline coefficients rate of root deepening and the response factors to environmental conditions although there are limitations in the use of the fixed crop calendar cad for future climate this assumption is further justified by the fact that crop yield data for cultivars with longer crop cycle are not available in the region the second adaptation measure tested was irrigation management obermaier et al 2014 showed that irrigation projects implemented in the semiarid neb contributed to growth in agricultural productivity and in general led to income increases without irrigation crop losses were in the range of 70 90 in critical years while crops with irrigation systems showed losses in the range of 10 30 consequently we carried out simulations using the net calculation option available in aquacrop which quantifies the amount of water needed to avoid water stress effects but disregards the efficiency of the irrigation system the irrigation method time irrigation schedules and limitations of water supply thus the method accounts for the amount of water needed maintain the soil profile at field capacity on a daily basis although the net calculation option does not reflect actual field conditions it is valuable for comparisons of water demand for the baseline and future periods therefore all simulations were repeated to allow for the use of irrigation and comparisons made in terms of productivity for fixed calendar days and growing degree days as well as in terms of water requirements based on the irrigated areas in 2015 and 2030 ana 2017 and the planted area of maize in 2015 ibge 2016 we estimated the maize crop water demand and production for both historical and future climate change scenarios at the municipal and subregional levels irrigated areas for 2015 were used in the historical scenarios while future scenarios regardless of the time slice used the potential irrigated area estimated for 2030 unless the ibge agriculture census provided planted area specific for each crop the brazilian atlas of irrigation ana 2017 did not specify information on the irrigated area of each crop type therefore we assumed a fraction of the irrigated land was used for maize production based on the information of existent irrigated areas values of planted and irrigated areas were multiplied by the maize yield for irrigated and rainfed conditions and values were accumulated for the 5 climate regions of the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 maize yield estimations for the baseline period using observations and climate models fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the average values of biomass yield water productivity transpiration planting date and crop cycle length over the baseline period which was simulated by aquacrop using as the input interpolated observations and bias corrected eta downscaled scenarios from the miroc 5 hadgem2 es and canesm2 global models visual analysis and the statistics clearly revealed close agreement between simulations run with observation and climate models for the baseline period almost all variables presented a correlation index above 0 90 except for the cycle length in the case of the canesm2 model which indicates excellent performance from all three models the root mean square error between the simulated and observed variables presented a low value usually below 16 of the mean values except the cycle length projected by the canesm2 model in spite of the uncertainties of the climate model projections the good performance of the aquacrop model using bias corrected data from model simulations for the baseline periods gives more confidence in the simulations of future scenarios calibrated aquacrop parameters and other statistical evaluations are presented in table a1 in the supplementary material 3 2 impact of the climate change scenarios on the maize yield fig 3 shows the box and whisker plots of each subregion for rainfed maize yield for different time slices and climate emissions using the crop parameters for gdd and cad in terms of yield it is clear that the simulations using the cad crop parameters were higher than those for gdd however the cad simulations had much larger dispersions compared to the gdd simulations for most of the subregions which was related to the fact that the subregions were delineated based on the 4 wettest months and consequently include areas of high rainfall to the west and east of the study region as well as areas of the semiarid interior because of this the cad simulations showed higher productivity than gdd simulations within the rainy areas and lower productivity within the semiarid areas in other words although the median productivity of the cad simulations was higher the chances for crop failure were also higher which explains why the cultivars currently used in the semiarid region favor a short crop cycle regarding the future scenarios there was a clear decrease in yield which was more drastic in the most distant future and for the highest emissions scenarios for both the gdd and cad simulations in subregion 5 for instance for the 2071 2099 time slice of the pessimistic rcp8 5 the median dropped by 58 for the gdd and 63 for the cad simulations however for the rcp4 5 scenario the yield loss was less significant even though the drop in the median reached 24 and 32 for the gdd and cad simulations respectively in the most distant future in subregion r5 it is interesting to note that the reduction in the yield median tended to be moderate until 2070 for rcp4 5 and until 2040 for rcp8 5 comparisons between the cad and gdd simulations in terms of their sensitivity to climate change indicated that the median relative yield decrease was more pronounced in the case of gdd for subregion 3 while in subregion 5 the results were the opposite that is the cad simulations were more affected by climate change in this subregion in the case of the other subregions the results indicated no consistent signal except in subregion 2 where the performance of cad was marginally better despite the larger dispersion the cad simulations presented a higher yield median compared to that of the gdd simulations in agreement with the findings of huang et al 2018 maize cultivars with a longer growing period were suitable to use as a measurement of adaptation to climate change in general subregion 5 was more affected in terms of the decrease in the maize median yield relative to the baseline followed by subregion 3 while subregion 2 seemed to be less affected in terms of yield losses while there was agreement between all the simulations that the temperature increased in all subregions the projected changes in precipitation differed among the models in certain subregions both in terms of the magnitude and in the signal of changes subregion 5 has been most affected by the reduction of precipitation since the beginning of the century see figure a3 in supplementary material while the most pessimistic scenarios also indicated a sharp reduction of precipitation for subregion 3 with regard to subregions 1 and 4 the climate models diverged in terms of precipitation changes before 2070 but they agreed with the sharp reduction by the end of the century on the other hand subregion 2 was expected to have increases in precipitation until 2070 the increase in precipitation was more noticeable under rcp4 5 which caused a slight increase in the maize yield median srivastava et al 2018 reported an increase of maize productivity in ghana due to the combination of higher co2 concentrations with moderate to no changes in the amount of precipitation and incoming radiation during the growing cycle as concluded by srivastava et al 2018 the impacts of climate change on maize yield depend on how changes in temperature and rainfall amounts combine to bring about shifts in the onset and the length of future growing seasons because of this the decrease in rainfall in future scenarios gradually reduces yields by the end of the century in all scenarios as shown in fig 3 a more comprehensive study in africa by dale et al 2017 showed contrasting results which were mostly related to changes in precipitation da silva et al 2012 showed an increased in climate risk during november and december for neb since that period coincides with the planting date of sub region 5 this explain why our results indicate larger productivity drop in that sub region in a background assessment we verified that the crop cycle length was impacted by up to 14 days shortening comparing cad to gdd simulation reduction of crop cycle length was also found by ojeda bustamante et al 2011 in mexico and prasad et al 2018 in northeast of united states to analyze whether the use of irrigation could minimize the loss of productivity due to climate change fig 4 shows the same box and whistler plots as in fig 3 except that in these simulations irrigation was included as expected there was an increase in yield for both the gdd and cad simulations although the increase was much more significant for the cad simulations and much less spread out in each subregion related to the fact that irrigation suppresses the risk of loss related to dry spells subregion 3 showed the highest dispersion compared to the other subregions which was related to higher temperature in general the cad simulations also showed larger dispersion than the gdd simulations which is likely be related to the length of the growing season in terms of the median it is interesting to note that for the current climate the use of irrigation can significantly increase the productivity of maize in subregion 5 for the baseline scenario 1980 2005 the attainable yield increased from 3 3 to 7 0 t ha 1 in the gdd scenario while it soared from 4 3 to 10 0 t ha 1 for the cad scenario regarding future scenarios it is clear that the reduction in yield was more significant for the gdd compared to the cad scenarios in all subregions for both the gdd and cad simulations the reduction in yield for the most unfavorable scenarios was less severe when compared to non irrigated simulations the time slice 2071 2099 for the rcp8 5 scenario in subregion 5 resulted in crop losses in relation to the baseline of 40 and 33 for the gdd and cad respectively these results suggest that for the worst climate change scenario of subregion 5 yield loss can be reduced by 18 and 30 using irrigation for the gdd and cad respectively in terms of the median it is interesting to note that the drop in productivity would be moderate for all the rcp4 5 time slices and for rcp8 5 until 2070 the decrease in median yield was 20 gdd and 13 cad for the 2071 2099 time slice for rcp4 5 and 25 gdd and 17 cad for the time slice 2041 2070 for rcp8 5 it is clear that irrigation compensates for most of the loss of productivity as suggested by previous studies meng et al 2014 araya et al 2017 however even in conditions with no water stress crop yield will be substantially reduced by the elevated temperatures as in the case of the rcp8 5 for 2071 2099 our results are in agreement with those of burney et al 2014 who tested different technologies and arrangements at the farm level and showed that interventions that focused on efficient irrigation systems can help reduce but not eliminate the dependence on production systems previous results from dale et al 2017 attributed the drop in maize productivity in africa to aquacrop s high sensitivity to precipitation and low sensitivity to temperature relative to other crop models and statistical analyses eitzinger et al 2013 however their results used default maize calibration parameters while in this study the crop parameters were set by site specific controlled field experiments martins et al 2018 and our scenarios predict an increase in temperature up to 5 c in the worst case see figure a3 in supplementary material in addition to the impact of irrigation in productivity fig 5 shows the net irrigation demand for the different subregions and climate change scenarios as expected and because the cad scenario had a longer crop cycle compared to gdd it had higher irrigation requirements and much dispersion among regions for the baseline scenario and in subregion 5 the median irrigation demand was 197 mm for the gdd scenario compared to 272 mm for cad as mentioned before the extra water requirement in the case of the cad scenario 75 mm implies an increase of yield of 3 t ha 1 according to the simulations the effect of increased temperature is evident in all future scenarios and directly impacts the crop water requirement and consequently irrigation requirement for instance in subregion 5 the median of irrigation requirements increased from 271 mm season 1 in the baseline scenario to 378 mm season 1 for rcp8 5 2071 2099 it is important to emphasize that we estimated the irrigation requirements based on net irrigation which does not account for the efficiency of water applications nor for the amount that maximizes yield considering that deficit irrigation could increase water productivity resulting in a yield similar to full irrigation mustafa et al 2017 future studies should consider several options in terms of the requirements and application time schedules for maintaining high yield under water limited conditions fig 5 indicates the irrigation crop requirements for the whole study region and does not explicitly take into account the irrigated areas and areas that are potentially suitable for expansion of irrigation therefore we used data from the rainfed planted area for 2015 the irrigated areas of 2015 and estimations of the irrigated areas for 2030 to calculate the maize production for each scenario and subregion as we mentioned before the brazilian irrigation atlas ana 2017 does not provide a fraction of the irrigated areas used for maize crops detailed information on few perimeters indicates that the proportion used by maize varies between 10 to 50 of the area therefore for the purpose of this study we fixed the irrigated area of maize at 30 for both 2015 and 2030 and assumed it was constant across all irrigated areas fig 6 shows the attainable total production based on the 2015 planted and irrigation areas for the baseline scenarios and the variation in the total production for the future scenarios considering the estimates for irrigation areas for 2030 for subregion r5 which is the more promising region in terms of the expansion of irrigated areas the rcp4 5 scenarios resulted in an increase in production although those gains gradually decreased for the most distant future in the other subregions there was a slight variation plus or minus within 10 of the baseline scenario for all future scenarios with the exception of subregion r3 where the drop in productivity is approximately 16 after 2072 regarding the rcp8 5 scenarios increased production in subregion r5 was verified until 2070 while for the 2072 2099 time slice the gains were cancelled out in the other subregions production gradually decreased and reached values between 30 and 50 in the most distant future in other words potential gains in production due to expansion of irrigated areas were achieved in subregion r5 while the outputs were neutral in other sub regions in the case of the worst emission scenarios such as in rcp8 5 gains in production due to expansion of irrigated areas were not enough to compensate for the negative effects of climate change since the use of irrigation at a large scale has strong implications in terms of water availability fig 7 shows the water demand of each of the scenarios as shown in fig 6 water consumption in subregion 5 was much higher than in the other subregions related to the fact that it has the largest irrigated areas it is also in subregion 5 where the highest impact of water demand occurred for future scenarios with an increase that exceeded 140 compared to the baseline for the most pessimistic scenario a significant increase in demand was also observed in subregion 1 closely followed by subregion 4 all three regions are mostly located in the semiarid area fig 1 where the most significant expansion of irrigated areas are planned for the worst case scenario even subregion r2 showed significant increases in water demand 70 although the scenario indicated that it would be possible to sustain or even increase levels of production in subregion r5 fig 6 those increases were at the expense of a significant increase in water demand because the brazilian atlas of irrigation ana 2017 takes into account water availability at a sub basin level but does not consider the effects of climate change in crop water requirements and in river discharges it is necessary to reassess whether the estimated area for irrigation expansion for 2030 does not have serious implication in other water uses and in ecosystem health in this case the results of fig 5 will need to be adjusted this is particularly relevant considering that the brazilian adaptation plan to climate change brazil 2016a warned that the impacts in northeast brazil are related to the decline in river discharges which are the main source of water for irrigation burney et al 2014 drew our attention to the fact that is necessary to have a clear discussion about what kinds of technologies should be purchased with government funds to decrease the impact of drought and build resiliency by applying the right measures through time especially during good rainy years when the farmer has time and resources to organize his her farm to face longer droughts we recognize that our study is affected by several sources of uncertainties especially the projected climate change scenarios and due to the choice of the crop productivity model however considering that precipitation contributes to most of the uncertainties in model projections dale et al 2017 it can be assumed that most of the limitations of this study are related to climate change models rather than to the crop productivity model used in addition to the models limitations we also ignored the influence of pests weeds and mycotoxins that can become relevant in a warming climate vaughan et al 2014 we did not account for the effect of soil fertility since all simulations assumed optimum nutrients levels under scenarios with increased productivity it is likely to assume that more nutrients will be demanded for soil and that climate change impacts will vary depending on soil fertility 4 conclusions we concluded that maize cultivars with longer growth periods and higher thermal requirements could partially mitigate the negative effects of a warming climate on crop production and food security in the study area our results indicated that there will be a drop in productivity mainly at the end of the century and that no single adaptation can overcome the detrimental effects of the complex interactions imposed by the changes in precipitation temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration in general a drop in productivity is significant for rainfed agriculture losses are kept at less than 20 in the case of irrigated cultivars with longer crop cycles for all scenarios except for the most pessimistic rcp8 5 for the most distant future in terms of the total production output which considered the expansion of irrigated areas until 2030 several scenarios indicate that it is possible to increase production except for the most pessimistic scenario however to sustain the current level of productivity a significant amount of water up to 140 compared to the baseline in the worst case scenario is required our results suggest that it is necessary to develop maize cultivars that use a longer crop cycle and that can adapt and become tolerant to high temperatures in addition irrigation becomes essential to sustaining productivity in adverse climate change scenarios it is important to mention that climate model projections are meant to produce plausible future scenarios to facilitate the exploration of crop management strategies therefore they cannot be treated as a deterministic prediction of the future climate in this context considering the competitive uses of water in the northeast brazil such as human and animal consumption and hydropower it is crucial to examine future demands for different uses in the region considering that irrigation is likely to become essential to sustain maize productivity levels acknowledgement authors would like to thank dr chou sin chan and projeta

11125,this paper assessed the potential impacts of climate change on maize productivity in the brazilian northeast to achieve this objective bias corrected regional downscaled scenarios from three global models for the representative emission pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the periods 1980 2005 2007 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 were used as input data for a crop productivity model because increased temperatures are likely to shorten the crop cycle length thus reducing productivity we investigated the lengthening of the growing cycle as an adaptation strategy to cope with the reduction of rainfall projected by future climate scenarios we analyzed the potential impact of irrigation on productivity the results showed that climate change effects would be mostly negative for maize rainfed agriculture particularly for the worst case scenario rcp8 5 2071 2099 in which losses were expected to reach more than 60 however productivity losses were limited to a maximum of 30 for all rcp4 5 scenarios and before 2070 for the rcp8 5 scenario the use of maize cultivars with a longer crop cycle for rainfed agriculture was likely to increase the average productivity in all scenarios although it came at the expense of increasing the risk of crop failure regarding the use of irrigation there was an improvement in productivity for both the short and long cycle cultivars although longer crop cycle cultivars had a decisive advantage with a drop in yield of less than 20 for all rcp4 5 scenarios and for the rcp8 5 scenario until 2070 compared to the present climate we estimated the total production and the increase in water demand based on the existing and projected irrigated areas in the region and concluded that it is possible to avoid significant losses in total maize production in the region for all scenarios with the exception of the 2071 2099 rcp8 5 scenario however sustaining such levels of production requires a significant increase in water consumption up to 140 key words aquacrop regional climate scenarios water requirements 1 introduction according to the fifth ipcc report ipcc 2014 the projected increases in atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature changes in rainfall patterns and water availability and the intensification of climate extremes are likely to affect the economy environment and societal sectors regarding crop yield those changes might result in a wide variety of impacts asseng et al 2013 porter et al 2014 trnka et al 2014 with productivity increasing in many regions and declining in others challinor et al 2014 ipcc 2014 wheeler and von braun 2013 it is expected that climate changes will affect the sustainability of agricultural systems in many regions and the populations who depend on local food production will be most vulnerable wheeler and von braun 2013 müller et al 2011 asante and mensah 2015 in this context food security will face significant challenges particularly in semiarid environments and cropping technologies will be essential to sustaining production levels for an increasing population in the stressed environment due to global warming in the context of climate change the northeast region of brazil is considered to be one of the most vulnerable regions in the country marengo et al 2016 simões et al 2010 due to its high population exposure high poverty rates and low adaptive capacity the inner region of northeast brazil is largely semiarid characterized by relatively low and high variability in space and time of the rainfall combined with high evaporation rates the region is affected by periodic droughts with severe socioeconomic impacts on the local population and substantial impacts on the public expenditure on mitigation actions recent studies brito et al 2017 marengo et al 2017 suggest that there has been an intensification of both the duration and frequency of severe droughts agricultural production depends on smallholder farmers that cultivate under rainfed conditions with low technological resources farming methods in the region include fire fallow and shifting cultivation which has resulted in increased deforestation rates of the shrublands locally known as caatinga in addition livestock has become the main economic activity since the 19th century inadequate management practices and overexploitations of natural resources has resulted in increased desertification of the area vieira et al 2015 tomasella et al 2018 the most widely produced grain in the brazilian northeast is maize zea mays l which not only is an important staple food of the local population but also is used to feed animals although maize is one of the most versatile cereal crops previous studies showed that its growth and productivity are likely be affected by increased atmospheric co2 and higher temperatures while higher temperature negatively affects the growth yield and quality of maize the effects of elevated co2 on the yield of maize are contradictory from little positive effect leakey et al 2004 to no effect kim et al 2007 to an increase of yield by 50 vanaja et al 2015 a recent study by abebe et al 2016 in northwest india revealed that maize responded positively to higher atmospheric co2 concentrations and negatively to higher temperature the study also indicated that elevated co2 was able to reduce the negative effect of elevated temperature on maize yield however the reduction of average precipitation the increased frequency of extreme events such as drought and the increase of temperature in northeast brazil marengo et al 2017 might have counterbalancing effects therefore understanding the combined effects of increased co2 and the unfavorable climate conditions for agricultural is crucial for ensuring preparedness and for developing adaptation strategies due to the uncertainties of climate change projections impact assessments should use multimodel climate projections rather than single model approaches to generate a range of plausible scenarios taylor et al 2009 for this reason the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 provides estimates of future climate change around the world based on data from more than 40 global climate models gcms with a grid size ranging from 100 to 200 km since this spatial resolution is inadequate for studies that focus on small scale climate change impacts there is a reliance on the use of regional atmospheric models that allow for horizontal resolutions at the level of tens of kilometers that enable explicit simulations of mesoscale processes with a better representation of local climatic characteristics tavares et al 2018 in the case of brazil chou et al 2014a b showed that dynamic downscaling techniques provide more accurate climate simulations particularly in terms of the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events consequently in this study downscaled climate scenarios for northeast brazil of the regional climate model eta mesinger et al 2012 nested in three cmip5 gcms models were used as input for the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 stetuto et al 2009 to assess the potential impacts of climate change on maize in terms of yield biomass water use efficiency planting dates and crop cycle length input datasets included the representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as the climate change drivers previous studies for instance xiao et al 2015 have shown that under warmer climate conditions maize yield might also be reduced due to early flowering and maturity and consequently shorten reproductive growth stage this is particularly relevant in the semiarid northeast brazil where the need to cope with water shortage and the large intraseasonal rainfall variability have promoted the development of short crop cycle maize varieties therefore we investigated whether potential adaptation measurements specifically the lengthening of the crop cycle mueller et al 2015 could minimize adverse climate change effects since field studies concluded that irrigated maize under elevated co2 levels have a positive effect on water use efficiency resulting in higher yields meng et al 2014 araya et al 2017 we also estimated the attainable productivity of irrigated maize for both short and extended crop cycle varieties and the impacts of the expansion of irrigated areas on water demand for the baseline and future scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study region the study region is located in northeast brazil and covers an area of approximately 1 5 million km² which is 20 of the total brazilian territory fig 1 due to its extension rainfall is modulated by multiple atmospheric systems such as the intertropical convergence zone in the northern part of the region the upper cyclonic vortex the easterly wave disturbances squall lines in the central part frontal systems and the south atlantic convergence zone in the southern part of the region see details in oliveira et al 2017 the annual rainfall is less than 500 mm in the semiarid inner areas and more than 1500 mm in the coastland and in the northwest part of the region which has resulted in various köppen climate types fig 1 the climate of the whole area alternates between a wet season for which timing and characteristics vary throughout the region but generally last between 2 5 months and a dry season for the remainder of the year rainfall is characterized by high spatial variability combined with large intraseasonal to interannual variations cunha et al 2015 based on the frequency of rainy days over a four month period cunha et al 2015 divided the area into five sub regions which are entirely consistent with the different rainfall regimes fig 1 with more than 50 million inhabitants 26 living in rural areas ibge 2010 a large part of the population of the study area depends on agriculture in the classic model of subsistence agriculture ipea 2018 in this context agricultural production in neb is a meaningful source of income especially for family farming 1 1 the definition by the brazilian family farming act law n 11 326 is that it is an agricultural producer that is directly responsible for farm management uses mainly family labor and earns a substantial part of the total family s income from agricultural activities brazil 2006 which is responsible for 82 6 of the jobs in rural areas and 50 of the value of marketed production in addition agriculture and livestock sectors contribute to almost 30 of neb s gross domestic product gdp ipea 2012 maize production mainly by rainfed production systems and modest livestock rearing are the mainstays of household livelihoods in the area the government private companies and social organizations have invested in water infrastructure to promote mitigation actions in neb and to improve traditional agricultural management practices successful initiatives in the são francisco river valley involve irrigated fruit cultivation ipea 2018 obermaier et al 2014 have shown examples of pilot irrigation projects that used small dams in the region to store water although these reservoirs are often sufficient for irrigated agriculture carvalho and egler 2003 inefficient irrigation practices are still in use at small properties positive actions have contributed to mitigate the drought effects on agricultural production although more efficient water management is needed ipea 2018 2 2 meteorological data we integrated rain gauge data from different sources including the brazilian water agency ana and the brazilian national weather service inmet resulting in a database with daily data from approximately 4000 rain gauges as described in souza et al 2001 see figure a1 in supplementary material in addition observations from more than 300 meteorological stations from inmet were used to calculate the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration according to allen et al 1998 the station data was then interpolated to a spatial resolution of 5 km using the inverse of the squared distance and for the period 1980 2005 for the following variables rainfall reference evapotranspiration and maximum and minimum temperature the same spatial resolution has been adopted in previous studies for an adequate representation of the spatial variability of rainfall souza et al 2001 considering the size of the region and the grid resolution the number of pixels use to represent the study area was 57 504 valid points these datasets were used to validate the climate projections for the present climate baseline scenario over the period 1980 2005 2 3 crop and irrigation area data crop productivity data used in this work were those compiled by martins et al 2018 those data sets include 45 experiments from 20 locations those experiments include a mix of maize cultivars 3 4 months from planting to harvest used in the semiarid area which were tolerant of water deficit and the high temporal variability of the rainfall during the growing season we also explored the use of irrigation on maize productivity and the overall regional production to achieve this goal the total planted area of maize for each municipality of the study region was extracted from the municipal agricultural production pam ibge 2016 because not all of the available agricultural land is appropriate for irrigation we used estimations based on the data from the brazilian atlas of irrigation ana 2017 which quantified the irrigated area in 2015 and the potential expansion of irrigated areas in 2030 for each municipality of the study region figure a2 in the supplementary material the expansion takes into account the water availability crop requirements available areas for agriculture considering environmental restrictions infrastructure and logistics land tenure and agricultural aptitude based on soil and topography the current irrigated area in neb is approximately 1 3 million ha and the potential irrigated agricultural expansion is approximately 11 ana 2017 2 4 soil database the soil database used in this study includes approximately 1200 brazilian pits from conventional soil surveys conducted by the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa and are reported in souza et al 2001 data were obtained on the soil type horizon description and depths the physical characteristics texture and stoniness and chemical data for each horizon see figure a1 in supplementary material we used the pedotransfer functions proposed by tomasella et al 2003 to estimate i water contents at field capacity saturation and wilting point ii the saturated hydraulic conductivity and iii the amount of gravel for 10 different depths 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 60 0 80 1 00 1 60 m at each soil pit location to take into account the spatial variability of soil types we used the soil map of vieira et al 2015 to group the soil pits included in each map unit the soil hydraulic properties of each horizon were interpolated to a 5 km grid for each soil map unit separately and then were merged for the whole area although this interpolating technique has limitations for representing the whole range of spatial variability of soils it should be considered that the resulting soil hydraulic map represents the averaged properties over a 5 km squared grid in addition the density of the soil sampling of the available soil surveys is relatively scarce in relation to the size of the study area 2 5 climate projections we used six sets of 20 km spatial resolution downscaled simulations of the eta regional climate model rcm forced by three global cmip5 climate models for two representative concentration pathways rcp for carbon emissions the canesm2 hadgem2 es and miroc5 arora et al 2011 collins et al 2011 watanabe et al 2010 those global models were previously evaluated by chou et al 2014a b 2018 in a study on south america and showed better performance in representing the current climate for this reason the models were used to support the brazilian third national communication to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc brazil 2016b according to the 5th ipcc report 2014 the rcp4 5 and the rcp8 5 scenarios represent optimistic and pessimistic emission scenarios respectively in the present study time slices for the periods 1980 2005 2007 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 were used to represent the baseline and future climate respectively daily maximum and minimum temperatures dew point temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed at 10 m height and solar radiation of the downscaled scenarios were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration using the penman monteith method according to allen et al 1998 to match the interpolated soil hydraulic and meteorological data maps the eta regional scenarios were further refined from a 20 km grid to a 5 km grid using bilinear transformation climate projections were bias corrected to eliminate systematic errors using the method proposed by bárdossy and pegram 2011 which has been successfully used in the region by martins et al 2018 this method assumes that the bias is determined by displacement for the same level of experimental frequency of the cumulative distribution functions derived from observations and from model simulations therefore cumulative distribution functions were determined for each grid cell and for each month based on observations described in item 2 2 and climate model simulations for the baseline scenario 1980 2005 which were afterwards used to eliminate the systematic errors of all regional scenarios 2 6 crop productivity model in a previous study in the same area martins et al 2018 showed that the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 stetuto et al 2009 had good performance in predicting the attainable maize yield the aquacrop model takes into account the impacts of water stress caused not only by stomatal closure but also by reductions in leaf expansion and premature canopy senescence in addition aquacrop accounts for the effects of temperature on crop growth and the impacts of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on crop productivity which makes it suitable for this study given the large spatial domain and the number of evaluations required we used the open source version of the fao aquacrop model foster et al 2017 the aquacrop model is capable of estimating crop productivity based on either fixed length of the crop cycle calendar days cad or on growing degree days gdd simulation runs produced the daily outputs of several variables such as yield t ha 1 biomass t ha 1 transpiration mm water productivity kg m 3 planting date crop cycle day and irrigation mm in addition to the climate described in item 2 2 and soil data indicated in item 2 4 aquacrop requires information about the crop parameters that needs to be calibrated for use in field data as well as the initial soil moisture conditions of the crop cycle in addition the model requires a time series of co2 concentrations to run projections 2 7 maize scenario simulations we used two sets of aquacrop calibrated crop parameters for maize yield simulations those parameters calibrated by martins et al 2018 using a fixed calendar of 120 days hereafter referred to as cad where this length cycle represents most of the cultivars in that area and provides enough accurate results see details in martins et al 2018 crop parameters calibrated for growing degree days using the crop data set of item 2 3 hereafter referred to as gdd these different sets of crop parameters were used to examine adaptation strategies as described in section 2 8 in addition simulations used a time series of co2 atmospheric concentrations extracted from the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ipcc scenarios although the original version of aquacrop raes et al 2009 stetuto et al 2009 considered the effects of soil fertility and salinity stresses these features were not included in the current version of aquacrop os foster et al 2017 therefore maize yield simulations conducted in this study include all physiological stresses related to elevated temperature co2 concentration and water deficit but did not consider conditions of limited soil fertility or elevated soil salinity this simplification is further justified by the fact that the calibration parameters derived by martins et al 2018 are based on controlled field experiments where both fertility and salinity levels are within the recommended ranges bias corrected maximum and minimum temperatures and the reference evapotranspiration and rainfall for both the baseline period and projections for the near future middle and end century of the three cmip5 global models dynamically downscaled over the study area were used as the input for the aquacrop os model using the calibrated crop parameters and soil hydraulic characteristics at 5 km spatial resolutions we estimated maize crop productivity by observing the wettest four month period of each of the five subregions considered in fig 1 planting dates for each simulation were not fixed but were determined by 5 consecutive days with at least 30 mm cumulative rainfall this approximation mimics the traditional management practices of smallholder farmers of the region that wait for the rainfall to plant rather than following a fixed calendar and it allows for variations in the onset of the wet season under future climatic conditions in addition we verified that the adopted amount of rainfall provides enough initial moisture in the soil profile to ensure germination due to the high interannual rainfall variability we assumed that there was complete crop failure whenever the amount of rainfall for triggering planting was not achieved in the first two months of the wet period of each subregion to evaluate the ability of downscaled scenarios to predict crop productivity we compared the crop productivity by using interpolated observations as inputs against the productivity derived by using the bias corrected climate scenarios the quality of the agreement was assessed in terms of the pixel to pixel correlation index and the root square error of the averaged productivity over the baseline period 1980 2005 for both estimations for the whole study area finally crop productivity projections for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the periods 2007 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 were compared to the baseline scenario 1980 2005 results were grouped according to the five subregions considered in fig 1 2 8 cropping system adaptation alternatives although the increase in co2 concentration typically leads to higher plant water use efficiencies that positively influence maize productivity rolla et al 2018 the shortening of the growing season is associated with higher air temperatures to reduce the grain filling period huang et al 2017 lizaso et al 2018 which causes a reduction of yield in addition the decrease of precipitation can negatively affect the transpiration and biomass accumulation further reducing crop yield based on the mutual interactions of those effects and considering the need to adapt to irreversible climate change effects the identification of the most effective combination of strategies and technologies for each regional context remains the main challenge of the agriculture sector burney et al 2014 because the increase in temperature and decrease in water availability are generally the most important causes of yield loss due to climate change adaptation strategies tested in this study were based on the length of the crop cycle and on water demand according to tao et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 cultivars with a longer growing period can increase the use of potential thermal time as well as improve grain yield therefore we compared the productivity of existent varieties and fixed the length of the crop cycle to 120 days which can be achieved using the crop parameters calibrated for cad against the productivity using crop parameters calibrated for the gdd which reflects the effects of warmer climate on the length of the crop cycle it is important to mention that aquacrop uses thermal time gdd as the default option when the alternative calendar time is used cad aquacrop internally estimates gdd taking into account the upper temperature threshold above which crop development no longer increases with increase in air temperature steduto et al 2009 therefore the use of the fixed crop calendar cad in warmer conditions implies that the length of the crop cycle will not change for future climate since aquacrop calculations are performed in gdd fixing the length cycle of the simulations for a warmer climate will implicitly increase the thermal time gdd to a magnitude sufficient to fit within the fixed crop cycle mimicking the behavior of a variety with higher gdd in addition all stress coefficients related to temperature and water availability are recalculated to reflect a higher gdd in other words because the growing period of the gdd simulations becomes shorter due to rising temperature the adaptation option using the cad parameters implicitly assumes that the length of the growing period remains the same as in 2015 which is equivalent to use varieties with a higher temperature sum that suppress the shortening of the growing period due to warming a similar approach was used by van oort and zwart 2017 to assess the impacts of climate change on rice production in africa it might be argued that the same effect could be achieved simply by increasing the thermal time of gdd simulations however genetic variation among cultivars includes not only the variation in timing and duration of the various stages but also in the initial canopy size per seedling canopy growth and decline coefficients rate of root deepening and the response factors to environmental conditions although there are limitations in the use of the fixed crop calendar cad for future climate this assumption is further justified by the fact that crop yield data for cultivars with longer crop cycle are not available in the region the second adaptation measure tested was irrigation management obermaier et al 2014 showed that irrigation projects implemented in the semiarid neb contributed to growth in agricultural productivity and in general led to income increases without irrigation crop losses were in the range of 70 90 in critical years while crops with irrigation systems showed losses in the range of 10 30 consequently we carried out simulations using the net calculation option available in aquacrop which quantifies the amount of water needed to avoid water stress effects but disregards the efficiency of the irrigation system the irrigation method time irrigation schedules and limitations of water supply thus the method accounts for the amount of water needed maintain the soil profile at field capacity on a daily basis although the net calculation option does not reflect actual field conditions it is valuable for comparisons of water demand for the baseline and future periods therefore all simulations were repeated to allow for the use of irrigation and comparisons made in terms of productivity for fixed calendar days and growing degree days as well as in terms of water requirements based on the irrigated areas in 2015 and 2030 ana 2017 and the planted area of maize in 2015 ibge 2016 we estimated the maize crop water demand and production for both historical and future climate change scenarios at the municipal and subregional levels irrigated areas for 2015 were used in the historical scenarios while future scenarios regardless of the time slice used the potential irrigated area estimated for 2030 unless the ibge agriculture census provided planted area specific for each crop the brazilian atlas of irrigation ana 2017 did not specify information on the irrigated area of each crop type therefore we assumed a fraction of the irrigated land was used for maize production based on the information of existent irrigated areas values of planted and irrigated areas were multiplied by the maize yield for irrigated and rainfed conditions and values were accumulated for the 5 climate regions of the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 maize yield estimations for the baseline period using observations and climate models fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the average values of biomass yield water productivity transpiration planting date and crop cycle length over the baseline period which was simulated by aquacrop using as the input interpolated observations and bias corrected eta downscaled scenarios from the miroc 5 hadgem2 es and canesm2 global models visual analysis and the statistics clearly revealed close agreement between simulations run with observation and climate models for the baseline period almost all variables presented a correlation index above 0 90 except for the cycle length in the case of the canesm2 model which indicates excellent performance from all three models the root mean square error between the simulated and observed variables presented a low value usually below 16 of the mean values except the cycle length projected by the canesm2 model in spite of the uncertainties of the climate model projections the good performance of the aquacrop model using bias corrected data from model simulations for the baseline periods gives more confidence in the simulations of future scenarios calibrated aquacrop parameters and other statistical evaluations are presented in table a1 in the supplementary material 3 2 impact of the climate change scenarios on the maize yield fig 3 shows the box and whisker plots of each subregion for rainfed maize yield for different time slices and climate emissions using the crop parameters for gdd and cad in terms of yield it is clear that the simulations using the cad crop parameters were higher than those for gdd however the cad simulations had much larger dispersions compared to the gdd simulations for most of the subregions which was related to the fact that the subregions were delineated based on the 4 wettest months and consequently include areas of high rainfall to the west and east of the study region as well as areas of the semiarid interior because of this the cad simulations showed higher productivity than gdd simulations within the rainy areas and lower productivity within the semiarid areas in other words although the median productivity of the cad simulations was higher the chances for crop failure were also higher which explains why the cultivars currently used in the semiarid region favor a short crop cycle regarding the future scenarios there was a clear decrease in yield which was more drastic in the most distant future and for the highest emissions scenarios for both the gdd and cad simulations in subregion 5 for instance for the 2071 2099 time slice of the pessimistic rcp8 5 the median dropped by 58 for the gdd and 63 for the cad simulations however for the rcp4 5 scenario the yield loss was less significant even though the drop in the median reached 24 and 32 for the gdd and cad simulations respectively in the most distant future in subregion r5 it is interesting to note that the reduction in the yield median tended to be moderate until 2070 for rcp4 5 and until 2040 for rcp8 5 comparisons between the cad and gdd simulations in terms of their sensitivity to climate change indicated that the median relative yield decrease was more pronounced in the case of gdd for subregion 3 while in subregion 5 the results were the opposite that is the cad simulations were more affected by climate change in this subregion in the case of the other subregions the results indicated no consistent signal except in subregion 2 where the performance of cad was marginally better despite the larger dispersion the cad simulations presented a higher yield median compared to that of the gdd simulations in agreement with the findings of huang et al 2018 maize cultivars with a longer growing period were suitable to use as a measurement of adaptation to climate change in general subregion 5 was more affected in terms of the decrease in the maize median yield relative to the baseline followed by subregion 3 while subregion 2 seemed to be less affected in terms of yield losses while there was agreement between all the simulations that the temperature increased in all subregions the projected changes in precipitation differed among the models in certain subregions both in terms of the magnitude and in the signal of changes subregion 5 has been most affected by the reduction of precipitation since the beginning of the century see figure a3 in supplementary material while the most pessimistic scenarios also indicated a sharp reduction of precipitation for subregion 3 with regard to subregions 1 and 4 the climate models diverged in terms of precipitation changes before 2070 but they agreed with the sharp reduction by the end of the century on the other hand subregion 2 was expected to have increases in precipitation until 2070 the increase in precipitation was more noticeable under rcp4 5 which caused a slight increase in the maize yield median srivastava et al 2018 reported an increase of maize productivity in ghana due to the combination of higher co2 concentrations with moderate to no changes in the amount of precipitation and incoming radiation during the growing cycle as concluded by srivastava et al 2018 the impacts of climate change on maize yield depend on how changes in temperature and rainfall amounts combine to bring about shifts in the onset and the length of future growing seasons because of this the decrease in rainfall in future scenarios gradually reduces yields by the end of the century in all scenarios as shown in fig 3 a more comprehensive study in africa by dale et al 2017 showed contrasting results which were mostly related to changes in precipitation da silva et al 2012 showed an increased in climate risk during november and december for neb since that period coincides with the planting date of sub region 5 this explain why our results indicate larger productivity drop in that sub region in a background assessment we verified that the crop cycle length was impacted by up to 14 days shortening comparing cad to gdd simulation reduction of crop cycle length was also found by ojeda bustamante et al 2011 in mexico and prasad et al 2018 in northeast of united states to analyze whether the use of irrigation could minimize the loss of productivity due to climate change fig 4 shows the same box and whistler plots as in fig 3 except that in these simulations irrigation was included as expected there was an increase in yield for both the gdd and cad simulations although the increase was much more significant for the cad simulations and much less spread out in each subregion related to the fact that irrigation suppresses the risk of loss related to dry spells subregion 3 showed the highest dispersion compared to the other subregions which was related to higher temperature in general the cad simulations also showed larger dispersion than the gdd simulations which is likely be related to the length of the growing season in terms of the median it is interesting to note that for the current climate the use of irrigation can significantly increase the productivity of maize in subregion 5 for the baseline scenario 1980 2005 the attainable yield increased from 3 3 to 7 0 t ha 1 in the gdd scenario while it soared from 4 3 to 10 0 t ha 1 for the cad scenario regarding future scenarios it is clear that the reduction in yield was more significant for the gdd compared to the cad scenarios in all subregions for both the gdd and cad simulations the reduction in yield for the most unfavorable scenarios was less severe when compared to non irrigated simulations the time slice 2071 2099 for the rcp8 5 scenario in subregion 5 resulted in crop losses in relation to the baseline of 40 and 33 for the gdd and cad respectively these results suggest that for the worst climate change scenario of subregion 5 yield loss can be reduced by 18 and 30 using irrigation for the gdd and cad respectively in terms of the median it is interesting to note that the drop in productivity would be moderate for all the rcp4 5 time slices and for rcp8 5 until 2070 the decrease in median yield was 20 gdd and 13 cad for the 2071 2099 time slice for rcp4 5 and 25 gdd and 17 cad for the time slice 2041 2070 for rcp8 5 it is clear that irrigation compensates for most of the loss of productivity as suggested by previous studies meng et al 2014 araya et al 2017 however even in conditions with no water stress crop yield will be substantially reduced by the elevated temperatures as in the case of the rcp8 5 for 2071 2099 our results are in agreement with those of burney et al 2014 who tested different technologies and arrangements at the farm level and showed that interventions that focused on efficient irrigation systems can help reduce but not eliminate the dependence on production systems previous results from dale et al 2017 attributed the drop in maize productivity in africa to aquacrop s high sensitivity to precipitation and low sensitivity to temperature relative to other crop models and statistical analyses eitzinger et al 2013 however their results used default maize calibration parameters while in this study the crop parameters were set by site specific controlled field experiments martins et al 2018 and our scenarios predict an increase in temperature up to 5 c in the worst case see figure a3 in supplementary material in addition to the impact of irrigation in productivity fig 5 shows the net irrigation demand for the different subregions and climate change scenarios as expected and because the cad scenario had a longer crop cycle compared to gdd it had higher irrigation requirements and much dispersion among regions for the baseline scenario and in subregion 5 the median irrigation demand was 197 mm for the gdd scenario compared to 272 mm for cad as mentioned before the extra water requirement in the case of the cad scenario 75 mm implies an increase of yield of 3 t ha 1 according to the simulations the effect of increased temperature is evident in all future scenarios and directly impacts the crop water requirement and consequently irrigation requirement for instance in subregion 5 the median of irrigation requirements increased from 271 mm season 1 in the baseline scenario to 378 mm season 1 for rcp8 5 2071 2099 it is important to emphasize that we estimated the irrigation requirements based on net irrigation which does not account for the efficiency of water applications nor for the amount that maximizes yield considering that deficit irrigation could increase water productivity resulting in a yield similar to full irrigation mustafa et al 2017 future studies should consider several options in terms of the requirements and application time schedules for maintaining high yield under water limited conditions fig 5 indicates the irrigation crop requirements for the whole study region and does not explicitly take into account the irrigated areas and areas that are potentially suitable for expansion of irrigation therefore we used data from the rainfed planted area for 2015 the irrigated areas of 2015 and estimations of the irrigated areas for 2030 to calculate the maize production for each scenario and subregion as we mentioned before the brazilian irrigation atlas ana 2017 does not provide a fraction of the irrigated areas used for maize crops detailed information on few perimeters indicates that the proportion used by maize varies between 10 to 50 of the area therefore for the purpose of this study we fixed the irrigated area of maize at 30 for both 2015 and 2030 and assumed it was constant across all irrigated areas fig 6 shows the attainable total production based on the 2015 planted and irrigation areas for the baseline scenarios and the variation in the total production for the future scenarios considering the estimates for irrigation areas for 2030 for subregion r5 which is the more promising region in terms of the expansion of irrigated areas the rcp4 5 scenarios resulted in an increase in production although those gains gradually decreased for the most distant future in the other subregions there was a slight variation plus or minus within 10 of the baseline scenario for all future scenarios with the exception of subregion r3 where the drop in productivity is approximately 16 after 2072 regarding the rcp8 5 scenarios increased production in subregion r5 was verified until 2070 while for the 2072 2099 time slice the gains were cancelled out in the other subregions production gradually decreased and reached values between 30 and 50 in the most distant future in other words potential gains in production due to expansion of irrigated areas were achieved in subregion r5 while the outputs were neutral in other sub regions in the case of the worst emission scenarios such as in rcp8 5 gains in production due to expansion of irrigated areas were not enough to compensate for the negative effects of climate change since the use of irrigation at a large scale has strong implications in terms of water availability fig 7 shows the water demand of each of the scenarios as shown in fig 6 water consumption in subregion 5 was much higher than in the other subregions related to the fact that it has the largest irrigated areas it is also in subregion 5 where the highest impact of water demand occurred for future scenarios with an increase that exceeded 140 compared to the baseline for the most pessimistic scenario a significant increase in demand was also observed in subregion 1 closely followed by subregion 4 all three regions are mostly located in the semiarid area fig 1 where the most significant expansion of irrigated areas are planned for the worst case scenario even subregion r2 showed significant increases in water demand 70 although the scenario indicated that it would be possible to sustain or even increase levels of production in subregion r5 fig 6 those increases were at the expense of a significant increase in water demand because the brazilian atlas of irrigation ana 2017 takes into account water availability at a sub basin level but does not consider the effects of climate change in crop water requirements and in river discharges it is necessary to reassess whether the estimated area for irrigation expansion for 2030 does not have serious implication in other water uses and in ecosystem health in this case the results of fig 5 will need to be adjusted this is particularly relevant considering that the brazilian adaptation plan to climate change brazil 2016a warned that the impacts in northeast brazil are related to the decline in river discharges which are the main source of water for irrigation burney et al 2014 drew our attention to the fact that is necessary to have a clear discussion about what kinds of technologies should be purchased with government funds to decrease the impact of drought and build resiliency by applying the right measures through time especially during good rainy years when the farmer has time and resources to organize his her farm to face longer droughts we recognize that our study is affected by several sources of uncertainties especially the projected climate change scenarios and due to the choice of the crop productivity model however considering that precipitation contributes to most of the uncertainties in model projections dale et al 2017 it can be assumed that most of the limitations of this study are related to climate change models rather than to the crop productivity model used in addition to the models limitations we also ignored the influence of pests weeds and mycotoxins that can become relevant in a warming climate vaughan et al 2014 we did not account for the effect of soil fertility since all simulations assumed optimum nutrients levels under scenarios with increased productivity it is likely to assume that more nutrients will be demanded for soil and that climate change impacts will vary depending on soil fertility 4 conclusions we concluded that maize cultivars with longer growth periods and higher thermal requirements could partially mitigate the negative effects of a warming climate on crop production and food security in the study area our results indicated that there will be a drop in productivity mainly at the end of the century and that no single adaptation can overcome the detrimental effects of the complex interactions imposed by the changes in precipitation temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration in general a drop in productivity is significant for rainfed agriculture losses are kept at less than 20 in the case of irrigated cultivars with longer crop cycles for all scenarios except for the most pessimistic rcp8 5 for the most distant future in terms of the total production output which considered the expansion of irrigated areas until 2030 several scenarios indicate that it is possible to increase production except for the most pessimistic scenario however to sustain the current level of productivity a significant amount of water up to 140 compared to the baseline in the worst case scenario is required our results suggest that it is necessary to develop maize cultivars that use a longer crop cycle and that can adapt and become tolerant to high temperatures in addition irrigation becomes essential to sustaining productivity in adverse climate change scenarios it is important to mention that climate model projections are meant to produce plausible future scenarios to facilitate the exploration of crop management strategies therefore they cannot be treated as a deterministic prediction of the future climate in this context considering the competitive uses of water in the northeast brazil such as human and animal consumption and hydropower it is crucial to examine future demands for different uses in the region considering that irrigation is likely to become essential to sustain maize productivity levels acknowledgement authors would like to thank dr chou sin chan and projeta

11126,reasonable uses of water resources can promote the development of oasis agriculture and avoid re desertification of reclaimed land therefore knowledge of the distribution of irrigation water productivity and its relationship with soil properties is important to cope with water scarcity and ensure food security a total of 118 sampling points were selected within the study area of 120 km2 1 km 1 km grid in the oasis field of arid northwest china where the soil organic matter total nitrogen nitrate nitrogen total phosphorus available phosphorus bulk density soil water content silt content sand content and irrigation water productivity iwp yield per unit applied irrigation water were analyzed the traditional statistics geostatistics and partial least squares methods pls were used to investigate i the spatial distribution of soil properties and their changes with the cultivation years ii the relationship between iwp and soil properties iii the key driving factors of iwp from the soil factors the results showed that soil organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorus soil water content and silt content increased with the increase of cultivation years and the correlations were significant except for total phosphorus while the sand content showed the opposite trend and there was no significant relationship between bulk density available phosphorus and nitrate nitrogen with the cultivation years iwp of oasis irrigated fields varied from 0 55 to 3 46 kg m 3 with a moderate spatial heterogeneity cv 40 the average iwp was 1 48 kg m 3 compared with the developed areas of water saving agriculture the iwp of oasis farmland still has great potential for improvement the key driving factors of iwp are available phosphorus and nitrate nitrogen and the iwp can be improved by increasing the application of phosphorus fertilizers and reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the oasis fields of arid northwest china the results provide scientific basis for improving iwp of oasis fields and have a great significance to the sustainable development of water saving agriculture in arid areas keywords irrigation water productivity soil properties spatial variability cultivation years geostatistics partial least squares pls 1 introduction the acreage of global desertification land is 3 6 107 km2 a quarter of the world s total land area kuang 2006 oasis is a special landscape unit with fertile land and stable water resources in the desert area liu et al 2010 which is the subsistence guarantee for people in arid areas fao 2002 reported that over the past 40 years 172 million hectares of cultivated land had been reclaimed in developing countries in the next 30 years to meet the food demand caused by population growth the world s new reclamation of arable land will increase at an annual growth rate of 3 75 million hectares fao 2002 however the global desertification area is overspreading at a rate of 5 7 million hectares per year with the annual direct economic losses of more than 42 billion mabit 2010 kuang 2006 improving the productive capacity and avoiding re desertification of new cultivation land and rational using of the water and soil resources have significant influences on the sustainable development of oasis agriculture in arid areas the limited water resource is restricting the development of oasis agriculture and directly causing land desertification which leads to the decline of arable land under such a critical condition agricultural water use efficiency which is often described as crop water productivity is the key to cope with water scarcity and ensure food security to increase the crop water productivity the main purpose is to produce more food with less water molden et al 2003 while the crop yield is mainly affected by controllable factors such as irrigation fertilization and crop variety and uncontrollable factors such as temperature solar radiation rainfall and other climatic factors loeve et al 2004 as early as 1978 professor heady of iowa state university established the water production functions of irrigated agriculture by studying the effects of irrigation applied nitrogen fertilizer and planting density on maize yield hexem and heady 1978 soil provides water and essential nutrients taken by the crop root systems for crop growth wang and shen 2015 it is also widely reported that crop water productivity is mainly affected by soil properties under particular climatic conditions and irrigation patterns arora et al 2011 bossio et al 2010 connolly 1998 katerji and mastrorilli 2009 the spatial variability of soil properties within or among agricultural fields is inherent because of geologic and soil forming factors mann et al 2010 with the increase of cultivation years the soil physical and chemical properties of newly reclaimed farmland would be changed through long term irrigation and fertilization management and variation of environmental conditions in the early stages of oasis farmland reclamation the soil organic carbon is low because of low bioaccumulation and after planting crops the amount of organic matter input into the soil increase significantly with above ground and below ground biomass however with the increase of planting years the biological physical and chemical properties of soil are relatively stable and the input and output of organic matter are relatively balanced therefore on the temporal scale the content of soil organic carbon and nutrient will increase originally and then become stable after 6 years of cultivation on the spatial scale there would be significant differences in total nitrogen tn and soil organic matter som at different sites most of which are in moderate intensity variation and have significant spatial autocorrelation zhang et al 2009 cambardella et al 1994 investigated field scale variability of soil properties at two sites undergoing different tillage practices in central iowa and found that som and tn had a strong spatial correlation and soil bulk density bd had a moderate degree of spatial correlation while the nitrate nitrogen no3 n had a weak spatial correlation besides as the scale of the study changed the range of spatial variability of soil sand and clay content sand and silt varied from meters to kilometers adhikari et al 2012 ovalles and collins 1988 trangmar et al 1987 in recent years it has been reported that the crop yield is affected by irrigation amount and spatial variabilities of soil properties cemek et al 2007 chen et al 2015 farooque et al 2012 grassini et al 2011 karasu et al 2015 mann et al 2010 stone et al 2010 wright et al 1990 however there is rarely research about the effects of soil physical and chemical properties on irrigation water productivity iwp yield per unit applied irrigation water understanding the soil spatial characteristics of oasis field and its influence on iwp and accurately adjusting the agronomic measures irrigation fertilization tillage methods planting density and so on of oasis fields is necessary to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and promote the development of large scale precision agriculture the objectives of this study are to i analyze the spatial distribution of soil properties and their changes with the cultivation years ii explore the relationship between iwp and soil properties and iii identify the key driving factors of iwp from the soil factors as to provide scientific basis for improving iwp of oasis fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted on the oasis irrigation district fig 1 a in linze county located in the middle reaches of heihe river basin gansu province china in 2015 it is continental arid climate with the annual average precipitation of 117 mm about 60 of the total precipitation during july to september and only 3 during winter the annual potential evaporation of 2365 6 mm the groundwater depth varies between 3 and 8 m and the annual average temperature is 7 6 with the frost free period of 165 d the middle reaches of the heihe river have become an important crop breeding base for its unique light and heat conditions of which the proportion of maize cultivation reached 70 the climatic conditions in the study area are shown in fig 2 heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin of china locating in the central region of hexi corridor the middle catchment is an important cereal production base where about 83 of the total available water resource is used for irrigation jiang et al 2015 with the population growth in recent decades more and more land has been reclaimed as irrigated farmland to meet the increasing food and economic demand which resulted in a further water shortage li et al 2006 according to the literature li and shao 2014 and our field survey the old oasis farmlands which are adjacent to the river bank have been cultivated for over 100 years while some more distanced fields have only been cultivated since 1975 when the ecological restoration was implemented and some fields on the edge of the oasis were cultivated less than 30 years ago based on these data we classified the cultivation years of fields in the study area into three categories 30 50 and 100 years fig 3 the numbers of samples for cultivation years of 30 50 and 100 were 28 26 and 64 respectively since the different cultivation years complex and changeable soil environment has been formed in the middle reaches of heihe river the river flow in the middle reach is from southeast to west 2 2 field investigation and sampling design with 1 km 1 km grid a total of 118 sampling locations in the study area are presented in fig 1b the position and elevation of each location were recorded by a hand held gps receiver with an accuracy of 1 3 m before the maize planting the base fertilizer has been applied soil samples of the tillage layer 0 30 cm were collected with random three subsamples in a 10 m 10 m plot at the sampling location the soil samples were air dried in laboratory and then uniformly mixed with the subsamples also two soil samples were collected near the sampling point by cutting rings with the diameter of 5 cm and volume of 100cm3 for measurements by oven drying method of bd and gravimetric water content of soil swc since 118 sampling points have been set up it is a great challenge to measure the amount of irrigation at each sampling point these data were obtained from water conservancy bureau of linze county automatic monitoring by triangular weir flowmeter and through a survey carried out in our study area the planting pattern of maize was planted 3 narrow rows covered with plastic film alternated 1 wide row the narrow row width was 40 cm and the wide row width was 60 cm the sowing depth of maize was 5 cm and the plant spacing was 25 cm planting density was 8 75 plants m 2 the average nitrogen application was 600 kg ha 1 and the phosphorus application was 86 kg ha 1 including base fertilizer after the maize maturity grain yield yield was measured in 100 m2 area at each sampling location a 100 seed sample was selected randomly weighed and further dried for 72 h at 80 c to determine the seed moisture finally every sampling crop yields have been converted into the grain weight with 13 moisture content li and shao 2014 using the seed moisture data the iwp is defined as the yield per unit of irrigation water use which was calculated as follows 1 i w p y i where iwp is irrigation water productivity in kg m 3 y is maize grain yield with 13 moisture content in kg ha 1 i is the amount of irrigation water in m3 ha 1 2 3 laboratory analysis the air dried soil samples were divided into two subsamples one was sieved through a 2 mm mesh for particle size analysis by laser diffraction using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 analyzer uk the other was passed through a 0 25 mm mesh for soil chemical properties measurements after analyzing the particle size of the soil the soil types were determined according to usda system fig 4 the som was measured by the potassium dichromate oxidation method liu et al 1996 the tn was digested by h2so4 and cupric sulfate potassium sulfate cuso4 k2so4 as the catalyst agent and measured by the kjeldahl method with an automatic kjeldahl apparatus foss 2300 kjeltec analyzer unit sweden lin et al 2010 the no3 n was measured using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe seal analytical gmbh germany kamphake et al 1967 available phosphorus ap was determined by the olsen extraction method using alkaline sodium bicarbonate as the extractant in a 20 1 ratio liang et al 2007 the soil samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 3 h and then hydrochloric acid 3 5 mol l 1 was added after that shaken for 16 h to convert the soil organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus and total phosphorus tp was measured by the olsen extraction method olsen 1954 2 4 statistical and geostatistical analyses the mean maximum minimum standard deviation and coefficient of variation were used to describe the statistical characteristics of soil variables the coefficient of variation cv was used to describe the overall variation in soil variables in the study area for cv 10 heterogeneity was considered to be weak 10 cv 100 was considered as moderate heterogeneity and cv 100 was considered as strong heterogeneity warrick and nielsen 1980 there is a significant correlation between soil properties and related factors heuscher et al 2005 so there may be a problem of collinearity between the independent variables soil properties when analyzing the influence of independent variables on dependent variables iwp and to solve this problem partial least squares pls can be used to quantitatively analyze the dependent variable of iwp afanador et al 2014 ceglar et al 2016 galindo et al 2014 wold et al 2001 in pls analysis the importance of dependent variables is indicated by the variable importance in the projection vip if all the vip scores are 1 it means that the independent variable xj has the same effect importance and influence on the dependent variable if vip score is greater than 1 it means that the independent variable have more important when the vip score is less than 0 8 which means that the independent variable contributes less to the dependent variable leggett et al 2017 wang 1999 wold 1995 therefore this study used the pls vip method to determine the main drivers of iwp the spatial characteristics of iwp and soil properties were analyzed by geostatistical method robertson 1987 rossi et al 1992 warrick and nielsen 1980 the iwp and soil spatial properties semivariogram function was calculated using the following equation isaaks and srivastava 1989 2 γ h 1 2 n h i i n h z x i h z x i 2 where γ h is the semivariance for the interval distance class h h is the sample spacing n h indicates the number of samples with a distance h z xi and z xi h is expressed as the distance h for the value of two sampling points the semivariance functions are mainly spherical eq 3 exponential eq 4 gaussian eq 5 and linear eq 6 with a base value of four empirical models adhikari et al 2012 tesfahunegn et al 2011 3 γ h 0 c 0 c 3 h 2 a h 3 2 a 3 c 0 c h 0 0 h a h a 4 γ h 0 c 0 c 1 exp h a h 0 h 0 5 γ h 0 c 0 c 1 exp h 2 a 2 h 0 h 0 6 γ h c 0 c h a 0 h a where γ h is the semivariance for the interval distance class h h is the sample spacing c0 is the nugget c is the partial sill and a is the range of spatial dependence to reach the sill c0 c the variation function γ h increases with the distance h from a non zero value to a relatively stable constant which is addressed as the base station value both the c0 and c0 c can describe the degree of spatial variation of the variable c0 reflects the possible extent of internal randomness of regionalization variable z x which is mainly expressed as the spatial variation caused by the random variable the higher value of c0 c indicates the larger the spatial variation of the variable c0 c is greatly influenced by its self factors and units of measurement therefore when different variables were compared it depends not only on the value of c0 c at this point the ratio between the c0 and c0 c is used to compare the degree of spatial variation between different variables cambardella et al 1994 robertson et al 1997 if the ratio was less than 25 between 25 and 75 or greater than 75 the variable was considered to be strongly moderately or weakly spatially dependent respectively while if the ratio was 100 or the slope of the semivariogram was close to 0 the variable was considered no spatially correlated range indicates the maximum distance of correlation between sampled data when h a the observations between any two points are correlated and this correlation decreases with the increase of h when h a the observations between any two points are no longer correlated zhang et al 2003 descriptive statistics kolmogorov smirnov k s test and significant difference of iwp and soil properties were analyzed by using a software of spss 21 0 the projection conversion of the sampling locations was implemented and coordinates of the kilometer network of the sampling points were extracted by arcgis 10 0 and then the semivariogram model of iwp and soil properties were fitted by gs 7 0 the analysis of partial least squares was carried out using software of xlstat 2010 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistical analysis the statistics of iwp and soil parameters are shown in table 1 the k s test showed that the data of iwp and soil properties were in a normal distribution p 0 05 except for no3 n and ap the iwp varied from 0 55 to 3 46 kg m 3 and showed a moderate spatial heterogeneity cv 40 the yield varied from 4 04 to 25 43 t ha 1 and showed a moderate spatial heterogeneity cv 36 as for the variable of soil properties bd has a weak spatial heterogeneity cv 10 however other variables of soil showed a moderate spatial heterogeneity in the oasis irrigated farmland the soil properties showed variations such as the content of som varied between 4 18 and 24 60 g kg 1 and soil tn 0 28 1 70 g kg 1 no3 n 3 14 125 81 mg kg 1 tp 0 49 1 11 g kg 1 ap 15 66 136 97 mg kg 1 bd 1 05 1 82 g cm 3 swc 4 97 27 74 silt 20 64 67 48 and sand 17 25 74 77 on the temporal scale iwp yield and soil properties show different changing trends with the cultivation years table 2 iwp yield som tn swc and silt increased with the increase of cultivation years and the correlations were significant while the content of sand showed the opposite trend and there was no obvious relationship between the bd ap and no3 n content with the cultivation years 3 2 geostatistical analysis the semivariogram model of no3 n ap and sand are spherical and yield som tn tp bd and silt are exponential while iwp and swc are gaussian respectively table 3 the c0 of swc was 0 00001 far less than other variables indicating that the spatial variability of soil water content caused by random factors is very small in addition according to table 3 the range of iwp was 3 60 km the ratio of c0 and c0 c was 49 3 which indicates that the iwp has a moderate spatially dependent in the study area som tn swc and silt had a strong spatially dependency through the ratio of c0 and c0 c and others soil properties had a moderate spatial dependency in order to intuitively reflect the spatial distribution of iwp and soil properties based on the semi variance theoretical model we obtained the spatial distribution of iwp and soil properties using the method of ordinary kriging interpolation fig 5 the som tn swc silt and sand were significantly correlated with cultivation years which is in accordance with the results in table 2 the productivity of irrigation water was low in the northwestern part of the study area the main reason was that the poor soil quality led by the shorter cultivation years of the oasis irrigated farmland and the lower yield of crops under the sufficient irrigation water however the iwp was not reduced in the northeast farmland mainly due to the crop production did not reduced too much with the higher available phosphorus levels in the soil besides the variations of no3 n ap and bd did not correlate with the cultivation years the main reason was that with the application of chemical fertilizers there were no significant differences in soil chemical properties between different regions and the annual soil tillage reduces the spatial difference of bd in the tillage layer 3 3 relationship between iwp and soil properties the correlation between iwp and yield and soil properties table 4 showed that the iwp was significantly correlated with soil no3 n and ap while it was not significantly correlated to other soil properties there was a statistically positive correlation between som tn ap and silt content and iwp no3 n tp bd swc and sand content were negatively correlated with iwp som was significantly correlated to soil properties except for no3 n while tn was significantly correlated to all the soil properties table 4 which indicated that the som and tn were affected by fertilization management and soil formation process substantially the content of no3 n was mainly correlated to tn and bd pearson s correlation coefficient 0 246 and 0 190 respectively tp was correlated to all the soil properties except for no3 n and bd and ap was mainly correlated to som tn and tp the pls vip analysis was used to assess the key drivers of iwp and the score of vip for soil properties is shown in fig 6 the pearson s correlation coefficient and vip results indicated that ap pearson s correlation coefficient 0 324 and vip 2 467 and no3 n pearson s correlation coefficient 0 190 and vip 1 448 were important predictors of iwp in addition it can be seen that at the scale of this study the chemical properties som tn and tp of the soil have a greater impact on iwp than the physical properties bd silt and sand 4 discussion in this study iwp of oasis irrigated fields varied from 0 55 to 3 46 kg m 3 with a moderate spatial heterogeneity cv 40 the average iwp was 1 48 kg m 3 which was much lower than 2 0 kg m 3 in developed areas of water saving agriculture wu et al 2007 there were 57 6 of the sampling sites with the iwp less than 1 48 kg m 3 24 6 of the sampling sites with the iwp greater than 1 48 kg m 3 and less than 2 0 kg m 3 and 17 8 of the sampling sites with the iwp greater than 2 0 kg m 3 it indicated that there was still considerable potential to improve iwp in some oasis irrigated farmland the reasons of low iwp fig 5 in northwest of the study area are as follows i this part of the farmland is near to the source of water heihe river the convenience of water leading to a much greater amount of irrigation than other areas and ii the low ap in the soil reduced the grain yield of maize wu et al 2015 the results of this study show a moderate spatial heterogeneity of soil properties except for bd table 1 indicating that there was no significant difference within the soils of tillage layer after cultivation for decades at the irrigation district scale moreover the sum of silt and sand was nearly 90 mainly because that the southern and northern edges of the study area are desert while the majority of the area was newly reclaimed farmland in nearly 50 years the internal environment of soil is very complex the soil nutrient flow and transformation were affected by cultivation years and tillage methods which lead to large temporal scale changes in soil nutrients zhang et al 2016 in the oasis irrigated farmland cultivated in less than 10 years the absorption and utilization of cotton will reduce the nutrient content of the soil early in the reclamation and then gradually accumulate with the constant input of organic matter and fertilizers to the soil nutrient content gu et al 2016 and soil properties approached a relatively stable level in nearly 30 years after cultivation in coastal farmland areas li et al 2014 as for the karst mountainous region where the fields had been cultivated over 30 years there was no significant correlation between soil nutrient content and cultivation years zhou et al 2011 however our results showed that som tn swc and silt content increased with the cultivation years significantly while the sand had the opposite trend and there were no obvious changes in the bd ap and no3 n content with the cultivation years table 2 the main reasons are a the oasis irrigated fields of the study area used to be desert before cultivation and had a relatively low soil nutrients while a large amount of crop residues and manure was applied after cultivation resulting in the accumulation of soil nutrient b the input of small particulate matter carried by surface water irrigation for a long time can effectively increase the soil silt content in the tillage layer su et al 2017 c with the increase of silt content in soil the proportion of aeration pore decreased and the soil water holding capacity increased su et al 2013 therefore under the condition of irrigation with the same amount of water it shows that swc measured before sowing increased with the cultivation years d the application of chemical fertilizers during crop growth stages directly converted into available nutrients and resulted in the increments of soil no3 n and ap which have no significant relationship with the cultivation years as shown in table 3 the spatial variability function of soil properties was spherical exponential and gaussian and the regression coefficient r2 of the model are higher than 0 75 n 118 this indicates that it is feasible to analyze the spatial variability of soil properties at the scale of irrigation district by semivariance function model zheng et al 2009 reported that agronomic practice such as fertilization soil management and land use weakened the spatial variability of soil chemical properties tn ap and ak however in this study we found that the som and tn had strong spatial variability table 3 the main reason was that in the oasis region the irrigation districts differed in the accumulation of som and tn during different cultivation years table 2 the bd and sand had moderate spatial variability it is mainly because that the soil particle size of the tillage layer would gradually stabilize with the increase of cultivation years sun et al 2011 additionally the decline of groundwater level and swc with the increase of the distance from the heihe river also leads to the strong spatial variability of swc in different areas the range indicates the shortest distance in the farmland beyond which measured properties are no longer spatially correlated gülser et al 2016 the range of soil properties varied with the scale of study areas adhikari et al 2012 ovalles and collins 1988 trangmar et al 1987 rodríguez et al 2009 studied the spatial variability of soil properties under pinus canariensis canopy in 8 m 8 m study areas and found that the average range of soil no3 n was only 1 93 m but di virgilio et al 2007 studied spatial variability of switchgrass in 4 8 ha fields and reported that the range of tn was more than 250 m the range of som ap silt and sand content varied between 178 m and 253 m in this study we analyzed soil properties of oasis irrigated fields in 120 km2 areas and found that the range of tn and bd were more than 30 km and the minimum range of swc was 3 77 km therefore we were found that the range of soil properties will increase with the sampling interval increases tolk and howell 2012 reported that the iwp tended to increase with the crop yield increment while the spatial variability of crop yields was affected by soil properties in different regions gaston et al 2001 mzuku et al 2005 rockström et al 1999 therefore the spatial variation of iwp was closely related to the spatial characteristics of soil properties in this study we found that the tn tp ap swc and silt had a significant positive correlation with som and the iwp was positively correlated to som tn ap swc and silt content table 4 the reason was that the increase of organic matter can effectively improve soil physical and chemical conditions and promote crop growth by increasing water capacity which will lead to an increment of crop yields so as to iwp ali and talukder 2008 in agricultural production it is impossible to improve the iwp through controlling all the soil factors which affect crop growth therefore it is necessary to find the key driving factors of the water productivity and thereby control it in this study we found that ap and no3 n were important predictors of iwp the main reasons are i the spatial heterogeneity of ap cv 57 and no3 n cv 86 were significantly greater than those of other soil factors ii soil available nutrients are the main source of nutrients absorbed by crop roots there was a significant negative correlation between iwp and no3 n and the average nitrogen applied was 600 kg ha 1 in our research area far more than the suggested nitrogen application which is 183 270 kg ha 1 in maize field castaldelli et al 2018 guo et al 2017 hu et al 2013 thus it can be seen that there was a serious waste of nitrogen fertilizer in the study area besides the ap has a positive effect on iwp pearson s correlation coefficient 0 324 and the mainly reason is appropriate increase the soil phosphorus content will increase crop yields which resulted in the increment of the iwp wu et al 2015 in summary from the perspective of farmer activity the iwp can be improved by increasing the application of phosphorus fertilizers and reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the oasis fields of arid northwest china 5 conclusion the analysis of spatial variability of soil properties and iwp is essential to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and promote the development of large scale precision agriculture in this study the som tn tp swc and silt content increase with the cultivation years of oasis irrigated farmland on the spatial scale the iwp and soil properties except for bd show a moderate spatial heterogeneity and the range of soil properties gradually increase with the sampling interval increases of the research area the key driving factors of iwp are ap and no3 n and the iwp varies from 0 55 to 3 46 kg m 3 which can provide a reference for planting management in oasis irrigated agriculture the iwp can be improved by increasing the application of phosphorus fertilizers and reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the oasis fields of arid northwest china the results provide scientific basis for improving iwp of oasis fields and have a great significance to the sustainable development of water saving agriculture in arid areas

increasing the application of phosphorus fertilizers and reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the oasis fields of arid northwest china the results provide scientific basis for improving iwp of oasis fields and have a great significance to the sustainable development of water saving agriculture in arid areas keywords irrigation water productivity soil properties spatial variability cultivation years geostatistics partial least squares pls 1 introduction the acreage of global desertification land is 3 6 107 km2 a quarter of the world s total land area kuang 2006 oasis is a special landscape unit with fertile land and stable water resources in the desert area liu et al 2010 which is the subsistence guarantee for people in arid areas fao 2002 reported that over the past 40 years 172 million hectares of cultivated land had been reclaimed in developing countries in the next 30 years to meet the food demand caused by population growth the world s new reclamation of arable land will increase at an annual growth rate of 3 75 million hectares fao 2002 however the global desertification area is overspreading at a rate of 5 7 million hectares per year with the annual direct economic losses of more than 42 billion mabit 2010 kuang 2006 improving the productive capacity and avoiding re desertification of new cultivation land and rational using of the water and soil resources have significant influences on the sustainable development of oasis agriculture in arid areas the limited water resource is restricting the development of oasis agriculture and directly causing land desertification which leads to the decline of arable land under such a critical condition agricultural water use efficiency which is often described as crop water productivity is the key to cope with water scarcity and ensure food security to increase the crop water productivity the main purpose is to produce more food with less water molden et al 2003 while the crop yield is mainly affected by controllable factors such as irrigation fertilization and crop variety and uncontrollable factors such as temperature solar radiation rainfall and other climatic factors loeve et al 2004 as early as 1978 professor heady of iowa state university established the water production functions of irrigated agriculture by studying the effects of irrigation applied nitrogen fertilizer and planting density on maize yield hexem and heady 1978 soil provides water and essential nutrients taken by the crop root systems for crop growth wang and shen 2015 it is also widely reported that crop water productivity is mainly affected by soil properties under particular climatic conditions and irrigation patterns arora et al 2011 bossio et al 2010 connolly 1998 katerji and mastrorilli 2009 the spatial variability of soil properties within or among agricultural fields is inherent because of geologic and soil forming factors mann et al 2010 with the increase of cultivation years the soil physical and chemical properties of newly reclaimed farmland would be changed through long term irrigation and fertilization management and variation of environmental conditions in the early stages of oasis farmland reclamation the soil organic carbon is low because of low bioaccumulation and after planting crops the amount of organic matter input into the soil increase significantly with above ground and below ground biomass however with the increase of planting years the biological physical and chemical properties of soil are relatively stable and the input and output of organic matter are relatively balanced therefore on the temporal scale the content of soil organic carbon and nutrient will increase originally and then become stable after 6 years of cultivation on the spatial scale there would be significant differences in total nitrogen tn and soil organic matter som at different sites most of which are in moderate intensity variation and have significant spatial autocorrelation zhang et al 2009 cambardella et al 1994 investigated field scale variability of soil properties at two sites undergoing different tillage practices in central iowa and found that som and tn had a strong spatial correlation and soil bulk density bd had a moderate degree of spatial correlation while the nitrate nitrogen no3 n had a weak spatial correlation besides as the scale of the study changed the range of spatial variability of soil sand and clay content sand and silt varied from meters to kilometers adhikari et al 2012 ovalles and collins 1988 trangmar et al 1987 in recent years it has been reported that the crop yield is affected by irrigation amount and spatial variabilities of soil properties cemek et al 2007 chen et al 2015 farooque et al 2012 grassini et al 2011 karasu et al 2015 mann et al 2010 stone et al 2010 wright et al 1990 however there is rarely research about the effects of soil physical and chemical properties on irrigation water productivity iwp yield per unit applied irrigation water understanding the soil spatial characteristics of oasis field and its influence on iwp and accurately adjusting the agronomic measures irrigation fertilization tillage methods planting density and so on of oasis fields is necessary to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and promote the development of large scale precision agriculture the objectives of this study are to i analyze the spatial distribution of soil properties and their changes with the cultivation years ii explore the relationship between iwp and soil properties and iii identify the key driving factors of iwp from the soil factors as to provide scientific basis for improving iwp of oasis fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted on the oasis irrigation district fig 1 a in linze county located in the middle reaches of heihe river basin gansu province china in 2015 it is continental arid climate with the annual average precipitation of 117 mm about 60 of the total precipitation during july to september and only 3 during winter the annual potential evaporation of 2365 6 mm the groundwater depth varies between 3 and 8 m and the annual average temperature is 7 6 with the frost free period of 165 d the middle reaches of the heihe river have become an important crop breeding base for its unique light and heat conditions of which the proportion of maize cultivation reached 70 the climatic conditions in the study area are shown in fig 2 heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin of china locating in the central region of hexi corridor the middle catchment is an important cereal production base where about 83 of the total available water resource is used for irrigation jiang et al 2015 with the population growth in recent decades more and more land has been reclaimed as irrigated farmland to meet the increasing food and economic demand which resulted in a further water shortage li et al 2006 according to the literature li and shao 2014 and our field survey the old oasis farmlands which are adjacent to the river bank have been cultivated for over 100 years while some more distanced fields have only been cultivated since 1975 when the ecological restoration was implemented and some fields on the edge of the oasis were cultivated less than 30 years ago based on these data we classified the cultivation years of fields in the study area into three categories 30 50 and 100 years fig 3 the numbers of samples for cultivation years of 30 50 and 100 were 28 26 and 64 respectively since the different cultivation years complex and changeable soil environment has been formed in the middle reaches of heihe river the river flow in the middle reach is from southeast to west 2 2 field investigation and sampling design with 1 km 1 km grid a total of 118 sampling locations in the study area are presented in fig 1b the position and elevation of each location were recorded by a hand held gps receiver with an accuracy of 1 3 m before the maize planting the base fertilizer has been applied soil samples of the tillage layer 0 30 cm were collected with random three subsamples in a 10 m 10 m plot at the sampling location the soil samples were air dried in laboratory and then uniformly mixed with the subsamples also two soil samples were collected near the sampling point by cutting rings with the diameter of 5 cm and volume of 100cm3 for measurements by oven drying method of bd and gravimetric water content of soil swc since 118 sampling points have been set up it is a great challenge to measure the amount of irrigation at each sampling point these data were obtained from water conservancy bureau of linze county automatic monitoring by triangular weir flowmeter and through a survey carried out in our study area the planting pattern of maize was planted 3 narrow rows covered with plastic film alternated 1 wide row the narrow row width was 40 cm and the wide row width was 60 cm the sowing depth of maize was 5 cm and the plant spacing was 25 cm planting density was 8 75 plants m 2 the average nitrogen application was 600 kg ha 1 and the phosphorus application was 86 kg ha 1 including base fertilizer after the maize maturity grain yield yield was measured in 100 m2 area at each sampling location a 100 seed sample was selected randomly weighed and further dried for 72 h at 80 c to determine the seed moisture finally every sampling crop yields have been converted into the grain weight with 13 moisture content li and shao 2014 using the seed moisture data the iwp is defined as the yield per unit of irrigation water use which was calculated as follows 1 i w p y i where iwp is irrigation water productivity in kg m 3 y is maize grain yield with 13 moisture content in kg ha 1 i is the amount of irrigation water in m3 ha 1 2 3 laboratory analysis the air dried soil samples were divided into two subsamples one was sieved through a 2 mm mesh for particle size analysis by laser diffraction using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 analyzer uk the other was passed through a 0 25 mm mesh for soil chemical properties measurements after analyzing the particle size of the soil the soil types were determined according to usda system fig 4 the som was measured by the potassium dichromate oxidation method liu et al 1996 the tn was digested by h2so4 and cupric sulfate potassium sulfate cuso4 k2so4 as the catalyst agent and measured by the kjeldahl method with an automatic kjeldahl apparatus foss 2300 kjeltec analyzer unit sweden lin et al 2010 the no3 n was measured using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe seal analytical gmbh germany kamphake et al 1967 available phosphorus ap was determined by the olsen extraction method using alkaline sodium bicarbonate as the extractant in a 20 1 ratio liang et al 2007 the soil samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 3 h and then hydrochloric acid 3 5 mol l 1 was added after that shaken for 16 h to convert the soil organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus and total phosphorus tp was measured by the olsen extraction method olsen 1954 2 4 statistical and geostatistical analyses the mean maximum minimum standard deviation and coefficient of variation were used to describe the statistical characteristics of soil variables the coefficient of variation cv was used to describe the overall variation in soil variables in the study area for cv 10 heterogeneity was considered to be weak 10 cv 100 was considered as moderate heterogeneity and cv 100 was considered as strong heterogeneity warrick and nielsen 1980 there is a significant correlation between soil properties and related factors heuscher et al 2005 so there may be a problem of collinearity between the independent variables soil properties when analyzing the influence of independent variables on dependent variables iwp and to solve this problem partial least squares pls can be used to quantitatively analyze the dependent variable of iwp afanador et al 2014 ceglar et al 2016 galindo et al 2014 wold et al 2001 in pls analysis the importance of dependent variables is indicated by the variable importance in the projection vip if all the vip scores are 1 it means that the independent variable xj has the same effect importance and influence on the dependent variable if vip score is greater than 1 it means that the independent variable have more important when the vip score is less than 0 8 which means that the independent variable contributes less to the dependent variable leggett et al 2017 wang 1999 wold 1995 therefore this study used the pls vip method to determine the main drivers of iwp the spatial characteristics of iwp and soil properties were analyzed by geostatistical method robertson 1987 rossi et al 1992 warrick and nielsen 1980 the iwp and soil spatial properties semivariogram function was calculated using the following equation isaaks and srivastava 1989 2 γ h 1 2 n h i i n h z x i h z x i 2 where γ h is the semivariance for the interval distance class h h is the sample spacing n h indicates the number of samples with a distance h z xi and z xi h is expressed as the distance h for the value of two sampling points the semivariance functions are mainly spherical eq 3 exponential eq 4 gaussian eq 5 and linear eq 6 with a base value of four empirical models adhikari et al 2012 tesfahunegn et al 2011 3 γ h 0 c 0 c 3 h 2 a h 3 2 a 3 c 0 c h 0 0 h a h a 4 γ h 0 c 0 c 1 exp h a h 0 h 0 5 γ h 0 c 0 c 1 exp h 2 a 2 h 0 h 0 6 γ h c 0 c h a 0 h a where γ h is the semivariance for the interval distance class h h is the sample spacing c0 is the nugget c is the partial sill and a is the range of spatial dependence to reach the sill c0 c the variation function γ h increases with the distance h from a non zero value to a relatively stable constant which is addressed as the base station value both the c0 and c0 c can describe the degree of spatial variation of the variable c0 reflects the possible extent of internal randomness of regionalization variable z x which is mainly expressed as the spatial variation caused by the random variable the higher value of c0 c indicates the larger the spatial variation of the variable c0 c is greatly influenced by its self factors and units of measurement therefore when different variables were compared it depends not only on the value of c0 c at this point the ratio between the c0 and c0 c is used to compare the degree of spatial variation between different variables cambardella et al 1994 robertson et al 1997 if the ratio was less than 25 between 25 and 75 or greater than 75 the variable was considered to be strongly moderately or weakly spatially dependent respectively while if the ratio was 100 or the slope of the semivariogram was close to 0 the variable was considered no spatially correlated range indicates the maximum distance of correlation between sampled data when h a the observations between any two points are correlated and this correlation decreases with the increase of h when h a the observations between any two points are no longer correlated zhang et al 2003 descriptive statistics kolmogorov smirnov k s test and significant difference of iwp and soil properties were analyzed by using a software of spss 21 0 the projection conversion of the sampling locations was implemented and coordinates of the kilometer network of the sampling points were extracted by arcgis 10 0 and then the semivariogram model of iwp and soil properties were fitted by gs 7 0 the analysis of partial least squares was carried out using software of xlstat 2010 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistical analysis the statistics of iwp and soil parameters are shown in table 1 the k s test showed that the data of iwp and soil properties were in a normal distribution p 0 05 except for no3 n and ap the iwp varied from 0 55 to 3 46 kg m 3 and showed a moderate spatial heterogeneity cv 40 the yield varied from 4 04 to 25 43 t ha 1 and showed a moderate spatial heterogeneity cv 36 as for the variable of soil properties bd has a weak spatial heterogeneity cv 10 however other variables of soil showed a moderate spatial heterogeneity in the oasis irrigated farmland the soil properties showed variations such as the content of som varied between 4 18 and 24 60 g kg 1 and soil tn 0 28 1 70 g kg 1 no3 n 3 14 125 81 mg kg 1 tp 0 49 1 11 g kg 1 ap 15 66 136 97 mg kg 1 bd 1 05 1 82 g cm 3 swc 4 97 27 74 silt 20 64 67 48 and sand 17 25 74 77 on the temporal scale iwp yield and soil properties show different changing trends with the cultivation years table 2 iwp yield som tn swc and silt increased with the increase of cultivation years and the correlations were significant while the content of sand showed the opposite trend and there was no obvious relationship between the bd ap and no3 n content with the cultivation years 3 2 geostatistical analysis the semivariogram model of no3 n ap and sand are spherical and yield som tn tp bd and silt are exponential while iwp and swc are gaussian respectively table 3 the c0 of swc was 0 00001 far less than other variables indicating that the spatial variability of soil water content caused by random factors is very small in addition according to table 3 the range of iwp was 3 60 km the ratio of c0 and c0 c was 49 3 which indicates that the iwp has a moderate spatially dependent in the study area som tn swc and silt had a strong spatially dependency through the ratio of c0 and c0 c and others soil properties had a moderate spatial dependency in order to intuitively reflect the spatial distribution of iwp and soil properties based on the semi variance theoretical model we obtained the spatial distribution of iwp and soil properties using the method of ordinary kriging interpolation fig 5 the som tn swc silt and sand were significantly correlated with cultivation years which is in accordance with the results in table 2 the productivity of irrigation water was low in the northwestern part of the study area the main reason was that the poor soil quality led by the shorter cultivation years of the oasis irrigated farmland and the lower yield of crops under the sufficient irrigation water however the iwp was not reduced in the northeast farmland mainly due to the crop production did not reduced too much with the higher available phosphorus levels in the soil besides the variations of no3 n ap and bd did not correlate with the cultivation years the main reason was that with the application of chemical fertilizers there were no significant differences in soil chemical properties between different regions and the annual soil tillage reduces the spatial difference of bd in the tillage layer 3 3 relationship between iwp and soil properties the correlation between iwp and yield and soil properties table 4 showed that the iwp was significantly correlated with soil no3 n and ap while it was not significantly correlated to other soil properties there was a statistically positive correlation between som tn ap and silt content and iwp no3 n tp bd swc and sand content were negatively correlated with iwp som was significantly correlated to soil properties except for no3 n while tn was significantly correlated to all the soil properties table 4 which indicated that the som and tn were affected by fertilization management and soil formation process substantially the content of no3 n was mainly correlated to tn and bd pearson s correlation coefficient 0 246 and 0 190 respectively tp was correlated to all the soil properties except for no3 n and bd and ap was mainly correlated to som tn and tp the pls vip analysis was used to assess the key drivers of iwp and the score of vip for soil properties is shown in fig 6 the pearson s correlation coefficient and vip results indicated that ap pearson s correlation coefficient 0 324 and vip 2 467 and no3 n pearson s correlation coefficient 0 190 and vip 1 448 were important predictors of iwp in addition it can be seen that at the scale of this study the chemical properties som tn and tp of the soil have a greater impact on iwp than the physical properties bd silt and sand 4 discussion in this study iwp of oasis irrigated fields varied from 0 55 to 3 46 kg m 3 with a moderate spatial heterogeneity cv 40 the average iwp was 1 48 kg m 3 which was much lower than 2 0 kg m 3 in developed areas of water saving agriculture wu et al 2007 there were 57 6 of the sampling sites with the iwp less than 1 48 kg m 3 24 6 of the sampling sites with the iwp greater than 1 48 kg m 3 and less than 2 0 kg m 3 and 17 8 of the sampling sites with the iwp greater than 2 0 kg m 3 it indicated that there was still considerable potential to improve iwp in some oasis irrigated farmland the reasons of low iwp fig 5 in northwest of the study area are as follows i this part of the farmland is near to the source of water heihe river the convenience of water leading to a much greater amount of irrigation than other areas and ii the low ap in the soil reduced the grain yield of maize wu et al 2015 the results of this study show a moderate spatial heterogeneity of soil properties except for bd table 1 indicating that there was no significant difference within the soils of tillage layer after cultivation for decades at the irrigation district scale moreover the sum of silt and sand was nearly 90 mainly because that the southern and northern edges of the study area are desert while the majority of the area was newly reclaimed farmland in nearly 50 years the internal environment of soil is very complex the soil nutrient flow and transformation were affected by cultivation years and tillage methods which lead to large temporal scale changes in soil nutrients zhang et al 2016 in the oasis irrigated farmland cultivated in less than 10 years the absorption and utilization of cotton will reduce the nutrient content of the soil early in the reclamation and then gradually accumulate with the constant input of organic matter and fertilizers to the soil nutrient content gu et al 2016 and soil properties approached a relatively stable level in nearly 30 years after cultivation in coastal farmland areas li et al 2014 as for the karst mountainous region where the fields had been cultivated over 30 years there was no significant correlation between soil nutrient content and cultivation years zhou et al 2011 however our results showed that som tn swc and silt content increased with the cultivation years significantly while the sand had the opposite trend and there were no obvious changes in the bd ap and no3 n content with the cultivation years table 2 the main reasons are a the oasis irrigated fields of the study area used to be desert before cultivation and had a relatively low soil nutrients while a large amount of crop residues and manure was applied after cultivation resulting in the accumulation of soil nutrient b the input of small particulate matter carried by surface water irrigation for a long time can effectively increase the soil silt content in the tillage layer su et al 2017 c with the increase of silt content in soil the proportion of aeration pore decreased and the soil water holding capacity increased su et al 2013 therefore under the condition of irrigation with the same amount of water it shows that swc measured before sowing increased with the cultivation years d the application of chemical fertilizers during crop growth stages directly converted into available nutrients and resulted in the increments of soil no3 n and ap which have no significant relationship with the cultivation years as shown in table 3 the spatial variability function of soil properties was spherical exponential and gaussian and the regression coefficient r2 of the model are higher than 0 75 n 118 this indicates that it is feasible to analyze the spatial variability of soil properties at the scale of irrigation district by semivariance function model zheng et al 2009 reported that agronomic practice such as fertilization soil management and land use weakened the spatial variability of soil chemical properties tn ap and ak however in this study we found that the som and tn had strong spatial variability table 3 the main reason was that in the oasis region the irrigation districts differed in the accumulation of som and tn during different cultivation years table 2 the bd and sand had moderate spatial variability it is mainly because that the soil particle size of the tillage layer would gradually stabilize with the increase of cultivation years sun et al 2011 additionally the decline of groundwater level and swc with the increase of the distance from the heihe river also leads to the strong spatial variability of swc in different areas the range indicates the shortest distance in the farmland beyond which measured properties are no longer spatially correlated gülser et al 2016 the range of soil properties varied with the scale of study areas adhikari et al 2012 ovalles and collins 1988 trangmar et al 1987 rodríguez et al 2009 studied the spatial variability of soil properties under pinus canariensis canopy in 8 m 8 m study areas and found that the average range of soil no3 n was only 1 93 m but di virgilio et al 2007 studied spatial variability of switchgrass in 4 8 ha fields and reported that the range of tn was more than 250 m the range of som ap silt and sand content varied between 178 m and 253 m in this study we analyzed soil properties of oasis irrigated fields in 120 km2 areas and found that the range of tn and bd were more than 30 km and the minimum range of swc was 3 77 km therefore we were found that the range of soil properties will increase with the sampling interval increases tolk and howell 2012 reported that the iwp tended to increase with the crop yield increment while the spatial variability of crop yields was affected by soil properties in different regions gaston et al 2001 mzuku et al 2005 rockström et al 1999 therefore the spatial variation of iwp was closely related to the spatial characteristics of soil properties in this study we found that the tn tp ap swc and silt had a significant positive correlation with som and the iwp was positively correlated to som tn ap swc and silt content table 4 the reason was that the increase of organic matter can effectively improve soil physical and chemical conditions and promote crop growth by increasing water capacity which will lead to an increment of crop yields so as to iwp ali and talukder 2008 in agricultural production it is impossible to improve the iwp through controlling all the soil factors which affect crop growth therefore it is necessary to find the key driving factors of the water productivity and thereby control it in this study we found that ap and no3 n were important predictors of iwp the main reasons are i the spatial heterogeneity of ap cv 57 and no3 n cv 86 were significantly greater than those of other soil factors ii soil available nutrients are the main source of nutrients absorbed by crop roots there was a significant negative correlation between iwp and no3 n and the average nitrogen applied was 600 kg ha 1 in our research area far more than the suggested nitrogen application which is 183 270 kg ha 1 in maize field castaldelli et al 2018 guo et al 2017 hu et al 2013 thus it can be seen that there was a serious waste of nitrogen fertilizer in the study area besides the ap has a positive effect on iwp pearson s correlation coefficient 0 324 and the mainly reason is appropriate increase the soil phosphorus content will increase crop yields which resulted in the increment of the iwp wu et al 2015 in summary from the perspective of farmer activity the iwp can be improved by increasing the application of phosphorus fertilizers and reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the oasis fields of arid northwest china 5 conclusion the analysis of spatial variability of soil properties and iwp is essential to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and promote the development of large scale precision agriculture in this study the som tn tp swc and silt content increase with the cultivation years of oasis irrigated farmland on the spatial scale the iwp and soil properties except for bd show a moderate spatial heterogeneity and the range of soil properties gradually increase with the sampling interval increases of the research area the key driving factors of iwp are ap and no3 n and the iwp varies from 0 55 to 3 46 kg m 3 which can provide a reference for planting management in oasis irrigated agriculture the iwp can be improved by increasing the application of phosphorus fertilizers and reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the oasis fields of arid northwest china the results provide scientific basis for improving iwp of oasis fields and have a great significance to the sustainable development of water saving agriculture in arid areas

spring followed by flowering into early summer 2 2 sapflow and light stick three gw irrigated trees were instrumented as were three tse irrigated trees details of the sapflow measurement technique are given in al yamani et al 2018 like our earlier measurements on the multi stemmed al sidr trees al yamani et al 2018 either 3 or 4 sets of probes were installed in the branches of each instrumented al samr tree as can be seen in fig 1 the measured flow in each stem was turned into a flux density using the stem cross sectional area all the branches of each tree were then measured to find the diameters of each of the stems the total water use of the tree was then calculated from the measured total cross sectional areas of all the branches and the use of the measured average sap flux

early september we have observed a similar bi modal deciduous behaviour in al sidr trees al yamani et al 2018 in addition we observed a drop in etc only for the gw irrigated trees in may fig 2 this we consider is due to leaf eating pests al samr trees are known to be a target for leaf defoliating pests such as the julodis sp of beetle and the lepidoptera baralade similes it will be unlikely that such drops in etc could be incorporated into irrigation allocations for law 5 and we report this here as just an interesting observation irrespective the measured water use values of both treatments is very low being between 2 10 l d 1 this is well less than the current practice of applying 60 l d 1 of irrigation substantial water savings are possible the water use by the gw trees over the year was 1 8 kl y 1 whereas the tse trees used 2 2 kl y 1 and increase of 25 due to the lower salinity of the tse which is a similar response to that we found for the al ghaf and al sidr trees al yamani et al 2019 from the measured water uses by the gw and tse trees etc we can compute the crop factor kc using the monitored weather data of the reference eto these results are shown in fig 4 and seasonal patterns reflect the deciduous phenology of the samr trees and the likely effect of leaf defoliation of the gw trees by pests these are very low kc values reflecting the wide spacing and low leaf area of the trees the annual average kc values for the gw trees is 0 019 and 0 021 for the tse trees table 1 3 2 predicting the crop factor the challenge for implementation of law 5 is to predict tree

the seasonal variation in etc from eto measurements made at a weather station for the halophytic xerophytes of al ghaf and al sidr al yamani et al 2019 from the kc li 1 ratio to be lower at 0 4 0 6 due to the smaller nature of the leaves relative to the woody infrastructure of the trees and also due to the level of salt and water stress of these irrigated tree species near madinat zayed we present in table 1 our measurements of the seasonal trend in li for both the gw and tse irrigated al samr trees there is a very muted seasonal pattern the woody infrastructure of the tree with its small leaves dominates the trees shadow pattern as can be seen by comparison of the two trees shown in fig 1 there is a very low light interception of just 0 17 0 18 by the samr trees with no significant difference between the treatments the ratio kc li 1 we have found for the al samr trees is very low being just 0 11 this is even lower than that we found for al ghaf and al sidr this low ratio reflects the low leaf area of the trees in relation to their woody infrastructure and is also a consequence of the xerophytic nature of this hardy desert species in a saline environment the rates of etc of both treatment trees is between 2 10 l d 1 well less than the 60 l d 1 of gw irrigation that is being used currently savings of up to 75 are possible 4 conclusions we have found through our sapflow measurements that the halophytic and xerophytic al samr trees use very little water for despite their substantial woody infrastructure they possess a low leaf area maximum rates of tree water use etc are around 10 l d 1 and there are two distinct deciduous periods where etc briefly drops below 2 4 l d 1 the total annual water use of the tse irrigated trees was 2 2 kl y 1 which

11128,reference evapotranspiration et0 plays an important role in studies on hydrological cycles and environmental change in present research the temporal changing characteristics of climatic variables as well as growing season et0 and attribution analysis of et0 trend from 1961 to 2016 were investigated at 99 meteorological stations across the western sichuan plateau sichuan basin yunnan guizhou plateau and guangxi basin in southwest china sc the results showed that the change point for et0 series was detected in 1996 by the cramer s test method growing season et0 declined significantly p 0 01 by 10 25mm decade during 1961 1996 while it increased significantly p 0 05 during 1997 2016 by 8 12 mm decade maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin exhibited a significant increasing trend during 1961 2016 while relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine duration hours sd showed a significant downward trend in sc et0 was highly sensitive to rh followed by sd tmax tmin and ws whilst the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variables fluctuated during the growing season the results of attribution analysis showed that the decline in sd as well as ws allocated the significant decrease in et0 offsetting the impact of increased temperature during 1961 1996 however decreased rh and increased air temperature commonly reversed the trend in et0 during 1997 2016 in sc the contribution rate of each climatic variable exhibited great variations both temporally and spatially due to the differences in geographical location and climatic conditions the increase in et0 will result in higher water consumption for the growth of crops especially for western sichuan plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau appeared to have experienced a more significant increase p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 the results can provide a guideline for the regional agricultural production administration and allocation of water resources in the context of ongoing climate change keywords reference evapotranspiration et0 climatic variables sensitivity coefficient contribution rate southwest china 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is a vital parameter of climatic and environmental change which is closely link to the meteorological and hydrological cycles roderick et al 2009 fan et al 2016 et0 is not only an important parameter in water balance and water conversion but also plays an important role in the energy exchange process in the earth atmospheric system gao et al 2016 feng et al 2018 a thorough understanding of spatiotemporal trends of et0 in the context of ongoing climate change is of great significance for the planning of regional agricultural production system and water resources management therefore the study of spatial and temporal changes of et0 has attracted much attention as it is the most relevant indicator of hydroclimatic changes and water cycles yin et al 2010 jhajharia et al 2012 researches have shown that the global surface air temperature has risen by 0 85 c on average during 1880 2012 stocker et al 2014 and is expected to rise by more than 1 5 c within one hundred years pachauri et al 2014 one of the projected consequences is that the rising temperature should have increased evaporation requirement however both observed pan evaporation and et0 were found to have decreasing trends in many regions around the world golubev et al 2001 moonen et al 2002 burn and hesch 2007 zhang et al 2007 fan and thomas 2013 which is known as the evaporation paradox peterson et al 1995 jhajharia et al 2012 roderick et al 2009 li et al 2012 wang et al 2017 some researchers revealed the decline in sunshine duration resulting from the increasing cloud cover global dimming was the dominant cause for the decrease in et0 in the wet regions of china south eastern norway and america over the past 50 years because it reduced the energy required for et0 peterson et al 1995 stanhill and cohen 2001 grimenes and thue hansen 2006 jhajharia et al 2012 qian et al 2015 meanwhile other researchers indicted the factor of decreasing wind speed was the foremost climatic variable for the declining et0 in canada burn and hesch 2007 iran dinpashoh et al 2011 and arid and semi arid regions of china liu and zhang 2013 wang et al 2017 which was termed wind stilling mcvicar et al 2012 furthermore humidity and air temperature were also considered to be the main causes for et0 variation in india and some regions of china qian et al 2007 cong et al 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2009 zuo et al 2012 however they indicated that the variations of et0 may not be caused by a single factor but rather to an integrated effect of many climatic variables the explanations given by different researchers seem dissimilar with each other due to the differences in the study areas conducted or different approaches adopted hupet and vanclooster 2001 lenhart et al 2002 estevez et al 2009 fan et al 2016 thus it is important to carry out a regional research for local water resources planning and management although the whole change trend of et0 is decreasing in the recent decades from the global perspective the increasing et0 was reported in some areas since 1980s 1990s papaioannou et al 2011 investigated the trend of annual et0 from 1950 to 2001 in greece and discovered it had a declined trend before the early 1980s conversely it has begun to increase until 2001 wang et al 2017 found that a change appeared in 1982 for the annual et0 series in china and wind speed was thought to be the primary influential climatic variables related to the enhanced et0 however zuo et al 2012 found that a change point appeared in 1993 for the temporal variability of annual et0 series in the wei river basin of china and the same phenomenon was also found in northwest china liu and zhang 2013 the variation of et0 is highly diverse across different regions of china in the content of climate change it is thus necessary to study the latest change in regional et0 and its driving mechanism mcvicar et al 2012 knowledge of the changing characteristics of et0 especially the spatial and temporal evolution is the initial step in calculating regional crop evapotranspiration and for irrigation water planning probing the effects of climatic variables on et0 variation in the growing season would assist in predicting the variation of et0 and providing basic scientific references for agricultural activities water resources planning and management the increasing et0 was detected in many regions of the world in recent years papaioannou et al 2011 liu and zhang 2013 li et al 2016 however few researchers explore the primary driving factors affecting the growing season et0 as well as crop water demand evolutions in southwest china which formed the motivation of this research the objectives of current research were 1 to detect the change of et0 series with the cramer s test method and map the spatial distributions of et0 and key climatic variables during the growing season april to september in the southwest china before and after the change point using the inverse distance weight interpolation method 2 to analyze the trends of et0 and key climatic variables in the growing season adopting the non parametric mann kendall test method 3 to quantify the sensitivity of et0 to various climatic variables using the partial derivative sensitivity coefficients method and further explore their distributions and temporal trends 4 to determine the key climatic variables and their differences in affecting et0 in the growing season with the comparative relative contribution method 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area and data processing the study was carried out in southwest

ii sichuan basin sb with altitudes of 300 700 m a s l iii yunnan guizhou plateau ygp with an elevation range of 1800 1900 m a s l and iv guangxi basin gb with altitudes of 80 200 m a s l fig 1 the elevation of these areas gradually decreases from west to east and from north to south the mean growing season precipitation of the wsp the sb the ygp and the gb are 708 mm 920 mm 876 mm and 1209 mm respectively the main data employed in current research were daily meteorological data during 1961 2016 involving minimum air temperature tmin c maximum air temperature tmax c mean relative humidity rh wind speed at 2 m height ws m s converted from wind speed at 10 m height by using the conversion formula as recommended by allen et al allan et al 1998 sunshine duration hours sd h d the meteorological data were collected from 141 national stations and supplied by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn the used time series daily meteorological data were long and continuous the stations with miss daily data less than 1 were selected and filled with data from the nearby stations by the linear regressive method the homogeneity and stationarity of climatic variables series were examined according to the test method developed by haktanir and citakoglu 2014 finally 99 stations were selected in this study geographic information including the longitude and elevation of selected stations were obtained as well and shown in fig 1 2 2 calculation of reference evapotranspiration in current study the penman monteith p m method was adopted to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration it is physically based with both the energy balance and aerodynamics and was recommended as the sole standard method for et0 estimation by fao in 1998 allan et al 1998 the formula and has been widely used owing to its consistency reliability and accuracy yin et al 2010 li et al 2017 feng et al 2017a the formula is given as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 δ is the curve slope of the saturation vapor pressure kpa 1 rn is the net radiation on the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the surface soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 1 tmean is the mean temperature at 2 m height u2 is the wind speed at the height of 2 m m s 1 es is the saturation pressure kpa and ea is actual water vapor pressure kpa the detailed calculation can be found in allan et al 1998 2 3 trend analysis and mutation test the rank based nonparametric mann kendall mk test shadmani et al 2012 was utilized to analyze the temporal variation of et0 and related climatic variables its superiority exists in the ability of detecting the significance of the long time series trend no matter the sample series follow a certain type of distribution ye et al 2014 the mk method has been widely used for the significant test of hydrological and meteorological data fan et al 2016 liu et al 2016 for mutation test the cramer s test method was adopted to verify the stability of a sample sequence by comparing the difference between the average of the whole sample sequence and partial sample sequence türkeş 1996 zhang et al 2013 the cramer s test is based on the statistic t k 2 t k n n 2 n n 1 τ k 2 τ k 3 τ k x k x s x k 1 n i k 1 k n x i x 1 n i 1 n x i where x x k represent the average of the whole sample sequence and the average of partial sample sequence respectively and s is the overall sample standard deviation n is the length of the overall sample sequence and n is the length of the selected partial sample sequence the null hypothesis that there is no mutation is rejected if tk t0 2 4 linear trend a series y 1 y 2 y i y n can be represented by the polynomial tang et al 2011 feng et al 2017b 4 y a 0 a 1 t a m t n m n where y is response variable i e et0 or climatic variables t is the year the linear trend of a time series can be evaluated by the least square method and can be expressed as a linear regression equation 5 y n t t r e n d v i t a 0 where the slope trendvi is the evaluated trend of the variable vi and trendvi 10 is called tendency rate indicating the variation range of variable vi per decade negative value of trendvi indicates a decreasing trend conversely positive value of trendvi indicates an increasing trend 2 5 sensitivity and contribution rate analysis different variables have different dimensions and ranges of values making it difficult to contrast the sensitivity via partial derivatives for multi variable models fan et al 2016 therefore the partial derivative is converted into a dimensionless form to facilitate comparison of different climate factors gong et al 2006 following the p m formula et0 is the function of five climatic variables ws tmax tmin rh sd which can be expressed as 6 e t 0 f w s t max t min r h s d the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variables can be expressed as follows 7 s v i lim δ v i 0 δ e t 0 e t 0 δ v i v i e t 0 v i v i e t 0 where vi is the climate variable which represents ws tmax tmin rh or sd in this study respectively svi represents the sensitivity coefficient of et0 to variable v i denoting the percentage change in et0 transmitted from the percentage change in vi if svi 0 et0 and v i will increase or decrease simultaneously otherwise they have a reverse relation the larger the svi the greater the effect of a given variable has on et0 variation the sensitivity coefficient method is more convenient and accurate compared to other sensitivity analysis approaches gao et al 2016 thus it has been widely used in evapotranspiration study tang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2014a wang et al 2017 in this research sensitivity coefficients were computed on a daily basis for tmin tmax ws rh sd monthly and growing season averaged sensitivity coefficients were obtained by averaging the corresponding daily sensitivity coefficients in current study the sensitivity coefficient was divided into four levels for assessing sensitivity more clearly li et al 2017 as shown in table 1 by multiplying the sensitivity coefficient of a single climatic variable by its relative change we can get the change in et0 caused by the climatic variable namely the contribution rate of the climatic variable to et0 variation 8 c o n v i s v i r c v i 9 r c v i n t r e n d v i a v i 100 where convi is the contribution rate of vi to et0 variation svi represents the sensitivity coefficient of et0 to variable vi rcvi is the relative change of vi n is the length of observations avi is the absolute value of the multi year averaged vi and trendvi is the estimated trend of the variable vi if the convi is positive negative the variation of the variable will increase decrease et0 denoting the variable had a positive negative contribution to et0 variation 2 6 spatial interpolation method inverse distance weighting idw method gave the lower mean error than other common interpolation methods spline ordinary kriging tang et al 2013 feng et al 2017b thus idw from arcgis 10 2 was applied to describe the spatial variability of et0 and other variables in the present research 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution and changes in reference evapotranspiration et0 the temporal variation of averaged growing season et0 over the 99 meteorological stations in sc during the whole study period was plotted in fig 2 a change point for et0 series was discovered around the year of 1996 by the cramer s test growing season et0 demonstrated a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 from 1961 to 1996 by 10 25 mm decade while turned into a significant increasing trend p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 by 8 12 mm decade fig 3 illustrates the trends in growing season et0 for the 99 meteorological stations in sc before and after the change point 1961 1996 1997 2016 and the whole study period 1961 2016 growing season et0 decreased at 90 out of 99 stations from 1961 to 1996 and et0 exhibited a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at 44 stations out of the 90 stations which are mainly distributed in gb sb and east of ygp however growing season et0 exhibited an increasing trend at 71 out of 99 stations from 1997 to 2016 and 27 stations in wsp and southwest ygp showed a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 in general growing season et0 exhibited a decreasing trend at 80 out of 99 stations from 1961 to 2016 and et0 showed a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at 34 stations out of the 80 stations and the stations were mainly concentrated in gb sb and east of ygp while the stations whose et0 having significant increasing trends were mainly located on the western edge of the ygp the distribution of growing season et0 showed an obvious spatial gradient fig 3 the et0 values increased from west to east whilst from north to south and the mean growing season et0 of 99 meteorological stations was 665 6 mm with the variation rang of 420 4 mm to 897 2 mm during the period 1961 2016 regionally the mean values between 500 and 750 mm occurred in the east of ygp and sb while the southwest ygp and gb regions have the variation ranging between 750 and 900 mm with the highest values appeared in beihai station near the ocean and a lowest mean growing season et0 in wsp 3 2 spatially distribution and changes in climatic variables spatially averaged tmax tmin showed a general increase trend while rh sd ws showed a significant downward trend in the study area over the past 56 years fig 4 trend analysis indicated that tmin tmax in sc have increased significantly p 0 01 by 0 14 c 0 2 c decade respectively in contrast sd ws and rh decreased significantly by 0 11 h 0 01 m s 0 6 decade from 1961 to 2016 respectively table 2 tmax and tmin have also obviously increased with multiple trends the growth rates of tmax 0 2 c decade and tmin 0 3 c decade were largest in the wsp while the rates of tmax 0 11 c decade in gb and tmin 0 15 c decade in sb were smallest sd ws and rh have been decreasing across different regions sd had a significant decrease trend p 0 01 in all regions with the highest rate 0 15 h decade in sb and gb and the lowest 0 08 h decade in wsp ws in ygp and sb and rh in sb showed an insignificantly decreased trend p 0 05 by 0 01 m s decade and 0 76 decade respectively while decreased significantly in the other regions the variations of each climatic variable before and after the change point was shown in fig 4 and table 2 tmin increased by 0 09 c decade while tmax decreased by 0 06 c decade from 1961 to 1996 respectively however tmin increased significantly p 0 05 by 0 37 c decade while tmax increased by 0 39 c decade from 1997 to 2016 in sc the similar changes of tmax and tmin were also detected in four sub regions sd had a significantly decreased p 0 05 trend in most of the stations with the rate of 0 19 h decade from1961 to 1996 in sc while an insignificant increasing trend after 1996 mainly occurred in wsp and ygp rh showed a downward trend in sc then decreased significantly after 1996 with a rate of 1 57 decade table 2 ws decreased significantly p 0 001 with the rate of 0 04 m s decade in sb and gb from 1961 to 1996 while increased by 0 01 m s decade and 0 05 m s decade in ygp and wsp however ws increased significantly p 0 05 in sc except for gb after 1996 3 3 the variations of sensitivity coefficients characteristics during the growing season in order to quantify the sensitivity of et0 to climate variables the average sensitivity coefficients for tmin s tmin tmax s tmax rh s rh sd s sd and ws s ws in sc and its four sub regions were calculated and the results were shown in fig 5 and table 3 the notation of the sensitivity coefficients shows that et0 is positively correlated to the vary of tmax tmin sd and ws while negatively correlated to the vary of rh in addition it can be seen from fig 5 and table 3 that et0 was most sensitive to rh in sc from 1961 to 2016 with the average sensitivity coefficient value 0 496 followed by sd 0 284 tmax 0 208 tmin 0 080 and ws 0 052 however the most sensitive climatic variable was rh followed by sd tmax ws and tmin in wsp and sb while by sd tmax tmin and ws in gb from 1961 to 2016 s tmin ranged from 0 008 to 0 17 throughout the study area with medium levels in gb and sb but negligible levels in ygp and wsp s tmin had an obvious increasing trend during the period 1961 2016 at most stations with high altitudes while it increased weakly or decreased at most stations with low altitudes of sc s tmax varied from 0 06 to 0 41 with a medium level in most regions except for wsp s tmax had an increasing trend before 1996 and a more obvious increasing trend from 1997 to 2016 s rh in most regions had a high level and the lager values were distributed mainly in gb and east of ygb strong negative sensitivity shows an increase in rh would greatly reduce et0 the changed trend in s rh had a lager difference in spatial distribution s rh displayed an increasing trend in gb and decreasing trends in other regions from 1961 to 1996 however s rh was decreasing after 1997 throughout the study area s sd ranged from 0 17 to 0 39 and had a medium level in sc except for sb and east of ygp s sd in sc showed an obvious decreasing trend in most regions during the period 1961 1996 continued to decrease until 2016 s ws ranged from 0 02 to 0 17 and had a medium level in wsp while the levels in other regions could be negligible s ws showed significantly increasing trends from 1961 to 2016 indicating that et0 was more sensitive to the change of ws the average monthly sensitivity coefficient on the tmax tmin sd ws and rh during the growing season in sc and its four sub regions wsp sb ygp and gb were shown in fig 6 the sensitivity coefficients for climate variables are unstable during the growing season s tmin s sd had a peak and reached maximum in july and august demonstrating that et0 was most sensitive to the changes in tmin and sd in july and august in the contrast s ws and s rh were the largest at the beginning of the growing season reached its minimum in july and august and rebounded at the end the growing season indicating that et0 was least sensitive to the changes in ws and rh in july and august the trends of s tmax in sc and its four sub regions existed a large difference fig 6 showed that et0 was sensitive to tmax at the early growing season in sc and its four sub regions with the coefficient value around 0 23 however s tmax decreased in most regions except gb in april and may the characteristics of s tmax in ygp and wsp were steady with the sensitivity coefficient around 0 17 while a larger increase from july to september occurred in sb the sensitivity of et0 to the same climate variable varied in four sub regions probably due to different climate as well as substrate layer characteristics in each region 3 4 contribution from climatic variables during the growing season in order to identify the main climatic variables to et0 variation in sc and its four sub regions the relative contribution method was adopted to quantify the contribution of climatic variables to et0 change and the results were shown in table 4 sd was an important climatic variable effecting growing season et0 trends causing reduced et0 by 3 96 thereby becoming the largest contributor to the decreasing growing season et0 from 1961 to 1996 in addition decreasing ws and tmax also played negative effects on growing season et0 in sc with the contribution rate 0 14 and 0 15 from 1961 to 1996 respectively decreasing rh was the mainly contributor to increased et0 after 1996 which caused et0 to change by 1 99 from 1997 to 2016 in addition increasing tmax tmin and ws also played an important effect on increased et0 and the contribution rate was 0 63 0 34 and 0 74 respectively in sc from 1997 to 2016 the same patterns were also found in its sub regions however the same climate variable may have different contribution rates to the change of et0 in four sub regions because of the different sensitivities and change in climate variable in terms of spatial distribution the average monthly contribution rates for climatic variables during the growing season in sc and its four sub regions wsp sb ygp and gb are shown in fig 7 and table 4 results showed that the increase of tmax tmin and the decrease of rh had positive contributions to et0 during the growing season while the decrease of ws and sd had negative contributions to et0 the contribution rate of tmax was higher in wsp but the s tmax in wsp was lower indicating that tmax had a lager increase in wsp and had a peak in june indicating that the tmax in june increased greatly the similar variation characteristics were also found in the contribution rates of tmin the contribution rates of tmin and ws was higher in april while the lower value appeared in august and the opposite characteristics appeared in the contribution rate of sd revealed that the variation of tmin and ws was small while sd varies greatly at the end of the growing season the contribution rate of rh reached its minimum in june in most regions and rebounded at the end the growing season the lowest value was close to 0 in wsp at the beginning of the growing season indicating that rh in wsp had small variation in april results in fig 7 clearly showed that rh was the main climatic variable causing et0 variation at the beginning of the growing season in sc followed by sd ws tmax tmin at the middle and late stages of growing season the biggest contributor to et0 was sd with the highest value 6 95 in july as shown in table 3 that et0 was most sensitive to rh but a significant reduction in sd caused a great decline of et0 thus the contribution rate of sd was most important to the changes of et0 4 discussion 4 1 patterns of reference evapotranspiration and climatic variables understanding the spatial and temporal evolutions of et0 in growing season is the initial step in calculating regional crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water planning probing the effects of climatic variables on et0 variation will assist in predicting the variation of et0 in the context of climate change tong et al 2007 feng et al 2017c however because of the diversity of the regional geography and the climatic conditions it was necessary to carry out a regional research to provide a reference framework for providing basic scientific evidence for agricultural activities water resources planning and management a change point for et0 series was discovered in 1996 by the cramer s test in this study growing season et0 had demonstrated a significant decreased trend during 1961 1996 while turned into a significantly increased trend from 1997 to 2016 li et al 2014b also indicated that annual et0 had a decreased trend during 1960 2000 and an increased trend during 2000 2009 in southwestern china sc which was well coincident with the results obtained in this research liu et al 2018 detected a turning point of annual pet series in sc and annual pet had a downward trend at 10 04 mm dacade during 1961 2000 but increased at 50 65 mm decade thereafter such abrupt changes of et0 have been widely reported in many regions of the world li et al 2016 found annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 05 in the loess plateau by 12 22 mm decade from 1960 to 1990 while it increased significantly p 0 001 by 11 5 mm decade from 1991 to 2013 papaioannou et al 2011 discovered that the trend of annual et0 in greece had a declined trend before the early 1980s conversely it has begun to increase until 2001 zhang et al 2007 found the annual et0 decreased at 10 5 mm dacede in tibetan plateau from 1966 to 2003 however the increasing et0 was not detected because of the shorter research period only to 2003 in addition liu and zhang 2013 detected an increased et0 after 1993 in northwest china liu et al 2011 investigated the pan evaporation in china and found it decreased from 1960 to 1991 while increased after 1992 the variation of et0 in this paper are generally consistent with the previous reports however the change point and variation range of et0 series may exist difference due to the different study areas and study period the decreasing sd was found at most stations of sc which is consistent with many previous researches in china zhang et al 2007 qian et al 2007 li et al 2015 wang et al 2017 however the reasons for sd change remains subject to debate cong et al 2009 thought that the increase in cloud cover may be the main reason causing sd reduction however the assumption that the increase in cloud cover causing sd reduction at sc seems to be unreasonable as declining precipitation had been widely reported in many regions of the world ruelland et al 2008 feng et al 2017b recent studies showed that aggregated aerosols from anthropogenic emissions of pollutants were main dimming factor qian et al 2007 zhao et al 2014 streets et al 2008 and feng et al 2017b found that there was significant decline in sd in southwest china the same conclusion was also obtained in this research in addition as can be seen stations with significant decrease in sd are mainly distributed at low altitudes of the study area where the population density is higher and human activity is concentrated industry in these areas is well developed pollution is more serious in such areas than in low population density areas such as ygp hence the decrease of sd is more visible at the low altitudes than the high altitudes deducing that the increase in aerosols resulting from human activities may be an important reason for the decrease in solar radiation grimenes and thue hansen 2006 qian et al 2007 zhao et al 2014 investigated climatic variables in two elevation groups plains and mountains in hai river basin and found the decreasing trend of solar radiation was more significant in the densely populated areas plains than in the sparsely populated ones mountains aerosol index increased more and more significantly from the low population density areas in northern china such as yanshan and taihang mountainous areas to the high population density areas the spatial distribution of the aerosol index increase is consistent with the solar radiation decrease wang et al 2017 indicated that the high rise buildings in urban area can be obstacles to the flow of wind making the atmospheric aerosol difficult to diffuse thereby aggravating the decrease of sd it can be concluded that human activities do have an important impact on the changes of solar radiation or sd from the above studies ws which has a larger fluctuation in sc and its four sub regions is also the main climatic factor affecting the change of et0 the variations of ws in sc and its four sub regions from 1961 to 2016 were shown in fig 8 ws showed a statically significant decrease in 1960s while increased rapidly in late 1960s then decreased significantly until 2000 and gradually increased in recent years the same change trend of ws was also founded by li et al 2014b and fu et al 2010 and the decline in ws was not significant throughout the whole study period generally a weakened atmospheric circulation is thought to be the reason for ws decline zhang et al 2009 the temperature difference between the polar and tropical areas associated with global warming has been declining weakening the strength of atmospheric circulation weak atmospheric circulation has been proved in east asian and south asian xu et al 2006 mcvicar et al 2012 additionally recent studies showed that the increasing surface roughness result from human activities such as plantation and urbanization nearby the weather stations may also play an important role in the decreasing ws shi et al 2017 however the ws in some meteorological stations have exhibited significant increasing trends since 2000 while the vegetation cover continued to increase liu and zhang 2013 liu et al 2008 changes in surface roughness may not fully explain the changes in ws therefore the driving factors of changes in ws need to be fully understood in sc air temperature showed significant increasing trends at most stations in the study area consistent with global warming from previous researches li et al 2014a najafi et al 2015 feng et al 2017b however diurnal temperature range had the downward trend because the increase in tmin was more obviously than the tmax which may be due to that aerosols and greenhouse gases absorb solar radiation during daytime and release energy in the form of long wave radiation into the atmosphere at night liu et al 2010 increasing aerosols and anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions najafi et al 2015 and urbanization ji and zhou 2011 are widely considered to be the primary reasons for temperature increase however the increasing trends of tmax and tmin with the rate of 0 14 and 0 20 c decade respectively in this study were generally lower than those reported in other parts of the world ipcc 2007 this may be related to higher vegetation and forest coverage in sc the decline of rh mainly resulting from the decreasing trend in precipitation in southwest china yan et al 2013 feng et al 2014 will have a vital impact on the variation of evapotranspiration the decrease of relative humidity is more significant in most sites of the high altitude areas which was also discovered by zhao et al 2014 the decline of rh will reduce atmospheric vapor pressure and accelerate the release of water vapor from plant stoma the spatial distribution characteristics of climatic variables were similar to previous studies of sc and parts of this region gong et al 2006 li et al 2014b liu et al 2017 feng et al 2017b while temporal trend may exist difference because of the different study period it is interesting to note that the spatial distribution of climatic variables shows the border line at appa at 105 e yin et al 2010 feng et al 2017b which appears to point to the influence of different monsoon especially during the growing season the water stream originating from south china sea transported by southeast monsoon and from bay of bengal transported by southwest monsoon forming a wet center at the east of 105 e of study area because of the obstruction of the mountains fan and thomas 2013 liu et al 2018 besides the gather water vapor in this region can markedly weaken solar radiation therefore sd is far lower than that of the west of 105 e of study area 4 2 sensitivity and contribution rate of et0 to the variation of climatic variables the sensitivity coefficients of climatic variables calculated in this paper are close to the previous studies in china or other regions zuo et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 li et al 2017 researches had found rh was the most sensitive variable in the wei river basin and also the most sensitive factor in the yellow river basin wang et al 2007 zuo et al 2012 and hai river basin zhao et al 2014 gong et al 2006 found that relative humidity was the most sensitive variable to et0 change in yangtze river basin followed by shortwave radiation air temperature and wind speed was the least sensitive variable liu et al 2018 indicated that the spatial distribution of annual et0 is mainly affected by air temperature sunshine hours and relativity humidity over southwest china while sd was the most sensitive climatic variable in poyang lake catchment ye et al 2014 and ws had the highest sensitivity in northwest china li et al 2014a the differences existed may be due to differences in the study areas and calculation methods the contribution rate of climate variable was determined not only by the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variable but also by the magnitude of the climatic variables trends although rh was the most sensitive climatic variable for et0 it contributed little to et0 change due to its much smaller change magnitude during the period 1961 1996 in the present study the sensitivity coefficient of sd was not the highest but sd contributed the most to et0 change among the variables due to its rather large variation during the period 1961 1996 the magnitude of the rh trend was large from 1997 to 2016 thus causing the contribution rate of rh to et0 was much greater among the variables during the period 1997 2016 zhao et al 2014 also found that the sensitivity order of climatic variables to et0 from strong to weak was relativity humidity temperature shortwave radiation and wind speed in hai river basin respectively however and the decreasing et0 was caused mainly by the decreasing wind speed and shortwave radiation liu and zhang 2013 found the decreases in vapor pressure deficit wind speed and solar radiation had more effects on the changes of et0 than increasing air temperature before 1993 in northwest china and zhang et al 2015 investigate the temporal trends of et0 in the yellow river basin from 1961 to 2012 the results showed that the change of sunshine hours was the major factors influencing the variability of et0 followed by wind speed li et al 2014b found that the decreased relative humidity would cause a corresponding decline of saturated vapor pressure which must lead to the rise of et0 during the period of 1991 2009 in southwestern china which was well coincident with the results obtained in this research while li et al 2016 found annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 05 in the loess plateau from 1960 to 1990 and wind speed was mostly responsible for the variability in the et0 trend from 1960 to 1990 followed by solar radiation and vapor pressure while it increased significantly p 0 001 from 1991 to 2013 because of the rapidly increasing air temperature the variation of et0 in this paper are generally consistent with the previous reports li et al 2014b li et al 2016 however the dominant fctors on et0 variation may exist difference due to the different study areas and methods adopted increasing temperature including tmin tmax should have led to the increase of et0 before 1996 but et0 had a decreased trend in this period so evaporation paradox also existed in sc significant decrease in sd and ws offsets the impact of increasing temperature and decreasing rh dominating the change in et0 in sc yin et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 feng et al 2017b finally resulted in evaporation paradox in sc before 1996 the uncertainties in the estimation of the contribution of climate variable to et0 variation existed in present research as the variables change rates and sensitivity coefficients were not the same but fluctuated therefore the average values were used to estimate the contribution to et0 variation might be less accurate liu and zhang 2013 fan et al 2016 4 3 implications of et0 changes on agricultural water management in order to analyze the crop water demand variations for crops in growing season and provide general profiles of crop water demand in each subregion of sc actual crop water demand during the growing season is estimated by multiplying daily et0 by a modified crop coefficient kc allan et al 1998 kang et al 2003 thomas 2008 crop coefficients during different growth stage of different crops are modified according to allan et al 1998 and listed in table 5 the application of multiple cropping systems is benefit for characterizing the evolution features of crop water demand however multiple cropping systems are adopted in this region we mainly selected two representative cropping systems in each subregion except for wsp for analyzing as a simplification seeing that the same subregion has similar crop planting types and intercropping has not been accounted for the results are shown in table 6 both early rice late rice and corn late rice cropping systems in gb are two large water consumers while highland barley in wsp consumed less water with the multi year averaged value of 479 mm which is due to low et0 values and single cropping system it is interesting to note that actual crop water demand during the growing season were detected to have increased trends in each regions of sc after 1996 especially for wsp and ygp appeared to have experienced a more significant increase p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 though crop water demand generally appears as decreasing trends from 1961 to 2016 meanwhile studies have showed that the precipitation in sc had a declining trend in recent years xu et al 2006 mcvicar et al 2012 because of the impact of west pacific subtropical high as well as south asia high yan et al 2013 liu et al 2017 indicating crops is more likely to be threatened by drought especially for rainfed agriculture areas in sc a warm and dry environment may slow the restoration of vegetation causing ecological problems such as grassland degradation and soil erosion this will have a negative impact on the economic and ecological environment of the wsp area dominated by animal husbandry the ygp with a thin soil layer weathered by rocks leading to lower soil moisture storage and thus aggravated water shortage jiang et al 2018 however it is difficult to construct a large water conservancy project because of the poor geology and limited available technology therefore more drought resistant species and irrigation facilities are required to maintain the crop production in ygp though the increased trend of crop water demand in sb is not significant as ygp and wsp the increasing crop water demand will significantly affect regional agricultural water management sb is not only one of the most developed agriculture regions but also a densely populated area in china the consumption of industrial water and domestic water has been increasing rapidly with the rapid growth of the economy and urban population in recent decades qian et al 2007 which will occupy more available water resources the main crops may suffer serious water shortage threat in sb because of the extraordinary industrialization and urbanization in this area the development of water saving irrigation to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources is an important way to deal with the agricultural water shortage mushtaq et al 2006 the measures of water saving irrigation in sb need to be considered through the aspects of engineering drip irrigation micro irrigation etc agronomy regulated deficit irrigation water saving varieties etc management water price government police etc and so on under the trend of agricultural water shortages ørum et al 2010 nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 li et al 2016 pérez sarmiento et al 2016 therefore the administration of sc is expected to focus on the sustainable regional water resources management according to local differences under the condition of ongoing climate change 5 conclusion based on daily data from 99 meteorological stations in sc during 1961 2016 growing season et0 as well as the spatiotemporal trends and the contribution of climate variable to et0 variation were analyzed a change point for growing season et0 series was discovered in 1996 by the cramer s test growing season et0 had demonstrated a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 from 1961 to 1996 by 10 25 mm decade while turned into a significantly increased trend p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 by 8 12 mm decade in terms of spatial distribution growing season et0 had an increasing trend from west to east whilst from north to south in sc for climatic variables tmin tmax and rh were higher in sb gb and east of ygp while sd and ws had a converse trend meanwhile tmax ws and rh had a weakly decreased trend and sd decreased significantly in sc before 1996 while increased trends appeared in tmax ws and sd after 1996 tmin had increased trends during the whole study period in sc due to different geographical location and topographical features the trends of climatic variables in four sub regions differed the sensitivity of et0 to rh was negative while its sensitivity to the other five climatic variables was positive rh was the most sensitive climatic variable for et0 followed by sd tmax tmin and ws in sc the monthly sensitivity coefficients of climatic variables varied during the growing season and the sensitivity coefficients for climatic variables showed great differences in spatial distribution meanwhile the sensitivity coefficient of et0 for the climatic variables was mutative with the climate change the monthly contribution of each variable to et0 determined by the sensitivity coefficient of climatic variable and the magnitude of its changing trend were temporally unstable and varied considerably over the growing season the proportional contributions of tmax tmin ws rh sd to the trend in et0 were 0 15 0 15 0 14 0 03 3 96 during the period 1961 1996 respectively therefore sd was the main contributor to the change of growing season et0 in sc from 1961 to 1996 the proportional contributions of tmax tmin ws rh sd to the increased et0 were 0 63 0 34 0 74 1 99 0 49 during the period 1997 2016 respectively inferring that rh was the dominant variable for the increase in et0 in sc the increase in et0 will result in higher water consumption for the growth of crops especially for wsp and ygp appeared to have experienced a more significant increase p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 which indicating crops is more likely to be threatened by drought especially for rainfed agriculture areas in sc acknowledgments we would like to thank the china meteorological administration for providing the data used in

11128,reference evapotranspiration et0 plays an important role in studies on hydrological cycles and environmental change in present research the temporal changing characteristics of climatic variables as well as growing season et0 and attribution analysis of et0 trend from 1961 to 2016 were investigated at 99 meteorological stations across the western sichuan plateau sichuan basin yunnan guizhou plateau and guangxi basin in southwest china sc the results showed that the change point for et0 series was detected in 1996 by the cramer s test method growing season et0 declined significantly p 0 01 by 10 25mm decade during 1961 1996 while it increased significantly p 0 05 during 1997 2016 by 8 12 mm decade maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin exhibited a significant increasing trend during 1961 2016 while relative humidity rh wind speed ws and sunshine duration hours sd showed a significant downward trend in sc et0 was highly sensitive to rh followed by sd tmax tmin and ws whilst the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variables fluctuated during the growing season the results of attribution analysis showed that the decline in sd as well as ws allocated the significant decrease in et0 offsetting the impact of increased temperature during 1961 1996 however decreased rh and increased air temperature commonly reversed the trend in et0 during 1997 2016 in sc the contribution rate of each climatic variable exhibited great variations both temporally and spatially due to the differences in geographical location and climatic conditions the increase in et0 will result in higher water consumption for the growth of crops especially for western sichuan plateau and yunnan guizhou plateau appeared to have experienced a more significant increase p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 the results can provide a guideline for the regional agricultural production administration and allocation of water resources in the context of ongoing climate change keywords reference evapotranspiration et0 climatic variables sensitivity coefficient contribution rate southwest china 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is a vital parameter of climatic and environmental change which is closely link to the meteorological and hydrological cycles roderick et al 2009 fan et al 2016 et0 is not only an important parameter in water balance and water conversion but also plays an important role in the energy exchange process in the earth atmospheric system gao et al 2016 feng et al 2018 a thorough understanding of spatiotemporal trends of et0 in the context of ongoing climate change is of great significance for the planning of regional agricultural production system and water resources management therefore the study of spatial and temporal changes of et0 has attracted much attention as it is the most relevant indicator of hydroclimatic changes and water cycles yin et al 2010 jhajharia et al 2012 researches have shown that the global surface air temperature has risen by 0 85 c on average during 1880 2012 stocker et al 2014 and is expected to rise by more than 1 5 c within one hundred years pachauri et al 2014 one of the projected consequences is that the rising temperature should have increased evaporation requirement however both observed pan evaporation and et0 were found to have decreasing trends in many regions around the world golubev et al 2001 moonen et al 2002 burn and hesch 2007 zhang et al 2007 fan and thomas 2013 which is known as the evaporation paradox peterson et al 1995 jhajharia et al 2012 roderick et al 2009 li et al 2012 wang et al 2017 some researchers revealed the decline in sunshine duration resulting from the increasing cloud cover global dimming was the dominant cause for the decrease in et0 in the wet regions of china south eastern norway and america over the past 50 years because it reduced the energy required for et0 peterson et al 1995 stanhill and cohen 2001 grimenes and thue hansen 2006 jhajharia et al 2012 qian et al 2015 meanwhile other researchers indicted the factor of decreasing wind speed was the foremost climatic variable for the declining et0 in canada burn and hesch 2007 iran dinpashoh et al 2011 and arid and semi arid regions of china liu and zhang 2013 wang et al 2017 which was termed wind stilling mcvicar et al 2012 furthermore humidity and air temperature were also considered to be the main causes for et0 variation in india and some regions of china qian et al 2007 cong et al 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2009 zuo et al 2012 however they indicated that the variations of et0 may not be caused by a single factor but rather to an integrated effect of many climatic variables the explanations given by different researchers seem dissimilar with each other due to the differences in the study areas conducted or different approaches adopted hupet and vanclooster 2001 lenhart et al 2002 estevez et al 2009 fan et al 2016 thus it is important to carry out a regional research for local water resources planning and management although the whole change trend of et0 is decreasing in the recent decades from the global perspective the increasing et0 was reported in some areas since 1980s 1990s papaioannou et al 2011 investigated the trend of annual et0 from 1950 to 2001 in greece and discovered it had a declined trend before the early 1980s conversely it has begun to increase until 2001 wang et al 2017 found that a change appeared in 1982 for the annual et0 series in china and wind speed was thought to be the primary influential climatic variables related to the enhanced et0 however zuo et al 2012 found that a change point appeared in 1993 for the temporal variability of annual et0 series in the wei river basin of china and the same phenomenon was also found in northwest china liu and zhang 2013 the variation of et0 is highly diverse across different regions of china in the content of climate change it is thus necessary to study the latest change in regional et0 and its driving mechanism mcvicar et al 2012 knowledge of the changing characteristics of et0 especially the spatial and temporal evolution is the initial step in calculating regional crop evapotranspiration and for irrigation water planning probing the effects of climatic variables on et0 variation in the growing season would assist in predicting the variation of et0 and providing basic scientific references for agricultural activities water resources planning and management the increasing et0 was detected in many regions of the world in recent years papaioannou et al 2011 liu and zhang 2013 li et al 2016 however few researchers explore the primary driving factors affecting the growing season et0 as well as crop water demand evolutions in southwest china which formed the motivation of this research the objectives of current research were 1 to detect the change of et0 series with the cramer s test method and map the spatial distributions of et0 and key climatic variables during the growing season april to september in the southwest china before and after the change point using the inverse distance weight interpolation method 2 to analyze the trends of et0 and key climatic variables in the growing season adopting the non parametric mann kendall test method 3 to quantify the sensitivity of et0 to various climatic variables using the partial derivative sensitivity coefficients method and further explore their distributions and temporal trends 4 to determine the key climatic variables and their differences in affecting et0 in the growing season with the comparative relative contribution method 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area and data processing the study was carried out in southwest china sc located within 20 54 34 19 n and 91 21 e 112 04 e and with an area of 1 4 million km2 sc experiences a typical monsoonal climate controlled by the south asia monsoon as well as affected by the east asia monsoon gao et al 2014 with obvious moisture transfer characteristics of dry and wet season changes less water vapor is brought by westerly winds in winter and spring because of the obstruction of tibetan plateau while the monsoonal moisture originates from the bay of bengal and the south china sea in summer and from the western pacific ocean in autumn feng et al 2014 gao et al 2014 in current study sc was divided into four subregions based on the terrain features and geographic locations i e i western sichuan plateau wsp with altitudes of 4000 4500 m above sea level m a s l ii sichuan basin sb with altitudes of 300 700 m a s l iii yunnan guizhou plateau ygp with an elevation range of 1800 1900 m a s l and iv guangxi basin gb with altitudes of 80 200 m a s l fig 1 the elevation of these areas gradually decreases from west to east and from north to south the mean growing season precipitation of the wsp the sb the ygp and the gb are 708 mm 920 mm 876 mm and 1209 mm respectively the main data employed in current research were daily meteorological data during 1961 2016 involving minimum air temperature tmin c maximum air temperature tmax c mean relative humidity rh wind speed at 2 m height ws m s converted from wind speed at 10 m height by using the conversion formula as recommended by allen et al allan et al 1998 sunshine duration hours sd h d the meteorological data were collected from 141 national stations and supplied by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn the used time series daily meteorological data were long and continuous the stations with miss daily data less than 1 were selected and filled with data from the nearby stations by the linear regressive method the homogeneity and stationarity of climatic variables series were examined according to the test method developed by haktanir and citakoglu 2014 finally 99 stations were selected in this study geographic information including the longitude and elevation of selected stations were obtained as well and shown in fig 1 2 2 calculation of reference evapotranspiration in current study the penman monteith p m method was adopted to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration it is physically based with both the energy balance and aerodynamics and was recommended as the sole standard method for et0 estimation by fao in 1998 allan et al 1998 the formula and has been widely used owing to its consistency reliability and accuracy yin et al 2010 li et al 2017 feng et al 2017a the formula is given as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 δ is the curve slope of the saturation vapor pressure kpa 1 rn is the net radiation on the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the surface soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 1 tmean is the mean temperature at 2 m height u2 is the wind speed at the height of 2 m m s 1 es is the saturation pressure kpa and ea is actual water vapor pressure kpa the detailed calculation can be found in allan et al 1998 2 3 trend analysis and mutation test the rank based nonparametric mann kendall mk test shadmani et al 2012 was utilized to analyze the temporal variation of et0 and related climatic variables its superiority exists in the ability of detecting the significance of the long time series trend no matter the sample series follow a certain type of distribution ye et al 2014 the mk method has been widely used for the significant test of hydrological and meteorological data fan et al 2016 liu et al 2016 for mutation test the cramer s test method was adopted to verify the stability of a sample sequence by comparing the difference between the average of the whole sample sequence and partial sample sequence türkeş 1996 zhang et al 2013 the cramer s test is based on the statistic t k 2 t k n n 2 n n 1 τ k 2 τ k 3 τ k x k x s x k 1 n i k 1 k n x i x 1 n i 1 n x i where x x k represent the average of the whole sample sequence and the average of partial sample sequence respectively and s is the overall sample standard deviation n is the length of the overall sample sequence and n is the length of the selected partial sample sequence the null hypothesis that there is no mutation is rejected if tk t0 2 4 linear trend a series y 1 y 2 y i y n can be represented by the polynomial tang et al 2011 feng et al 2017b 4 y a 0 a 1 t a m t n m n where y is response variable i e et0 or climatic variables t is the year the linear trend of a time series can be evaluated by the least square method and can be expressed as a linear regression equation 5 y n t t r e n d v i t a 0 where the slope trendvi is the evaluated trend of the variable vi and trendvi 10 is called tendency rate indicating the variation range of variable vi per decade negative value of trendvi indicates a decreasing trend conversely positive value of trendvi indicates an increasing trend 2 5 sensitivity and contribution rate analysis different variables have different dimensions and ranges of values making it difficult to contrast the sensitivity via partial derivatives for multi variable models fan et al 2016 therefore the partial derivative is converted into a dimensionless form to facilitate comparison of different climate factors gong et al 2006 following the p m formula et0 is the function of five climatic variables ws tmax tmin rh sd which can be expressed as 6 e t 0 f w s t max t min r h s d the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variables can be expressed as follows 7 s v i lim δ v i 0 δ e t 0 e t 0 δ v i v i e t 0 v i v i e t 0 where vi is the climate variable which represents ws tmax tmin rh or sd in this study respectively svi represents the sensitivity coefficient of et0 to variable v i denoting the percentage change in et0 transmitted from the percentage change in vi if svi 0 et0 and v i will increase or decrease simultaneously otherwise they have a reverse relation the larger the svi the greater the effect of a given variable has on et0 variation the sensitivity coefficient method is more convenient and accurate compared to other sensitivity analysis approaches gao et al 2016 thus it has been widely used in evapotranspiration study tang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2014a wang et al 2017 in this research sensitivity coefficients were computed on a daily basis for tmin tmax ws rh sd monthly and growing season averaged sensitivity coefficients were obtained by averaging the corresponding daily sensitivity coefficients in current study the sensitivity coefficient was divided into four levels for assessing sensitivity more clearly li et al 2017 as shown in table 1 by multiplying the sensitivity coefficient of a single climatic variable by its relative change we can get the change in et0 caused by the climatic variable namely the contribution rate of the climatic variable to et0 variation 8 c o n v i s v i r c v i 9 r c v i n t r e n d v i a v i 100 where convi is the contribution rate of vi to et0 variation svi represents the sensitivity coefficient of et0 to variable vi rcvi is the relative change of vi n is the length of observations avi is the absolute value of the multi year averaged vi and trendvi is the estimated trend of the variable vi if the convi is positive negative the variation of the variable will increase decrease et0 denoting the variable had a positive negative contribution to et0 variation 2 6 spatial interpolation method inverse distance weighting idw method gave the lower mean error than other common interpolation methods spline ordinary kriging tang et al 2013 feng et al 2017b thus idw from arcgis 10 2 was applied to describe the spatial variability of et0 and other variables in the present research 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution and changes in reference evapotranspiration et0 the temporal variation of averaged growing season et0 over the 99 meteorological stations in sc during the whole study period was plotted in fig 2 a change point for et0 series was discovered around the year of 1996 by the cramer s test growing season et0 demonstrated a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 from 1961 to 1996 by 10 25 mm decade while turned into a significant increasing trend p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 by 8 12 mm decade fig 3 illustrates the trends in growing season et0 for the 99 meteorological stations in sc before and after the change point 1961 1996 1997 2016 and the whole study period 1961 2016 growing season et0 decreased at 90 out of 99 stations from 1961 to 1996 and et0 exhibited a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at 44 stations out of the 90 stations which are mainly distributed in gb sb and east of ygp however growing season et0 exhibited an increasing trend at 71 out of 99 stations from 1997 to 2016 and 27 stations in wsp and southwest ygp showed a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 in general growing season et0 exhibited a decreasing trend at 80 out of 99 stations from 1961 to 2016 and et0 showed a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at 34 stations out of the 80 stations and the stations were mainly concentrated in gb sb and east of ygp while the stations whose et0 having significant increasing trends were mainly located on the western edge of the ygp the distribution of growing season et0 showed an obvious spatial gradient fig 3 the et0 values increased from west to east whilst from north to south and the mean growing season et0 of 99 meteorological stations was 665 6 mm with the variation rang of 420 4 mm to 897 2 mm during the period 1961 2016 regionally the mean values between 500 and 750 mm occurred in the east of ygp and sb while the southwest ygp and gb regions have the variation ranging between 750 and 900 mm with the highest values appeared in beihai station near the ocean and a lowest mean growing season et0 in wsp 3 2 spatially distribution and changes in climatic variables spatially averaged tmax tmin showed a general increase trend while rh sd ws showed a significant downward trend in the study area over the past 56 years fig 4 trend analysis indicated that tmin tmax in sc have increased significantly p 0 01 by 0 14 c 0 2 c decade respectively in contrast sd ws and rh decreased significantly by 0 11 h 0 01 m s 0 6 decade from 1961 to 2016 respectively table 2 tmax and tmin have also obviously increased with multiple trends the growth rates of tmax 0 2 c decade and tmin 0 3 c decade were largest in the wsp while the rates of tmax 0 11 c decade in gb and tmin 0 15 c decade in sb were smallest sd ws and rh have been decreasing across different regions sd had a significant decrease trend p 0 01 in all regions with the highest rate 0 15 h decade in sb and gb and the lowest 0 08 h decade in wsp ws in ygp and sb and rh in sb showed an insignificantly decreased trend p 0 05 by 0 01 m s decade and 0 76 decade respectively while decreased significantly in the other regions the variations of each climatic variable before and after the change point was shown in fig 4 and table 2 tmin increased by 0 09 c decade while tmax decreased by 0 06 c decade from 1961 to 1996 respectively however tmin increased significantly p 0 05 by 0 37 c decade while tmax increased by 0 39 c decade from 1997 to 2016 in sc the similar changes of tmax and tmin were also detected in four sub regions sd had a significantly decreased p 0 05 trend in most of the stations with the rate of 0 19 h decade from1961 to 1996 in sc while an insignificant increasing trend after 1996 mainly occurred in wsp and ygp rh showed a downward trend in sc then decreased significantly after 1996 with a rate of 1 57 decade table 2 ws decreased significantly p 0 001 with the rate of 0 04 m s decade in sb and gb from 1961 to 1996 while increased by 0 01 m s decade and 0 05 m s decade in ygp and wsp however ws increased significantly p 0 05 in sc except for gb after 1996 3 3 the variations of sensitivity coefficients characteristics during the growing season in order to quantify the sensitivity of et0 to climate variables the average sensitivity coefficients for tmin s tmin tmax s tmax rh s rh sd s sd and ws s ws in sc and its four sub regions were calculated and the results were shown in fig 5 and table 3 the notation of the sensitivity coefficients shows that et0 is positively correlated to the vary of tmax tmin sd and ws while negatively correlated to the vary of rh in addition it can be seen from fig 5 and table 3 that et0 was most sensitive to rh in sc from 1961 to 2016 with the average sensitivity coefficient value 0 496 followed by sd 0 284 tmax 0 208 tmin 0 080 and ws 0 052 however the most sensitive climatic variable was rh followed by sd tmax ws and tmin in wsp and sb while by sd tmax tmin and ws in gb from 1961 to 2016 s tmin ranged from 0 008 to 0 17 throughout the study area with medium levels in gb and sb but negligible levels in ygp and wsp s tmin had an obvious increasing trend during the period 1961 2016 at most stations with high altitudes while it increased weakly or decreased at most stations with low altitudes of sc s tmax varied from 0 06 to 0 41 with a medium level in most regions except for wsp s tmax had an increasing trend before 1996 and a more obvious increasing trend from 1997 to 2016 s rh in most regions had a high level and the lager values were distributed mainly in gb and east of ygb strong negative sensitivity shows an increase in rh would greatly reduce et0 the changed trend in s rh had a lager difference in spatial distribution s rh displayed an increasing trend in gb and decreasing trends in other regions from 1961 to 1996 however s rh was decreasing after 1997 throughout the study area s sd ranged from 0 17 to 0 39 and had a medium level in sc except for sb and east of ygp s sd in sc showed an obvious decreasing trend in most regions during the period 1961 1996 continued to decrease until 2016 s ws ranged from 0 02 to 0 17 and had a medium level in wsp while the levels in other regions could be negligible s ws showed significantly increasing trends from 1961 to 2016 indicating that et0 was more sensitive to the change of ws the average monthly sensitivity coefficient on the tmax tmin sd ws and rh during the growing season in sc and its four sub regions wsp sb ygp and gb were shown in fig 6 the sensitivity coefficients for climate variables are unstable during the growing season s tmin s sd had a peak and reached maximum in july and august demonstrating that et0 was most sensitive to the changes in tmin and sd in july and august in the contrast s ws and s rh were the largest at the beginning of the growing season reached its minimum in july and august and rebounded at the end the growing season indicating that et0 was least sensitive to the changes in ws and rh in july and august the trends of s tmax in sc and its four sub regions existed a large difference fig 6 showed that et0 was sensitive to tmax at the early growing season in sc and its four sub regions with the coefficient value around 0 23 however s tmax decreased in most regions except gb in april and may the characteristics of s tmax in ygp and wsp were steady with the sensitivity coefficient around 0 17 while a larger increase from july to september occurred in sb the sensitivity of et0 to the same climate variable varied in four sub regions probably due to different climate as well as substrate layer characteristics in each region 3 4 contribution from climatic variables during the growing season in order to identify the main climatic variables to et0 variation in sc and its four sub regions the relative contribution method was adopted to quantify the contribution of climatic variables to et0 change and the results were shown in table 4 sd was an important climatic variable effecting growing season et0 trends causing reduced et0 by 3 96 thereby becoming the largest contributor to the decreasing growing season et0 from 1961 to 1996 in addition decreasing ws and tmax also played negative effects on growing season et0 in sc with the contribution rate 0 14 and 0 15 from 1961 to 1996 respectively decreasing rh was the mainly contributor to increased et0 after 1996 which caused et0 to change by 1 99 from 1997 to 2016 in addition increasing tmax tmin and ws also played an important effect on increased et0 and the contribution rate was 0 63 0 34 and 0 74 respectively in sc from 1997 to 2016 the same patterns were also found in its sub regions however the same climate variable may have different contribution rates to the change of et0 in four sub regions because of the different sensitivities and change in climate variable in terms of spatial distribution the average monthly contribution rates for climatic variables during the growing season in sc and its four sub regions wsp sb ygp and gb are shown in fig 7 and table 4 results showed that the increase of tmax tmin and the decrease of rh had positive contributions to et0 during the growing season while the decrease of ws and sd had negative contributions to et0 the contribution rate of tmax was higher in wsp but the s tmax in wsp was lower indicating that tmax had a lager increase in wsp and had a peak in june indicating that the tmax in june increased greatly the similar variation characteristics were also found in the contribution rates of tmin the contribution rates of tmin and ws was higher in april while the lower value appeared in august and the opposite characteristics appeared in the contribution rate of sd revealed that the variation of tmin and ws was small while sd varies greatly at the end of the growing season the contribution rate of rh reached its minimum in june in most regions and rebounded at the end the growing season the lowest value was close to 0 in wsp at the beginning of the growing season indicating that rh in wsp had small variation in april results in fig 7 clearly showed that rh was the main climatic variable causing et0 variation at the beginning of the growing season in sc followed by sd ws tmax tmin at the middle and late stages of growing season the biggest contributor to et0 was sd with the highest value 6 95 in july as shown in table 3 that et0 was most sensitive to rh but a significant reduction in sd caused a great decline of et0 thus the contribution rate of sd was most important to the changes of et0 4 discussion 4 1 patterns of reference evapotranspiration and climatic variables understanding the spatial and temporal evolutions of et0 in growing season is the initial step in calculating regional crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water planning probing the effects of climatic variables on et0 variation will assist in predicting the variation of et0 in the context of climate change tong et al 2007 feng et al 2017c however because of the diversity of the regional geography and the climatic conditions it was necessary to carry out a regional research to provide a reference framework for providing basic scientific evidence for agricultural activities water resources planning and management a change point for et0 series was discovered in 1996 by the cramer s test in this study growing season et0 had demonstrated a significant decreased trend during 1961 1996 while turned into a significantly increased trend from 1997 to 2016 li et al 2014b also indicated that annual et0 had a decreased trend during 1960 2000 and an increased trend during 2000 2009 in southwestern china sc which was well coincident with the results obtained in this research liu et al 2018 detected a turning point of annual pet series in sc and annual pet had a downward trend at 10 04 mm dacade during 1961 2000 but increased at 50 65 mm decade thereafter such abrupt changes of et0 have been widely reported in many regions of the world li et al 2016 found annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 05 in the loess plateau by 12 22 mm decade from 1960 to 1990 while it increased significantly p 0 001 by 11 5 mm decade from 1991 to 2013 papaioannou et al 2011 discovered that the trend of annual et0 in greece had a declined trend before the early 1980s conversely it has begun to increase until 2001 zhang et al 2007 found the annual et0 decreased at 10 5 mm dacede in tibetan plateau from 1966 to 2003 however the increasing et0 was not detected because of the shorter research period only to 2003 in addition liu and zhang 2013 detected an increased et0 after 1993 in northwest china liu et al 2011 investigated the pan evaporation in china and found it decreased from 1960 to 1991 while increased after 1992 the variation of et0 in this paper are generally consistent with the previous reports however the change point and variation range of et0 series may exist difference due to the different study areas and study period the decreasing sd was found at most stations of sc which is consistent with many previous researches in china zhang et al 2007 qian et al 2007 li et al 2015 wang et al 2017 however the reasons for sd change remains subject to debate cong et al 2009 thought that the increase in cloud cover may be the main reason causing sd reduction however the assumption that the increase in cloud cover causing sd reduction at sc seems to be unreasonable as declining precipitation had been widely reported in many regions of the world ruelland et al 2008 feng et al 2017b recent studies showed that aggregated aerosols from anthropogenic emissions of pollutants were main dimming factor qian et al 2007 zhao et al 2014 streets et al 2008 and feng et al 2017b found that there was significant decline in sd in southwest china the same conclusion was also obtained in this research in addition as can be seen stations with significant decrease in sd are mainly distributed at low altitudes of the study area where the population density is higher and human activity is concentrated industry in these areas is well developed pollution is more serious in such areas than in low population density areas such as ygp hence the decrease of sd is more visible at the low altitudes than the high altitudes deducing that the increase in aerosols resulting from human activities may be an important reason for the decrease in solar radiation grimenes and thue hansen 2006 qian et al 2007 zhao et al 2014 investigated climatic variables in two elevation groups plains and mountains in hai river basin and found the decreasing trend of solar radiation was more significant in the densely populated areas plains than in the sparsely populated ones mountains aerosol index increased more and more significantly from the low population density areas in northern china such as yanshan and taihang mountainous areas to the high population density areas the spatial distribution of the aerosol index increase is consistent with the solar radiation decrease wang et al 2017 indicated that the high rise buildings in urban area can be obstacles to the flow of wind making the atmospheric aerosol difficult to diffuse thereby aggravating the decrease of sd it can be concluded that human activities do have an important impact on the changes of solar radiation or sd from the above studies ws which has a larger fluctuation in sc and its four sub regions is also the main climatic factor affecting the change of et0 the variations of ws in sc and its four sub regions from 1961 to 2016 were shown in fig 8 ws showed a statically significant decrease in 1960s while increased rapidly in late 1960s then decreased significantly until 2000 and gradually increased in recent years the same change trend of ws was also founded by li et al 2014b and fu et al 2010 and the decline in ws was not significant throughout the whole study period generally a weakened atmospheric circulation is thought to be the reason for ws decline zhang et al 2009 the temperature difference between the polar and tropical areas associated with global warming has been declining weakening the strength of atmospheric circulation weak atmospheric circulation has been proved in east asian and south asian xu et al 2006 mcvicar et al 2012 additionally recent studies showed that the increasing surface roughness result from human activities such as plantation and urbanization nearby the weather stations may also play an important role in the decreasing ws shi et al 2017 however the ws in some meteorological stations have exhibited significant increasing trends since 2000 while the vegetation cover continued to increase liu and zhang 2013 liu et al 2008 changes in surface roughness may not fully explain the changes in ws therefore the driving factors of changes in ws need to be fully understood in sc air temperature showed significant increasing trends at most stations in the study area consistent with global warming from previous researches li et al 2014a najafi et al 2015 feng et al 2017b however diurnal temperature range had the downward trend because the increase in tmin was more obviously than the tmax which may be due to that aerosols and greenhouse gases absorb solar radiation during daytime and release energy in the form of long wave radiation into the atmosphere at night liu et al 2010 increasing aerosols and anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions najafi et al 2015 and urbanization ji and zhou 2011 are widely considered to be the primary reasons for temperature increase however the increasing trends of tmax and tmin with the rate of 0 14 and 0 20 c decade respectively in this study were generally lower than those reported in other parts of the world ipcc 2007 this may be related to higher vegetation and forest coverage in sc the decline of rh mainly resulting from the decreasing trend in precipitation in southwest china yan et al 2013 feng et al 2014 will have a vital impact on the variation of evapotranspiration the decrease of relative humidity is more significant in most sites of the high altitude areas which was also discovered by zhao et al 2014 the decline of rh will reduce atmospheric vapor pressure and accelerate the release of water vapor from plant stoma the spatial distribution characteristics of climatic variables were similar to previous studies of sc and parts of this region gong et al 2006 li et al 2014b liu et al 2017 feng et al 2017b while temporal trend may exist difference because of the different study period it is interesting to note that the spatial distribution of climatic variables shows the border line at appa at 105 e yin et al 2010 feng et al 2017b which appears to point to the influence of different monsoon especially during the growing season the water stream originating from south china sea transported by southeast monsoon and from bay of bengal transported by southwest monsoon forming a wet center at the east of 105 e of study area because of the obstruction of the mountains fan and thomas 2013 liu et al 2018 besides the gather water vapor in this region can markedly weaken solar radiation therefore sd is far lower than that of the west of 105 e of study area 4 2 sensitivity and contribution rate of et0 to the variation of climatic variables the sensitivity coefficients of climatic variables calculated in this paper are close to the previous studies in china or other regions zuo et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 gao et al 2016 li et al 2017 researches had found rh was the most sensitive variable in the wei river basin and also the most sensitive factor in the yellow river basin wang et al 2007 zuo et al 2012 and hai river basin zhao et al 2014 gong et al 2006 found that relative humidity was the most sensitive variable to et0 change in yangtze river basin followed by shortwave radiation air temperature and wind speed was the least sensitive variable liu et al 2018 indicated that the spatial distribution of annual et0 is mainly affected by air temperature sunshine hours and relativity humidity over southwest china while sd was the most sensitive climatic variable in poyang lake catchment ye et al 2014 and ws had the highest sensitivity in northwest china li et al 2014a the differences existed may be due to differences in the study areas and calculation methods the contribution rate of climate variable was determined not only by the sensitivity of et0 to climatic variable but also by the magnitude of the climatic variables trends although rh was the most sensitive climatic variable for et0 it contributed little to et0 change due to its much smaller change magnitude during the period 1961 1996 in the present study the sensitivity coefficient of sd was not the highest but sd contributed the most to et0 change among the variables due to its rather large variation during the period 1961 1996 the magnitude of the rh trend was large from 1997 to 2016 thus causing the contribution rate of rh to et0 was much greater among the variables during the period 1997 2016 zhao et al 2014 also found that the sensitivity order of climatic variables to et0 from strong to weak was relativity humidity temperature shortwave radiation and wind speed in hai river basin respectively however and the decreasing et0 was caused mainly by the decreasing wind speed and shortwave radiation liu and zhang 2013 found the decreases in vapor pressure deficit wind speed and solar radiation had more effects on the changes of et0 than increasing air temperature before 1993 in northwest china and zhang et al 2015 investigate the temporal trends of et0 in the yellow river basin from 1961 to 2012 the results showed that the change of sunshine hours was the major factors influencing the variability of et0 followed by wind speed li et al 2014b found that the decreased relative humidity would cause a corresponding decline of saturated vapor pressure which must lead to the rise of et0 during the period of 1991 2009 in southwestern china which was well coincident with the results obtained in this research while li et al 2016 found annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 05 in the loess plateau from 1960 to 1990 and wind speed was mostly responsible for the variability in the et0 trend from 1960 to 1990 followed by solar radiation and vapor pressure while it increased significantly p 0 001 from 1991 to 2013 because of the rapidly increasing air temperature the variation of et0 in this paper are generally consistent with the previous reports li et al 2014b li et al 2016 however the dominant fctors on et0 variation may exist difference due to the different study areas and methods adopted increasing temperature including tmin tmax should have led to the increase of et0 before 1996 but et0 had a decreased trend in this period so evaporation paradox also existed in sc significant decrease in sd and ws offsets the impact of increasing temperature and decreasing rh dominating the change in et0 in sc yin et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 feng et al 2017b finally resulted in evaporation paradox in sc before 1996 the uncertainties in the estimation of the contribution of climate variable to et0 variation existed in present research as the variables change rates and sensitivity coefficients were not the same but fluctuated therefore the average values were used to estimate the contribution to et0 variation might be less accurate liu and zhang 2013 fan et al 2016 4 3 implications of et0 changes on agricultural water management in order to analyze the crop water demand variations for crops in growing season and provide general profiles of crop water demand in each subregion of sc actual crop water demand during the growing season is estimated by multiplying daily et0 by a modified crop coefficient kc allan et al 1998 kang et al 2003 thomas 2008 crop coefficients during different growth stage of different crops are modified according to allan et al 1998 and listed in table 5 the application of multiple cropping systems is benefit for characterizing the evolution features of crop water demand however multiple cropping systems are adopted in this region we mainly selected two representative cropping systems in each subregion except for wsp for analyzing as a simplification seeing that the same subregion has similar crop planting types and intercropping has not been accounted for the results are shown in table 6 both early rice late rice and corn late rice cropping systems in gb are two large water consumers while highland barley in wsp consumed less water with the multi year averaged value of 479 mm which is due to low et0 values and single cropping system it is interesting to note that actual crop water demand during the growing season were detected to have increased trends in each regions of sc after 1996 especially for wsp and ygp appeared to have experienced a more significant increase p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 though crop water demand generally appears as decreasing trends from 1961 to 2016 meanwhile studies have showed that the precipitation in sc had a declining trend in recent years xu et al 2006 mcvicar et al 2012 because of the impact of west pacific subtropical high as well as south asia high yan et al 2013 liu et al 2017 indicating crops is more likely to be threatened by drought especially for rainfed agriculture areas in sc a warm and dry environment may slow the restoration of vegetation causing ecological problems such as grassland degradation and soil erosion this will have a negative impact on the economic and ecological environment of the wsp area dominated by animal husbandry the ygp with a thin soil layer weathered by rocks leading to lower soil moisture storage and thus aggravated water shortage jiang et al 2018 however it is difficult to construct a large water conservancy project because of the poor geology and limited available technology therefore more drought resistant species and irrigation facilities are required to maintain the crop production in ygp though the increased trend of crop water demand in sb is not significant as ygp and wsp the increasing crop water demand will significantly affect regional agricultural water management sb is not only one of the most developed agriculture regions but also a densely populated area in china the consumption of industrial water and domestic water has been increasing rapidly with the rapid growth of the economy and urban population in recent decades qian et al 2007 which will occupy more available water resources the main crops may suffer serious water shortage threat in sb because of the extraordinary industrialization and urbanization in this area the development of water saving irrigation to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources is an important way to deal with the agricultural water shortage mushtaq et al 2006 the measures of water saving irrigation in sb need to be considered through the aspects of engineering drip irrigation micro irrigation etc agronomy regulated deficit irrigation water saving varieties etc management water price government police etc and so on under the trend of agricultural water shortages ørum et al 2010 nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 li et al 2016 pérez sarmiento et al 2016 therefore the administration of sc is expected to focus on the sustainable regional water resources management according to local differences under the condition of ongoing climate change 5 conclusion based on daily data from 99 meteorological stations in sc during 1961 2016 growing season et0 as well as the spatiotemporal trends and the contribution of climate variable to et0 variation were analyzed a change point for growing season et0 series was discovered in 1996 by the cramer s test growing season et0 had demonstrated a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 from 1961 to 1996 by 10 25 mm decade while turned into a significantly increased trend p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 by 8 12 mm decade in terms of spatial distribution growing season et0 had an increasing trend from west to east whilst from north to south in sc for climatic variables tmin tmax and rh were higher in sb gb and east of ygp while sd and ws had a converse trend meanwhile tmax ws and rh had a weakly decreased trend and sd decreased significantly in sc before 1996 while increased trends appeared in tmax ws and sd after 1996 tmin had increased trends during the whole study period in sc due to different geographical location and topographical features the trends of climatic variables in four sub regions differed the sensitivity of et0 to rh was negative while its sensitivity to the other five climatic variables was positive rh was the most sensitive climatic variable for et0 followed by sd tmax tmin and ws in sc the monthly sensitivity coefficients of climatic variables varied during the growing season and the sensitivity coefficients for climatic variables showed great differences in spatial distribution meanwhile the sensitivity coefficient of et0 for the climatic variables was mutative with the climate change the monthly contribution of each variable to et0 determined by the sensitivity coefficient of climatic variable and the magnitude of its changing trend were temporally unstable and varied considerably over the growing season the proportional contributions of tmax tmin ws rh sd to the trend in et0 were 0 15 0 15 0 14 0 03 3 96 during the period 1961 1996 respectively therefore sd was the main contributor to the change of growing season et0 in sc from 1961 to 1996 the proportional contributions of tmax tmin ws rh sd to the increased et0 were 0 63 0 34 0 74 1 99 0 49 during the period 1997 2016 respectively inferring that rh was the dominant variable for the increase in et0 in sc the increase in et0 will result in higher water consumption for the growth of crops especially for wsp and ygp appeared to have experienced a more significant increase p 0 05 from 1997 to 2016 which indicating crops is more likely to be threatened by drought especially for rainfed agriculture areas in sc acknowledgments we would like to thank the china meteorological administration for providing the data used in

11129,water availability is a major constraint for wheat production in the southeast of the loess plateau china plastic mulch exhibits greater potential in rainwater harvesting while nitrogen n fertilizer has a strong effect on soil water utilization most of annual precipitation in the loess plateau occurs in summer rainwater retention in summer fallow becomes very important for winter wheat production in the dryland of the loess plateau straw mulching in summer fallow are commonly used to prevent water evaporation from soil surface and retain rainwater recently plastic mulching has also been used nitrogen inputs have also a significant impact on soil water utilization and yield production however there is little information available for the effects of full coverage of plots with plastic mulch pm in summer fallow on soil water storage at sowing and n rates interact with the soil water utilization in winter wheat yield water use efficiency wue and grain protein concentration gpc therefore field experiments were conducted in three consecutive years with variable rainfall the results showed that pm in summer fallow increased soil water storage at sowing by at least 50 mm and water storage efficiency was the highest 56 5 in the dry season spatio temporal dynamics in the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth exhibited a downward movement with crop development approximately half of soil water consumption from flowering to maturity was derived from the 200 300 cm soil layers the optimal n rate with pm increased grain yield by 27 in the wet season 36 in the normal season and 41 in the dry season pm in combination with optimized n could improve wue only when annual rainfall is equal to or above the yearly average furthermore evapotranspiration is negatively correlated with gpc although the soil water consumption from 200 to 300 cm depth is positively correlated with post anthesis n uptake this suggests that the additional n is needed to further increase gpc in the season with soil water storage of 550 600 mm at sowing the n rate of 225 kg ha 1 with pm could achieve the highest yield and 13 2 of gpc in the season with soil water storage of 450 550 mm at sowing the n rate of 150 kg ha 1with pm could achieve the highest yield and 14 3 of gpc when the season with soil water storage of approximately 400 mm the n rate of 75 kg ha 1 with pm achieved the highest yield and 15 0 of gpc our results indicate that adjusting n fertilizer inputs based on seasonal variation in summer rainfall could enhance wheat yield and gpc in the southeast region of the loess plateau keywords plastic mulch summer fallow nitrogen soil water storage grain protein concentration 1 introduction rainfed agriculture covers approximately 80 of the cultivated land in the world contributing to about 60 of total crop production world water assessment programme 2009 the loess plateau a typical rainfed farming area in china makes up approximately 40 rainfed farming in china li et al 2015 winter wheat is the main crop in the loess plateau and therefore its production is important for food security in the region jin et al 2007 low water availability is the main limiting factor for winter wheat productivity in the loess plateau annual precipitation in the loess plateau is around 300 600 mm approximately 60 of which occurs in the summer july to september winter wheat is sown in the end of september or early october and harvested in the june of the following year the land is left fallow during the summer as the temperature in summer is high and a large proportion of rainfall is evaporated from the upper layer of soil kang et al 2002 to reduce evaporation and increase rainwater storage in summer fallow farming practices such as mulching and conservation tillage have widely been used baumhardt and jones 2002 chen et al 2015 he et al 2016 wang et al 2016 qin et al 2015 sun et al 2018 traditionally straw mulch in summer fallow is applied to reduce moisture evaporation from the upper layer of soil and consequently increases rainwater storage in soil baumhardt and jones 2002 recently the ridge furrow framework with the ridge covered by plastic film has been widely adopted to effectively reduce water loss through evaporation during the crop growing season and increased wue qin et al 2015 chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 in addition if plastic mulch in the ridge furrow system is kept in summer fallow it can further increase soil water storage at sowing he et al 2016 further studies on plastic mulch in summer fallow are needed to harvest more precipitation root growth and depth in soil play a significant role in the uptake of soil water and nutrients the deeper rooting of winter wheat results in lower amounts of inorganic n in the layer soil of 1 0 2 5 m kristian et al 2009 he et al 2016 also show that all precipitation is stored within 3 m depth and deep drainage does not occur below 3 m depth our previous study showed that 2 3 m soil water was used at late stages of winter wheat growth sun et al 2018 these results imply that the importance of spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage especially in 2 3 m depth another limiting factor for winter wheat production in the loess plateau is low soil n increased n inputs could greatly enhance winter wheat yield guo et al 2012 however when water is adequate excessive n promotes vegetative growth of wheat plants and delay reproductive growth leading to more infertile tillers and plant lodging walter et al 1995 hossain et al 2008 consequently wheat grain yield could be largely reduced and cause environmental pollution as well godfray et al 2010 hvistendahl 2010 it should also be born in mind that the higher grain yields often results in the lower grain protein concentration gpc bogard et al 2010 and the negative correlation has been observed when plastic mulch was used either in the summer fallow or the crop growing season luo et al 2018 therefore it is important to optimize n fertilizer application not only for high grain yield but also for the gpc required by end users there are several application options available for n application such as basal fertilizer topdressing and foliar spray in rainfed wheat production topdressing is not effective due to the lack of soil moisture in top soil during the late stages of growth foliar fertilizer is effective woolfolk et al 2002 dick et al 2016 but there is additional cost associated with the application basal fertilizer application is the most economic and easy to be implemented based on the soil moisture status at sowing in the present study we used plastic film with punched holes to cover entire plots during the summer fallow to further increase soil water storage and applied three n rates at sowing to evaluate the effects of n rate on the utilization of soil water storage grain yield and gpc we also determined soil water distribution in 0 300 cm depth to evaluate the effects of pm and n rate on soil water consumption in different wheat growth stages the experiments were conducted in three consecutive seasons our objectives were 1 to examine effects of pm in summer fallow on rainfall retention 2 to determine effects of the combination of pm and n rate on the consumption of the soil water storage in 0 300 cm depth during crop growing season and 3 to evaluate effects of the combination of pm and n rate on grain yield and gpc 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted at agriculture research station of shanxi agriculture university 34 35 n 110 15 e in wenxi shanxi province of china from july 2010 to june 2013 the experimental site locates in the eastern tableland of the loess plateau it is a typical semi arid area which has an altitude of 450 700 m an average annual air temperature of 11 13 c and annual precipitation of 343 656 mm 2003 2013 winter wheat is usually sown in early october and harvested in early june of the following year the land is left fallow in summer from july to september precipitation from july 2010 to june 2013 and ten year average from 2003 to 2013 are shown in fig 1 the yearly average in the last ten years 2003 2013 was 490 mm fig 1 based on the generalized precipitation classification dry year is defined as the year average precipitation is less than ten years average precipitation p 25 normal year is defined as the year average precipitation is basically equal to ten years average precipitation 25 p 25 wet year is defined as the year average precipitation is more than ten years average precipitation p 25 the annual precipitation in 2011 12 was 35 above the ten year average and therefore the 2011 12 season is referred to as the wet season fig 1 the annual precipitation of 553 mm in 2010 11 was much lower than that in 2011 12 and it was close to the ten year average fig 1 therefore the 2010 11 season is referred to as the normal season the annual precipitation in 2012 13 was 27 lower than the ten year average and the 2012 13 season is referred to as the dry season fig 1 the distribution of precipitation was uneven and approximately 70 precipitation occurred in the summer fallow fig 1 the experimental site was flat and bound with boundary there was no water runoff during the experiments all precipitation could be stored in 3 m depth and deep drainage does not occur generally below 3 m depth he et al 2016 soil type at the experimental site was classified as calcareous cinnamon soil sand 43 2 silt 32 5 and clay 10 5 using chinese soil taxonomy soil organic matter was determined with the modified walkley black method wang et al 2016 total nitrogen was measured by the kjeldahl method available p olsen p was measured by extraction with 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 followed by colorimetric measurement of p using the molybdate ascorbic acid method available k by extraction with 1 mol l 1 ammonium acetate and analyzed by a flame photometer and soil ph in water was determined with a 1 2 5 soil to water ratio basic soil properties are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the experiment used split plot design with three complete replications main plot treatments were plastic mulch pm with full coverage in the summer fallow and sub plot treatments were three rates of n fertilizer at sowing they were 75 150 and 225 n kg ha 1 respectively before plastic mulching organic matter fertilizer 1500 kg ha 1 was evenly spread in plots and then the organic matter fertilizer and remaining wheat stubble 20 30 cm were ploughed to 25 30 cm depth using a rotavator in the early to middle of july as deep ploughing described by sun et al 2018 the organic fertilizer contained approximately 45 organic matter 1 2 available n 1 available p 0 3 available k and more than 20 million g 1 effective counts of living bacteria after deep ploughing soil surface was tilled to be uniform and flat using the rotavator for pm entire plots were covered by water permeable plastic film 8 μm in thickness 100 cm in width with punched holes 1 0 cm in diameter 25 holes m 2 and no plastic film nm was used as the control fig 2 the plastic cover in pm was removed and ploughed to a depth of 10 15 cm in the end of august before sowing three rates of n fertilizer urea containing n 46 were applied with 150 p2o5 kg ha 1 as triple superphosphate 16 p2o5 and 75 k2o kg ha 1 as potassium chloride 50 k2o all fertilizers were spread uniformly and then tilled into the top 15 cm of soil plots 3 m 10 m were tilled to form the ridge furrow framework with five ridges and furrows fig 2 the ridges covered with transparent plastic film 8 μm in thickness with no punched holes fig 2 using film mulching seeder 2bx 12 hebeinonghaha china the winter wheat cultivar yunhan 20410 was sown on 29 september 2010 and 1 october in 2011 and 2012 and the seeding rate was 90 kg ha 1 the seeds were planted to the two sides of furrows the other crop management was the same as that used by local farmers the plastic film cover was removed in the middle to end of may plants were harvested on 5 june 2011 10june 2012 and 2june 2013 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture before plot preparation a 3 m deep profile pit was excavated and soil samples were taken from 0 to 300 cm depth in 20 cm increments using the cutting ring method described by dama et al 2005 soil bulk density and gravimetric soil moisture content gsw were measured for each soil layers gswwas determined and expressed as soil water storage mm gsw was measured in 20 cm increments to a depth of 300 cm at the beginning of plastic mulching and at the end of the summer fallow gsw was also determined at four developmental stages of plants in each plot four random soil samples were taken between plant rows for each soil sample gws was calculated as the ratio of the mass of water per mass dry soil dry weight of soil sample was obtained by placing fresh soil samples in an oven at 105 c for 72 h soil water storage for a given layer was calculated as follows sun et al 2018 w mm gsw ρb g cm 3 sd mm where ρb is dry soil bulk density of given soil layer and sd refers to soil depth water storage efficiency is equal to soil water content at the end of summer fallow minus soil water content at the beginning of summer fallow dividing by precipitation during summer fallow 100 2 3 2 ear number grain yield and water use efficiency wue at maturity plants of one m2from each plot were randomly sampled from the inner rows for the determination of ear number grain yield was obtained by harvesting all plants in the plot wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as grain yield kg ha 1 divided by evapotranspiration mm evapotranspiration was the sum of precipitation mm in the growing season and consumption of soil water storage mm in 0 300 cm depth from sowing to plant maturity 2 3 3 plant nitrogen and grain protein concentration twenty plants from each plot were collected randomly for the measurement of plant n concentration at flowering and maturity plant samples and grains were oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then at 75 c for 48 h for dry weight dry plant samples were cut to 4 5 cm length and ground using plant ball mill fz102 beijing china dry grains were also ground to powder using fz102 mill ground samples of 0 25 g were digested with h2so4 h2o2 and then total n concentration was determined using the standard indophenol blue colorimetric method meyer 1983 grain protein concentration gpc was estimated as grain n concentration multiplied by 5 7 post anthesis n uptake kg ha 1 total n accumulation of the aboveground plant at maturity total n accumulation of the aboveground plant at anthesis 2 4 statistical analysis the sas package sas institute inc north carolina usa was used for analysis of variance least significance difference lsd tests at p 0 05 were used for comparison of means 3 results 3 1 pm in summer fallow increased soil water storage at sowing the precipitation in summer fallow was the highest 460 mm in the wet season the middle 420 mm in the normal season and the lowest 188 mm in the dry season fig 1 the precipitation in summer fallow accounts for more than 75 of the yearly total in both wet and normal seasons and it also makes up 53 of the yearly total in the dry season the variable rainfall in summer fallow led to the difference of soil water storage in three growing seasons table 2 plastic mulch with punched holes pm in summer fallow fig 2 increased the soil water storage of 0 300 cm at sowing in all three seasons although the amount of soil water storage increased 50 62 mm by pm was similar in these three seasons water storage efficiency was much higher in the dry season 56 5 than in either wet 42 2 or normal season 43 3 table 2 3 2 pm and high n rates increase ear number and yield pm treatments significantly increased ear number relative to nm controls fig 3 a n225 with pm had the highest ear number 614 per m2 in the wet season which was 11 3 higher than that of nm fig 3a in the normal season n150 with pm had the highest ear number 535 per m2 and it was 12 5 higher than that of nm fig 3a n150 with pm had also the highest ear number 380 per m2 in the dry season and it was 22 4 higher than that of nm fig 3a a similar trend in the pm treatments was also observed for grain yield fig 3b n225 with pm increased grain yield by 27 relative to that of nm in the wet season 36 in the normal season and 41 in the dry season respectively fig 3b the multiple variance analysis showed that pm had the largest effect on ear number and the effect of n rate on ear number and yield was after that of year and the interaction of year n rate table 3 however the effect of the pm n rate interaction on ear number and yield was relatively small these results indicate that pm has a larger effect than n rates on ear number as well as yield as both ear number and yield was positively correlated the regression analysis was conducted between ear number and yield the results showed that the yield increase in pm treatments is highly significantly correlated with ear number in all three seasons p 0 008 suppl fig s1 these results indicate that the increase in grain yield by pm and the optimal n rate largely results from the enhanced ear number 3 3 pm and optimized n rates increase wue in normal and wet seasons pm treatments had the largest effect on wue and n rates had a minor effect on wue table 3 optimized n rates of in the pm treatment could slightly increase wue in both wet and normal seasons but not in the dry season fig 3c these results show that pm in combination with optimized n could improve wue only when annual rainfall is equal to or above the yearly average 3 4 high n rates increased grain protein concentration gpc but pm reduced gpc both pm and n rate affected gpc the increase in n rate significantly enhanced gpc regardless of mulch treatments in both wet and normal seasons whereas in the dry season the highest gpc was observed at n150 in both pm and nm fig 3d in contrast pm treatments significantly reduced gpc compared to the nm controls in both wet and normal seasons but pm treatments had no effect on gpc relative to nm in the dry season fig 3d gpc at n225 with pm was 0 84 lower than the nm control 14 08 in the wet season whereas in the normal season gpc at n225 with pm was 0 52 lower than the nm control 14 29 fig 3d the highest n rate n225 in the pm treatment could achieve the highest gpc in both wet and normal seasons whereas the middle n rate n150 was adequate for the highest gpc in the dry season the multiple variance analysis showed that year had the largest effect on gpc which was approximately 60 higher than that of n rate table 3 notably the effect of n rate on gpc was approximately four fold larger than that of pm table 3 however the effect of the pm n rate interaction on gpc was extremely small these results indicate that pm reduces gpc in both normal and wet seasons and n input plays a key role in the improvement of gpc in the rainfed dryland in all three seasons studied regression analysis showed that gpc was negatively correlated with et at all three n rates in either pm or nm suppl fig s2 the slopes decreased with an increase in n rate in both pm and nm suppl fig s2 a large reduction was observed at n225 relative to n150 in both pm and nm suppl fig s2 the difference in the slope at n225 was small between pm and nm suppl fig s2 these results indicate that the higher water consumption by plants leads to the lower gpc regardless of mulch treatments and the higher n input reduces the negative effect of total water consumption by plants on gpc 3 5 optimized n rates reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage but increase soil water consumption in the 200 300 cm soil layer at the reproductive stage the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth in all treatments slightly reduced 1 3 from winter dormancy to jointing in all three seasons and largely reduced 21 23 from winter dormancy to flowering suppl table s1 a further reduction at maturity was observed in both wet and normal seasons resulting in a total reduction of 31 38 but in the dry season the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth at maturity slightly higher than that at flowering suppl table s1 this is because higher rainfall occurred in the late may 2013 fig 1 spatio temporal dynamics in the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth varied with n rate developmental stage and season but it was generally similar in nm and pm except for pm having higher soil water storage than nm until flowering in all three seasons figs 4 6 in the wet season with nm the differential soil water storage in three n rates at jointing appeared in the soil layers between 80 cm and 220 cm fig 4a moved downwards to 120 220 cm when plants were flowering fig 4b and further moved downwards to 200 300 cm at maturity fig 4c the vertical movement of differential soil water storage with plant development was similar between pm and nm in the wet season fig 4d f in the normal season with either nm or pm the differential soil water storage in three n rates at jointing was evident in the soil layers between 60 and 180 cm fig 5a d slightly moved to 80 180 cm at flowering fig 5b e and sharply moved downwards to 220 300 cm at maturity fig 5c f in the dry season with either nm or pm the differential soil water storage in three n rates at jointing occurred in the soil layers of 20 160 cm fig 6a d moved downwards to 80 180 cm at flowering fig 6b e and sharply moved downwards to 220 300 cm at maturity fig 6c f to show whether the differences observed in the differential soil layers among three n rates were significant the amount of soil water storage in the differential soil layers was calculated and is shown in fig 7 at jointing soil water storage in the differential soil layers was significantly higher in pm than in nm across three seasons fig 7a the soil water storage in the 80 220 cm layers significantly increased with n rate in the wet season for both nm and pm and n225 in pm was 14 mm higher than n150 fig 7a when plants were flowering soil water storage in the differential soil layers was significantly higher in pm than in nm for both normal and dry seasons while no significant difference at n150 and n225 was observed between pm and nm in the wet season fig 7b notably n225 in the wet season had significantly lower soil water storage in the 120 220 cm layers than n150 and the soil water storage at n225 was approximately 14 mm less than that at n150 fig 7b in both normal and dry seasons n150 in both nm and pm had significantly lower soil water storage in the 80 180 cm soil layers than either n225 or n75 at flowering fig 7b at maturity the soil water storage in the 200 300 cm layers in the wet season was 19 mm less at n225 than at n150 fig 7c in the normal season the differential soil water storage in the 220 300 cm layers remained lower at n150 than at either n225 or n75 fig 7c in the dry season the differential soil water storage in the 220 300 cm layers remained significantly lower at n150 with pm than at either n225 or n75 while there was no difference in nm between n150 and n225 fig 7c these results show that the optimal n rate could reduce soil water storage up to the jointing stage leading to more soil water available for plant later growth stages and the plants treated with the optimal n rate also consume more soil water from flowering to maturity the results reveal that in all three seasons differential soil water storage moved from above 80 200 cm at flowering down to the 200 300 cm depth at maturing indicating the importance of soil water storage in the deep soil layers for high yield production in addition the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm at maturity was similar between pm and nm treatments in both wet and normal seasons whereas the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm at maturity was higher in the pm treatments than in the nm treatments for dry season suppl table s1 these results indicate that the higher yield with pm does not reduce the overall soil water storage in the end of crop season 3 6 water consumption from the deep soil layer is correlated with post anthesis n uptake and yield in all three seasons the consumption of soil water in the 200 300 cm layers at n225 with pm in the wet season was 65 8 mm accounting for 56 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth while n150 with pm in the normal season was 35 4 mm accounting for 44 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth fig 8 in the dry season n150 with pm consumed 21 9 mm water from the 200 300 cm soil layers despite of the higher precipitation during the late may fig 1 resulting in the negative values of soil water consumption in 0 200 cm fig 8 in comparison to the normal season water consumption at n150 in the dry season was found to be 38 lower fig 8 these results show that a substantial proportion of water consumption is derived from the deep soil during grain filling in all three seasons implying that the water consumption from the deep soil could be vital for post anthesis n uptake and grain yield the regression analysis showed that post anthesis n uptake is linearly correlated with yield fig 9 a the post anthesis n uptake in both nm and pm treatments increased with n rate in the wet season all three n rates in pm had significantly higher post anthesis n uptake than those in the nm controls fig 9b the post anthesis n uptake at n225 with pm was the highest in all n treatments fig 9b in the normal and dry season the highest level of post anthesis n uptake was found at n150 with pm fig 9b interestingly the soil water consumption of the 200 300 cm layer from flowering to maturity highly significantly correlates with the post anthesis n uptake in all three seasons p 0 006 suppl fig s3 these results suggest that the soil water consumption in the deeper soil play an important role in the post anthesis n uptake 4 discussion 4 1 plastic mulch in summer fallow increases soil water storage at sowing and n inputs optimize the utilization of soil water storage in the semiarid and rain fed farming area of the losses plateau the increase in soil water storage during summer fallow is critical for winter wheat production as approximately 60 of annual precipitation occurs in the summer plastic mulch in the ridge furrow framework has been widely used to reduce water evaporation from soil surface during the crop growing season chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and it has been extended to the summer fallow period for increasing soil water storage he et al 2016 plastic mulch in the ridge furrow framework either during the crop growing season or in the summer fallow or both could increase soil water storage leading to higher wheat yield chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 he et al 2016 in addition deep ploughing in the early summer fallow could increase the capacity of soil water storage and consequently enhance soil water storage of 69 mm on average during summer fallow relative to no tillage sun et al 2018 in the present study soil surface in pm was fully covered by plastic film with punched holes during the summer fallow our results showed that pm could increase the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth in the summer fallow in all three seasons by 11 63 on average relative to nm table 2 in contrast three out of six seasons shows that the ridge covered with pm in the summer fallow increases soil water recharge in the 0 300 cm depth he et al 2016 therefore the full coverage by pm with punched holes during the summer fallow has its advantage in soil water storage over the ridge covered by pm furthermore pm had a higher efficiency of soil water storage in the dry season than that in the normal or wet season table 2 suggesting that pm is more effective in the season with a lower rainfall in the summer fallow in the pm treatment the overall soil water storage in the 0 300 cm depth at flowering remained higher than that in the nm treatment in all three seasons table 3 importantly pm had also a higher level of soil water storage at flowering in the deep soil layers 200 300 cm in all three seasons fig 6 these results indicate that pm could provide more soil water for crop growth especially in flowering and grain filling the higher level of available water in soil could meet crop demand for the higher yield formation importantly the higher yield production with pm does not reduce the overall soil water storage in the end of crop season suppl table s1 furthermore the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage during the crop growing season figs 3 5 revealed that soil water reduction in both nm and pm started from shallow soil layers gradually moved downwards to the middle soil layers and ended at the deep soil layers of 200 300 cm figs 3 5 the pattern of soil water change was similar to that with on deep tillage in summer fallow sun et al 2018 this illustrates the importance of soil water storage in the deep soil layer for high crop yield the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage also revealed that n rates had a significant impact on the utilization of soil water storage increased by pm the deferential consumption of soil water in three n rates took place in different soil depths at the different growth stages the high n rate n255 in the wet season and the middle level of n fertilizer n150 in both normal and dry seasons used less soil water storage up to the jointing stage in differential soil layers but more soil water storage was depleted from flowering to maturity figs 3 5 the optimized n input could reduce water consumption at the early to middle stage of plant development and therefore could provide more soil water for the consumption during grain filling leading to higher grain yield fig 3b it has been shown that roots in the deep soil play an important role in the uptake of soil water after flowering in wheat li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 root growth increases in depth with plant developmental progression and follow water availability in soil feng et al 2017 xu et al 2016 which implies that the deferential soil water storage observed in soil layers among three n rates is a result of the water uptake activity of roots the higher grain yield in the pm treatment with the optimized n input achieved higher wue in all three seasons fig 3b c as the grain yield is largely determined by et the increased soil water storage in pm plays a key roleinthe higher grain yield production therefore leading to the higher wue 4 2 optimal n inputs for high grain yield and gpc vary with summer rainfall the optimized n input could maximize the utilization of soil water storage not only for higher grain yield but also higher gpc in the wet season the grain yield in pm with the high n rate n255 was 6 41 ton ha 1 which was26 7 higher than that of n150 fig 3b in the normal season the grain yield in pm with the middle n rate n150 reached 5 78 ton ha 1 which was 14 2 higher than that of n75 fig 3b in the dry season the grain yield in pm with n150 was 3 40 ton ha 1 which was 41 0 higher than that with nm fig 3b our results show that pm in the summer fallow could largely increase grain yield 28 3 on average in all three seasons as every 100 mm increased in rainfall results approximately 3 decrease in yield increase it means that the effects of pm on yield are more effective in the lower rainfall seasons similar results were also reported by qin et al 2015 this highlights the importance of the rainfall storage during summer fallow for higher yield in the semiarid and rainfed agricultural area of the losses plateau however the increased yield with pm led to the gpc reduction in both wet and normal seasons gpc with pm at n225 in the wet season was 5 9 lower than that with nm at n225 while gpc with pm at n150 in the normal season was 3 9 lower than that with nm at n150 fig 3d interestingly no gpc reduction at n150 was observed between pm and nm in the dry season fig 3d this could be due to the much lower grain yield in the dry season relative to in the normal or wet season fig 3b the negative correlation between grain yield and gpc has been reported in the various conditions including plastic mulch triboi et al 2006 arduini et al 2006 zheng et al 2009 luo et al 2018 dilution effect plays a predominant role apart from the dilution effect the lower post anthesis n uptake could also have an impact on gpc because n remobilization from vegetative organs plays little role in gpc bogard et al 2010 althoughthe soil water consumption from 200 to 300 cm depth is positively correlated with post anthesis n uptake suppl fig s3 et is negatively correlated with gpc at any of the three n rates suppl fig s2 this indicates that additional n application is required to further increase gpc the application could be done by either basal n fertilizer at sowing lin et al 2015 or foliar n fertilizer at jointing stage dick et al 2016 4 3 matching n input with summer rainfall for high winter wheat yield and gpc to obtain high grain yield and gpc required n inputs need to be adjusted based on pre sowing soil water storage in the season with pre sowing soil water storage 550 600 mm n225 could be applied for the highest yield with 13 14 of gpc in the season with pre sowing soil water storage 450 550 mm n150 could be applied to achieve the highest yield and 14 15 of gpc when pre sowing soil water storage is approximately 400 mm n75 could be applied to achieve the highest yield and 14 of gpc our recommendations could be used as a guideline for wheat production in the southeast region of the loess plateau if the higher gpc is required such as in the wet season the agronomic or genetic approach is required to improve higher post anthesis n uptake the application of basal n and foliar n late in the season is effective in increasing gpc woolfolk et al 2002 dick et al 2016 growing cultivars with high gpc could also be used for higher gpc liu et al 2016 further studies on high gpc cultivars applied with reduced n inputs are warranted for high grain yield and gpc 5 conclusion the increase of soil water storage in the summer fallow through the full coverage of soil surface with pm consisting of punched holes could provide additional rainwater for winter wheat growth in the southeast region of the loess plateau the optimized n inputs could reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage and lead to more soil water available for grain yield production spatio temporal dynamics in the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth exhibited a downward movement with the crop development progression the soil water storage in the 200 300 cm soil depth plays an important role in grain filling and post anthesis n uptake n inputs need to be adjusted based on the pre sowing soil water storage for high grain yield and gpc acknowledgements the authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for valuable input this

11129,water availability is a major constraint for wheat production in the southeast of the loess plateau china plastic mulch exhibits greater potential in rainwater harvesting while nitrogen n fertilizer has a strong effect on soil water utilization most of annual precipitation in the loess plateau occurs in summer rainwater retention in summer fallow becomes very important for winter wheat production in the dryland of the loess plateau straw mulching in summer fallow are commonly used to prevent water evaporation from soil surface and retain rainwater recently plastic mulching has also been used nitrogen inputs have also a significant impact on soil water utilization and yield production however there is little information available for the effects of full coverage of plots with plastic mulch pm in summer fallow on soil water storage at sowing and n rates interact with the soil water utilization in winter wheat yield water use efficiency wue and grain protein concentration gpc therefore field experiments were conducted in three consecutive years with variable rainfall the results showed that pm in summer fallow increased soil water storage at sowing by at least 50 mm and water storage efficiency was the highest 56 5 in the dry season spatio temporal dynamics in the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth exhibited a downward movement with crop development approximately half of soil water consumption from flowering to maturity was derived from the 200 300 cm soil layers the optimal n rate with pm increased grain yield by 27 in the wet season 36 in the normal season and 41 in the dry season pm in combination with optimized n could improve wue only when annual rainfall is equal to or above the yearly average furthermore evapotranspiration is negatively correlated with gpc although the soil water consumption from 200 to 300 cm depth is positively correlated with post anthesis n uptake this suggests that the additional n is needed to further increase gpc in the season with soil water storage of 550 600 mm at sowing the n rate of 225 kg ha 1 with pm could achieve the highest yield and 13 2 of gpc in the season with soil water storage of 450 550 mm at sowing the n rate of 150 kg ha 1with pm could achieve the highest yield and 14 3 of gpc when the season with soil water storage of approximately 400 mm the n rate of 75 kg ha 1 with pm achieved the highest yield and 15 0 of gpc our results indicate that adjusting n fertilizer inputs based on seasonal variation in summer rainfall could enhance wheat yield and gpc in the southeast region of the loess plateau keywords plastic mulch summer fallow nitrogen soil water storage grain protein concentration 1 introduction rainfed agriculture covers approximately 80 of the cultivated land in the world contributing to about 60 of total crop production world water assessment programme 2009 the loess plateau a typical rainfed farming area in china makes up approximately 40 rainfed farming in china li et al 2015 winter wheat is the main crop in the loess plateau and therefore its production is important for food security in the region jin et al 2007 low water availability is the main limiting factor for winter wheat productivity in the loess plateau annual precipitation in the loess plateau is around 300 600 mm approximately 60 of which occurs in the summer july to september winter wheat is sown in the end of september or early october and harvested in the june of the following year the land is left fallow during the summer as the temperature in summer is high and a large proportion of rainfall is evaporated from the upper layer of soil kang et al 2002 to reduce evaporation and increase rainwater storage in summer fallow farming practices such as mulching and conservation tillage have widely been used baumhardt and jones 2002 chen et al 2015 he et al 2016 wang et al 2016 qin et al 2015 sun et al 2018 traditionally straw mulch in summer fallow is applied to reduce moisture evaporation from the upper layer of soil and consequently increases rainwater storage in soil baumhardt and jones 2002 recently the ridge furrow framework with the ridge covered by plastic film has been widely adopted to effectively reduce water loss through evaporation during the crop growing season and increased wue qin et al 2015 chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 in addition if plastic mulch in the ridge furrow system is kept in summer fallow it can further increase soil water storage at sowing he et al 2016 further studies on plastic mulch in summer fallow are needed to harvest more precipitation root growth and depth in soil play a significant role in the uptake of soil water and nutrients the deeper rooting of winter wheat results in lower amounts of inorganic n in the layer soil of 1 0 2 5 m kristian et al 2009 he et al 2016 also show that all precipitation is stored within 3 m depth and deep drainage does not occur below 3 m depth our previous study showed that 2 3 m soil water was used at late stages of winter wheat growth sun et al 2018 these results imply that the importance of spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage especially in 2 3 m depth another limiting factor for winter wheat production in the loess plateau is low soil n increased n inputs could greatly enhance winter wheat yield guo et al 2012 however when water is adequate excessive n promotes vegetative growth of wheat plants and delay reproductive growth leading to more infertile tillers and plant lodging walter et al 1995 hossain et al 2008 consequently wheat grain yield could be largely reduced and cause environmental pollution as well godfray et al 2010 hvistendahl 2010 it should also be born in mind that the higher grain yields often results in the lower grain protein concentration gpc bogard et al 2010 and the negative correlation has been observed when plastic mulch was used either in the summer fallow or the crop growing season luo et al 2018 therefore it is important to optimize n fertilizer application not only for high grain yield but also for the gpc required by end users there are several application options available for n application such as basal fertilizer topdressing and foliar spray in rainfed wheat production topdressing is not effective due to the lack of soil moisture in top soil during the late stages of growth foliar fertilizer is effective woolfolk et al 2002 dick et al 2016 but there is additional cost associated with the application basal fertilizer application is the most economic and easy to be implemented based on the soil moisture status at sowing in the present study we used plastic film with punched holes to cover entire plots during the summer fallow to further increase soil water storage and applied three n rates at sowing to evaluate the effects of n rate on the utilization of soil water storage grain yield and gpc we also determined soil water distribution in 0 300 cm depth to evaluate the effects of pm and n rate on soil water consumption in different wheat growth stages the experiments were conducted in three consecutive seasons our objectives were 1 to examine effects of pm in summer fallow on rainfall retention 2 to determine effects of the combination of pm and n rate on the consumption of the soil water storage in 0 300 cm depth during crop growing season and 3 to evaluate effects of the combination of pm and n rate on grain yield and gpc 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted at agriculture research station of shanxi agriculture university 34 35 n 110 15 e in wenxi shanxi province of china from july 2010 to june 2013 the experimental site locates in the eastern tableland of the loess plateau it is a typical semi arid area which has an altitude of 450 700 m an average annual air temperature of 11 13 c and annual precipitation of 343 656 mm 2003 2013 winter wheat is usually sown in early october and harvested in early june of the following year the land is left fallow in summer from july to september precipitation from july 2010 to june 2013 and ten year average from 2003 to 2013 are shown in fig 1 the yearly average in the last ten years 2003 2013 was 490 mm fig 1 based on the generalized precipitation classification dry year is defined as the year average precipitation is less than ten years average precipitation p 25 normal year is defined as the year average precipitation is basically equal to ten years average precipitation 25 p 25 wet year is defined as the year average precipitation is more than ten years average precipitation p 25 the annual precipitation in 2011 12 was 35 above the ten year average and therefore the 2011 12 season is referred to as the wet season fig 1 the annual precipitation of 553 mm in 2010 11 was much lower than that in 2011 12 and it was close to the ten year average fig 1 therefore the 2010 11 season is referred to as the normal season the annual precipitation in 2012 13 was 27 lower than the ten year average and the 2012 13 season is referred to as the dry season fig 1 the distribution of precipitation was uneven and approximately 70 precipitation occurred in the summer fallow fig 1 the experimental site was flat and bound with boundary there was no water runoff during the experiments all precipitation could be stored in 3 m depth and deep drainage does not occur generally below 3 m depth he et al 2016 soil type at the experimental site was classified as calcareous cinnamon soil sand 43 2 silt 32 5 and clay 10 5 using chinese soil taxonomy soil organic matter was determined with the modified walkley black method wang et al 2016 total nitrogen was measured by the kjeldahl method available p olsen p was measured by extraction with 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 followed by colorimetric measurement of p using the molybdate ascorbic acid method available k by extraction with 1 mol l 1 ammonium acetate and analyzed by a flame photometer and soil ph in water was determined with a 1 2 5 soil to water ratio basic soil properties are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the experiment used split plot design with three complete replications main plot treatments were plastic mulch pm with full coverage in the summer fallow and sub plot treatments were three rates of n fertilizer at sowing they were 75 150 and 225 n kg ha 1 respectively before plastic mulching organic matter fertilizer 1500 kg ha 1 was evenly spread in plots and then the organic matter fertilizer and remaining wheat stubble 20 30 cm were ploughed to 25 30 cm depth using a rotavator in the early to middle of july as deep ploughing described by sun et al 2018 the organic fertilizer contained approximately 45 organic matter 1 2 available n 1 available p 0 3 available k and more than 20 million g 1 effective counts of living bacteria after deep ploughing soil surface was tilled to be uniform and flat using the rotavator for pm entire plots were covered by water permeable plastic film 8 μm in thickness 100 cm in width with punched holes 1 0 cm in diameter 25 holes m 2 and no plastic film nm was used as the control fig 2 the plastic cover in pm was removed and ploughed to a depth of 10 15 cm in the end of august before sowing three rates of n fertilizer urea containing n 46 were applied with 150 p2o5 kg ha 1 as triple superphosphate 16 p2o5 and 75 k2o kg ha 1 as potassium chloride 50 k2o all fertilizers were spread uniformly and then tilled into the top 15 cm of soil plots 3 m 10 m were tilled to form the ridge furrow framework with five ridges and furrows fig 2 the ridges covered with transparent plastic film 8 μm in thickness with no punched holes fig 2 using film mulching seeder 2bx 12 hebeinonghaha china the winter wheat cultivar yunhan 20410 was sown on 29 september 2010 and 1 october in 2011 and 2012 and the seeding rate was 90 kg ha 1 the seeds were planted to the two sides of furrows the other crop management was the same as that used by local farmers the plastic film cover was removed in the middle to end of may plants were harvested on 5 june 2011 10june 2012 and 2june 2013 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture before plot preparation a 3 m deep profile pit was excavated and soil samples were taken from 0 to 300 cm depth in 20 cm increments using the cutting ring method described by dama et al 2005 soil bulk density and gravimetric soil moisture content gsw were measured for each soil layers gswwas determined and expressed as soil water storage mm gsw was measured in 20 cm increments to a depth of 300 cm at the beginning of plastic mulching and at the end of the summer fallow gsw was also determined at four developmental stages of plants in each plot four random soil samples were taken between plant rows for each soil sample gws was calculated as the ratio of the mass of water per mass dry soil dry weight of soil sample was obtained by placing fresh soil samples in an oven at 105 c for 72 h soil water storage for a given layer was calculated as follows sun et al 2018 w mm gsw ρb g cm 3 sd mm where ρb is dry soil bulk density of given soil layer and sd refers to soil depth water storage efficiency is equal to soil water content at the end of summer fallow minus soil water content at the beginning of summer fallow dividing by precipitation during summer fallow 100 2 3 2 ear number grain yield and water use efficiency wue at maturity plants of one m2from each plot were randomly sampled from the inner rows for the determination of ear number grain yield was obtained by harvesting all plants in the plot wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as grain yield kg ha 1 divided by evapotranspiration mm evapotranspiration was the sum of precipitation mm in the growing season and consumption of soil water storage mm in 0 300 cm depth from sowing to plant maturity 2 3 3 plant nitrogen and grain protein concentration twenty plants from each plot were collected randomly for the measurement of plant n concentration at flowering and maturity plant samples and grains were oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then at 75 c for 48 h for dry weight dry plant samples were cut to 4 5 cm length and ground using plant ball mill fz102 beijing china dry grains were also ground to powder using fz102 mill ground samples of 0 25 g were digested with h2so4 h2o2 and then total n concentration was determined using the standard indophenol blue colorimetric method meyer 1983 grain protein concentration gpc was estimated as grain n concentration multiplied by 5 7 post anthesis n uptake kg ha 1 total n accumulation of the aboveground plant at maturity total n accumulation of the aboveground plant at anthesis 2 4 statistical analysis the sas package sas institute inc north carolina usa was used for analysis of variance least significance difference lsd tests at p 0 05 were used for comparison of means 3 results 3 1 pm in summer fallow increased soil water storage at sowing the precipitation in summer fallow was the highest 460 mm in the wet season the middle 420 mm in the normal season and the lowest 188 mm in the dry season fig 1 the precipitation in summer fallow accounts for more than 75 of the yearly total in both wet and normal seasons and it also makes up 53 of the yearly total in the dry season the variable rainfall in summer fallow led to the difference of soil water storage in three growing seasons table 2 plastic mulch with punched holes pm in summer fallow fig 2 increased the soil water storage of 0 300 cm at sowing in all three seasons although the amount of soil water storage increased 50 62 mm by pm was similar in these three seasons water storage efficiency was much higher in the dry season 56 5 than in either wet 42 2 or normal season 43 3 table 2 3 2 pm and high n rates increase ear number and yield pm treatments significantly increased ear number relative to nm controls fig 3 a n225 with pm had the highest ear number 614 per m2 in the wet season which was 11 3 higher than that of nm fig 3a in the normal season n150 with pm had the highest ear number 535 per m2 and it was 12 5 higher than that of nm fig 3a n150 with pm had also the highest ear number 380 per m2 in the dry season and it was 22 4 higher than that of nm fig 3a a similar trend in the pm treatments was also observed for grain yield fig 3b n225 with pm increased grain yield by 27 relative to that of nm in the wet season 36 in the normal season and 41 in the dry season respectively fig 3b the multiple variance analysis showed that pm had the largest effect on ear number and the effect of n rate on ear number and yield was after that of year and the interaction of year n rate table 3 however the effect of the pm n rate interaction on ear number and yield was relatively small these results indicate that pm has a larger effect than n rates on ear number as well as yield as both ear number and yield was positively correlated the regression analysis was conducted between ear number and yield the results showed that the yield increase in pm treatments is highly significantly correlated with ear number in all three seasons p 0 008 suppl fig s1 these results indicate that the increase in grain yield by pm and the optimal n rate largely results from the enhanced ear number 3 3 pm and optimized n rates increase wue in normal and wet seasons pm treatments had the largest effect on wue and n rates had a minor effect on wue table 3 optimized n rates of in the pm treatment could slightly increase wue in both wet and normal seasons but not in the dry season fig 3c these results show that pm in combination with optimized n could improve wue only when annual rainfall is equal to or above the yearly average 3 4 high n rates increased grain protein concentration gpc but pm reduced gpc both pm and n rate affected gpc the increase in n rate significantly enhanced gpc regardless of mulch treatments in both wet and normal seasons whereas in the dry season the highest gpc was observed at n150 in both pm and nm fig 3d in contrast pm treatments significantly reduced gpc compared to the nm controls in both wet and normal seasons but pm treatments had no effect on gpc relative to nm in the dry season fig 3d gpc at n225 with pm was 0 84 lower than the nm control 14 08 in the wet season whereas in the normal season gpc at n225 with pm was 0 52 lower than the nm control 14 29 fig 3d the highest n rate n225 in the pm treatment could achieve the highest gpc in both wet and normal seasons whereas the middle n rate n150 was adequate for the highest gpc in the dry season the multiple variance analysis showed that year had the largest effect on gpc which was approximately 60 higher than that of n rate table 3 notably the effect of n rate on gpc was approximately four fold larger than that of pm table 3 however the effect of the pm n rate interaction on gpc was extremely small these results indicate that pm reduces gpc in both normal and wet seasons and n input plays a key role in the improvement of gpc in the rainfed dryland in all three seasons studied regression analysis showed that gpc was negatively correlated with et at all three n rates in either pm or nm suppl fig s2 the slopes decreased with an increase in n rate in both pm and nm suppl fig s2 a large reduction was observed at n225 relative to n150 in both pm and nm suppl fig s2 the difference in the slope at n225 was small between pm and nm suppl fig s2 these results indicate that the higher water consumption by plants leads to the lower gpc regardless of mulch treatments and the higher n input reduces the negative effect of total water consumption by plants on gpc 3 5 optimized n rates reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage but increase soil water consumption in the 200 300 cm soil layer at the reproductive stage the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth in all treatments slightly reduced 1 3 from winter dormancy to jointing in all three seasons and largely reduced 21 23 from winter dormancy to flowering suppl table s1 a further reduction at maturity was observed in both wet and normal seasons resulting in a total reduction of 31 38 but in the dry season the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth at maturity slightly higher than that at flowering suppl table s1 this is because higher rainfall occurred in the late may 2013 fig 1 spatio temporal dynamics in the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth varied with n rate developmental stage and season but it was generally similar in nm and pm except for pm having higher soil water storage than nm until flowering in all three seasons figs 4 6 in the wet season with nm the differential soil water storage in three n rates at jointing appeared in the soil layers between 80 cm and 220 cm fig 4a moved downwards to 120 220 cm when plants were flowering fig 4b and further moved downwards to 200 300 cm at maturity fig 4c the vertical movement of differential soil water storage with plant development was similar between pm and nm in the wet season fig 4d f in the normal season with either nm or pm the differential soil water storage in three n rates at jointing was evident in the soil layers between 60 and 180 cm fig 5a d slightly moved to 80 180 cm at flowering fig 5b e and sharply moved downwards to 220 300 cm at maturity fig 5c f in the dry season with either nm or pm the differential soil water storage in three n rates at jointing occurred in the soil layers of 20 160 cm fig 6a d moved downwards to 80 180 cm at flowering fig 6b e and sharply moved downwards to 220 300 cm at maturity fig 6c f to show whether the differences observed in the differential soil layers among three n rates were significant the amount of soil water storage in the differential soil layers was calculated and is shown in fig 7 at jointing soil water storage in the differential soil layers was significantly higher in pm than in nm across three seasons fig 7a the soil water storage in the 80 220 cm layers significantly increased with n rate in the wet season for both nm and pm and n225 in pm was 14 mm higher than n150 fig 7a when plants were flowering soil water storage in the differential soil layers was significantly higher in pm than in nm for both normal and dry seasons while no significant difference at n150 and n225 was observed between pm and nm in the wet season fig 7b notably n225 in the wet season had significantly lower soil water storage in the 120 220 cm layers than n150 and the soil water storage at n225 was approximately 14 mm less than that at n150 fig 7b in both normal and dry seasons n150 in both nm and pm had significantly lower soil water storage in the 80 180 cm soil layers than either n225 or n75 at flowering fig 7b at maturity the soil water storage in the 200 300 cm layers in the wet season was 19 mm less at n225 than at n150 fig 7c in the normal season the differential soil water storage in the 220 300 cm layers remained lower at n150 than at either n225 or n75 fig 7c in the dry season the differential soil water storage in the 220 300 cm layers remained significantly lower at n150 with pm than at either n225 or n75 while there was no difference in nm between n150 and n225 fig 7c these results show that the optimal n rate could reduce soil water storage up to the jointing stage leading to more soil water available for plant later growth stages and the plants treated with the optimal n rate also consume more soil water from flowering to maturity the results reveal that in all three seasons differential soil water storage moved from above 80 200 cm at flowering down to the 200 300 cm depth at maturing indicating the importance of soil water storage in the deep soil layers for high yield production in addition the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm at maturity was similar between pm and nm treatments in both wet and normal seasons whereas the overall soil water storage of 0 300 cm at maturity was higher in the pm treatments than in the nm treatments for dry season suppl table s1 these results indicate that the higher yield with pm does not reduce the overall soil water storage in the end of crop season 3 6 water consumption from the deep soil layer is correlated with post anthesis n uptake and yield in all three seasons the consumption of soil water in the 200 300 cm layers at n225 with pm in the wet season was 65 8 mm accounting for 56 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth while n150 with pm in the normal season was 35 4 mm accounting for 44 of the total consumption in the 0 300 cm depth fig 8 in the dry season n150 with pm consumed 21 9 mm water from the 200 300 cm soil layers despite of the higher precipitation during the late may fig 1 resulting in the negative values of soil water consumption in 0 200 cm fig 8 in comparison to the normal season water consumption at n150 in the dry season was found to be 38 lower fig 8 these results show that a substantial proportion of water consumption is derived from the deep soil during grain filling in all three seasons implying that the water consumption from the deep soil could be vital for post anthesis n uptake and grain yield the regression analysis showed that post anthesis n uptake is linearly correlated with yield fig 9 a the post anthesis n uptake in both nm and pm treatments increased with n rate in the wet season all three n rates in pm had significantly higher post anthesis n uptake than those in the nm controls fig 9b the post anthesis n uptake at n225 with pm was the highest in all n treatments fig 9b in the normal and dry season the highest level of post anthesis n uptake was found at n150 with pm fig 9b interestingly the soil water consumption of the 200 300 cm layer from flowering to maturity highly significantly correlates with the post anthesis n uptake in all three seasons p 0 006 suppl fig s3 these results suggest that the soil water consumption in the deeper soil play an important role in the post anthesis n uptake 4 discussion 4 1 plastic mulch in summer fallow increases soil water storage at sowing and n inputs optimize the utilization of soil water storage in the semiarid and rain fed farming area of the losses plateau the increase in soil water storage during summer fallow is critical for winter wheat production as approximately 60 of annual precipitation occurs in the summer plastic mulch in the ridge furrow framework has been widely used to reduce water evaporation from soil surface during the crop growing season chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and it has been extended to the summer fallow period for increasing soil water storage he et al 2016 plastic mulch in the ridge furrow framework either during the crop growing season or in the summer fallow or both could increase soil water storage leading to higher wheat yield chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 he et al 2016 in addition deep ploughing in the early summer fallow could increase the capacity of soil water storage and consequently enhance soil water storage of 69 mm on average during summer fallow relative to no tillage sun et al 2018 in the present study soil surface in pm was fully covered by plastic film with punched holes during the summer fallow our results showed that pm could increase the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth in the summer fallow in all three seasons by 11 63 on average relative to nm table 2 in contrast three out of six seasons shows that the ridge covered with pm in the summer fallow increases soil water recharge in the 0 300 cm depth he et al 2016 therefore the full coverage by pm with punched holes during the summer fallow has its advantage in soil water storage over the ridge covered by pm furthermore pm had a higher efficiency of soil water storage in the dry season than that in the normal or wet season table 2 suggesting that pm is more effective in the season with a lower rainfall in the summer fallow in the pm treatment the overall soil water storage in the 0 300 cm depth at flowering remained higher than that in the nm treatment in all three seasons table 3 importantly pm had also a higher level of soil water storage at flowering in the deep soil layers 200 300 cm in all three seasons fig 6 these results indicate that pm could provide more soil water for crop growth especially in flowering and grain filling the higher level of available water in soil could meet crop demand for the higher yield formation importantly the higher yield production with pm does not reduce the overall soil water storage in the end of crop season suppl table s1 furthermore the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage during the crop growing season figs 3 5 revealed that soil water reduction in both nm and pm started from shallow soil layers gradually moved downwards to the middle soil layers and ended at the deep soil layers of 200 300 cm figs 3 5 the pattern of soil water change was similar to that with on deep tillage in summer fallow sun et al 2018 this illustrates the importance of soil water storage in the deep soil layer for high crop yield the spatio temporal dynamics of soil water storage also revealed that n rates had a significant impact on the utilization of soil water storage increased by pm the deferential consumption of soil water in three n rates took place in different soil depths at the different growth stages the high n rate n255 in the wet season and the middle level of n fertilizer n150 in both normal and dry seasons used less soil water storage up to the jointing stage in differential soil layers but more soil water storage was depleted from flowering to maturity figs 3 5 the optimized n input could reduce water consumption at the early to middle stage of plant development and therefore could provide more soil water for the consumption during grain filling leading to higher grain yield fig 3b it has been shown that roots in the deep soil play an important role in the uptake of soil water after flowering in wheat li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 root growth increases in depth with plant developmental progression and follow water availability in soil feng et al 2017 xu et al 2016 which implies that the deferential soil water storage observed in soil layers among three n rates is a result of the water uptake activity of roots the higher grain yield in the pm treatment with the optimized n input achieved higher wue in all three seasons fig 3b c as the grain yield is largely determined by et the increased soil water storage in pm plays a key roleinthe higher grain yield production therefore leading to the higher wue 4 2 optimal n inputs for high grain yield and gpc vary with summer rainfall the optimized n input could maximize the utilization of soil water storage not only for higher grain yield but also higher gpc in the wet season the grain yield in pm with the high n rate n255 was 6 41 ton ha 1 which was26 7 higher than that of n150 fig 3b in the normal season the grain yield in pm with the middle n rate n150 reached 5 78 ton ha 1 which was 14 2 higher than that of n75 fig 3b in the dry season the grain yield in pm with n150 was 3 40 ton ha 1 which was 41 0 higher than that with nm fig 3b our results show that pm in the summer fallow could largely increase grain yield 28 3 on average in all three seasons as every 100 mm increased in rainfall results approximately 3 decrease in yield increase it means that the effects of pm on yield are more effective in the lower rainfall seasons similar results were also reported by qin et al 2015 this highlights the importance of the rainfall storage during summer fallow for higher yield in the semiarid and rainfed agricultural area of the losses plateau however the increased yield with pm led to the gpc reduction in both wet and normal seasons gpc with pm at n225 in the wet season was 5 9 lower than that with nm at n225 while gpc with pm at n150 in the normal season was 3 9 lower than that with nm at n150 fig 3d interestingly no gpc reduction at n150 was observed between pm and nm in the dry season fig 3d this could be due to the much lower grain yield in the dry season relative to in the normal or wet season fig 3b the negative correlation between grain yield and gpc has been reported in the various conditions including plastic mulch triboi et al 2006 arduini et al 2006 zheng et al 2009 luo et al 2018 dilution effect plays a predominant role apart from the dilution effect the lower post anthesis n uptake could also have an impact on gpc because n remobilization from vegetative organs plays little role in gpc bogard et al 2010 althoughthe soil water consumption from 200 to 300 cm depth is positively correlated with post anthesis n uptake suppl fig s3 et is negatively correlated with gpc at any of the three n rates suppl fig s2 this indicates that additional n application is required to further increase gpc the application could be done by either basal n fertilizer at sowing lin et al 2015 or foliar n fertilizer at jointing stage dick et al 2016 4 3 matching n input with summer rainfall for high winter wheat yield and gpc to obtain high grain yield and gpc required n inputs need to be adjusted based on pre sowing soil water storage in the season with pre sowing soil water storage 550 600 mm n225 could be applied for the highest yield with 13 14 of gpc in the season with pre sowing soil water storage 450 550 mm n150 could be applied to achieve the highest yield and 14 15 of gpc when pre sowing soil water storage is approximately 400 mm n75 could be applied to achieve the highest yield and 14 of gpc our recommendations could be used as a guideline for wheat production in the southeast region of the loess plateau if the higher gpc is required such as in the wet season the agronomic or genetic approach is required to improve higher post anthesis n uptake the application of basal n and foliar n late in the season is effective in increasing gpc woolfolk et al 2002 dick et al 2016 growing cultivars with high gpc could also be used for higher gpc liu et al 2016 further studies on high gpc cultivars applied with reduced n inputs are warranted for high grain yield and gpc 5 conclusion the increase of soil water storage in the summer fallow through the full coverage of soil surface with pm consisting of punched holes could provide additional rainwater for winter wheat growth in the southeast region of the loess plateau the optimized n inputs could reduce soil water consumption before the jointing stage and lead to more soil water available for grain yield production spatio temporal dynamics in the soil water storage of 0 300 cm depth exhibited a downward movement with the crop development progression the soil water storage in the 200 300 cm soil depth plays an important role in grain filling and post anthesis n uptake n inputs need to be adjusted based on the pre sowing soil water storage for high grain yield and gpc acknowledgements the authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for valuable input this
